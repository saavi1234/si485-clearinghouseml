Cuccinelli II, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, United States Citizenship & Immigration Services, Kevin K. McAleenan, Ken Cuccinelli, United States of America, United States Department of Homeland Security USCA Case Number 20-2537. In appealing from a preliminary injunction granted to the plaintiffs by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Daniels, J.), the defendant Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") moves to stay the preliminary injunction pending resolution of this appeal. We conclude that the moving party has demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits as we doubt that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction while this Court was considering an appeal from a prior, virtually identical preliminary injunction. Accordingly, we stay the preliminary injunction pending further order of this Court by the panel charged with deciding its merits. Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk USCA for the Second Circuit.

All expert discovery shall be completed by July 16, 2021. Initial disclosures must be exchanged by November 6, 2020. If Defendants intend to oppose the production of initial disclosures, they may file a brief on the issue by close of business on October 26, 2020. Plaintiffs' reply, if any, is due by November 2, 2020. The parties are required to follow the Court's Individual Practices when seeking Court intervention on discovery disputes. See http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Wang. A joint letter informing the Court of the status of discovery shall be filed by December 2, 2020 and every 60 days thereafter. The letter should address any outstanding discovery disputes and the efforts made by the parties to resolve these issues without Court intervention. It should also indicate whether the parties wish to schedule a settlement conference and, if so, include proposed dates on at least two consecutive weeks. The parties are, however, encouraged to contact the Court earlier if they believe a settlement conference sooner would be productive. The parties request a bench trial.

The privilege log need not be publicly filed. The Court does not find this request unduly burdensome as Exhibit 1 contains 208 entries. Defendant shall supplement their privilege descriptions. Defendants shall identify which individuals listed in the privilege log are attorneys. The Court does not find this request unduly burdensome. A ruling on this issue is premature. Neither Plaintiffs nor the Court can assess the applicability of the deliberative process privilege in a vacuum. The Court will address the applicability of the privilege if/when, after a robust meet and confer between the parties, there are particular documents where the applicability of the privilege is contested. Parties shall follow my Individual Practices for raising such disputes in the future. Plaintiffs' request for the Court to set a deadline for Defendants to produce a final privilege log is denied without prejudice for renewal.

    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. District court judges from across the countries granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule but after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On August 21, 2019, the states of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont, along with the city of New York, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Plaintiff States sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), as well as the acting secretaries of both departments in their official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Plaintiff States sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s final public charge rule (the Rule) vacated due to violations of the APA and unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The Plaintiff States also sought to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Rule from being enforced.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a revised, final public charge rule, which defined personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increased the types of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is &ldquo;inadmissible.&rdquo; Thus, under the proposed Rule, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid, or is deemed likely to receive them in the future, may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. The Plaintiff States asserted that this Rule would force immigrant families to choose between using these benefits or risk failing to gain permanent resident status.</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiff States further argued that the Rule causes damage to the health and livelihood of immigrant families by deterring them from using these benefits, thereby undermining the sovereign interests of the Plaintiff States and interfering in the policies designed to support the well-being and civil rights of residents. The Plaintiff States contended that the Rule exceeds the Defendant's jurisdiction and authority under the APA; is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion; and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, 2019, the Plaintiff States filed a motion for preliminary injunction and stay pending judicial review, arguing they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief, that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims made in the complaint, and that preliminary relief is in the public interest. The Rule, unless prohibited, was set to go into effect on October 15, 2019. The Plaintiff States asserted that the Rule should not take effect while the legal action was still pending.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2019, the Defendants filed an opposition to the motion. The Defendants contended that the Rule is a \"well-reasoned definition of public charge providing practical guidance to Executive Branch officials making public charge inadmissibility determinations\" based on foundational principles of United States immigration law. The Defendants also argued that the Plaintiff States and City did not meet their burden of establishing standing, that they did not show an actual or imminent threat of harm as the result of the Rule. Although the Plaintiff States claimed that enforcement of the Rule would cause irreparable harm, the Defendants argued that those claims are not enough to establish standing. The Defendants further argued that the Motion should be dismissed because the Plaintiff States' substantive claims lack merit and because the Plaintiff States are outside the zone of interests regulated by the APA.</p>\r\n<p>On October 11, 2019, Judge George Daniels granted the motion for preliminary injunction. First, Judge Daniels found that the Plaintiff States had standing, that their claims were ripe for judicial review, and that they were within the zone of interests regulated by the APA. Then, after analyzing the long-standing definition of the term public charge and whether Congress intended to redefine public charge, Judge Daniels found that the Plaintiff States sufficiently alleged that the Rule exceeds statutory authority and is contrary to law. Judge Daniels also ruled that the Plaintiff States sufficiently demonstrated that the rule is arbitrary and capricious. Judge Daniels found that the Plaintiff States and \"law-abiding citizens who have come to this country to seek a better life\" will suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. Finally, Judge Daniels ordered that the injunction be applied nationwide, in order to unify national immigration policy and in consideration of nearly two dozen other jurisdictions that have had suits brought challenging the Rule. 408 F.Supp.3d 334.</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2019, the Defendants filed an appeal of the order granting preliminary injunction; the Defendants also sought to stay the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On December 2, 2019, Judge Daniels denied the Defendants' motion to stay. Judge Daniels reasoned that \"to stay the injunction would be inconsistent with this Court's underlying findings of Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on the merits, and of the irreparable injury that Plaintiffs, noncitizens, and the general public would suffer in the absence of an effective injunction.\" 2019 WL 6498250.</p>\r\n<p>On January 8, 2020, while the Defendants' appeal was pending, the Second Circuit denied the Defendants' motion for stay pending appeal of the nationwide preliminary injunction. 2020 WL 95815.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2020, the Defendants submitted to Justice Ginsburg of the Supreme Court an application for stay of the preliminary injunction while the appeal is pending in the Second Circuit. Justice Ginsburg referred the application to the Supreme Court on January 27, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the Defendants' application for stay and thus stayed the District Court&rsquo;s October 11, 2019 orders granting a nationwide preliminary injunction. In granting the Defendants' application, Justice Gorsuch, writing the opinion for the court, addressed the many suits, injunctions, and stays regarding the Rule occurring across the country and concluded that the \"routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions.\" These nationwide injunctions, Justice Gorsuch reasoned, shared a similar flaw in that \"they direct how the defendant must act toward persons who are not parties to the case.\" Justice Gorsuch also found that these nationwide injunctions encouraged gamesmanship and forum shopping, that if a single district court issued a nationwide injunction, \"the government&rsquo;s hope of implementing any new policy could face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-to-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the courts of appeal.\" Thus, in granting the Defendants' application for stay and staying the district court's nationwide preliminary injunction, the Supreme Court found the occasion to address its concerns with the proliferation of nationwide injunctions. 140 S.Ct. 599. After the Supreme Court ruling, the Defendants stated that the rule would take effect on February 24, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Following the Supreme Court's stay of the preliminary injunction and a Ninth Circuit opinion \"concluding that the Rule falls well within the Executive Branch&rsquo;s discretion to interpret and implement the public charge inadmissibility provision in the INA,\" the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on February 14, 2020. The Plaintiffs argued that the Defendants were taking \"a third bite at the apple\" and that because Defendants offered \"no new substantive arguments, and this Court has already evaluated and rejected Defendants&rsquo; contentions under the more stringent standards governing entry of a preliminary injunction,\" the motion to dismiss should be denied.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate this case with <em><a href=\"../../../../case/43111/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Make the Road New York, et al. v. Kenneth Cuccinelli, et al.</a>&nbsp;</em>and <em><a href=\"../../../../case/17287/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of New York v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Security</a></em>. The parties argued that the cases met the standard for consolidation as they share many common questions of fact and law and also assert the same constitutional violation and cause of action.</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2020, the Plaintiff-States sent a letter to the Defendants urging them \"to immediately stop implementation of [the Rule] ... in the wake of the COVID-19 coronavirus.\" The Plaintiff states asserted that, in the context of a nationwide outbreak of COVID-19, \"DHS&rsquo;s policy of deterring immigrants from using the medical benefits to which they are legally entitled directly undermines and frustrates our public health professionals&rsquo; efforts, putting our communities and residents at unnecessary risk.\"</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 2020, the Plaintiff States filed a motion in the Supreme Court to temporarily lift or modify the Court's stay of the district court's October 11, 2019 and December 6, 2019 orders. The Plaintiffs' asserted that, while state and local authorities had taken \"extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and well-being of ... residents,\" the Rule undermined those efforts by \"deterring immigrants from accessing healthcare and public benefits that are essential tools for protecting the public at large . . . .\" The Supreme Court denied the motion to temporarily lift or modify the stay on April 24, 2020, but ruled that &ldquo;[t]his order does not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel considers appropriate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, the Plaintiffs filed a second motion for a preliminary injunction and stay or a temporary restraining order on April 28, 2020. The Plaintiffs argued that immigrants would be deterred from seeking public health benefits out of fear of violating the public charge rule, which would exacerbate the national health crisis. These changed facts, the plaintiffs believed, provided the district court the authority to issue an injunction despite the Supreme Court's previous stay.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2020, the district court granted the Defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claim that DHS and USCIS lacked the authority to promulgate the Rule, but granted the Plaintiffs&rsquo; second motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the Defendants from implementing the Rule at any point during the COVID-19 outbreak. 2020 WL 4347264. The Defendants appealed the court&rsquo;s preliminary injunction order to the Second Circuit on August 3, 2020. On August 12, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed the injunction with respect to all states but the Plaintiff States (Connecticut, New York, and Vermont) until the Second Circuit ruled on the motion to stay. The Second Circuit then stayed the second preliminary injunction altogether on September 11, 2020 while the Second Circuit considered the Defendants&rsquo; appeal of the district court&rsquo;s first preliminary injunction order. 974 F.3d 210.</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 2, 2020 alleging that DHS and USCIS violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) and the Homeland Security Act (HSA) by implementing the Rule because the Rule was promulgated by an Acting DHS Secretary who was unlawfully serving in his position. As a result, the Plaintiffs argued, DHS&rsquo;s and USCIS&rsquo;s implementation of the Rule exceeded the departments&rsquo; statutory authority under FVRA and was not in accordance with the law under the APA.</p>\r\n<p>On October 7, 2020, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s initial preliminary injunction orders, finding that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Rule is contrary to the INA and arbitrary and capricious. 969 F.3d 42. The Defendants petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court, which was granted on February 22, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Following their Second Circuit win, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in district court on October 27, 2020, arguing that the Rule was null and void because the Acting DHS Secretary promulgated it while serving in violation of the FVRA and HSA. In response, on November 17, 2020, the Defendants moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claims that the Rule was invalid because it was issued by an unlawfully serving Acting DHS Secretary, insisting that the Rule was promulgated pursuant to the APA and ratified by lawful agency officials, including the Acting DHS Secretary.</p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2021, the new Biden administration issued an Executive Order calling for the new Secretary of Homeland Security to review the agency's actions around the public charge rule. As a result of this order, the District Court granted a stay of the proceedings for up to 90 days, on the condition that the agency not take any action to implement or enforce the rule during the period of the stay. However, on February 22, 2021, the defendants reported to the court that no agreement had been reached to stop agency action during the stay, so its conditions were not met.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2021, the defendants informed the court that the Biden Administration had decided to stop defending the public charge rule change, no longer pursue appellate review of District Court stays of the rule, and return to the previously-used guidance on the public charge rule. As a result, the case was stayed on March 11, 2021. After a joint request from the plaintiffs and the Biden Administration, the Clerk of the Supreme Court also agreed to dismiss the case from its docket before hearing the argument.</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and the defendants' partial motion to dismiss on September 30, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The case was stayed until March, 2022. During this time, the Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit considered motions to intervene from states seeking to defend the rule. Then, on March 3, 2023, the plaintiffs gave notice of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) without prejudice against the defendants. According to <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/03/cases-testing-trumps-public-charge-immigration-rule-are-dismissed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SCOTUS blog</a>, this dismissal was at the request of the Biden administration.&nbsp; The court approved the voluntary dismissal on March 6, 2023. The case is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In August of 2019, three states and the City of New York filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Department of Homeland Security's Public Charge Rule, enacted in August of 2019, expanded the number of programs that the federal government would consider when making public charge determinations to include health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Plaintiffs alleged that the Public Charge Rule would result in harm to the Plaintiff States and its residents by deterring legal residents from enrolling in basic benefit programs out of fear of being determined a \"public charge\" and rendered inadmissible for citizenship. District Court Judge George Daniels granted the Plaintiff States' Motion to Stay Pending Judicial Review and Preliminary Injunction, resulting in the Rule not being implemented as planned. In January 2020, the Supreme Court issued an order staying the district court's nationwide preliminary injunction, and Defendants accordingly implemented the Rule in February 2020. In April 2020, the Supreme Court denied the Plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay of the January 2020 order in light of the ongoing COVID-19 national emergency. The Plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the district court, asserting that the Rule is hindering efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and causing irreparable harm to citizens and non-citizens. On July 29, 2020, the district court granted the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claim that DHS and USCIS lacked the authority to promulgate the Rule, but granted the Plaintiffs’ second motion for a preliminary injunction. The court then enjoined the Defendants from implementing the Rule at any point during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Defendants appealed to the Second Circuit, which stayed the second preliminary injunction order until it ruled on the first. In the meantime, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 2, 2020 alleging that DHS and USCIS violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA) and the Homeland Security Act (HSA) by implementing the Rule because the Rule was promulgated by an Acting DHS Secretary who was unlawfully serving in his position. On October 7, 2020, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s preliminary injunction orders, finding that the Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. The Defendants petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. The Court granted certiorari on February 22, 2021, but dismissed the case without hearing argument on March 9, 2021, after a joint request to do so from the new Biden Administration and the plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in district court on October 27, 2020, arguing that the Rule was null and void because the Acting DHS Secretary promulgated it while serving in violation of the FVRA and HSA. The Defendants opposed the Plaintiffs' motion and moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims that the rule was promulgated improperly. The court denied both motions on September 30, 2021. The case was stayed until March 2022, then voluntarily dismissed in March 2022 as a result of the change in power to the Biden administration.",

The \npreliminary injunction defendants challenge merely preserves the status quo. It does so by \nrequiring defendants to continue using the same test to determine whether noncitizens are \ninadmissible as “likely at any time to become a public charge” that has been in place for more \nthan twenty years—a test that defendants concede is consistent with the governing statute. \nDefendants point to no urgent need to change that standard immediately and identify no concrete \nharm if they are delayed in implementing their preferred policy. On the other side of the scale, as \nthe district court found, allowing defendants to implement the radical changes they propose \nwould cause irreparable injury to plaintiffs and grave, widespread harm to immigrants, their \nfamilies, and the public health. Four courts of appeals, including the Second Circuit, are already \naddressing the issues presented by this application, all on an expedited basis. Those appeals will \nbe fully briefed in a matter of weeks. It is premature to presume that this Court will grant \ncertiorari before any appellate court has ruled on the merits. In these circumstances, defendants \ndo not carry their “especially heavy burden,” Edwards v. Hope Med. Grp. for Women, 512 U.S. \n1301, 1302 (1994) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (quotations marks omitted), to justify a stay by this \nCourt. \nPlaintiffs challenge a rule promulgated by the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”), 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (the “Rule”), that seeks to impose drastic \nrestrictions on the ability of low-income noncitizens (primarily persons already living in this \ncountry with their families) to achieve lawful permanent residence. Under Section 212(a)(4) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), noncitizens are deemed \ninadmissible or ineligible for status adjustment if, in the government’s opinion, they are “likely \n \n \n\n \nat any time to become a public charge.” For a noncitizen living in the United States as a \nnonimmigrant, a finding of inadmissibility precludes adjustment of status to lawful permanent \nresident. In many cases, denial of status adjustment can also subject noncitizens to removal and \nseparation from their families.  \nThe Rule purports to redefine the statutory term “public charge” to include any \nnoncitizens the government deems likely, for an aggregate of twelve months over three years at \nany time in the future, to receive cash or certain supplemental noncash public benefits, including \nMedicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits (“SNAP,” formerly food \nstamps), or certain forms of housing assistance even in small amounts—irrespective of their \nability to work and care for themselves, and regardless of whether they have received public \nbenefits in the past. As one court noted, “[t]o take a plausible example, someone receiving $182 \nover 36 months . . . in SNAP benefits is a public charge under the Rule.” City & Cty. of S.F. v. \nUSCIS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1099 (N.D. Cal. 2019).  \nDefendants cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs’ challenge. \nThe Rule is contrary to Congressional intent, and represents a fundamental break from more than \n138 years of judicial and administrative understanding of the meaning of the statutory term \n“public charge.” In that time, administrative agencies and courts, including this Court, have \nconsistently interpreted it to apply only to noncitizens who are unable to care for themselves, and \nare therefore likely to be primarily or exclusively reliant on public support for subsistence. \nConsistent with this narrow understanding, since the turn of the twentieth century, the percentage \nof immigrants denied admission or lawful permanent residence on public charge ground has \nconsistently been a fraction of one percent. Congress has consistently approved this \nunderstanding by repeatedly reenacting the provision without relevant change and without \n2 \n \n\n \nredefining the term “public charge,” most recently in 1996. Congress has also repeatedly turned \nback legislative efforts to define the term as the Rule now seeks to do. \nThe Rule departs from this settled and Congressionally approved understanding. \nPlaintiffs are not aware of a single judicial or administrative case in the 138 years since the \nstatute was enacted in which noncitizens were deemed likely to be a public charges based solely \non their projected future eligibility for public benefits, without regard to their ability to work or \nto support themselves. In contrast to the historical exclusion rate of less than one percent, “the \nproposed redefinition [of ‘public charge’] would mean that most native-born, working-class \nAmericans are or have been public charges.” Center for American Progress Comment, D. Ct. \nDkt. 50-29, at 15. Defendants have offered no evidence that Congress ever intended to permit \nthat extraordinary result. \nThe district court properly found, based on largely uncontradicted evidence, that the Rule \nwill cause enormous harm to plaintiffs, immigrants, their families (including citizen children), \nand the Nation. As the district court concluded, the Rule would “expose individuals to economic \ninsecurity, health instability, denial of their path to citizenship, and potential deportation.” App. \n46a. This harm is not limited to noncitizens who are covered by the Rule. By DHS’s own \nestimates, the Rule will cause hundreds of thousands of individuals and households, in many \ncases noncitizens not even subject to public charge scrutiny, to forego public benefits for which \nthey are eligible, out of fear and confusion about the consequences for their immigration status of \naccepting such benefits. See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,269 & \nTable 53 (Oct. 10, 2018). As a result, DHS projected that the Rule would lead to adverse health \noutcomes including increased malnutrition (especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women, \ninfants, or children) and increased prevalence of communicable diseases, increased poverty and \n3 \n \n\n \nhousing instability, reduced productivity, and other “unanticipated consequences.” See id. at \n51,270. The stay that defendants seek would exacerbate this harm by creating even more \nconfusion and uncertainty. \nFinally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the Rule nationwide. \nThe injunction is consistent with Congress’s directive in the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”) that the courts “set aside” unlawful agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 706, and its grant of \nauthority to the courts to “postpone the effective date” of such action, id. § 705. The district court \nfound that a nationwide injunction was necessary to provide complete preliminary relief to \nplaintiffs, including plaintiff Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (“CLINIC”) which \nsupports affiliates in 49 states and the District of Columbia. The courts of appeals should be \nallowed, after full briefing and argument and review of the evidentiary record, to address the \nscope of any injunction in the first instance. That the lower courts have come to different \nconclusions as to whether to stay preliminary injunctions pending those appeals does not subject \ndefendants to inconsistent directives, or otherwise create a need for this Court to intervene before \nthe courts of appeals address the merits.  \nThe Court should decline defendants’ invitation to intervene at this stage, and allow the \nnormal appellate process to proceed. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nI.  THE HISTORY OF “PUBLIC CHARGE” \nSince the term “public charge” first became part of U.S. immigration law as part of the \nImmigration Act of 1882, it has been interpreted and applied narrowly by courts and agencies to \nrefer only to a small number of noncitizens who are unable to care for themselves, and \naccordingly are likely to be institutionalized or otherwise primarily dependent on the government \nfor subsistence. Congress has repeatedly approved that interpretation, most recently in 1996. It \n4 \n \n\n \nhas never authorized the Executive to redefine “public charge”—as the Rule now seeks to do—to \nrefer to anyone expected to receive benefits used by millions of working Americans. On the \ncontrary, it has expressly rejected legislative efforts to achieve that result. \nA.  The Original Meaning of “Public Charge” Referred to Narrow Classes of \nPersons Unable to Care for Themselves \nThe term “public charge” first appeared in federal immigration law in the Immigration \nAct of 1882, 47th Cong. ch. 376, 22 Stat. 214, § 2, which provided that “any person unable to \ntake care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge” could be denied admission to \nthe United States. Later enactments adopted the current phrasing: “likely to become a public \ncharge.” E.g., 1891 Immigration Act, 51st Cong. ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084 § 1. Under current law, \nthe statute applies both to noncitizens seeking admission and to those already residing in the \nUnited States and seeking to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1255(a). \nAs the Ninth Circuit acknowledged in granting defendants’ motion to stay the injunctions \nissued from district courts within that circuit, “[t]he 1882 act did not consider an alien a ‘public \ncharge’ if the alien received merely some form of public assistance.” City & Cty. of S.F. v. \nUSCIS, 944 F.3d 773, 793 (9th Cir. 2019). In enacting the 1882 Act, Congress intended “public \ncharge” to refer to those likely to become long-term residents of “poor-houses and alms-\nhouses”—i.e., persons who were institutionalized and wholly dependent on the government for \nsubsistence. 13 Cong. Rec. 5109 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep. Davis). The Act expressly \nrecognized that a need for short-term public assistance did not render a person a public charge. \nThus, the Act established an “immigrant fund” to provide assistance for immigrants who, while \nnot excludible as likely public charges, might require temporary “care” and “relief” for new \n5 \n \n\n \nimmigrants “until they can proceed to other places or obtain occupation for their support.” 22 \nStat. 214, § 1; 13 Cong. 5106 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep. Reagan).  \nConsistent with Congress’s intent that a temporary need for public assistance would not \nrender an immigrant a public charge, this Court, in its only decision construing the public charge \nprovision, held that the provision was intended only to exclude immigrants “on the ground of \npermanent personal objections accompanying them,” rather than those needing temporary \nassistance or who might be unable to find work. Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915). Other \ndecisions from the same period likewise found the provision to apply only to “persons who were \nlikely to become occupants of almshouses for want of means with which to support themselves \nin the future.” Howe v. United States ex rel. Savitsky, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917). \nB.  Administrative Decisions for Nearly a Century Affirm That Mere Receipt of \nPublic Benefits Does Not Render the Recipient a Public Charge \nThe original scope of “public charge” as referring solely to persons unable to care for \nthemselves remained in place throughout the twentieth century. In the leading administrative \ncase of Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323, 324 (B.I.A. 1948), the Board of Immigration Appeals \n(“BIA”) held that “acceptance by an alien of services provided by a State . . . to its residents . . . \ndoes not in and of itself make the alien a public charge [for removal purposes].” The holding in \nMatter of B- has been the law for more than 70 years. See, e.g., Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. \n& N. Dec. 409, 421 (B.I.A. 1962; A.G. 1964) (explaining that, to exclude a noncitizen as likely \nto become a public charge, “the [INA] requires more than a showing of a possibility that the \nalien will require public support”); Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (B.I.A. 1974) \n(“The fact that an alien has been on welfare does not, by itself, establish that he or she is likely to \n6 \n \n\n \nbecome a public charge.”).1 Defendants have acknowledged that these and other administrative \ndecisions “clarified that . . . receipt of welfare would not, alone, lead to a finding of likelihood of \nbecoming a public charge.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,125.2 \nAdministrative decisions over decades have uniformly focused on the noncitizen’s ability \nto care for herself, including through employability or assistance from family, not on the mere \nreceipt of public benefits. To take just a few examples: \n• Matter of T-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 641 (B.I.A. 1949): Petitioner and son not excluded on public \ncharge grounds because petitioner was “quite capable of earning her own livelihood \nindependent of her husband” and the son was trained in tailoring. \n• Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. 409 (B.I.A. 1962; A.G. 1964): Petitioner not \nlikely to become a public charge, despite his falsifying an offer of employment, complete \n                                                 \n1  Defendants’ assertion that Matter of B- held that a noncitizen could be deemed a public \ncharge merely because she received benefits consisting of “clothing, transportation, and other \nincidental benefits” and those benefits were not repaid on demand, App. 25 & n.4, is \nunsupported by the decision. The opinion says nothing about whether receipt of such \ntemporary benefits would be sufficient to trigger a public charge finding. Nor was that issue \npresented, because the respondent in that case was a long-term resident of a state mental \ninstitution. Defendants have pointed to no administrative decision in the seventy years since \nMatter of B- was decided in which receipt of such “incidental” benefits, alone, was held \nsufficient to render a person a public charge. On the contrary, as late as 1996, Senator Alan \nSimpson unsuccessfully proposed a measure to redefine “public charge” by statute so as to \n“override” Matter of B-, which he argued had rendered the public charge provision “virtually \nunenforced and unenforceable.” 142 Cong. Rec. S4401, S4408–09 (1996).  Congress’s \nrejection of this proposal is discussed further below. See infra pp. 11–12. \n2  Defendants cite the 1933 and 1951 editions of Black’s Law Dictionary, App. 24, and a 1929 \nimmigration treatise, App. 25 (quoting Arthur Cook et al., Immigration Laws of the United \nStates § 285 (1929)), in support of the claim that receipt of “any” amount of public benefits \nhistorically rendered the recipient a public charge. But all three of these sources rely for this \npurpose on a single case, Ex Parte Kichmiriantz, 283 F. 697 (N.D. Cal. 1922), and that case \ndoes not support defendants’ position. The court in Kichmiriantz held that the respondent was \nnot a public charge despite having been “committed to the Stockton State Hospital for the \ninsane” within five years of admission, and was (according to testimony from an examining \nphysician) “unable to care for himself in any way.” Id. at 697–98. The court ultimately found \nhim not to be a public charge because his family covered the cost of his “care and \nmaintenance.” Id. at 698. Far from supporting the notion that the receipt of “any” amount of \npublic benefits renders a person a public charge, Kichmiriantz reflects the consistent \nhistorical focus of the term on those wholly unable to care for themselves. Id. at 697.  \n7 \n \n\n \nlack of English fluency, and only $50 in assets, when he was young, had work experience \nin the United States, and had family in United States that was willing to assist him. \n• Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583 (1974): Petitioner likely to become a public \ncharge because she was 70, “incapable of earning a livelihood,” “had no one responsible \nfor her support,” and expected to be dependent on old-age cash assistance. \n• Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136 (B.I.A. 1974): Petitioner not likely to become a \npublic charge despite past receipt of welfare because having been “on welfare does not, \nby itself, establish that he or she is likely to become a public charge” and she was 28, \nhealthy, capable of finding employment, and supported by family. \n• Matter of Vindman, 16 I. & N. Dec. 131 (BIA 1977): Petitioners likely to become public \ncharges because they were 66 and 54 years old, had received public cash assistance for \nthe past three years, and were unemployed with no future prospects. \n• Matter of A-, 19 I. & N. Dec. 867 (B.I.A. 1988): Petitioner not likely to become a public \ncharge although neither she nor her spouse had worked during the past four years and her \nfamily received cash assistance, as she was “young,” employed, and able to earn a living. \nIn keeping with the narrow scope of “public charge,” Federal immigration officials have \nconsistently excluded only a minuscule percentage of arriving immigrants on public charge \ngrounds. Of the 21.8 million immigrants admitted to the United States as lawful permanent \nresidents between 1892 and 1930, less than one percent were deemed inadmissible on public \ncharge grounds, as shown by DHS’s own data. The same has been true in subsequent years. \nBetween 1931 and 1980 (the last year for which DHS publishes such data), only 13,798 \nimmigrants were excluded on public charge grounds out of more than 11 million admitted as \nlawful permanent residents—an exclusion rate of about one-tenth of one percent.3 \n                                                 \n3  See Dep’t of Homeland Security, Table 1. Persons Obtaining Lawful Permanent Resident \nStatus: Fiscal Years 1820 to 2016 (Dec. 18, 2017), D. Ct. Dkt. 50-11; Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 2001 Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService 258 (2003), D. Ct. Dkt. 50-12. \n8 \n \n\n \nC.  Congress Has Approved Administrative Interpretations by Repeatedly \nReenacting the Public Charge Provisions of the INA Without  Material \nChange \nCongress has approved these judicial and administrative interpretations of “public \ncharge” by repeatedly reenacting the public charge provisions of the INA without material \nchange. In 1952, four years after Matter of B- was decided, Congress reenacted the public charge \nprovision in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 without purporting to change its \ninterpretation. 66 Stat. 163, 183. Defendants cite a statement in a 1950 Senate report stating that \nbecause “the elements constituting likelihood of becoming a public charge are varied, there \nshould be no attempt to define the term in the law.” S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349 (1950) (quoted \nat App. 26). But that statement on its face reflects only Congress’s recognition that determining \nwhether an individual noncitizen is likely to be a public charge is necessarily fact-specific. \nNothing in the report suggests that Congress intended to authorize the Executive to redefine the \nstatutory term “public charge” itself.  \nAlmost 40 years later, in the Immigration Act of 1990, Congress again reenacted the \npublic charge provision without material change. Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, \n§§ 601–03, 104 Stat. 4978, 5067–85. The legislative history of the 1990 Act noted that courts \nhad associated likelihood of becoming a public charge not by reference to mere receipt of \nbenefits, but by pegging the status to “destitution coupled with an inability to work.” Staff of the \nH. Comm. on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., Grounds for Exclusion of Aliens Under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act: Historical Background and Analysis 121 (Comm. Print 1988). \nAgain, Congress declined to depart from that definition. \nCongress again chose not to disturb the settled understanding of “public charge” in two \nmajor pieces of legislation enacted in 1996 that otherwise addressed noncitizen use of public \nbenefits and public charge determinations. First, in the Personal Responsibility and Work \n9 \n \n\n \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), Congress restricted certain noncitizens’ \neligibility for certain federal benefits. See Pub. L. No. 104-193, § 403, 110 Stat. 2105, 2265–67 \n(1996) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1613). But, following the passage of PRWORA and subsequent \nlegislation, many noncitizens remained eligible for federal benefits, including Medicaid and \nSNAP, and states were authorized to provide benefits to many others. See generally 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1612–13. As defendants note, PRWORA’s statement of policy provides that noncitizens \nshould “not depend on public resources to meet their needs.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 (quoting 8 \nU.S.C. § 1601(2)(A)). But Congress has plainly concluded that allowing noncitizens to receive \ncertain benefits is consistent with that purpose.  Indeed, since 1996, Congress has expanded \nnoncitizen access to benefits, including SNAP and Medicaid.4 \nThe second relevant statute enacted in 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”), likewise did not overturn the settled interpretation of \nthe INA’s public charge provisions. See Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. C, § 531, 110 Stat. 3009, 3674 \n(1996) (amending 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)). The statute, enacted one month after PRWORA, \namended the public charge admissibility provision only to codify the existing standard that a \ndetermination whether a noncitizen was likely to become a public charge should be based on the \n“totality of the circumstances,” and should take account of the applicant’s age; health; family \n                                                 \n4  See Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-185 \n(1998) (restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled, and child immigrants who resided in \nthe United States when PRWORA was enacted); Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002, Pub. L. No. 107-171 (2002) (restoring eligibility for food stamps (now SNAP) to \nqualified immigrant adults who have been in the United States at least five years, and \nimmigrants receiving certain disability payments and for children, regardless of how long \nthey have been in the country); Children’s Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009, \nPub. L. No. 111-3 (2009) (providing states an option to cover lawfully present immigrant \nchildren and pregnant women under the federal Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram programs). \n10 \n \n\n \nstatus; assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). But Congress otherwise reenacted the existing INA public charge \nadmissibility provision without material change. \nCongress’s decision not to expand the settled meaning of “public charge” in either of the \n1996 statutes was not an oversight. In enacting IIRIRA, Congress expressly considered and \nrejected a proposal that would have defined public charge for purposes of removal as a \nnoncitizen who receives certain benefits—including Medicaid, food stamps, and any other \nneeds-based benefits—for more than 12 months. Immigration Control & Financial \nResponsibility Act of 1996, H.R. 2202, 104th Cong. § 202 (1996). A proponent of the proposed \namendment explained that it was intended to override “a 1948 decision by an administrative law \njudge” (i.e., Matter of B-), which he argued had rendered the public charge provision “virtually \nunenforced and unenforceable.” 142 Cong. Rec. S4401, S4408–09 (1996) (statement of Sen. \nSimpson); see supra n.1. \nThe proposed amendment to redefine “public charge” passed the House but was \nwithdrawn in the Senate under threat of Presidential veto. 142 Cong. Rec. S11872, S11881–82 \n(1996). Contrary to defendants’ unsupported assertion that opposition to the amendment was \ndriven only by concern about unduly restricting the Executive’s power to define “public charge,” \nApp. 27, President Clinton threatened to veto any immigration bill that went “too far in denying \nlegal immigrants access to vital safety net programs which could jeopardize public health and \nsafety.” Statement on Senate Action on the “Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility \nAct of 1996,” 32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 783 (May 2, 1996). Likewise, a leading opponent of \nthe amendment expressed concern that it was “too quick to label people as public charges for \nutilizing the same public assistance that many Americans need to get on their feet,” and argued \n11 \n \n\n \nthat the proposed “definition of public charge goes too far in including a vast array of programs \nnone of us think of as welfare,” including medical services and supplemental nutritional \nprograms. S. Rep. No. 104-249, at 63–64 (1996) (statement of Sen. Leahy).  \nIn 2013, Congress again turned back efforts to redefine public charge to include anyone \nwho received means-tested public benefits. During deliberations on the proposed Border \nSecurity, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, a bill that sought to create \na path to citizenship for noncitizens who could show they were “not likely to become a ‘public \ncharge,’” Senator Jefferson B. Sessions, later Attorney General while the Rule was under \ndevelopment at DHS, sought to amend the definition of public charge to include receipt of \n“noncash employment supports such as Medicaid, the SNAP program, or the Children’s Health \nInsurance Program.” S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 38, 42, 63 (2013). Senator Sessions’s proposed \namendment was rejected by voice vote. Id. at 42, 63. \nD.  Administrative Field Guidance from 1999 Confirmed the Settled \nInterpretation of Public Charge \nIn 1999, three years after the passage of PRWORA and IIRIRA, and under the \nadministration of the same President who signed them into law, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (“INS,” the predecessor agency to defendant U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”)) issued its Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility \non Public Charge Grounds (“Field Guidance”), 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999), and a \nparallel proposed regulation, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676 (May 26, 1999). INS explained that the Field \nGuidance “summarize[d] longstanding law with respect to public charge,” and provided “new \nguidance on public charge determinations” in light of the recent legislation. 64 Fed. Reg. at \n28,689. Defendants have cited no contemporaneous evidence questioning INS’s interpretation of \nPRWORA or IIRIRA. The Field Guidance remains in effect today. \n12 \n \n\n \nThe Field Guidance reaffirmed the agency’s longstanding approach to public charge as \none focused on the ability of noncitizens to support themselves. It defined “public charge” as a \nnoncitizen “who is likely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) ‘primarily dependent \non the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash \nassistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government \nexpense.’” Id. And it excluded from consideration in public charge determinations receipt of \nnoncash benefits such as Medicaid, SNAP, and housing assistance, on the ground that those \nbenefits “are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in combination, provide sufficient \nresources to support an individual or family.” Id. at 28,692. \nII.  DHS’S PROPOSED “PUBLIC CHARGE” RULE \nDHS issued the proposed Rule for notice and comment on October 10, 2018. 83 Fed. \nReg. 51,114. More than 260,000 comments were submitted, the “vast majority” of them in \nopposition. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297. The Final Rule, largely rejecting those comments, was \npublished in the Federal Register on August 14, 2019. See id. at 41,292. \nThe Rule defines “public charge” to mean any person who receives any amount of \nspecified “public benefits” for more than 12 months in any 36-month period. Proposed 8 C.F.R. \n§ 212.21(a). The Rule specifies that receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months, \nso that a person could be deemed a public charge for participating in four separate benefit \nprograms for three months in any three-year period. Id. It defines “public benefit” to mean cash \nbenefits or benefits from specified noncash programs that offer short-term or supplemental \nsupport to eligible recipients, including SNAP, federal Medicaid (with certain exclusions5), \n                                                 \n5  Medicaid benefits excepted from the Rule’s public charge analysis include benefits paid for \nan emergency medical condition, services or benefits provided under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, school-based benefits provided to children at or below the \n13 \n \n\n \nSection 8 Housing Assistance, Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing \nunder section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b).  \nThe undisputed evidence before the district court shows that receiving these noncash \nbenefits does not connote destitution or a lack of self-sufficiency. On the contrary, these benefits \nare widely used by working families and are available to many individuals and families with \nincomes well above the poverty level. Schanzenbach Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 40, ¶¶ 6–19 & Tables 1–\n3 (discussing SNAP eligibility and use); Allen Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 41, ¶¶ 10–22 (discussing \nfederal housing benefit eligibility and use); Ku Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 42, ¶¶ 16–22, 79–81 \n(discussing Medicaid eligibility and use). As the Field Guidance explained in concluding that \nsuch benefits should be excluded from public charge considerations, those benefits “are \nincreasingly being made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, \nreflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health and nutrition, \npromoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of becoming self-\nsufficient.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692.  \nA person can be deemed likely to be a public charge without having received any public \nbenefits in the past. Instead, the Rule creates a complex and confusing scheme of positive and \nnegative “factors,” including “heavily weighted” factors, for USCIS personnel to consider in \nmaking that determination. Proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.22. These factors focus overwhelmingly on \nthe applicant’s income and financial resources. The strong correlation between these factors \n(such as low income (regardless of employment status), a low credit score, or a medical \ncondition requiring extensive medical treatment and lack of private health insurance) leads to a \n                                                 \neligible age for secondary education, and benefits received by children under 21 years of age \nor women during pregnancy and 60 days post-partum. Proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b)(5). \n14 \n \n\n \nsnowball effect in which a single characteristic—low income or limited means—triggers \nmultiple negative factors, making a public charge finding virtually inevitable. \nThe Rule would dramatically increase the number of persons potentially deemed a public \ncharge. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, 94 percent of noncitizens who \noriginally entered the United States without lawful permanent resident status have at least one \ncharacteristic that could be weighed negatively in a public charge determination, and 42 percent \nhave characteristics that could be treated as heavily weighted negative factors. Samantha Artiga \net al., Kaiser Family Foundation, Estimated Impacts of the Proposed Public Charge Rule on \nImmigrants and Medicaid, D. Ct. Dkt. 50-28, at 1 (Oct. 2018). Another study submitted to DHS \nduring the notice-and-comment process showed that between 40 and 50 percent of U.S.-born \nindividuals covered by a 2015 survey participated in one of the listed benefit programs between \n1998 and 2014. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (“CBPP”) Comment, D. Ct. Dkt. 50-20, \nat 9–10. Defendants have not challenged these estimates. \nIII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn August 27, 2019, plaintiffs—five nonprofit organizations that serve and advocate for \nlow-income noncitizens—commenced this action by filing a complaint in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York, asserting claims under the APA and the \nEqual Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. The States of New York, Connecticut, and \nVermont and the City of New York filed a related action that was assigned to the same district \njudge (the “New York Action”). This case and the New York Action have proceeded in tandem. \nOther states, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations filed seven similar actions in four other \ndistrict courts. \nOn September 9, 2019, plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin the Rule and postpone its \nproposed effective date. Plaintiffs in the New York Action submitted a similar motion. The \n15 \n \n\n \nparties collectively submitted hundreds of pages of briefs and supporting materials on those \nmotions, including 26 expert and fact declarations. Amici—including the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Academy of Nursing, and the American Academy of Pediatrics—\nsubmitted ten briefs, all but one urging that the Rule be enjoined, and explaining the dire public \nhealth and other consequences they expected from the Rule.  \nOn October 11, 2019, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motions, and issued \npreliminary injunctions in both cases barring enforcement of the Rule and postponing its \neffective date under 5 U.S.C. § 705. App. 69a–71a. Each of the four other district courts in which \nthe Rule was challenged also preliminarily enjoined it, in some cases nationwide and in other \ncases with a more limited geographic scope. \nDefendants appealed these injunctions to the Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth \nCircuits. Defendants also moved in each district and circuit court for a stay pending appeal. The \nSecond Circuit denied defendants’ motion, noting that the appeal was expedited and that the \nmerits panel “has full authority to consider the scope of the existing injunction.” App. 65a. The \nSeventh Circuit (with one dissent) likewise denied a stay. Divided panels of the Fourth and Ninth \nCircuits stayed the preliminary injunctions entered by district courts in those circuits. CA2 Dkt. \n56, 60, 92 (orders from panels of Ninth, Fourth, and Seventh Circuits). Only the Ninth Circuit \npanel issued a detailed opinion. See San Francisco, 944 F.3d 773.  \nThe merits portions of these appeals are pending, and briefing and argument has been \nexpedited. All of them, including this case, will be fully briefed on February 14, 2020. Oral \nargument in the Ninth Circuit has not been scheduled, while argument in the Second, Fourth, and \nSeventh Circuits is scheduled or tentatively scheduled for February or March. \n16 \n \n\n \nARGUMENT \nDefendants bear a “heavy burden” to justify the “extraordinary” relief they seek. Whalen \nv. Roe, 423 U.S. 1313, 1316 (1975) (Marshall, J., in chambers). In seeking a stay pending appeal, \ndefendants must establish:  \n(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently \nmeritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will \nvote to reverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that irreparable harm will \nresult from the denial of a stay. In close cases the Circuit Justice or the Court will \nbalance the equities and weigh the relative harms to the applicant and to the \nrespondent.  \nHollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010). A showing of irreparable harm is necessary \nfor a stay to be granted. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 463 U.S. 1315, 1317 (1983) (Blackmun, \nJ., in chambers) (“An applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits need not be considered . . . \nif the applicant fails to show irreparable injury from the denial of the stay.”); Williams v. Zbaraz, \n442 U.S. 1309, 1312 (1979) (Stevens, J., in chambers) (“The question, then, is only whether the \nDistrict Court’s injunction should be observed in the interim. Unless the applicants will suffer \nirreparable injury, it clearly should be.”). As Justice Stevens noted in Williams,  \nIn addressing the irreparable-injury issue, the task of a judge or Justice is to \nexamine the competing equities, a task that involves balancing the injury to one \nside against the losses that might be suffered by the other. . . . Where there is \ndoubt, it should inure to the benefit of those who oppose grant of the \nextraordinary relief which a stay represents.  \nId. at 1312 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).   \n“Because this matter is pending before the Court of Appeals, and because the Court of \nAppeals denied [their] motion for a stay, [defendants] ha[ve] an especially heavy burden.” \nPackwood v. Senate Select Comm. on Ethics, 510 U.S. 1319, 1320 (1994) (Rehnquist, C.J., in \nchambers). Such stays are “rare and exceptional,” and are granted only “upon the weightiest \nconsiderations.” Fargo Women’s Health Org. v. Schafer, 507 U.S. 1013, 1014 (1993) \n17 \n \n\n \n(O’Connor, J., concurring in denial of stay application) (voting to deny stay despite view that \nlower court decisions were “inconsistent” with Supreme Court precedent); see also Pasadena \nCity Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 423 U.S. 1335, 1336 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) \n(“Ordinarily a stay application to a Circuit Justice on a matter currently before a Court of \nAppeals is rarely granted.”); Edwards, 512 U.S. at 1302 (“[W]hen a district court judgment is \nreviewable by a court of appeals that has denied a motion for a stay, the applicant seeking an \noverriding stay from this Court bears ‘an especially heavy burden.’” (quoting Packwood, 510 \nU.S. at 1320)). \nI.  DEFENDANTS WILL SUFFER NO IRREPARABLE INJURY  \nDefendants cannot establish irreparable harm from a delay in implementing the Rule \nwhile the courts of appeals (and, if necessary, this Court) consider the pending appeals.  \nThe district court’s injunction merely maintains the status quo. It does so by requiring \nDHS to continue applying the Field Guidance that has guided public charge determinations by \nDHS and its predecessors for more than twenty years (including almost three years before the \ncurrent Administration sought to adopt the Rule). Defendants have conceded that the Field \nGuidance is a lawful implementation of the public charge provision. See Defts. Memo. of Law in \nOpp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj., D. Ct. Dkt. 129, at 21 (“The 1999 Interim Field Guidance . . . \nillustrate[s] an exercise of the authority Congress has delegated to the Executive Branch to define \n‘public charge’ within the broad limits of its plain meaning . . . .”); see also Appellant’s Mot. for \nStay Pending Appeal, CA2 Dkt. 24, at 13. DHS remains able to deny admission or status \nadjustment to noncitizens it deems likely to be public charges under the standards set forth in the \nField Guidance. That defendants wish to implement a different public charge rule does not \nrender the Field Guidance unlawful, or imply that the injunction requires it to grant status \nadjustment to “those not legally entitled to it.” App. 40 (quoting San Francisco, 944 F.3d at \n18 \n \n\n \n806). In contrast to other recent cases in which the government has sought a stay pending appeal, \ndefendants have identified no emergency or other pressing justification for departing from the \nnormal appellate process in this case. Cf., e.g., Appl. for a Stay Pending Appeal at 3–4, Barr v. \nE. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, No. 19A230 (U.S. Aug. 26, 2019) (asserting injunction prevented \ngovernment from addressing a “crisis at the southern border”); Appl. for a Stay Pending Appeal \nat 25–26, Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 542 (Nov. 20, 2017) (No. 17A550 ) (asserting injunction \ninterfered with government’s “foreign-policy, national-security, and counterterrorism \nobjectives”). \nThe purported harm that defendants cite does not support a stay. Defendants contend that \nthe government will be irreparably harmed if it is “precluded from implementing its chosen \npolicy.” App. 4. And they assert that, if the Rule remains enjoined, some noncitizens will be \ngranted lawful permanent residence status who would not have received that status under the \nRule, and that DHS has “no practical means of revisiting” those determinations. App. 40.  \nThese generic assertions prove too much. In any APA challenge to administrative action, \nan injunction in favor of the plaintiffs impedes the Executive from implementing its preferred \npolicy, and in many such cases Executive action taken under injunction will not be reversible. \nThus, defendants’ argument, if accepted, would mean that this factor always favors the \ngovernment in every APA case. But this Court has routinely recognized that the government is \nnot irreparably injured by mere delay in implementing a policy, e.g., Whalen, 423 U.S. at 1317, \nor having to use disfavored criteria in decisionmaking, e.g., Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance \nProject, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2088–89 (2017) (per curiam) (requiring government to process visa \napplications for certain classes of individuals despite Executive Order suspending entry); \nRuckelshaus, 463 U.S. at 1317 (no irreparable harm to EPA from having to abide by a \n19 \n \n\n \npreliminary injunction requiring the agency to process applications to register pesticides without \ncollecting manufacturers’ trade secrets). And any injury suffered by defendants as a result of an \ninjunction pales in comparison to the demonstrable harm the Rule will inflict on plaintiffs and \nimmigrant communities around the country if it is allowed to take effect, as discussed further \nbelow in Section III.  \nII.  THE COURT IS UNLIKELY TO GRANT CERTIORARI AND REVERSE \nDefendants’ speculation that the Court would grant certiorari “if the court of appeals \nultimately upholds the district court’s nationwide preliminary injunctions,” App. 15, highlights \nwhy this application is premature. Defendants hypothesize potential conflicts between the courts \nof appeals that may exist if they reach differing results on the merits, and suggest that they may \nseek certiorari on the nationwide scope of the injunction if it survives appellate review. See id. at \n15–16. Such conjecture cannot satisfy defendants’ heavy burden of establishing a need for \nimmediate intervention by this Court.6 In any event, defendants should not prevail on the merits. \n                                                 \n6  Defendants’ contention that, if the Second Circuit rules in favor of plaintiffs on the merits, it \nwill inevitably create a split with the Ninth Circuit (App. 15–16) assumes that the decision by \nthe Ninth Circuit motion panel will be followed by the merits panel. But see United States v. \nHouser, 804 F.2d 565, 568 (9th Cir. 1986) (“[W]hile a merits panel does not lightly overturn \na decision made by a motions panel during the course of the same appeal,” it “do[es] not \napply the law of the case doctrine as strictly” as when considering a prior merits panel’s \ndetermination.). It ignores as well the possibility that the Ninth Circuit will grant the \nplaintiffs’ pending motions for en banc review of the motion panel decision, see Counties’ \nMot. for Reconsideration En Banc, City & Cty. of S.F. v. USCIS, No. 19-17213 (9th Cir. Dec. \n19, 2019), Dkt. 30, or would grant en banc review following a panel decision on the merits, \nin light of the dissent on the panel and contrary rulings denying stays in the Second and \nSeventh Circuits. See 9th Cir. Rule 35-1 (noting as “appropriate ground[s] for rehearing en \nbanc that a panel opinion “conflicts with an existing opinion by another court of appeals and \nsubstantially affects a rule of national application in which there is an overriding need for \nnational uniformity”). The defendants’ need to speculate about how the courts of appeals will \naddress these issues only underscores the premature nature of this application.  \n20 \n \n\n \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Standing and Are Within the Zone of Interests of the INA \nDefendants are unlikely to prevail on their contention that plaintiffs lack standing under \nArticle III. App. 17–18.  An organization establishes an injury-in-fact sufficient to confer \nstanding if the defendants’ actions have “perceptibly impaired” its activities or “drain[ed its] . . . \nresources.” Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982). The presence of one \nparty with standing is sufficient to satisfy Article III. See Bowshar v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 \n(1986). As the district court found, “the Rule forces [plaintiffs] to devote substantial resources to \nmitigate its potentially harmful effects—resources that Plaintiffs could and would have used for \nother purposes.” App. 33a.7 Such “concrete and demonstrable injury to the [plaintiff] \norganization[s’] activities—with the consequent drain on the [plaintiff] organization[s’] \nresources—constitutes far more than simply a setback to the [plaintiff] organization[s’] abstract \nsocial interests.” Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at 379. \nPlaintiffs are also well within the zone of interests of the INA. See App. 17–18.  In an \nAPA challenge to administrative action, the zone of interests inquiry “is not especially \ndemanding” and forecloses suit “only when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or \ninconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress authorized that plaintiff to sue.” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., \n572 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) (quotation marks omitted); see also Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band \n                                                 \n7  For example, as its noncitizen clients turn away from public benefits out of fear of harming \ntheir immigration status, plaintiff African Services Committee (“ASC”) has experienced an \nincreased demand for its food pantries, English classes, and housing assistance, depleting \nresources that would otherwise be available to meet other client needs. Nichols Decl., D. Ct. \nDkt. 46, ¶¶ 17–19. Similarly, plaintiffs that provide direct legal services must devote \nadditional time and resources to status adjustment applications, with correspondingly less \ntime available to represent clients in removal and other immigration matters, Oshiro Decl., D. \nCt. Dkt. 43, ¶¶ 27, 35, 41; Russell Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 44, ¶¶ 22–24; Nichols Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. \n46, ¶¶ 21–26; Wheeler Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 48, ¶¶ 10–16, and, in some cases, this leads to \ndecreases in revenue, Nichols Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 46, ¶¶ 25–26. \n21 \n \n\n \nof Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (discussing “Congress’ evident \nintent when enacting the APA to make agency action presumptively reviewable.” (quotation \nmarks omitted)). In assessing Congress’s intent, the Court must consider not only the specific \nprovision at issue, but its “overall context” and “Congress’ overall purpose in” enacting the \nstatute., Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 401 (1987). In light of the multiple provisions \nof the INA giving immigrant assistance organizations like plaintiffs a role in helping noncitizens \nnavigate the immigration system, see E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 768–\n69 (9th Cir. 2018) (collecting statutory provisions), plaintiffs easily satisfy that standard.  \nDefendants’ contention that plaintiffs’ only interest is to “maintain[] enrollment in \npublic-benefits programs,” and is therefore contrary to what defendants claim is the purpose of \nthe public charge provision, App. 18, reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of plaintiffs’ roles \nin advising, assisting, and advocating for immigrants.8 Defendants also ignore “Congress’ \noverall purpose[s]” of the INA, see Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401–02, which, as the Rule concedes, \ninclude promoting “family unity, diversity, and humanitarian assistance.” 84 Fed Reg. at 41,306. \nThese are all core components of plaintiffs’ missions. \nB.  The Rule Is Contrary to the INA \nThe Court is likely to hold that the Rule should be set aside under the APA because it is \ncontrary to the INA, as demonstrated by the plain language and history of the public charge \ninadmissibility provision. Defendants’ reliance on statements of Congressional policy and other \nstatutory provisions to justify radically expanding the provision do not withstand scrutiny. \n                                                 \n8  See, e.g., Oshiro Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 43, ¶¶ 5, 36 (plaintiff Make the Road New York’s mission \nis to “build[] the power of immigrant and working-class communities to achieve dignity and \njustice through organizing, policy innovation, transformative education, and survival \nservices”); Russell Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 44, ¶¶ 4, 42; Nichols Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 46, ¶¶ 4, 7–8, \n10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 26; Wheeler Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 48, ¶¶ 10, 14, 16, 18; Yoo Decl., D. Ct. \nDkt. 47, ¶¶ 21–25.  \n22 \n \n\n \n  The Rule Is Inconsistent with the Meaning of “Public Charge” in the \nINA \nDefendants’ proffered interpretation of the statutory term “public charge” is inconsistent \nwith the meaning of “public charge” as it has been understood for more than a century, and with \nCongress’s demonstrated intent to approve that understanding.  \nFirst, the Rule is inconsistent with the plain language of the INA. As discussed above, at \nthe time it was introduced in federal immigration law, the term “public charge” referred to a \nnarrow category of persons who are institutionalized or otherwise completely dependent on \npublic assistance, and this interpretation has been confirmed in case law from the early twentieth \ncentury. See Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 139 S. Ct. 2356, 2363–64 (2019) (courts \nlook to “common usage,” such as “dictionary definitions” and “early case law,” to “shed light on \n[a] statute’s ordinary meaning”). See supra pp. 5–6. \nSecond, the consistent, century-long judicial and administrative interpretation of “public \ncharge” as being unable to care for oneself and therefore primarily dependent on the government \nfor subsistence is powerful evidence of the meaning of that term. “[A] long-standing, \ncontemporaneous construction of a statute by the administering agencies is entitled to great \nweight, and will be shown great deference.” Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 25 (1969) \n(quotation marks, alteration, and citations omitted). As discussed above, courts and immigration \nagencies have uniformly held that receipt (or likely future receipt) of benefits does not render a \nperson a public charge absent additional circumstances showing that she is unlikely to be able to \nfend for herself. See supra pp. 6–8. \nThe adoption of the Field Guidance only three years after enactment of PRWORA and \nIIRIRA further supports this conclusion. As this Court has held, an implementing agency’s \ninterpretation of a statute soon after its enactment is better evidence of the statute’s meaning and \n23 \n \n\n \nCongress’s intent than a later, inconsistent interpretation. See Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook \nCty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 U.S. 159, 168 (2001) (looking to agency’s “original \ninterpretation” of the Clean Water Act, “promulgated two years after its enactment,” as well as \nthe absence of any “persuasive evidence that the [agency] mistook Congress’ intent,” to \ndetermine that a later, inconsistent interpretation was against congressional intent (emphasis in \noriginal)); Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 414 (1993). Here, the definition of \n“public charge” in the Field Guidance in 1999 is the best reflection of Congress’s intent, \nparticularly absent any “persuasive evidence that [INS] mistook” that intent. Solid Waste Agency, \n531 U.S. at 168.  \nThird, Congress’s repeated reenactment of the public charge provision without material \nchange evidences its approval of the agency interpretation. “It is well established that when \nCongress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without \npertinent change, the ‘congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency’s interpretation is \npersuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.’” CFTC v. Schor, \n478 U.S. 833, 846 (1986); see Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239–40 (2009) \n(“Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and \nto adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change . . . .”); Toyota Motor Mfg., \nKy., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 193–94 (2002) (“Congress’s repetition of a well-established \nterm generally implies that Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with pre-\nexisting regulatory interpretations.”).  \nThe legislative history here demonstrates that Congress was aware of the administrative \nand judicial interpretations described above. See supra pp. 9–12. Congress’s repeated \n24 \n \n\n \nreenactments of the public charge provisions of the INA without material change reflect its intent \nto retain the longstanding judicial and agency interpretations of the term. \nFourth, Congressional intent to preserve an agency’s interpretation of a statute is \nespecially clear where, as here, Congress has rejected legislation specifically intended to \noverturn that interpretation. See supra pp. 11–12. In Bob Jones University v. United States, the \nCourt considered the IRS’s decade-old determination that private schools practicing racial \ndiscrimination were not entitled to tax-exempt status. 461 U.S. 574, 579 (1983). In upholding the \nagency’s interpretation of the relevant provision of the tax code, the Court found that Congress’s \nrepeated consideration and rejection of bills intended to overturn the IRS’s interpretation was \n“significant” evidence of “Congressional approval of the [IRS] policy.” Id. at 600–01. See also \nMichigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., 572 U.S. 782, 801–02 (2014) (Congressional intent to \napprove longstanding judicial interpretation of scope of tribal immunity clear when Congress \nconsidered, but did not enact, two bills that expressly sought to abrogate that interpretation); \nUnited States v. Bd. of Comm’rs, 435 U.S. 110, 134–35 (1978) (Congress’s intent to endorse an \nagency’s interpretation is particularly clear where Congress reenacts a statute and “manifest[s] its \nview” on an existing interpretation). The Court has placed particular weight on Congress’s \ndecision—as it did in 1996, see supra pp. 11–12—to enact a bill without specific language \noverturning existing law that passed one chamber of Congress but was removed during \nconference. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 408, 414 n.8 (1975) (finding that \n“Congress plainly ratified” prior judicial interpretation when conference committee “specifically \nrejected” language overturning that interpretation, and the bill passed both chambers without \nsuch language). These considerations strongly weigh against the Rule.   \n25 \n \n\n \n  Defendants’ Arguments to the Contrary Are Unpersuasive \nDefendants’ arguments that the Rule is an appropriate administrative exercise of DHS’s \nauthority to construe the statute are not persuasive.  \nFirst, defendants argue that the Rule is justified by the “broad discretion” they allege the \nstatute gives to the Executive Branch to define “public charge.”9  App. 20, 25–26. But while the \nstatute undoubtedly gives the Executive authority to determine whether a noncitizen is likely to \nbe a public charge based on the totality of the circumstances in an individual case, the statute \ndoes not give it unfettered discretion to redefine the statutory term “public charge” in a way that \nis inconsistent with decades of administrative and judicial interpretation and Congressional \nintent.10  In FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 143-56 (2000), for \nexample, the Court held that the FDA lacked authority to regulate nicotine in tobacco and \n                                                 \n9  Despite invoking the agency’s purported discretion to interpret the “public charge” provision, \ndefendants do not analyze the Rule under this Court’s traditional two-step Chevron \nframework applicable to agency rulemaking. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). As a threshold matter, because the Rule involves \nquestions “of deep economic and political significance,” including “billions of dollars in \nspending” and the health of “millions of people,” it is exempt from Chevron deference under \nthe “major question” doctrine. See King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2489 (2015). In any \nevent, the Rule fails at both Chevron steps. Congressional intent is readily ascertainable at \nChevron step one, given the legislative history and historical backdrop: the Rule is simply \n“inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.” FDA v. \nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 125 (2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline \nProject v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 497, 517 (1988)). And, under Chevron step two, all interpretive \ntools indicate that the Rule’s interpretation of the public charge provision “goes beyond the \nmeaning the statute can bear.” MCI Telecomm. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, \n229 (1994).  \n10  The statutory reference to “the opinion of” the Executive in determining whether an \nindividual noncitizen is likely to become a public charge does not on its face authorize the \nagency to redefine the statutory term. The sole case cited by defendants on this point, \nconstruing similar language in the Internal Revenue Code, likewise held only that the IRS \nCommissioner appropriately exercised his authority in rejecting individual taxpayer’s \naccounting practices. Thor Power Tool Co. v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522, 540 (1979) (cited \nin App. 20). Thor does not suggest that such language empowers to Executive to redefine a \nstatutory term in the face of longstanding contrary administrative interpretation repeatedly \napproved by Congress. \n26 \n \n\n \ntobacco products themselves, despite broad statutory grant of authority to regulate “drugs,” \ndefined broadly as any “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function \nof the body.”  The Court based its decision upon, among other things, the “range of plausible \nmeanings” that the statutory language could have had when the statute was enacted; its \nlegislative history, including rejected efforts to amend the statute to grant FDA such authority; \nand Congressional reenactment of the statute after the FDA took the position that it lacked \njurisdiction to regulate tobacco. Id. Accord Utility Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, \n316–24 (2014) (rejecting agency reading of statute in light of prior inconsistent agency \ninterpretation, as well as statute’s structure and design). The same considerations foreclose \ndefendants from redefining “public charge” here. \nSecond, defendants’ reliance on statements of policy in PRWORA that “aliens within the \nNation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,” and that “the availability \nof public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1601(2), is misplaced. App. 23. Nothing in PRWORA indicates that the statements of policy \nwere intended to alter the longstanding definition of “public charge.” On the contrary, by \nretaining immigrant eligibility for certain benefits in PRWORA—and expanding that eligibility \nin later legislation—Congress has plainly concluded that allowing noncitizens to access those \nbenefits is not inconsistent with the statements of purpose expressed in PRWORA, including the \ndesire to promote self-sufficiency.  \nPRWORA’s statements of legislative purpose do not justify the Rule’s radical expansion \nof public charge. As this Court has repeatedly stressed, balancing multiple legislative purposes \n“is the very essence of legislative choice—and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative \nintent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be the \n27 \n \n\n \nlaw,” because “no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 \nU.S. 522, 525–26 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis in original). As Chief Justice Burger explained: \nCongress may be unanimous in its intent to stamp out some vague social or \neconomic evil; however, because its Members may differ sharply on the means \nfor effectuating that intent, the final language of the legislation may reflect hard-\nfought compromises. Invocation of the ‘plain purpose’ of legislation at the \nexpense of the terms of the statute itself takes no account of the processes of \ncompromise and, in the end, prevents the effectuation of congressional intent. \nBd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin. Corp., 474 U.S. 361, 373–74 (1986). \nHere, as noted, the INA reflects a balance among many Congressional goals, including “family \nunity, diversity, and humanitarian assistance.” 84 Fed Reg. at 41,306. Defendants’ assertion that \nCongress’s identification of a single policy justifies overturning the longstanding meaning of one \nstatutory provision ignores the teaching of Rodriguez and Board of Governors. \nThird, defendants point to provisions in the INA, adopted as part of the 1996 legislation, \nrequiring certain noncitizens to provide enforceable affidavits of support by their sponsors as a \ncondition of admissibility under the public charge provision. See App. 21–22. As discussed \nabove, however, Congress, in passing PRWORA, chose not to redefine “public charge” to mean \nany receipt of cash or noncash benefits. On the contrary, it rejected such a proposal a month later \nwhen enacting IIRIRA. See supra pp. 11–12. Had Congress intended to redefine public charge, it \nwould have done so directly. See also Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 \n(2001) (noting that Congress “does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in \nvague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes”). \nNor is there any inconsistency between requiring noncitizens seeking admission or status \nadjustment to provide an enforceable affidavit of support from their sponsors and retaining the \ntraditional, narrow interpretation of “public charge.” To the contrary, the requirement of an \naffidavit of support—which DHS acknowledges is a requirement in relevant cases “separate” \n28 \n \n\n \nfrom a public charge assessment, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,448—protects the public fisc by ensuring \nthat a sponsor’s agreement to repay certain benefits used by the noncitizen can be enforced, and \nfurthers the Congressional policy of discouraging immigrants from relying on public benefits. \nAnd it does so without undermining the compelling goals of family unity and diversity that \nwould result from redefining “public charge” and rendering large numbers of noncitizens \nineligible for lawful permanent residence. \nFourth, defendants erroneously rely on a provision of the INA that directs immigration \nofficers adjudicating public charge inadmissibility determinations for immigrants who have been \n“battered or subjected to extreme cruelty” in the United States not to “consider any benefits the \nalien may have received” under section 8 U.S.C. § 1641(c)(1)(A). App. 22 (citing 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1182(s), 1611–13) (emphasis added). Enacted as part of the Battered Immigrant Women \nProtection Act of 2000, the purpose of this provision is to protect vulnerable immigrants who \noften lack means of support outside abusive relationships. See Pub. L. No. 106-386, § 1502, \n1505, 114 Stat. 1464, 1518, 1525–27. In categorically exempting these so-called “battered \nqualified aliens” from public charge, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E), Congress did not implicitly \n“presuppose[],” App. 22, that any other noncitizens who use public benefits would be deemed \npublic charges. Indeed, Section 1182(s) was enacted in 2000, when the Field Guidance was \nalready in place, and defendants point to no evidence that Congress, in enacting that provision, \nintended to overrule the Field Guidance sub silentio and radically reinterpret the INA’s public \ncharge provision. \nC.  The Rule Should Be Set Aside Under the APA Because It Is Contrary to the \nRehabilitation Act \nThe Rule is contrary to law under the APA for the additional reason that it explicitly \ndiscriminates against individuals with disabilities in violation of Section 504 of the \n29 \n \n\n \nRehabilitation Act and DHS’s own regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the Rule, \napplicants with disabilities start with multiple strikes against them. The Rule expressly requires \nimmigration officials to consider “an applicant’s disability diagnosis,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,408, \nand treat it as a negative factor relating to a noncitizen’s “assets, resources, and financial status,” \nand, separately, as a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the noncitizen lacks private health \ninsurance or sufficient assets to cover reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to the \ndisability. See proposed 8 C.F.R. §§ 212.22(c)(1)(iii), 212.22(b)(4)(H). \nDefendants argue that the Rule does not violate the Rehabilitation Act because it does not \ndeny noncitizens adjustment of status “solely by reason of her or his disability,” as the statute \nrequires. App. 30–31 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)). Under the Rule’s scheme, multiple \nindependent “negative” factors flow from an individual’s disability—including heavily-weighted \nnegative factors. Thus, an “otherwise qualified” noncitizen could be excluded as likely to \nbecome a public charge “solely” because of the myriad negative factors related to their disability. \nThis is precisely the type of discrimination prohibited by the Rehabilitation Act. See Henrietta D. \nv. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 276 (2d Cir. 2003). The Rule also runs afoul of DHS’s regulations \npromulgated under the Rehabilitation Act. See 6 C.F.R. § 15.30(b)(4) (providing that DHS may \nnot “utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would: (i) \nSubject qualified individuals with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability; or (ii) \nDefeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with \nrespect to individuals with a disability.”).  \nDefendants argue that the statute’s inclusion of “health” as a public charge factor requires \nDHS to take an immigrant’s disability into account. App. at 31. But the Rehabilitation Act’s \ndisability discrimination provision controls because it is far more specific: the INA only requires \n30 \n \n\n \na general consideration of an immigrant’s “health,” while the Rehabilitation Act prohibits \ndiscrimination against one particular “health” concern, namely, a person’s disability status. See \nClifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use and Benefit of Calvin Tomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 \n(1944) (“Specific terms prevail over the general in the same or another statute which might \notherwise be controlling.”). \nD.  The Rule Should Be Set Aside Under the APA Because It Is Arbitrary and \nCapricious \nDefendants’ primary argument that the radical expansion of public charge under the Rule \nis not arbitrary and capricious again depends on its position that the “receipt of any public \nbenefits, including noncash benefits, [i]s indicative of a lack of self-sufficiency” in the view of \nCongress. App. 29. But, as explained above, defendants’ misplaced reliance on broad statements \nof policy regarding immigrants’ “self-sufficiency” in PRWORA means the Rule is based upon \nan “irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions” rather than “germane” factors, \nrendering it arbitrary and capricious. Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 55 (2011).  \nIn any event, the district court correctly found that “[r]eceipt of a benefit . . . does not \nnecessarily indicate that the individual is unable to support herself,” recognizing that a person \nmay elect to use a benefit simply “because she is entitled to it” despite being “fully capable of \nsupporting herself without government assistance.” App. 40a–41a. The district court similarly \npointed out the inconsistency between an individual being made eligible for benefits by \nCongress, and being penalized with denial of adjustment of status for having used them or being \nlikely to use them. See App. 41a. Defendants’ position also ignores the undisputed evidence that \nsupplemental benefits actually promote rather than impede self-sufficiency, and that the \nprograms covered by the Rule are widely used by working families—including those with \nincomes above the poverty level—merely to supplement their incomes. Schanzenbach Decl., D. \n31 \n \n\n \nCt. Dkt. 40, ¶¶ 6–19 & Tables 1–3; Allen Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 41, ¶¶ 10–22; Ku Decl., D. Ct. \nDkt.42, ¶¶ 16–22, 79–81. Defendants also ignore the uncontested evidence that noncitizens who \nwould be at risk of being denied status adjustment on public charge grounds are unlikely to use \ngovernment benefits. Van Hook Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 45, ¶¶ 11, 26, 39. Nor have defendants \n“articulate[d] a rational basis for equating public charge with receipt of benefits for 12 months \nwithin a 36-month period, particularly when this has never been the rule,” nor explained “what \nevaluation of the factors enumerated in the Rule would make the DHS officer confident that she \ncould make an appropriate prediction.” App. 41a.   \nE.  The Rule Violates Equal Protection \nEvaluating the factors set forth in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing \nDevelopment Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267–68 (1977), demonstrates that the Rule is the product of \ndiscriminatory purpose by key decisionmakers, and therefore violates the Constitution’s Equal \nProtection guarantees. First, direct “contemporary statements” by decisionmakers, as well as the \n“administrative history” and the “specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged \ndecision,” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267–68, which are described in detail in the Complaint \nand were presented to the district court, see Compl., Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1, ¶¶ 203–34, strongly support \nan inference of discriminatory purpose. Second, as the District Court found, App. 44a–45a, it is \nundisputed that the Rule will disparately impact noncitizens of color. Arlington Heights, 429 \nU.S. at 266. See also Van Hook Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 45, ¶¶ 46-68, 95, 96; Ku Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 42, \n¶¶ 9, 28. The Rule also does not pass muster even if rational basis scrutiny applies, as animus \nagainst a particular group is never a legitimate governmental objective. See, e.g., City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446–47 (1985) (“[S]ome objectives—such as a \n32 \n \n\n \nbare desire to harm a politically unpopular group—are not legitimate state interests [under \nrational basis review].” (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted)).11  \nIII.  THE BALANCE OF THE EQUITIES AND RELEVANT HARMS WEIGH IN \nFAVOR OF MAINTAINING THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND \nSTAYING THE RULE PENDING APPEAL \nThe balance of equities favors retaining the injunction. The purpose of a stay is to \nmaintain the status quo, Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 429 (2009), the opposite of what \ndefendants seek here. As discussed, defendants have not shown that they will suffer any harm by \ncontinuing to apply the same rules set forth in the Field Guidance that have been in effect for \ndecades. See supra pp. 18–20 \nOn the other side of the ledger is the irreparable harm that the district court found, based \non unrebutted evidence in the record, plaintiffs would suffer in responding to the impact of the \nRule on their immigrant clients. Defendants dismiss plaintiffs’ injuries as “speculative.” App. 40. \nBut the district court found that the Rule would irreparably harm plaintiffs “by forcing them to \ndivert resources and by shifting the burden of providing services to those who can no longer \nobtain federal benefits without jeopardizing their status in the United States.” App. 45a–46a. \nThis, the district court explained, was “a direct and inevitable consequence of the impending \nimplementation of the Rule.” App. 46a. Plaintiffs also have suffered and will continue to suffer \nmonetary harm as a result of the Rule. Nichols Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 46, ¶¶ 11, 16, 19, 25, 26; \nWheeler Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 48, ¶ 16. That harm is irreparable because the APA does not permit \nrecovery of monetary damages. See 5 U.S.C. § 702 (enabling claimants to obtain “relief other \nthan money damages”); San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 806–07 (finding that “purely economic \n                                                 \n11  The Court need not reach plaintiffs’ constitutional claims if it concludes that a preliminary \ninjunction is warranted on statutory grounds. \n33 \n \n\n \nharm” suffered by plaintiffs was irreparable because money damages are not available under the \nAPA).  \nThe Rule’s detrimental impact on public health, homelessness, and food insecurity, \namong other ills, also weighs heavily in favor of an injunction. As the record shows, the Rule is \nexpected to result in millions of noncitizens and citizens—many of whom are not subject to the \nRule, but fear that they or their families will suffer immigration penalties if they continue to use \nbenefits—foregoing benefits for which they are eligible. See Ku Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 42, ¶¶ 26, 46–\n54 (describing millions of U.S. citizen family members who are expected to disenroll or decline \nto participate in benefits programs for which they are eligible, including up to 3.1 million \nmembers of immigrant families from Medicaid, resulting in as many as 4,000 excess premature \ndeaths per year); Schanzenbach Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 40, ¶¶ 5, 31–48 & Tables 4–8 (describing \nexpected substantial harm to 524,897 households consisting of 1.78 million individuals, some of \nwhom are U.S. citizens, who are projected not to participate in SNAP, of which 35 percent of \nhouseholds have children aged 4 or younger). \nDHS does not dispute the grave harms the Rule will inflict. It concedes that the Rule will \ncause hundreds of thousands of noncitizens to forego benefits for which they are eligible, \nincluding benefits for healthcare, nutrition, and housing, although it greatly understates the \nseverity of those effects. DHS estimates that, as a result, these individuals will lose nearly $1.5 \nbillion in federal benefits payments, and more than $1 billion in state benefits payments, every \nyear.12 DHS has also projected that the Rule will lead to “[w]orse health outcomes”; “[i]ncreased \nuse of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary health care due to delayed \n                                                 \n12  See DHS, Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of Public Benefits \nPrograms, D. Ct. Dkt. 50-43, at 7 & Table 5; Regulatory Impact Analysis, Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, D. Ct. Dkt. 50-44, at 10–11 & Table 1. \n34 \n \n\n \ntreatment”; “[i]ncreased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among members of the \nU.S. citizen population who are not vaccinated”; “[i]ncreases in uncompensated care in which a \ntreatment or service is not paid for by an insurer or patient”; “[i]ncreased rates of poverty and \nhousing instability”; “[r]educed productivity and educational attainment”; and other \n“unanticipated consequences and indirect costs.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,270. Unrebutted expert \ndeclarations in the record before the district court provide estimates of likely public harms that \nare many times greater than DHS’s estimates. Schanzenbach Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 40, ¶¶ 31– 48 & \nTables 4–8; Ku Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 42, ¶¶  63–73 & Tables 2–4. The Rule will also lead to \nincreases in denials of adjustment, resulting in possible removal from the U.S. and consequent \nfamily separation.  These harms are especially likely to befall the working poor, people with \ndisabilities, and the elderly. See Ku Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 42, ¶ 29; Van Hook Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. 45, \n¶¶ 69–73, Table 9, Figure 9a. \nAccordingly, the balance of the equities and the public interest weigh heavily in favor of \na preliminary injunction. \nIV.  THERE IS NO BASIS TO NARROW THE INJUNCTION \nThe district court found that a nationwide injunction is necessary “to accord Plaintiffs and \nother interested parties with complete redress” because the individuals whom plaintiffs serve live \nin, and may move between, different states. App. 50a. See also Wheeler Decl., D. Ct. Dkt. \n48, ¶ 2 (showing that plaintiff CLINIC supports affiliate programs that deliver direct services to \nimmigrants in 49 states and the District of Columbia). The district court reasoned as well that a \npatchwork system of injunctions would “result[] in different public charge frameworks spread \nacross the country,” which would “wreak havoc on the immigration system.” App. 49a. The \ndistrict court’s findings of fact are amply supported in the record, and must not be set aside \nunless clearly erroneous. Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). \n35 \n \n\n \nDefendants’ contention that the district court’s injunction is overbroad should be \naddressed in the first instance by the courts of appeals, particularly in light of the fact-specific \nnature of the district court’s ruling. In any event, defendants’ arguments do not establish that the \ndistrict court abused its discretion. See City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 293 (7th Cir. \n2018); Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1140 (9th Cir. 2009). \nFirst, the APA expressly permits the relief ordered by the district court. Section 705 of \nthe APA empowers the courts to “postpone the effective date of an agency action” pending \nreview so as to “prevent irreparable injury.” 5 U.S.C. § 705; see App. 50a n.4 (granting relief \nunder § 705). This statute has been read to provide authority to preliminarily enjoin agency \naction in its entirety, with nationwide applicability to both parties and nonparties. E.g., Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 (5th Cir. 2016) (granting stay under Section 705 of final EPA rule \npending judicial review). See also Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 562 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (noting that Section 705 “authoriz[es] courts to stay \nagency rules pending judicial review” (emphasis in original)).  \nSecond, the district court injunction is consistent with the APA’s directive that the courts \n“set aside” unlawful agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). “[T]he ordinary result [of such a \ndetermination] is that the rules are vacated—not that their application to individual petitioners is \nproscribed.” Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409–10 (D.C. Cir. \n1998). Accord Pennsylvania v. President United States, 930 F.3d 543, 575–76 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(district court did not abuse its discretion in granting a nationwide injunction due, in part, to the \n“impact of the[] interstate activities” of the plaintiff States’ residents). See also Texas v. United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134, 187–88 (5th Cir. 2015) (approving nationwide injunction), aff’d by an \nequally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016); Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass’n v. Fed. \n36 \n \n\n \nMotor Carrier Safety Admin., 656 F.3d 580, 589 (7th Cir. 2011) (same); Earth Island Inst. v. \nRuthenbeck, 490 F.3d 687, 699 (9th Cir. 2007) (same), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488 (2009). Such relief ensures that the entirety of \n“today’s vast and varied federal bureaucracy” stays within the bounds of the laws as Congress \nhas written them. City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 313 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThird, defendants assert that nationwide injunctions run afoul of Article III where such \nrelief goes beyond what is needed to redress the injuries of the plaintiff before the Court. App. \n32–34. That contention ignores the district court’s specific factual findings that this preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to protect the interests of particularized interests of plaintiffs. Moreover, \nthere is a long history of issuing an injunction against a defendant properly before the court that \nalso protects the interests of nonparties. See Amanda Frost, In Defense of Nationwide \nInjunctions, 93 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1065, 1080–81 & n.77 (2018). Because this relief was available \nat the time the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, id., federal courts may continue to exercise it \ntoday. See Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318–\n19 (1999).  \nContrary to defendants’ claims that nationwide injunctions are a recent invention, App. \n38, Article III courts, including this Court, “have issued injunctions that extend beyond just the \nplaintiff for well over a century.” Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the “Universal” Injunction, \n133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924, 935–54 (2020). Most recently, in Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance \nProject (“IRAP”), involving President Trump’s second Executive Order suspending the entry of \nforeign nationals from certain specified countries, the Court narrowed a nationwide injunction by \nlimiting it to foreign nationals with a bona fide relationship with the United States, but left in \n37 \n \n\n \nplace nationwide injunctions with respect to the plaintiff “and those similarly situated.” 137 S. at \n2087. Defendants’ contention that nationwide injunctions protecting parties other than the \nplaintiffs violate Article III cannot be squared with IRAP. \nFourth, defendants’ assertion that a nationwide injunction will prevent the percolation of \nissues and the development of the law in the lower courts has no bearing here. App. 32, 38–39. \nWhile the Court has cautioned lower courts to “take care” in using their broad powers so as to \n“not improperly interfere with the litigation of similar issues in other judicial districts,” Califano \nv. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702–03 (1979), defendants do not suggest that the courts here did not \nconsider that caution. And the multiple pending appeals show that the district court injunction \nhere is not impeding the lower courts from considering the issues presented. See San Francisco, \n944 F.3d at 788 (holding that appeal from preliminary injunction was not mooted by nationwide \ninjunctions entered by the district court in this case). \nFifth, the district court’s emphasis on the importance of avoiding “different public charge \nframeworks spread across the country,” App. 49a, is further supported by Congress’s intent that \nthe immigration laws “should be enforced . . . uniformly.” Immigration Reform and Control Act \nof 1986, Pub. L. No. 99–603, § 115(1), 100 Stat. 3359, 3384. See also Texas v. United States, \n809 F.3d 134, 187–88 (5th Cir. 2015) (affirming nationwide injunction in immigration action, \nbased in part on need for uniformity in immigration enforcement). \n \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants respectfully submit that defendants’ application for a stay should be denied. \n   \n38 \n \n\n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n/s/ Andrew J.

Daniels, \nJ.) that had enjoined the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) from implementing a \nfinal rule setting out a new agency interpretation of our immigration law that expands the \nmeaning of “public charge” in determining whether a non-citizen is admissible to the \nUnited States.  While the appeal of that preliminary injunction was pending before us, the \ndistrict court issued a new, nationwide, preliminary injunction preventing DHS from \nenforcing that same rule based on its finding that the COVID-19 pandemic heightened the \nneed for the stay.  The initial issue here is whether the district court had jurisdiction to enter \na second preliminary injunction, given the then pending appeal of the first injunction. \nBecause DHS has demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits, given our doubt that \n3 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 4   Poaf g1e2 4 of 12\nthe district court had jurisdiction to enter the preliminary injunction while its prior, virtually \nidentical injunction was pending appeal before this Court, we grant DHS’s motion to stay. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  This case involves a challenge to the implementation of a DHS rule that introduced \na new framework for determining the admissibility of non-citizens to the United States, \nexpanding the meaning of the “public charge” ground of inadmissibility, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(4),  to  include  significantly  more  people  than  would  have  been  found \ninadmissible  under  previous  administrative  understandings  of  that  ground.    See \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) \n(“the Rule” or “the Final Rule”).  In October 2019, the district court enjoined DHS \nfrom implementing the Rule anywhere in the United States, in a set of orders in \ntwo now consolidated cases.  New York v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-cv-\n7777  (S.D.N.Y.);  Make  the  Road  New  York  v.  Cuccinelli,  No.  19-cv-7993 \n(S.D.N.Y.).  Several other district courts, in the District of Maryland, the Northern District \nof Illinois, the Northern District of California, and the Eastern District of Washington, \nissued  similar  preliminary  injunctions  prohibiting  DHS’s  enforcement  of  the  Rule \nnationwide.  See CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, No. 19-cv-2715 (D. Md.); Cook Cty. \nv. Wolf, No. 19-cv-6334 (N.D. Ill.); City and Cty. of San Francisco v. USCIS, No. 19-cv-\n4717 (N.D. Cal.); California v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-cv-4975 (N.D. Cal.); \nWashington v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-cv-5210 (E.D. Wash.).   \n4 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 5   Poaf g1e2 5 of 12\nDHS appealed the October 2019 preliminary injunctions, and a motions panel of \nthis Court denied its motion to stay the injunctions pending its appeal.  New York v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-3591, 2020 WL 95815 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2020).  While that \nappeal was pending in this Court, the Supreme Court granted DHS’s application for a stay \nof the injunction:   \n[The] October 11, 2019 orders granting a preliminary injunction are stayed \npending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit and disposition of the Government’s \npetition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought. Should the \npetition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  be  denied,  this  stay  shall  terminate \nautomatically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the \nstay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court. \n \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, --- U.S. ---, 140 S. Ct. 599, 206 L.Ed.2d 115 (2020).  \nWith the district court’s preliminary injunctions thus stayed, the Rule went into effect \nnationwide.  \n  In April 2020, the Plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to modify its stay of the \ninjunction during the pendency of the national emergency caused by the COVID-19 virus.  \nThe Supreme Court denied the request but suggested an alternative route to potential relief, \nnoting that “[t]his order does not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel considers \nappropriate.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, --- S. Ct. ---, 206 L.Ed.2d 847, 2020 \nWL 1969276, at *1 (Apr. 24, 2020).   \nThe Plaintiffs returned to the district court. Notwithstanding that the court had \nalready granted a preliminary injunction against implementation of the Rule, the merits of \nwhich were on appeal before this Court, and which had been stayed by the Supreme Court, \n5 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 6   Poaf g1e2 6 of 12\nthe Plaintiffs filed a new motion for a preliminary injunction. They argued that the COVID-\n19 pandemic dramatically increases the public harm caused by the Rule, because the Rule \ndeters non-citizens from getting tested for COVID-19 or seeking treatment, thus impeding \nefforts to prevent COVID-19’s spread, and puts the non-citizens themselves at a particular \nrisk given that they make up a significant portion of the work force in essential industries \nthat  have  continued  to  work  throughout  the  pandemic  and  been  disproportionately \nimpacted by COVID-19.  DHS opposed the motion, asserting that the district court lacked \njurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction while DHS’s appeal of the initial preliminary \ninjunction was before this Court.   \nThe district court issued a new injunction on July 29, 2020, concluding that the Rule \n“impedes public efforts . . . to stem the spread of the disease.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., No. 19-cv-7777, 2020 WL 4347264, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2020).  It \nfound that it had jurisdiction to issue another preliminary injunction despite “[o]verlapping \nlegal issues” with the prior injunction then pending on appeal before us, because of the new \nCOVID-19-related evidence and because the district court is better suited to make factual \nfindings and provide narrowly tailored relief than an appellate court.  Id. at *9.  It opined \nthat this new, nationwide preliminary injunction did not contravene the Supreme Court’s \nstay of the initial preliminary injunction, reasoning that there was “no indication that the \nSupreme Court disagreed with [its] analysis of the merits,” and that the Supreme Court’s \nstay was issued “on a significantly different factual record.”  Id.   Although the district \ncourt  concluded  that  it  had  jurisdiction  to  issue  a  new  preliminary  injunction,  it \n6 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 7   Poaf g1e2 7 of 12\nacknowledged the possibility that we might have a different opinion and explained that \n“[s]hould the Second Circuit determine that this Court does not presently have jurisdiction \nto issue this injunction and remand[ ] this case for the purpose of further considering the \nPlaintiffs’ present motion, this Court would issue a preliminary injunction based on factual \nfindings as set forth herein.”  Id. at *14. \nJust  days  later,  on  August  4,  2020,  we  ruled  on  DHS’s  appeal  of  the  initial \npreliminary injunctions entered in October 2019.  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \nSec., 969 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2020). Addressing only those preliminary injunctions, we \naffirmed the district court’s rulings in part.  We agreed with the district court that the \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Rule is arbitrary and \ncapricious, that the Plaintiffs had shown that they would suffer irreparable injury if the \nRule’s implementation was not enjoined, and that the public interest favored a preliminary \ninjunction given DHS’s acknowledgment that the Rule “will likely result in ‘[w]orse health \noutcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and malnutrition, . . . [i]ncreased \nprevalence  of  communicable  diseases,  .  .  . [i]ncreased  rates  of  poverty  and  housing \ninstability[,] and [r]educed productivity and educational attainment.’”  Id. at 87 (quoting \n83 Fed. Reg. at 51,270).  Although we therefore upheld the preliminary injunctions \nblocking the Rule, we narrowed the scope of the injunctions to the States within this Circuit \n– New York, Connecticut, and Vermont – each of which had joined in this suit and \ndemonstrated that it and its citizens would suffer irreparable injury from the Rule.  We \nnoted the skepticism of the Supreme Court toward nationwide injunctions in these very \n7 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 8   Poaf g1e2 8 of 12\ncases, see Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. at 599-601 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring in the grant of stay), and concluded that, to the extent that the issuance of such \ninjunctions would in some cases be appropriate,  the “issuance of unqualified nationwide \ninjunctions is a less desirable practice where, as here, numerous challenges to the same \nagency action are being litigated simultaneously in district and circuit courts across the \ncountry. It is not clear to us that, where contrary views could be or have been taken by \ncourts of parallel or superior authority, entitled to determine the law within their own \ngeographical jurisdictions, the court that imposes the most sweeping injunction should \ncontrol the nationwide legal landscape.” New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 \nF.3d at 88.   Thus, we found no need for a broader injunction, particularly given the \nSupreme Court’s stay, which remains in effect “not only through our disposition of the \ncase, but also through the disposition of DHS’s petition for a writ of certiorari, should DHS \nseek review of this decision.”  Id. \nDHS now appeals the district court’s second nationwide preliminary injunction.  \nCurrently before us is its motion to stay the new injunction and allow the Rule to remain \nin effect during our consideration of this new appeal.   \nDISCUSSION \nThe  factors  relevant  in  assessing  a  motion  for  a  stay  pending  appeal  are  the \napplicant’s “strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits,” irreparable injury \nto the applicant in the absence of a stay, substantial injury to the nonmoving party if a stay \nis issued, and the public interest.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The first \n8 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 9   Poaf g1e2 9 of 12\ntwo factors are the most critical, but a stay “is not a matter of right, even if irreparable \ninjury might otherwise result”; rather, a stay is “an exercise of judicial discretion,” and \n“[t]he party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an \nexercise of discretion.”  Id. at 433-34 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn our view, DHS has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits, primarily \nbecause we doubt that the district court had jurisdiction to issue the July 29 preliminary \ninjunction while the appeal of its virtually identical prior preliminary injunction was \npending before this Court. We also doubt whether the nationwide application of the \ninjunction was proper in light of the considerations we set forth in New York v. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., which was not available to the district court at the time it issued the second \ninjunction. Finally, we conclude that DHS has shown irreparable injury from the district \ncourt’s prohibition on effectuating the new regulation. \nThe filing of a “timely and sufficient notice of appeal” divests the district court of \njurisdiction “as to any matters involved in the appeal” or “as to the matters covered by the \nnotice.”  Leonhard v. U.S., 633 F.2d 599, 609-10 (2d Cir. 1980); accord Motorola Credit \nCorp. v. Uzan, 388 F.3d 39, 53-54 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing Griggs v. Provident Consumer \nDiscount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982); N.Y. State Nat’l Org. for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d \n1339, 1350 (2d Cir. 1989)).  In our view, the Supreme Court’s response to Plaintiffs’ April \n2020 motion to lift or modify the stay of the initial preliminary injunction, that its “order \ndoes not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel considers appropriate,”  Dep’t of \n9 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 1  0P aogf e1 210 of 12\nHomeland Sec. v. New York, 2020 WL 1969276, at *1, does not mean the district court was \nvested with jurisdiction. \nWe have held that “once a notice of appeal has been filed, a district court may take \nactions only ‘in aid of the appeal or to correct clerical errors.’”  Int’l Ass’n of Machinists \nand Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. E. Air Lines, Inc., 847 F. 2d 1014, 1017 (2d Cir. \n1988) (quoting Leonhard, 633 F.2d at 609-10)).  We are not persuaded by the district \ncourt’s reliance on instances where we have found district courts had jurisdiction during \nthe pendency of an appeal.  In Webb v. GAF, 78 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 1996), for example, we \ndismissed an appeal of a preliminary injunction as moot, when during the pendency of the \nappeal of the preliminary injunction, the district court decided pending post-trial motions \nin accordance with jury determinations, and made a dispositive ruling on the merits of the \ncase that rendered the injunction permanent.  See Webb, 78 F.3d at 53-56.  Webb is not \nanalogous to the instant case: There the district court proceeded with the case on the merits, \nwhich resulted in a permanent injunction that mooted the preliminary relief that was the \nsubject of the appeal; here, in contrast, the district court undertook to reconsider the very \npreliminary injunction that was under review in this Court, and simply provided new \nreasons to justify the preliminary relief itself. \nNor, in our view, does International Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, \nAFL-CIO, support the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction.  There, we held that where \nan appeal of an injunction is pending, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62 grants the district \ncourt specific authority to “suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the \n10 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 1  1P aogf e1 211 of 12\npendency of the appeal,” but that the Rule should be “narrowly interpreted to allow district \ncourts to grant only such relief as may be necessary to preserve the status quo.”  847 F.2d \nat 1018 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c)). Here, the district court did not attempt to preserve \nthe status quo. In January, the Supreme Court stayed the initial preliminary nationwide \ninjunctions in their entirety “pending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition \nfor a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, \n140 S. Ct. at 599.  The district court’s injunction thus disrupted the status quo by imposing \nan injunction where the Supreme Court had stayed the preexisting injunctions.   \nNor did our August 4, 2020, ruling on the merits of the district court’s October 2019 \npreliminary injunction retroactively cure the district court’s apparent lack of authority. See \nGriggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982) (stating that the filing of \na notice of appeal “confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court \nof its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal”).  Our ruling addressed \nthe merits of the original preliminary injunction that had been stayed by the Supreme Court. \nOur ruling affirmed the grant of preliminary relief but limited its scope.  We did not address \n– nor did the district court – the jurisdictional impact of the Supreme Court’s stay pending \na timely petition by the Government for a writ of certiorari. We did, however, modify the \ninjunction to limit its reach to the three plaintiff states that make up this Circuit. Whether \nor not the pandemic affects the balance of equities favoring preliminary relief, it is not \n11 \n\nCase 1:C1a9s-cev 2-007-2757377-G, DBoDc-uOmTeWn t   9D3o, c0u9m/1e1n/t2 201220 ,   2F9il2e9d3 0691/,1 P1a/2g0e 1  2P aogf e1 212 of 12\nobvious that the effects of the pandemic bear on the considerations that led us to modify \nthe district court’s initial injunction. \nAccordingly, we conclude that DHS has shown a likelihood of success on the merits \nbased primarily on the district court’s apparent lack of jurisdiction to issue the preliminary \ninjunction during the appeal of its prior, virtually identical injunction (coupled with DHS’s \nshowing of irreparable harm resulting from its inability to enforce its regulation). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED that the district court’s July 29, 2020 \ngrant of a preliminary injunction is STAYED pending further order of this Court. The \nmerits of this appeal will be considered by another panel of this Court. The views expressed \nherein on the question whether the district court had jurisdiction to enter the order appealed \nfrom and on the nationwide scope of the injunction are intended solely as informing our \nassessment of whether the moving party demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits \nand are not intended to bind the merits panel on that question.  \n12 ",

DANIELS, United States District Judge: \nPlaintiffs the State of New York, the City of New York, the State of Connecticut, and the \nState of Vermont commenced this action against Defendants the United States Department of \nHomeland Security (\"DHS\"), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), \nSecretary Kevin K.  McAleenan, Director Kenneth T.  Cuccinelli II,  and the United States of \n' \nAmerica, challenging Defendants' promulgation, implementation, and enforcement of a rule titled \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified at \n8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, 248) (the \"Rule\").  (Compl. for Declaratory and Injunctive \nRelief,  ECF  No.  17.)  Shortly  after bringing this  action,  Plaintiffs  moved  for  a preliminary \ninjunction enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing the Rule, and for a stay of the \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 122   Filed 12/02/19   Page 2 of 6\neffective date of the Rule, which was scheduled to go into effect on October 15,2019. (Pls.' Notice \nof Mot., ECF No.  33.)  This Court granted Plaintiffs' motion on October 11, 2019.1  (Mem. \nDecision and Order, ECF No. 11 0; see also Order Granting Pls.' Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., ECF No. \n109.)  Specifically, this Court issued a nationwide injunction, as well as a stay postponing the \neffective date of the Rule pending adjudication on the merits or further order of the Court.  (Mem. \nDecision and Order at 24.)  Defendants now move to stay this Court's preliminary injunction \npending resolution of Defendants' appeal of this Court's October 11, 2019 order.  (Mot. for Stay \noflnj. Pending Appeal, ECF No. 111.) \nIn assessing  whether to  grant a  stay  pending  appeal,  a  court considers  four  factors: \n(1) whether the moving party has made a strong showing of its likelihood of success on the merits, \n(2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay, (3) whether the issuance \nof a stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding, and (4 ) where the \npublic interest lies.  Nken v.  Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  \"There is substantial overlap \nbetween these and the factors governing preliminary injunctions[.]\" !d. (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. \nDef Council,  Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)).  \"A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable \ninjury might otherwise result,\" and \"is instead 'an exercise of judicial discretion.\"'  Id.  at 433 \n(citations omitted).  The party seeking a stay bears the \"difficult burden\" of demonstrating that a \nstay is necessary.  Floyd v. City ofN  ew York, 959 F. Supp. 2d 691, 693 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting \nUnited States v.  Private Sanitation Indus. Ass 'n of Nassau/Suffolk, Inc., 44 F .3d 1082, 1084 (2d \nCir. 1995)). \n1 Also on that day, this Court granted the same preliminary injunction and stay in a related action, Make the \nRoad New Yorkv. Cuccinelli, No. 19 Civ. 7993 (GBD), 2019 WL 5484638 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019). \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 122   Filed 12/02/19   Page 3 of 6\nDefendants argue that they are likely to  succeed on the merits of their appeal.  They \nreallege, as an initial matter, that Plaintiffs fall outside of the zone of interests regulated by the \nRule,  and  that  Plaintiffs  lack  standing  because  their  only  possible  injuries  are  speculative \ndownstream effects of the independent decisions ofthird parties.  (Mem. ofLaw in Supp. ofDefs.' \nMotion for Stay of Inj. Pending Appeal (\"Defs.' Mem.\"), ECF No. 112, at 2-3.)  As to the merits, \nDefendants insist that the new definition of\"public charge\" set forth in the Rule simply implements \nthe U.S.  immigration law principle of self-sufficiency, and therefore falls within Defendants' \ndelegated interpretive authority.  (!d. at 3-4.) They further argue that this Court \"erred in holding \nthat the Rule is arbitrary and capricious based on the Court's view that there was no rational \nrelationship between self-sufficiency and receipt of public benefits.\"  (!d.  at 5.)  In particular, \nDefendants contend that the Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999) (the \"Field Guidance\")-which establishes the \ncurrent framework for determining whether a noncitizen is likely to become a public charge \nalready \"tie[ s] the definition of public charge to the receipt of public benefits.\"  (!d.) \nDefendants  assert  that  the  remaining  factors  justifying  a  stay  are  also  satisfied. \nSpecifically, Defendants contend that the government and public will suffer irreparable harm \nabsent a stay because DHS will be required to grant lawful permanent residence to noncitizens \nwho are not public charges under the Field Guidance but who would be considered public charges \nunder the new Rule. (!d. at 6-7.) According to Defendants, DHS \"currently has no practical means \nof revisiting these determinations\" ifthis Court's injunction is later vacated.  (!d. at 7.) Moreover, \nbecause these noncitizens are \"likely\" to receive public benefits, the injunction will \"inevitably\" \nresult in additional government expenditures.  (!d.)  Defendants further argue that the Rule's \n\"future effectiveness is reduced\" because \"any public benefits received by aliens submitting status \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 122   Filed 12/02/19   Page 4 of 6\nadjustment applications before the Rule takes effect will be counted only if they would have been \ncovered by the ... Field Guidance.\"  (!d.)  Defendants' other alleged injuries include \"significant \nadministrative burdens,\" such as those associated with delaying training on how to implement the \nRule.  (!d.)  Meanwhile, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs will suffer no irreparable harm if a stay \nis issued during the pendency of an appeal.  (!d. at 8.)  Defendants argue that this Court should, at \nminimum, issue a stay limiting the scope of its injunction to Plaintiff states.  (!d.) \nThese arguments are without merit.  Indeed, Defendants' instant motion largely reiterates \nthe same arguments made in their opposition to Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction and \nstay-all of which this Court rejected.2  Critically, Defendants have yet to provide a reasonable \nexplanation for redefining \"public charge\" as someone \"who receives one or more public benefits \n... for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period.\"  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501. \nAs previously noted by this Court, \"public charge\" has never been interpreted as someone who \nreceives 12 months of benefits within a 36-month period; there is zero precedent supporting this \ndefinition; and there is no indication that Congress expressed any desire to redefine the term, let \nalone in this manner.  Additionally, Defendants'  attempt to  analogize the Rule to  the Field \nGuidance ignores the key distinction that the Field Guidance drew between cash assistance and \nlong-term institutionalization on the one hand, and supplemental, non-cash benefits on the other. \n2 In fact, every single court that has considered the Rule has rejected Defendants' argument that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits and has accordingly issued an injunction.  See Casa de Md., Inc. v.  Trump, \nNo.  19 Civ. 2715 (PWG), 2019 WL 5190689, at *18-19 (D. Md. Oct. 14, 2019) (granting nationwide \ninjunction and stay of effective date of Rule); Cook Cty.  v.

Oct. 11, 20 19) (granting nationwide injunction and stay of effective date of Rule). \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 122   Filed 12/02/19   Page 5 of 6\nThe Field Guidance expressly states that \"participation in ... noncash programs is not evidence of \npoverty or dependence.\"  64 Fed.  Reg.  at 28,692.  It further notes that \"by focusing on cash \nassistance  for  income  maintenance,  the  [government]  can  identify those  who  are  primarily \ndependent on the government for subsistence without inhibiting access to non-cash benefits that \nserve important public interests\" and that eligible noncitizens are \"legally entitled to receive.\"  /d. \nDefendants  also  fail  to  adequately  demonstrate  what  irreparable  injuries  the  federal \ngovernment agencies will suffer in the absence of a stay, or how any such alleged injuries outweigh \nthose that Plaintiffs and the public have demonstrated that they will suffer in the absence of an \ninjunction.  First, the injunction merely maintains the status quo and the public charge framework \nthat has been in place, with Congress's endorsement, for decades.  Defendants seek to upend the \nstatus quo without identifying any rational justification or urgent need for doing so.  Nor do \nDefendants provide any plausible basis for their claims that the Rule's \"future effectiveness is \nreduced\" with every day that the injunction stays in place, or that they will endure \"significant \nadministrative burdens.\"  (See Defs.' Mem. at 7.)  In contrast, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that \nthey  will  suffer  immediate  and  irreparable  injuries,  including  proprietary,  economic,  and \nprogrammatic harms, if the injunction is stayed.  (Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Motion for Stay of Inj. \nPending Appeal, ECF No.  117, at 2-3.)  Moreover, because the Rule would deter law-abiding \nimmigrants  from  receiving  available  benefits  to  which  they  are  legally  entitled,  it  would \nundoubtedly make both these immigrants and the public at large more vulnerable to health and \neconomic instability.  (See id.)  In addition, denial of permanent resident status and deportation are \nthe expected results of the immediate implementation of the new Rule. \nIn short, to stay the injunction would be inconsistent with this Court's underlying findings \nof Plaintiffs'  likelihood of success on the merits, and of the irreparable injury that Plaintiffs, \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 122   Filed 12/02/19   Page 6 of 6\nnoncitizens,  and the  general  public  would suffer in the  absence  of an effective  injunction.3 \nAccordingly, Defendants' motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, (ECF \nNo. 111), is DENIED. \nDated: New York, New York \nDecember 2, 2019 \nSO ORDERED. \ne.Y~ \ntes District Judge \n3 Defendants' cursory argument that this Court should, at minimum, limit the scope of its nationwide \ninjunction is unavailing.  They claim that the nationwide scope renders other decisions about the Rule \n\"academic,\" pointing to two  decisions in which two  other district courts  limited  the scope  of their \ninjunctions to particular jurisdictions.  (Defs.' Mem. at 8.)  However, Defendants conveniently ignore that \nthe remaining two district courts to consider the Rule issued a nationwide injunction, similarly to this Court. \nSee Casa de Md., Inc. v. Trump, No. 19 Civ. 2715 (PWG), 2019 WL 5190689, at* 18-19 (D. Md. Oct. 14, \n2019) (granting nationwide injunction); Washington v.  U.S.  Dep't of Homeland Sec., No. 19 Civ. 5210 \n(RMP), 2019 WL 5100717, at *23 (E.D. Wash. Oct. 11, 2019) (same).  Continued consistent application \nof the existing immigration laws is the least injurious to those who would be most adversely affected by the \nRule's hasty and piecemeal application. \n6 ",

Wolf, \nActing Secretary of DHS; and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, Senior Official Performing the Duties \nof the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—seek a \nstay of an order issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York \n(Daniels, J.) preliminarily postponing the effective date and enjoining enforcement of a Final \nRule by DHS. The Rule radically alters the test for evaluating whether an immigrant is likely \nto become a “public charge” under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A), and thus be ineligible for a green \ncard. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019). The \nRule’s vast expansion of “public charge”—to include employed individuals who receive any \namount of certain means-tested benefits for even brief periods of time—is a stark departure from \na more-than-century-long consensus that has limited the term to individuals who are primarily \ndependent on the government for long-term subsistence.  \nThere is no basis for the truly extraordinary stay that defendants seek. The fundamental \npurpose of a stay is to preserve the status quo, but the relief that defendants seek here would \ndo the opposite. A stay of the district court’s order would allow defendants to immediately \nimplement the Final Rule’s unprecedented change to the meaning of “public charge”—one \nthat has never been applied since that statutory term first came into use in the nineteenth \ncentury. But defendants have identified no reason whatsoever for such precipitous action. \nUnlike in other cases, defendants have not claimed that a stay is needed for public safety, \nnational security, or military effectiveness, let alone an emergency touching on any of these \nareas of concern. There are no imminent discovery obligations or statutory deadlines that \ndefendants must meet. It is undisputed that the current public-charge framework is lawful, even \n\nif defendants would prefer to change it. And four courts of appeals, including the Second \nCircuit, have agreed to expedite defendants’ appeals of various district court orders about the \nFinal Rule and will be ready to issue decisions on the merits within only a month or two. There \nis thus no compelling reason for this Court to intervene now, before the lower courts can \ncomplete their expedited merits review, and disrupt the status quo by endorsing the immediate \nimplementation of the novel Final Rule.  \nBy contrast, granting a stay here would inject confusion and uncertainty into immigration \ndecisions and plaintiffs’ administration of their public-benefits programs, and deter potentially \nmillions of noncitizens residing in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions from accessing public benefits that \nthey are legally entitled to obtain. Plaintiffs presented extensive, concrete evidence below of \nthe harms that would follow from the Final Rule’s significant changes to the public-charge \nframework. Defendants presented no evidence whatsoever to rebut this showing. The radical \ndisruption of the status quo and the serious harms that the Rule would cause to plaintiffs and \nthe public are enough to deny defendants’ motion for a stay.   \nDefendants have also failed to satisfy the remaining stay factors. A stay is not warranted \nunless there is a reasonable probability that this Court will grant certiorari. But that inquiry is \nentirely premature here, when no appellate court has yet decided whether to affirm the \npreliminary relief issued by various district courts, and when defendants have not sought this \nCourt’s direct review of the district court’s decision by means of a petition for certiorari before \njudgment. Defendants assert that this Court would grant certiorari in this case if four courts of \nappeals were to rule a certain way and if defendants were then to seek certiorari, but that \nassertion depends on rank speculation about the future actions of not only the four courts of \nappeals but also this Court. \n2 \n\nEven if this Court were to assume that it will eventually grant certiorari in this case, \ndefendants’ request for a stay would fail because they have not met their burden of showing that \nthey would be likely to succeed on the merits. The Final Rule’s unprecedented redefinition of \n“public charge” violates the law because it vastly exceeds the long-established understanding of \nthat term, contrary to Congress’s intent to incorporate this consensus understanding into federal \nimmigration law. And the Rule’s novel multifactor test for assessing whether an immigrant \nwill likely be a public charge is arbitrary and capricious for multiple reasons, including its \narbitrary targeting of even temporary use of benefits and its reliance on multiple factors that \nhave no rational connection to whether an immigrant will receive public benefits at all, let \nalone become primarily dependent on the government. \nFinally, the scope of the preliminary relief ordered below provides no basis for a partial \nstay. The district court postponed the effective date of the Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705, a \nstatutory remedy authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that, by its plain \nterms, allows district courts to delay the effect of a rule as a whole. This case thus does not \nrequire this Court to address any general question about the scope of district courts’ power to \ngrant nationwide equitable relief, although defendants’ arguments on that score are meritless \nin any event. Defendants’ motion should thus be denied.  \n   \n3 \n\nSTATEMENT \nA.  The Public-Charge Statute  \nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), noncitizens who lawfully entered \nthe country may adjust their status to legal permanent resident (LPR) if they are “admissible.” \n8  U.S.C.  § 1255(a).  One  of  the  narrow  categories  that  would  render  such  a  noncitizen \ninadmissible is if he is “likely at any time to become a public charge.” Id. § 1182(a)(4). DHS \nmakes public-charge determinations principally for noncitizens who have lawfully entered the \ncountry and are thus already living here.1 Id. § 1185(d).  \n“Public charge” under federal immigration law is a term of art that has developed a \nsettled meaning after more than a century of usage. “Public charge” has never included \nemployed persons who receive modest or temporary amounts of government benefits designed \nto promote health or upward mobility—individuals now covered by the Final Rule. Instead, \nfrom its inception, the term “public charge” has been limited to an individual who does not \nwork and is consequently primarily dependent on the government for long-term subsistence.  \nThis understanding of “public charge” appeared as early as nineteenth-century state \nlaws that required ship captains to execute bonds to support infirm passengers “likely to \nbecome permanently a public charge.” Ch. 195, § 3, 1847 N.Y. Laws 182, 184; see Ch. 238, \n                                                \n1 The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), a component of the United States \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ), made public-charge determinations for applicants living in the \ncountry until March 2003, when its authority was delegated to the USCIS, a component of DHS. \nTwo other agencies also apply the public charge statute. Individuals seeking to obtain an immigrant \nvisa must satisfy the Department of State’s separate public-charge inquiry, which is conducted \nabroad by consular officers. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4), 1201(a). And DOJ is authorized to conduct \nanother public-charge inquiry to deport an already admitted LPR who actually becomes a “public \ncharge” within five years of entry from causes that did not arise after entry. Id. § 1227(a)(5). \n4 \n\n§ 21, 1837 Mass. Acts 270-71. In these statutes, “public charge” referred to “persons utterly unable \nto maintain themselves,” Friedrich Kapp, Immigration, and the Commissioners of Emigration \nof the State of New York 87 (1870). It did not refer to “able-bodied and industrious” immigrants \nwho merely lacked wealth or might receive modest assistance. See Report of the Commissioners \nof Alien Passengers and Foreign Paupers, Mass. S. Doc. No. 14, at 17 (1852). States allowed \nsuch employable immigrants to land without any bond, and instead collected a per-immigrant \ntax that was often used in part to help immigrants find transportation and work. See Annual \nReports of the Commissioners of Emigration of the State of New York 135 (1861). \nIn 1882, Congress incorporated this narrow meaning of “public charge” into federal \nlaw. Following prior state laws, Congress prohibited any “lunatic, idiot, or any person unable \nto take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge” from entering the country. \nImmigration Act of 1882, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214, 214 (1882). “Public charge” thus adhered \nto its already settled meaning to refer to the fraction of immigrants likely to “become life-long \ndependents on our public charities.” 13 Cong. Rec. 5109 (1882) (Rep. Van Voorhis). Congress \ndid not exclude immigrants who received any public benefits. Rather, in the same statute that \nincorporated the “public charge” concept into federal law, Congress also directed the collection \nof a per-person tax “for the support and relief” of immigrants who “may fall into distress or \nneed public aid.” 1882 Act §§ 1-2, 22 Stat. at 214. Like the prior state taxes, these funds were \nused in part “for protecting and caring for” immigrants “until they can proceed to other places \nor obtain occupation for their support.” See 13 Cong. Rec. 5106 (1882) (Rep. Reagan).  \n5 \n\nFrom 1891 to 1951, Congress reenacted public-charge provisions substantially similar \nto the one in the 1882 Act.2 Throughout this time, the scope of “public charge” remained \nlimited to individuals likely to rely almost entirely on government support to survive. See \nGegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915); Howe v. United States, 247 F. 292 (2d Cir. 1917). \n“Public charge” did not include an immigrant “able to earn her own living,” Ex parte Mitchell, \n256 F. 229, 230 (N.D.N.Y. 1919), even if he received minor public assistance. \nAgainst this background of nearly a century of statutory and regulatory usage of the \nterm “public charge,” Congress enacted the INA’s public-charge provision in 1952. Congress \ndeclined to enact a new definition of “public charge,” thus incorporating that term’s well-\nestablished meaning into the INA. Federal immigration authorities adhered to this understanding, \nrepeatedly confirming that “public charge” refers narrowly to immigrants who are “incapable \nof earning a livelihood” to sustain themselves, In re Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 589 \n(B.I.A. 1974), and does not include employable immigrants who might receive modest amounts \nof public assistance, see In re Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. 409, 421-22 (A.G. 1962) \n(“public charge” does not include “healthy person” in “prime of life”); In re Perez, 15 I. & N. \nDec. 136, 137 (B.I.A. 1974). \nIn 1996, Congress amended the public charge statute to require DHS to consider certain \nfactors in making public-charge determinations, specifically, an immigrant’s age; health; \nfamily status; financial resources; and “education and skills.” Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-674. \n                                                \n2 See Immigration Act of 1891, ch. 551, § 1, 26 Stat. 1084, 1084; Immigration Act of 1907, \nch. 1134, § 2, 34 Stat. 898, 898-99; Immigration Act of 1917, ch. 29 § 3, 39 Stat. 874, 876. \n6 \n\nBut Congress did not alter the established meaning of “public charge.” To the contrary, \nCongress rejected a proposal that would have transformed the meaning of “public charge” in \nthe deportation context to mean an immigrant’s receipt of any amount of public benefits within \na short time period. H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 138, 241 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). \nSeparately, in 1996, Congress enacted a complex set of statutory provisions directed at \nthe use of specific public benefits by specific categories of noncitizens after they had already \nentered the country or been admitted as LPRs. To satisfy a declared “national policy with \nrespect to welfare and immigration” under which “aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend \non public resources to meet their needs,” 8 U.S.C. § 1601(2)(A), the 1996 provisions and \nsubsequent amendments generally limited LPRs from using Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP) benefits until they had lived here for five years. Id. §§ 1612(a)(2)(L), \n1613(a). Additional limits on Medicaid and SNAP use apply to LPRs who have sponsors, until \nthe sponsored immigrant has worked a certain amount or become a citizen. See id. §§ 1183a(a)(2), \n1631(b). (No similar restrictions ultimately applied to LPRs’ use of Section 8 housing benefits, \nmany other federal means-tested benefits, or a wide array of federal public benefits that are not \nmeans tested.3 See id. §§ 1611(a), (c); 1641(b)(1).) Congress explained that these limitations on \n                                                \n3 Congress did not define the term “federal means-tested public benefit” for purposes of \nits benefits-use provisions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1613(a); 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1. The benefit-administering \nagencies have determined that the only federal means-tested public benefits for purposes of the \nWelfare Reform Act are Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, Medicaid, and SNAP. PRWORA: Federal Means-Tested Public Benefits Paid by the \nSocial Security Administration, 62 Fed. Reg. 45,284, 45,284-85 (Aug. 26, 1997); PRWORA: \nInterpretation of “Federal Means-Tested Public Benefit,” 62 Fed. Reg. 45,256, 42,257 (Aug. \n26, 1997); Food Stamp Program: Noncitizen Eligibility, and Certification Provisions, 65 Fed. \nReg. 10,856, 10,876 (Feb. 29, 2000). Certain statutory limits also apply to social services block \ngrants. 8 U.S.C. § 1612(3)(b)(3)(B). \n7 \n\naccessing  benefits  promoted  “self-sufficiency”  and  prevented  “the  availability  of  public \nbenefits” from incentivizing immigration. Id. § 1601(3), (6). Again, however, Congress did not \namend the definition of “public charge” in the 1996 amendments or thereafter.  \nIn 1999, DHS’s predecessor agency (the Immigration and Naturalization Service) issued \nguidance confirming that the 1996 amendments had not altered the long-settled meaning of \n“public charge.” Consistent with over a century of usage, the guidance explained that “public \ncharge” refers only to individuals “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence,” \nas evidenced by publicly funded long-term institutionalization or cash assistance for income \nmaintenance. Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, \n64 Fed. Reg. 28,689, 28,689 (Mar. 26, 1999). The Guidance prohibited consideration of \nsupplemental benefits—such as food stamps, Medicaid, and Section 8 housing—in rendering \npublic-charge determinations because, as the benefit-granting agencies had explained, such \nbenefits are often available to employed individuals “with incomes far above the poverty level” \nand thus reflect Congress’s “broad public policy decisions” about improving public health and \nupward mobility. Id. at 28,692. \nB.  The Final Rule  \nIn August 2019, DHS issued the Final Rule challenged here. The Rule radically alters \nthe meaning of “public charge” to include, for the first time, an immigrant likely to receive \nany amount of “public benefit[s],” defined to include certain supplemental benefits such as \nSection 8 housing assistance, Medicaid, and SNAP benefits. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501. The Rule \ndeems an immigrant to be a “public charge” based on short-term receipt of such benefits: a \nDHS official need merely believe that an immigrant “will receive[] one or more public \n8 \n\nbenefits” during “more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period” during \nhis life. Id. The Rule separately considers the time period for each benefit an immigrant may \nreceive, so that, for example, “receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months.” Id.  \nThe Rule sets forth weighted factors that DHS officials must consider to predict whether \nan applicant is likely to receive an aggregate of 12 months of benefits within any 36-month \nperiod during his entire life. Actual receipt of enumerated benefits is a heavily weighted factor \ncounted against an applicant. Id. at 41,504. The Rule also lists several other negative factors \nthat support a “public charge” finding, including, low credit scores; lack of English-language \nskills;  merely  applying  for  public  benefits;  or  having  a  medical  condition  that  requires \nextensive treatment or  interferes  with work  or school,  regardless  of whether reasonable \naccommodations enable the applicant to work or learn.       \nHeavily weighted positive factors include having household income or assets of at least \n250% of the federal poverty guidelines, and having private health insurance not funded with \ntax subsidies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Id. at 41,502-04.  \nC.  Procedural Background \nPlaintiffs challenged the Final Rule under the APA, alleging, among other things, that \nthe Rule was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.  \n1.  The district court’s order of preliminary relief \nIn October 2019, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion to stay the Rule’s effective \ndate pending judicial review, see 5 U.S.C. § 705, and for a preliminary injunction. The court \nconcluded  that  plaintiffs  and  the  public  will  suffer  concrete,  irreparable  harm  absent \n9 \n\npreliminary relief; by contrast, the court found that defendants will not suffer any irreparable \nharm from maintaining the long-existing status quo for a short time. (App. 19a-21a.) On the \nmerits, the court concluded that the Final Rule’s transformation of “public charge” to include \neven temporary receipt of any amounts of supplemental benefits was likely contrary to the \nINA, and arbitrary and capricious. (App. 11a-18a.)  \n2.  Defendants’ expedited appeal \nOn October 30, defendants filed an interlocutory appeal from the order of preliminary \nrelief. The Second Circuit granted defendants’ request to expedite the appeal and set the \naccelerated briefing schedule that defendants had proposed: defendants filed their opening \nbrief on December 13; plaintiffs’ opposition brief is due on January 24; and defendants’ reply \nbrief is due on February 14. The Second Circuit has proposed holding oral argument on \ndefendants’ appeal during the week of March 2. Notification, No. 19-3591 (Jan. 8, 2020), ECF \nNo. 164. \n3.  The lower courts’ denials of a stay pending appeal \nThe district court denied defendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal. The court \nconcluded that defendants did not have “any rational justification or urgent need” to upend the \nstatus quo that had governed public-charge determinations for at least two decades. (App. 56a.) \nBy contrast, the court explained, a stay would cause immediate and irreparable injuries to \nplaintiffs and the public, including by injecting uncertainty into LPR-status applications and \ndeterring “law-abiding immigrants from receiving available benefits to which they are legally \n10 \n\nentitled.”  (App. 56a.) Moreover,  the court  concluded,  defendants  did not have a strong \nlikelihood of success on appeal. (App. 55a-56a.) \nThe Second Circuit subsequently denied defendants’ request to that court for a stay \npending appeal or a partial stay limiting the scope of the district court’s preliminary relief.  The \ncourt emphasized that the extraordinary relief of a stay was not warranted given that defendants’ \nappeal had been expedited and oral argument “will be scheduled promptly” after February 14. \n(App. 65a.) On defendants’ objections to the scope of the district court’s preliminary relief, \nthe Second Circuit observed that, “[a]s always, the merits panel . . . has full authority to \nconsider the scope of the existing injunction.” (App. 65a.) \n4.  Pending appeals in other courts of appeals \nDifferent plaintiffs separately challenged the Rule in four other district courts. Each of \nthose  courts  issued  orders  preliminarily  postponing  the  effective  date  of  the  Rule  or \npreliminarily enjoining its implementation. See Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, 2019 WL \n5190689 (D. Md. Oct. 14, 2019); Cook County v. McAleenan, 2019 WL 5110267 (N.D. Ill. \nOct. 14, 2019); Washington v. DHS, 2019 WL 5100717 (E.D. Wa. Oct. 11, 2019); City & County \nof San Francisco v. USCIS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057 (N.D. Cal. 2019). Defendants have appealed \nthese rulings to the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits, respectively.  \nDefendants sought to stay each district court order pending appeal. On December 23, \nthe Seventh Circuit declined to issue a stay. Order, Cook County v. Wolf, No. 19-3169, ECF \nNo. 41. Defendants have not sought from this Court any stay of the Illinois district court’s \norder pending the Seventh Circuit’s review of the merits of defendants’ appeal.  \n11 \n\nThe Fourth Circuit, over a dissent, stayed the order issued by the Maryland district \ncourt, and the Ninth Circuit, over a dissent, stayed the orders issued by the district courts in \nCalifornia and Washington. Order, Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, No. 19-2222 (Dec. 9, \n2019), ECF No. 21; Order, City & County of San Francisco v. USCIS, No. 19-17213 (Dec. 5, \n2020), ECF No. 27.  \nNo court of appeals has yet issued any decision on the merits of any of defendants’ appeals. \nEach court is proceeding on an accelerated briefing schedule, with briefing to be completed in \nall cases by February 14. The Seventh Circuit has scheduled oral argument on February 26. \nArgument Notice, No. 19-3169 (Jan. 9, 2020), ECF No. 44. The Second Circuit, as noted, has \nproposed oral argument for the week of March 2. And the Fourth Circuit has tentatively scheduled \noral argument for the week of March 17. Tentative Calendar Order, No. 19-2222 (Dec. 19, 2019), \nECF No. 26. As of the date of this brief, the Ninth Circuit had not yet scheduled oral argument.  \nARGUMENT \nTHE COURT SHOULD DENY DEFENDANTS’ REQUEST FOR A STAY PENDING \nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S IMMINENT REVIEW OF DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL \nBecause a stay intrudes on “the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review,” \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009) (quotation marks omitted), defendants bear the \n“heavy burden” of justifying such “extraordinary” and disruptive relief, see Whalen v. Roe, \n423 U.S. 1313, 1316 (1975) (Marshall, J., in chambers). Defendants have “an especially heavy \nburden” here given the truly exceptional nature of their request: they ask this Court to intervene \nnow to stay the district court’s order of preliminary relief, even though their already expedited \nappeal from that order “is pending before” the Second Circuit; three other courts of appeals \n12 \n\nare considering defendants’ expedited appeals from similar orders issued by other district courts; \nand all four of the courts of appeals will likely issue decisions on the merits in a matter of \nmonths. Packwood v. Senate Select Comm. on Ethics, 510 U.S. 1319, 1320 (1994) (Rehnquist, \nC.J., in chambers).  \nThere is no basis for such extraordinary intervention by this Court. Defendants have \nnot even attempted to identify any urgent need to radically disrupt the status quo that has \nlawfully governed public-charge determinations for over a century. Instead, they rely on \nnothing more than their bare desire to implement a new policy in this area. But that interest—\nwhich is present in every case where the government has adopted a new policy—is not enough \nfor this Court to exercise its extraordinary powers and effectively endorse a controversial \nexpansion of “public charge” before the lower courts can fully consider defendants’ expedited \nappeals. By contrast, plaintiffs and the public will suffer severe and irreparable harms if this \nCourt were to issue a stay that would allow the Final Rule to come into effect immediately. \nThe balance of the equities alone thus requires the denial of a stay. See Trump v. International \nRefugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (per curiam). \nGiven the preliminary posture of this case, and the three other cases currently pending in \nthe courts of appeals, there is also no reasonable basis to assess whether this Court will ultimately \ngrant certiorari. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010). Indeed, defendants \nhave not sought certiorari here, and there is no plausible basis to guess how the Second Circuit \nwill rule, whether the issues raised in that ruling (which may include threshold issues, the merits, \nor the scope of relief) will warrant further review, or whether the Second Circuit’s ruling will \nconflict with the decision of any other court of appeals. Finally, even if it were possible to \n13 \n\ndetermine whether certiorari would eventually be granted, defendants have failed to meet their \nburden of showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of such an appeal.  \nA.  The Balance of Hardships and the Public Interest Weigh Decisively Against \nDefendants’ Request for a Stay That Would Upend the Status Quo for No \nGood Reason. \n1.  Defendants have identified no urgent reason for a stay that would \ndisrupt rather than preserve the status quo. \nThe fundamental purpose of a stay is to preserve the status quo. See Nken, 556 U.S. at \n429. But the stay requested here would do the opposite by allowing the immediate implementation \nof a Final Rule that would radically disrupt over a century of settled immigration policy and \npublic-benefits programs. Faced with that disruption, defendants have identified no compelling \nreason, let alone a time-sensitive one, to implement the Rule immediately: not public safety, \nnot national security, and not foreign policy. Defendants instead claim that they are entitled to \na stay merely because they want to implement their chosen policy. But that interest cannot by \nitself  justify  this  Court’s  extraordinary  intervention—particularly  when  defendants  have \nconceded that the status quo public-charge framework is both lawful and administrable. The \nCourt should deny the motion on these grounds alone.  \nAs the district court explained, the Rule will upend the status quo that has governed \npublic-charge determinations for over a century by adopting a new definition of “public charge” \nand a novel multifactor methodology. (App. 21a, 62a.) Unlike in other cases in which the \nfederal government has recently sought stays from this Court, defendants here provide no reason \nto effect these radical changes immediately, before the Second Circuit and three other courts \nof appeals can adjudicate their expedited appeals. For example, in contrast to other recent \n14 \n\nimmigration matters, defendants do not claim that a stay is needed to allow the federal \ngovernment to address any pressing concerns related to national security, foreign relations, or \nlaw enforcement. See Application for a Stay Pending Appeal 4, Barr v. East Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant, No. 19A230 (U.S. Aug. 26, 2019) (“crisis at the southern border”); Application for a \nStay Pending Appeal 2, Trump v. Sierra Club, No. 19A60 (U.S. July 12, 2019) (“combatting the \nenormous flow of illegal narcotics”); Application for a Stay Pending Appeal 25, Trump v. Hawaii, \nNo. 17A550 (U.S. Nov. 20, 2017) (“foreign-policy, national-security, and counterterrorism \nobjectives”). Nor do defendants identify any other urgent concern that might warrant precipitous \naction, such as “a risk to military effectiveness and lethality,” Application for a Stay in the \nAlternative to a Writ of Certiorari Before Judgment 2, Trump v. Karnoski, No. 18A625 (U.S. \nDec. 13, 2018); or any practical or statutory deadlines, see Application, Sierra Club, supra, at \n35-38 (contracting and funding deadlines). \nDefendants’ silence is unsurprising because no urgent need for a stay exists. There is \nno dispute that the status quo public-charge framework is lawful and administrable. There is \nno deadline, let alone an important or imminent one, that DHS might fail to meet absent a stay. \nAnd DHS displayed no urgency in promulgating this Final Rule, taking over two years under \nthe current administration to finalize it. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,292; cf. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto \nCo., 463 U.S. 1315, 1317-18 (1983) (Blackmun, J., in chambers) (stay applicants’ “failure to \nact with greater dispatch tends to blunt [their] claim of urgency”). It thus beggars belief that \ndefendants (or the public) would be harmed—let alone irreparably so—by extending for the \nfew months of defendants’ underlying appeal the public-charge framework that has been in \nplace for over a century since Congress’s initial enactment; for two decades since the 1999 \nGuidance; and for the first three years of the current administration. \n15 \n\nWithout any urgent need to support their motion, defendants claim that they are \nnonetheless entitled to a stay solely because of their desire to “implement[] [their] chosen \npolicy” (Mot. 4). But that interest cannot plausibly justify a stay because it will be present in \nevery case where the government seeks to implement a new policy. Granting a stay under these \ncircumstances would transform this Court’s intervention in pending litigation from a “rare and \nexceptional” occurrence into a routine one. See Fargo Women’s Health Org. v. Schafer, 507 \nU.S. 1013, 1014 (1993) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  \nNor is it sufficient that, under the status quo, defendants will grant LPR status to some \nimmigrants who would otherwise be excluded by the Final Rule. (Mot. 4.) Because defendants \nare unlikely to succeed on the merits, the public interest weighs against allowing them to \nimplement a policy of dubious legality. See League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 \nF.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (government lacks any cognizable “interest in the perpetuation of \nunlawful agency action”). Moreover, although DHS may not revoke LPR status once granted \n(Mot. 5), DOJ retains authority to deport a LPR who actually becomes a “public charge” within \nfive years of admission from causes that did not arise after admission. Id. § 1227(a)(5). The \nlack of any need to implement the Rule now warrants denial of a stay. See International \nRefugee, 137 S. Ct. at 2087; Ruckelshaus, 463 U.S. at 1317.  \n   \n16 \n\n2.  Disrupting the status quo would wreak havoc on public-charge \ndeterminations and public-benefits administration and seriously \ninjure plaintiffs and the public.  \nBy contrast, allowing the Rule to take effect immediately will inject severe confusion \nand  uncertainty  into  immigration  proceedings  and  public-benefits  administration,  cause \nwidespread disenrollment from public benefits, undermine the healthcare systems operated by \nplaintiffs, and harm public health. Such chaos is especially unwarranted here because the courts \nof appeals and this Court may ultimately agree that the Final Rule must be vacated as either \nunlawful or arbitrary and capricious—thus subjecting the public-charge framework to massive, \nshort-term fluctuations for no reason at all. The balance of the equities thus tilts decisively \nagainst a stay. \nImplementing the Rule’s radical new definition of public charge and its novel and \ncomplex multifactor test will upset the administration of adjustment-of-status decisions issued \nby both DHS officers and immigration courts during removal proceedings. In place of familiar \nfactors  that  have  dictated  public-charge  determinations  for  over  a  century—such  as  an \napplicant’s likely ability to work, use of long-term institutional care, or receipt of income \nmaintenance—the Rule imposes a welter of new and differently weighted factors without \nproviding any concrete guidance on how DHS officers will actually evaluate many of these \nfactors. For example, the Rule requires officers to weigh negatively an applicant’s low English \nproficiency,  but  provides  no  parameters  for  how  an  officer  should  evaluate  applicants’ \nlanguage skills or determine whether a particular skill-level warrants a positive or negative \nmark. The Rule is similarly unclear about how an officer should determine the weight to give \nto each particular factor, or about how an officer should ultimately determine whether positive \nfactors outweigh negative ones. Indeed, in the district court, defendants were unable to explain \n17 \n\n“how the new framework would operate” in practice or “to provide an example of the ‘typical \nperson’ that Defendants could predict is going to receive 12 months of benefits in a 36-month \nperiod.”  (App.  16a.)  The  confusion  and  uncertainty  that  will  inevitably  follow  from \nimplementing  this  untested  public-charge  framework  counsels  strongly  against  allowing \ndefendants to implement that framework immediately, particularly when defendants have not \nidentified any problems from continuing the status quo pending appeal.  \nA stay would also disrupt plaintiffs’ administration of their public-benefit programs. \nAs extensive and unrebutted evidence here established, immediate implementation of the Rule \nwould  force  plaintiffs  to  overhaul  their  systems  for  determining  benefits  eligibility  and \nenrollment. If the district court’s order were ultimately affirmed, plaintiffs would then be \nforced to undo all of these major changes. For example, Connecticut currently automatically \nreenrolls Medicaid beneficiaries each year and automatically confers eligibility for SNAP or \nMedicaid if an applicant receives other benefits; but because such processes would lead to \nsevere negative consequences for applicants under the Rule, Connecticut would be forced to \nalter its systems if a stay were to allow the Final Rule to immediately come into effect. \n(Addendum (“Add.”) 49-50.) Similarly, a stay would force New York’s Special Supplemental \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children to conduct costly and time-consuming \neligibility verification procedures rather than rely on existing streamlined processes that \nleverage applicants’ existing SNAP and Medicaid eligibility. (Add. 180-183.) The imposition of \nsuch substantial and irreparable harms on public-benefits administrators is entirely unwarranted \nwhen defendants have offered no compelling reason to support the immediate implementation \nof the Final Rule. \n18 \n\nAllowing the Rule to take effect now will also irreparably harm plaintiffs and the public \nin other ways. As the district court found and DHS acknowledged, the Rule will cause many \nindividuals and their families to forgo supplemental benefits—to which they are legally \nentitled—to avoid a public-charge finding under the Rule’s radical new framework. See 84 \nFed. Reg. at 41,300, 41,307. These reductions in benefits use will “reduce[] revenues for \nhealthcare providers participating in Medicaid,” Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, \n83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,118 (Oct. 10, 2018), including public healthcare facilities operated by \nplaintiffs. (Add. 47, 54, 102-111; see Add. 57-58 (NYC Health + Hospitals expects to lose $42 \nmillion in Medicaid revenue in first year of Rule’s implementation).) Although defendants \nclaim, without any support, that these losses will be offset by plaintiffs spending less to fund \nMedicaid (Mot. 17), this argument ignores the fact that plaintiffs’ healthcare costs will increase \nas newly uninsured patients avoid preventative care, suffer worse health outcomes, and seek \nmore costly care from public healthcare systems. (Add. 58 (NYC Health + Hospitals expects \nlosses to rise to at least $121 million given increased costs); Add. 103-111, 165-167.)  \nPublic health and economic welfare will be further harmed in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions \nas the Rule causes residents to avoid benefits. For example, as defendants do not contest, \nfamilies who forgo Section 8 benefits will need to leave their homes, live in more dangerous \nneighborhoods, and suffer harms to their health, education, and employment. (Add. 15-29, \n152-155.) And lower SNAP usage means less nutritious food for families, lower revenues for \ngrocery stores, and economic losses for plaintiffs. (Add. 127-132.) \nIf the Rule comes into effect immediately, the injuries to plaintiffs and the public will \nbe disruptive, irreparable, and long-lasting. For example, families that disenroll from Section \n8 housing cannot easily reenter the program because the waiting lists are long. (Add. 157-158.) \n19 \n\nImmigrants deemed “public charges” under the Rule may be forced to leave the country or \nface removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A); may be subject to multi-year bars to reentering, id. \n§ 1182(a)(9)(A)-(B); and will likely lose their path to LPR status or citizenship.  \nThe disruption, confusion, and harm from implementing the Rule immediately weigh \nstrongly against a stay. In urging otherwise, defendants make the conclusory assertion that all \nof these harms are “speculative.” (Mot. 40; see id. at 17-18.) But “[i]t is disingenuous for DHS \nto claim” that the harms “are too attenuated…when it acknowledged these costs in its own \nrulemaking process.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 787. Indeed, defendants failed to present any \nevidence below to contradict plaintiffs’ extensive factual record demonstrating the harmful \neffects of the Rule on plaintiffs and the public.  \nRather than grapple meaningfully with the largely uncontested harms that will occur \n(see Mot. 17-18, 39-40), defendants make the conclusory and astounding assertion that “whatever” \nharms plaintiffs and the public “will suffer” are automatically outweighed by defendants’ mere \npreference to implement the Rule now (id. at 40). If such empty treatment of “the relative \nharms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large,” International \nRefugee, 137 S. Ct. at 2087 (quotation marks omitted), were enough to obtain a stay here, then \napplicants, or at least the federal government, may expect to obtain the extraordinary intervention \nof a stay from this Court in nearly any case. Accordingly, the Court should deny a stay.     \n20 \n\nB.  There Is No Basis to Assess Whether This Court Will Grant Certiorari \nGiven That No Petition for Certiorari Has Yet Been Filed and No Court of \nAppeals Has Yet Ruled on the Merits of the Orders Below. \nThe truly extraordinary nature of defendants’ stay motion is further highlighted by their \nrequest for this Court’s premature intervention in ongoing appellate proceedings, before there \ncan be any plausible basis to discern whether this Court’s review will be warranted.  \nDefendants ask this Court to stay the district court’s order of preliminary relief when \nthe Second Circuit is currently reviewing that order on an expedited basis; when the Fourth, \nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits are reviewing similar orders issued by four other district courts; \nand when decisions on the merits from these courts will likely be issued in a matter of months. \nUntil these courts issue their decisions, there is no reasonable basis to predict how they will \nrule, whether their decisions will conflict with each other, or whether any issues they address \n(whether on threshold issues like standing, on the merits, or on the scope of relief) might \nwarrant this Court’s review. Defendants thus rely on nothing beyond rank speculation in \ncontending that there is a “reasonable probability” that four Justices will grant certiorari to \nreview the Second Circuit’s yet-to-be-issued decision. See Hollingsworth, 558 U.S. at 190. \nGiven the preliminary posture of this case and the other proceedings involving the Final \nRule, defendants are simply wrong to contend (Mot. 15-16) that a decision from the Second \nCircuit upholding the district court’s order will “conflict” with contrary decisions from the \nFourth or Ninth Circuits. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits have not issued any such “conflicting” \ndecisions because they have not yet had the opportunity to decide whether to uphold the \npreliminary relief issued by the other district courts. Instead, they have issued only interim stay \ndecisions. But such decisions based on truncated briefing do not dictate, let alone necessarily \npredict, how the courts will ultimately rule after full briefing, oral argument, and deliberation. \n21 \n\nThe speculative nature of defendants’ predictions is highlighted by the fact that the interim \ndecisions of the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits were each issued over a dissent. Given \nthat this Court is “a court of review, not of first view,” Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, \n137 S. Ct. 1144, 1151 (2017) (quotation marks omitted), and given that each of the courts of \nappeals considering challenges to the Final Rule will likely issue decisions within the next few \nmonths, the circumstances here support allowing the issues to percolate in the lower courts.  \nThe preliminary posture of this case also belies defendants’ contention (Mot. 16-17) \nthat this Court must intervene now to resolve the scope of relief that district courts may order. \nIn denying defendants’ stay motion, the Second Circuit made clear that “the merits panel, as \nsoon as constituted, has full authority to consider the scope of the existing injunction.” \n(App. 65a.) There is no reason for this Court to decide this question now when the Second \nCircuit has expressly flagged that issue for resolution and is moving expeditiously to complete \nbriefing and hold argument on that question.  \nC.  There Is Not a Fair Prospect That This Court Would Conclude That the \nDistrict Court Abused Its Discretion in Finding That the Rule is Likely \nContrary to Law and Arbitrary and Capricious.  \n1.  The Rule is likely contrary to law. \nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Final Rule’s unprecedented \ndefinition of “public charge” exceeds the well-established understanding of that term as \nincorporated into the INA. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. \n837, 842-44 (1984).  \na.  In the district court, defendants acknowledged that the permissible scope of \n“public charge” turns on that term’s historical meaning. (Mem. in Opp. to Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \n22 \n\n13-22 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2019), ECF No. 99.) But as the district court properly concluded \n(App. 13a), the Final Rule’s definition of “public charge” represents a sharp and untenable \nbreak from that historical meaning and thus exceeds “the bounds of reasonable interpretation.” \nUtility Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 321 (2014).  \nThe Rule now defines “public charge” to include employed immigrants who might \n“receive only hundreds of dollars, or less, in public benefits.” See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,360-61. \nThe Rule also considers disqualifying an applicant’s possible receipt of certain supplemental \nbenefits  that  do  not  provide  long-term  subsistence,  but  instead  boost  public  health  and \neconomic mobility. See infra, at 26-28. And the Rule’s aggregate counting system, which \ncounts each benefit used in a single month as a separate month for calculating the duration of \nbenefits  use,  means  that  noncitizens  will  be  considered  “public  charges”  based  on  the \nlikelihood of using multiple benefits temporarily, even for just a few months, to address an \nacute period of financial strain or emergency.  \nThese changes represent a radical and unprecedented departure from what had previously \nbeen a well-settled understanding of “public charge.” When Congress originally enacted the \npublic-charge provision in 1882, it adopted the prevailing understanding—reflected in early \nstate  laws—that  “public  charge”  was  limited  to  “persons  utterly  unable  to  maintain \nthemselves.” Kapp, supra, at 87. See supra, at 4-5. As precedents and contemporaneous \nsources from this era demonstrate, “public charge” meant individuals “physically and mentally \nincapacitated for labor,” Kapp, supra, at 91, not hard-working individuals who might receive \nminor amounts of assistance. See, e.g., City of Boston v. Capen, 61 Mass. 116, 124 (1851) \n(Massachusetts statute applied to individuals “without means of support”); American Dictionary \nof the English Language (N.  Webster 1828 online ed.), at https://archive.org/download/ \n23 \n\namericandictiona01websrich/americandictiona01websrich.pdf (defining the noun “charge” as \na  “person  or  thing  committed  to  another[’]s  custody,  care  or  management”)  (entry  6). \nConsistent with this understanding, the 1882 statute excluded the few immigrants unable “to \nsupport themselves by honest industry and labor,” 13 Cong. Rec. 5112 (Rep. Van Voorhis), \nwhile allowing employable immigrants to enter the country subject to a per-person tax used to \nassist immigrants until they could “obtain occupation for their support,” id. at 5106 (Rep. Reagan). \nThis established meaning of “public charge” carried forward through the early twentieth \ncentury. As courts and immigration agencies repeatedly made clear, “public charge” is a term \nof art in immigration law that has always meant individuals unlikely “to earn a living.” Wallis \nv. United States ex rel, Mannara, 273 F. 509, 509 (2d Cir. 1921). It has never been understood \nto include employed or employable immigrants who might receive some modicum of public \nbenefits. See Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10 (“public charge” means persons with “permanent personal \nobjections” preventing them from employment); Howe v. United States, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d \nCir. 1917) (“We are convinced that Congress meant the act to exclude persons who were likely \nto become occupants of almshouses for want of means with which to support themselves in \nthe future.”). \nCongress incorporated this established understanding of “public charge” when it enacted \nthe INA’s public-charge provision in 1952, without redefining the term. See McDermott Int’l, \nInc. v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337, 342 (1991); Lorillard v. Pons, 435 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) \n(“Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute \nand to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.”). Indeed, a Senate \nreport  about  the  INA,  on  which  defendants  rely  (Mot.  25-26),  confirms  that  Congress \nunderstood the extensive history of the public-charge provision and the precedents interpreting \n24 \n\nit, and retained the preexisting scope of “public charge” rather than expand it. See S. Rep. No. \n1515, at 45-53, 335-50 (1950). \nb.  Tellingly, defendants’ motion abandons most of the historical sources they \nreferenced below. And the Ninth Circuit’s stay order acknowledged the extensive history \nestablishing that “public charge” has a commonly understood meaning of persons “unwilling \nor unable to care for themselves.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 793.  \nThe few sources cited by defendants and the Ninth Circuit do not support their alternative \nreading of the historical meaning of “public charge.” For example, defendants cite a sentence \nfrom a treatise and two dictionaries to argue that “public charge” includes anybody who imposes \nany “money charge” or “expense” on “‘the public for support and care.’” (Mot. 24-25.) But \nthat  sentence  is  drawn  from  a  district  court  case  that  involved  a  noncitizen  who  was \ninstitutionalized because he was “unable to care for himself” and would have “starve[d] to \ndeath within a short time” absent institutional care. Ex parte Kichmiriantz, 283 F. 697, 698 \n(N.D. Ca. 1922); see, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary (3d ed. 1933) (citing Kichmiriantz, 283 F. \nat 698). And the case held that even this noncitizen could not be deemed a public charge \nbecause the “money charge” for his institutional care had been paid for by his relatives rather \nthan the public. Kichmiriantz, 283 F. at 698. \nDefendants and the Ninth Circuit’s stay order also badly misread a decision of the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, In re B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (B.I.A. 1948), as allowing already-\nadmitted LPRs to be deported for failure to repay any public benefit they receive. (See Mot. \n25.) In that decision, the BIA actually narrowed the public-charge provision applicable to \nadmitted LPRs by requiring that, to be deportable, an LPR must both have become a “public \ncharge”—i.e., substantially reliant on government funds to survive—and actually failed to \n25 \n\nrepay  those  funds  when  demanded.  See  In  re  B-,  3  I.  &  N.  Dec.  at  325  (immigrant \ninstitutionalized for eight years). This additional failure-to-repay requirement was thus a \nfurther protection against deportation of already-admitted LPRs, see In re Harutunian, 14 I. & \nN. Dec. at 588-89, not an expansion of the meaning of “public charge.”4  \nc.  Defendants’ remaining attempts to support their sweeping new definition of \n“public charge” are equally unavailing. \nFirst, echoing the Ninth Circuit’s flawed reasoning, defendants contend (Mot. 20) that \nthe public-charge statute confers discretion on DHS to determine the definition of “public \ncharge” by rendering inadmissible “[a]ny alien who . . . in the opinion of [DHS] . . . is likely \nat any time to become a public charge,” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). But discretion to determine \nwhether “[a]ny alien” meets the statutory standard in a particular case is not the same as \ndiscretion to redefine the statutory standard itself. And even if there were some play in the \njoints in applying the historical meaning of “public charge” to modern benefits programs (see \nMot. 24-25)—for instance, identifying which current programs serve the truly destitute—that \nflexibility would not authorize DHS to simply abandon the historical understanding of “public \ncharge” altogether, as the Final Rule does. See Utility Air, 573 U.S. at 321-24.  \nHere, the Final Rule goes far “beyond the meaning that the statute can bear,” MCI \nTelecommunications  Corp.  v.  AT&T  Co.,  512  U.S.  218,  229  (1994),  by  adopting  the \nunprecedented view that an individual can become a “public charge” simply by receiving \n                                                \n4 Contrary to defendants’ contention (Mot. 25 n.4), the BIA did not indicate that the \ninstitutionalized LPR in In re B- could have been deported for failure to repay incidental \nexpenses. The BIA noted that the LPR was required to pay for her own minor expenses to \nemphasize that, by contrast, the government could not seek reimbursement for her publicly \nfunded institutional care and therefore could not deport her. Id. at 327.  \n26 \n\nminor and temporary amounts of certain supplemental benefits. Contrary to the unsupported \nassumptions of defendants and the Ninth Circuit, the supplemental benefits targeted by the \nRule do not serve only the truly destitute who might plausibly be “public charges” under the \nestablished meaning of the INA. Rather, as DHS’s predecessor and the federal agencies that \nactually administer these benefits made clear in the 1999 Guidance, Congress made these \nprograms available as well to many employed individuals who have “incomes far above the \npoverty level”—not to support their subsistence, but rather to further “broad public policy \ndecisions” about improving public health, nutrition, and economic opportunities, 64 Fed. Reg. \nat 28,692. For example, in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, more than 60% of adult Medicaid recipients \nare working;5 in New York City, recipients of Section 8 benefits may retain those benefits \nwhile earning up to $85,350 annually (Add. 6); and in 2011, 44% of all SNAP participants \nlived in households with earnings.6 An individual may be “fully capable of supporting herself \nwithout government assistance but elect[] to accept” a supplemental benefit “simply because \nshe is entitled” to use it to obtain more nutritious food, safer housing, or better healthcare. \n(App. 15a.) \nThe supplemental benefits targeted by the Rule are a far cry from almshouses, institutional \ncare, or income-maintenance programs—programs that are designed to serve destitute individuals \nwho are “extremely unlikely” to meet their “basic subsistence requirements” without relying \n                                                \n5 Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid in Connecticut (Oct. 2019), at http://files.kff.org/ \nattachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-CT  (67%  of  adult  Medicaid  enrollees  work);  Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, Medicaid in Vermont (Oct. 2019), at http://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-\nsheet-medicaid-state-VT (65%); Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid in New York (Oct. 2019), \nat http://files.kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet-medicaid-state-NY (61%). \n6 U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Building a Healthy America: A Profile of SNAP 1 (2012). \n27 \n\nprimarily on the government in the long term. Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public \nCharge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, 28,678 (May 26, 1999); see id. (long-term care \ninstitutions provide all subsistence needs); id. at 28,687 (Supplemental Security Income \nprotects  “from  complete  impoverishment”).  The  Rule’s  inclusion  of  these  supplemental \nbenefits thus stretches “public charge” far past the breaking point of reasonable interpretation.  \nSecond, defendants misplace their reliance on policy statements in the 1996 Welfare \nReform Act and related provisions addressing noncitizens’ use of public benefits after they \nhave already entered the country or been admitted as LPRs. Defendants cite the Welfare \nReform Act’s goals of furthering “[s]elf-sufficiency” in “immigration policy” and preventing \n“the availability of public benefits” from incentivizing immigration. 8 U.S.C. § 1601. But \nCongress effectuated those goals in the 1996 Act by limiting immigrants’ use of specific \nbenefits in particular ways, such as by imposing a waiting period for eligibility for already-\nadmitted LPRs and denying benefits altogether to undocumented immigrants. The same \nCongress  pointedly  did  not  pursue  these  “self-sufficiency”  goals  through  amending  the \nthreshold public-charge provision. To the contrary, Congress in 1996 affirmatively rejected a \nproposal to transform the meaning of “public charge” in the deportation context to mean an \nimmigrant’s receipt of any amount of public benefits within a short time period. H.R. Rep. No. \n104-828, at 138, 241. And in 2013, Congress again rejected an attempt to make a similar \nchange to the meaning of “public charge.” See S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013) (Judiciary \nCommittee report noting that senators opposing amendment cited “strict benefit restrictions \nand requirements.”). There is thus no plausible basis to import the Welfare Reform Act’s “self-\nsufficiency” goals into the public-charge provision. See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 \nU.S. 167, 174-75 (2009).  \n28 \n\nFor similar reasons, the actual access-to-benefits rules that Congress enacted in 1996 \ndo not support the Rule’s redefinition of “public charge” for admissibility purposes. The new \neligibility rules were meant to limit certain public benefits to those immigrants who Congress \nbelieved displayed adequate “self-sufficiency” and who were not incentivized to enter this \ncountry due to “the availability of public benefits.” 8 U.S.C. § 1601. But the Final Rule \nimproperly disregards Congress’s policy choice by treating the receipt of these benefits as \ninstead automatically indicating that an immigrant is so destitute as to be a “public charge”—\nprecisely the opposite of Congress’s judgment. See Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, \n525-26 (1987) (per curiam) (deciding which “competing values will or will not be sacrificed \nto the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice”).  \nThird, defendants are fundamentally incorrect in finding support for the Final Rule in \nstatutory provisions requiring some (but not all) applicants to provide affidavits of support \nfrom third-party sponsors to avoid being deemed a public charge. (Mot. 20-21.) Contrary to \ndefendants’ contention, affidavits of support do not require the sponsor to repay “any means-\ntested public benefit” the applicant may receive. (Mot. 21 (emphasis added).) The repayment \nobligation does not currently apply to Section 8 housing benefits at all, as the Final Rule does. \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1. See supra, at 7. And the affidavits’ contractual obligation is substantially \nnarrower than the Final Rule in multiple additional ways—it applies primarily to certain \napplicants with family-based visas (not employment-based visas), is enforceable only after an \nimmigrant has been admitted, and encompasses only the covered benefits received during \ndefined  time  periods.  8  U.S.C.  §§ 1182(a)(4)(C)-(D), 1183a(2)-(3).  This  limited  post-\nadmission remedy does not remotely suggest that Congress silently transformed the threshold \nmeaning of “public charge” for all applicants to include any individual likely to receive any \n29 \n\nmeans-tested benefits at any time in the future—including time periods well beyond which \naffidavits of support would be enforceable. As the Final Rule acknowledges, affidavits are at \nmost a “separate requirement” in certain cases. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,448. And such affidavits \nprimarily serve a purpose distinct from the threshold admissibility review: “to provide a \nreimbursement mechanism” for the government or the LPR after the applicant’s admission “to \nrecover from the sponsor” who broke a contract to support the LPR, id. at 41,320.  \nFinally, there is also no merit to defendants’ assertion (Mot. 22) that a provision \nprohibiting DHS from considering “any benefits” received by battered immigrants in rendering \npublic-charge determinations necessarily authorizes DHS to consider “any benefits” for other \nimmigrants. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(s); see id. § 1641(c). There is no indication that Congress \nintended a shield for some immigrants to be used as a sword against others. Congress spoke \nbroadly in enacting this provision to make clear its intent to protect vulnerable immigrants who \noften lack any means of support outside their abusive relationships. See Battered Immigrant \nWomen Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 106-386, §§ 1502-1505, 114 Stat. 1464, 1518-27 (2000). \nIndeed, Congress likely referred to “any benefits” to ensure that battered immigrants could \nreceive any benefits that might actually reflect primary reliance on the government to subsist \nlong-term, such as income maintenance, without risking a public-charge determination. It \nwould be perverse to read into such broad protective legislation, directed at a distinct problem, \nan implicit intent to withdraw similar protections from other immigrants. And such implied \nintent is particularly implausible when Congress was operating against a backdrop in which \nthe well-settled public-charge framework did not consider receipt of supplemental public \nbenefits.  \n30 \n\nAt base, all of defendants’ arguments about these scattershot provisions suffer from the \nsame basic defect: they infer radical changes to the well-established meaning of public charge \nthrough provisions that did not alter that meaning, and instead serve very different roles in the \ncomplex legislative scheme governing public benefits or immigration. But Congress does not \n“hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 \n(2001). And whatever discretion DHS may have to apply the term “public charge,” it does not \nhave authority to “undo what [Congress] has done” by radically remaking immigration law \nand benefit programs—particularly when DHS has no authority over benefits programs or the \ncomplex rules that govern them. See King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2496 (2015). The district \ncourt thus properly concluded that DHS likely violated the INA by drastically expanding the \nmeaning of public charge in a way that Congress has not authorized. See Bob Jones Univ. v. \nUnited States, 461 U.S. 574, 600-01 (1983).  \n2.  The Rule is likely arbitrary and capricious.  \nThe Final Rule is also likely arbitrary and capricious for multiple, independent reasons.  \nFirst, as the district court correctly determined (App. 15a), DHS failed to provide any \nreasonable explanation for determining that likely receipt of any amount of supplemental \nbenefits, even temporarily, automatically means that an applicant cannot afford the “basic \nnecessities of life” and is thus a “public charge,” 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,159. That determination \n“rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay [defendants’] prior policy.” \nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 (2009). Based on the expertise of \nbenefit-granting agencies, the 1999 Guidance concluded that receiving supplemental benefits \ndoes not automatically suggest that the recipient is unable to afford her basic needs because \n31 \n\nsuch benefits are often available to working individuals to promote public health and upward \nmobility. 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. DHS’s failure to provide any rational basis for departing so \ndrastically from these prior findings renders the Rule arbitrary and capricious.    \nSecond, the Rule’s aggregate-counting system—which, for example, counts the use of \nthree benefits in one month as three months of benefits use—irrationally undermines DHS’s \nown stated goal of not including as “public charge” immigrants who suffer only a short-term \nemergency. (See App. 16a.) In the Rule, DHS stated that it had imposed a durational threshold \nrequiring likely benefits use for 12 out of 36 months to ensure that “short-term and intermittent \naccess to public benefits” will not render applicants public charges. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,361. \nBut the aggregate counting system does the opposite by deeming the use of multiple benefits \nover just a few months to satisfy the Rule’s new definition of “public charge.” DHS failed to \nprovide any reasoned explanation for arbitrarily shortening the 12-month durational threshold \nthat it selected as the “bright-line rule,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,360. Although “receipt of multiple \nbenefits” in a single month may indicate that an immigrant used more assistance during that \nmonth, id. at 41,361, it does not alter the short-term nature of such benefits use.  \nThird, multiple factors in the Rule’s new public-charge test do not reasonably predict \nthat an immigrant is likely to receive supplemental benefits at all—let alone receive them to such \nan extent she could rationally be considered a public charge. For example, the Rule assigns \nnegative weight to low credit scores, lack of English proficiency, and a larger family. But the \ndata on which DHS relies demonstrate that the vast majority of people with such factors do not \nuse any public benefits at all. See 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,196 (no benefits use by 75.4% of people \nwho do not speak English well); id. at 51,186 (no benefits use by 79.3% of people in families \nof four). Moreover, the Rule denies the heavily positive factor of having private health insurance \n32 \n\nto immigrants who use ACA credits to obtain insurance. But ACA credits are available to \nimmigrants who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty line—approximately $100,000 a year \nfor a family of four—and using such credits to purchase private insurance makes it extremely \nunlikely that the immigrant will use Medicaid.7      \nFinally, the Rule failed to adequately justify the need to radically alter the well-\nestablished public-charge framework, particularly given the grievous harms imposed by the \nRule. DHS declared that it lacked information to make such a justification. See 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,312-14. But DHS received extensive information on these harms and simply failed to \n“adequately analyze…the consequences” of its actions.  See American Wild Horse Pres. \nCampaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 932 (D.C. Cir. 2017). And given the information provided, \nDHS’s conclusion that the Rule “will ultimately strengthen public safety, health, and nutrition,” \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314, is contrary to the evidence and impermissibly based on “sheer \nspeculation.” Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Moreover, \nthe Rule contains no reasoned explanation for how these harms may be justified by any \npurported gains: DHS identified no concrete problems caused by the current public-charge \nregime aside from the fact that it grants LPR status more often than the Rule would.   \n   \n                                                \n7 See U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Federal Poverty Level, at \nhttps://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/. \n33 \n\n3.  The Rule is likely unlawful and arbitrary under the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe district court correctly concluded that the Rule is likely arbitrary and capricious \nand contrary to law because it violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by discriminating \nagainst individuals with disabilities. (App. 18a.) Section 504 provides that no individual “shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination” under any activity conducted by a federal \nagency. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added). This provision does not, as defendants contend \n(Mot. 30-31), prohibit only public-charge determinations that are based solely on an applicant’s \ndisability. Rather, it also prohibits DHS from subjecting an applicant to “a more onerous \ncondition” based solely on disability, Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 276 (2d Cir. \n2003)—including,  as  DHS’s  own  regulations  provide,  different  “criteria  or  methods  of \nadministration,” 6 C.F.R. § 15.30(b)(4). The Rule violates these principles by automatically \n“consider[ing] disability as a negative factor in the public charge assessment” (App. 18a).      \nThe Rule is also likely arbitrary and capricious given that it provides no rational basis \nfor concluding that “disability alone is itself a negative factor indicative of being more likely \nto become a public charge” when reasonable accommodations would allow the applicant to work. \n(App. 18a.) And the Rule’s irrational treatment of individuals with disabilities is compounded \nby its use of multiple, duplicative factors that essentially double- and triple-count a person’s \ndisability against them. For example, a person’s disability could underlie both a negative factor \nfor a serious medical condition, and a heavily negative factor for past use of Medicaid (a \ncommon resource for people with disabilities who have incomes far above the poverty line). \nSee 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,504.  \n34 \n\nContrary to defendants’ arguments (Mot. 31), Congress’s requirement that DHS consider \n“health” in making public-charge determinations does not authorize the agency to make the \nirrational conclusion that disability alone—particularly with a reasonable accommodation—\nwill automatically render an applicant incapable of supporting himself. And that conclusion is \nfurther belied by the evidence submitted to DHS, which confirms “the reality that many \nindividuals with disabilities live independent and productive lives” (App. 18a).  \n4.  Defendants’ threshold arguments lack merit.  \nThe district court correctly determined that plaintiffs have standing and are within the \napplicable zone of interests.  \nArticle  III  standing:  The  “predictable  effect[s]”  of  the  Final  Rule  give  plaintiffs \nstanding. Department of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). Plaintiffs \npresented unrebutted evidence that the Rule will concretely injure plaintiffs’ proprietary, \neconomic, and sovereign interests by causing many of plaintiffs’ residents to forgo public-\nbenefit programs. Such drops in benefits enrollment will reduce Medicaid revenue, increase \ncosts to healthcare systems, burden plaintiffs’ public-benefit programs, and harm plaintiffs’ \neconomies. See supra, at 17-20. Such injuries are “precisely the kind of ‘pocketbook’” injuries \nthat confer standing. Air Alliance Houston v. EPA, 906 F.3d 1049, 1059-60 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  \nZone of interests: The district court also correctly concluded that plaintiffs are within \nthe INA’s zone of interests. Given the APA’s “generous review provisions,” the zone-of-\ninterests test is satisfied unless plaintiffs’ interests are “so marginally related to or inconsistent \nwith the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress \nintended to permit the suit.” Clarke v. Securities Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399-400 & n.16 \n35 \n\n(1987) (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs  easily satisfy this lenient standard here. As \ndefendants acknowledge (Mot. 18), Congress enacted the public-charge provision in part to \nprotect state and city fiscs. But Congress also maintained a narrow meaning of “public charge” \nto ensure that States and their subdivisions will continue to receive the economic and other \nbenefits that flow from employable immigrants becoming “a valuable component part of the \nbody-politic.” 13 Cong. Rec. 5108 (Rep. Van Voorhis). The Rule acknowledges that it will impose \nsubstantial costs on these state fiscal interests. The zone-of-interests test is thus satisfied.  \nD.  There Is No Basis to Limit the Scope of the Preliminary Relief Ordered.  \nDefendants’ demand that this Court limit the scope of the district court’s injunction \nignores the separate provision of the district court’s order postponing the Rule’s effective date \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 705. Section 705 provides that “[o]n such conditions as may be required and \nto the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury,” a court “may issue all necessary and \nappropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or \nrights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” By authorizing the court to suspend “the \neffective date” of an agency’s action, this express statutory remedy applies to a rule as a whole \nrather than to particular parties or locations. See Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 \nF.3d 544, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting in part) (§ 705 “authorizes courts to \nstay agency rules pending judicial review”) (emphasis omitted). \nThe scope of the provisional relief authorized by § 705 parallels the ultimate remedies \nof vacatur or remand that a court is authorized to issue under the APA—remedies that also \napply to an entire regulation, not to particular parties. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); National Mining \nAss’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409-10 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Likewise, when \n36 \n\nagencies have invoked § 705 to postpone the effective dates of their own rules, they have \nroutinely done so on a nationwide basis. See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Jackson, 833 F. Supp. 2d 11, \n21-22 (D.D.C. 2012). The district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing similar relief \nunder  § 705  here.  See  West  Virginia  v.  EPA,  136  S.  Ct.  1000  (Mem.)  (2016)  (staying \nregulation); Application for Stay of Final Agency Action 5, 13, West Virginia v. EPA, No. \n15A773 (U.S. Jan 26, 2016) (requesting § 705 stay).  \nThe district court’s postponement of the Rule’s effective date under § 705 means that \nthis  case  may  not  squarely  present  any  issues  regarding  the  scope  of  courts’  “equity \njurisdiction” (Mot. 38). Contrary to defendants’ conclusory assertion (Mot. 37), a § 705 stay \nis not “one and the same” as a preliminary injunction. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 428, 434 (“An \ninjunction and a stay have typically been understood to serve different purposes.”). Although \ncourts have looked to similar factors in issuing both forms of relief, a § 705 stay is directly \nauthorized by statute and does not rely on the courts’ inherent authority to issue equitable \nrelief. Moreover, unlike an injunction, a § 705 stay operates on a regulation’s effective date \nrather than directing the “conduct of a party.” See id. A § 705 stay thus does not risk exposing \nDHS or its officials to conflicting injunctions issued by different courts.  \nThe prospect that courts may reach different decisions about whether to issue a § 705 \nstay (Mot. 4, 39) is a feature of Congress’s statutory remedies rather than any judicial \noverreach. The APA authorizes different plaintiffs to challenge the same regulation in different \ncourts, see 5 U.S.C. § 703, and each “reviewing court” is authorized to stay a regulation’s \neffective date if circumstances so warrant. When Congress wanted to remove judicial authority \nto issue a stay under § 705, it knew how to do so. See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. § 1855(f)(1)(A) (§ 705 \n“not applicable” to judicial review of fishery-management regulations); 15 U.S.C. § 3416(b) \n37 \n\n(same for natural gas regulations). The absence of any such limitation here precludes any \nargument that the district court improperly relied on § 705 to do exactly what Congress \nauthorized—postpone the effective date of the Rule as a whole “pending conclusion of the \nreview proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705.  \nIn any event, the district court also properly issued a preliminary injunction without \ngeographic limitation. The “scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical” location of plaintiffs. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. \n682, 702 (1979). Here, plaintiffs do not challenge any individual public-charge determination \n(see Mot. 32-36). Rather, plaintiffs claim, and the district court found, that the Rule likely \nviolated the APA—a finding that would require vacatur of the Rule altogether. See National \nMining, 145 F.3d at 1409-10. The district court’s preliminary injunction thus appropriately \nprotects against precisely the harm that plaintiffs ultimately seek to prevent—implementation \nof an unlawful regulation. See Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr. Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994). \nMoreover, the district court properly exercised its “sound discretion to consider” both \nthe harms to plaintiffs and “the necessities of the public interest when fashioning injunctive \nrelief.” United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop., 532 U.S. 483, 496 (2001) (quotation \nmarks omitted). For example, as the district court found (App. 22a-24a), the preliminary \ninjunction is particularly appropriate here given the immigration context—both because a \nnationwide scope is necessary to protect plaintiffs and the public from irreparable harms, and \nin  view  of  the  importance  of  uniformity  in  the  application  and  enforcement  of  federal \nimmigration law. An injunction allowing the Rule’s disruptive and complicated multifactor \nsystem to take effect in some States but not others would likely exacerbate the fear and \n38 \n\nconfusion about that Rule that is harming plaintiffs, their residents, and the public interest-\nthe very harms that the injunction is meant to prevent. No partial stay is warranted. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court should deny the motion. \nDated: New York, New York \nJanuary 22, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \nfb~~.~ \nLETITIA JAMES \nAttorney General \nState ofN  ew York \nBARBARA D.

Reg. 41,292 (August 14, 2019) (“Final \nRule”), which directs officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to consider—for the first time—a noncitizen’s \nuse or potential use of specified federally subsidized housing programs when determining \nwhether an applicant for legal permanent residency in the United States (a “green card”) or an \nindividual applying to enter the United States on certain visas is subject to the “public charge” \nground of inadmissibility.  \n5.  The specific federally-subsidized housing programs included in the Final \nRule are: Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, Project-Based Section 8 Rental \nAssistance, and Public Housing (collectively referred to herein as “Federal housing programs”). \n2 \nAdd2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 58\nIn addition to Federal housing programs, the Final Rule specifies receipt or potential receipt of \nSNAP and Medicaid benefits as well as other non-cash benefits that officials should consider \nwhen assessing public charge.  \n6.  According to the Final Rule, living in federally subsidized housing and \nreceiving a subsidy in aggregate for more than 12 months during a 36-month period would be \nconsidered a heavily-weighted negative factor in determining whether a given applicant for \nadjustment is a public charge. The Final Rule contains many other features that go beyond the \nscope of this Declaration.  \n7.  The Final Rule is scheduled to go into effect on October 15, 2019. This \ndeclaration describes the following: (1) the Federal housing benefits included in the Final Rule, \nincluding supply and demand for these programs, financial eligibility, and immigrant eligibility; \n(2) the benefits of living in federal housing programs for individuals; and (3) the negative impact \nthe Final Rule will have on noncitizens if it is not enjoined by the Court.  \n8.  It is my opinion that if the Final Rule goes into effect, a certain number of \nnoncitizens who reside in federally-assisted housing will choose to disenroll from the Federal \nhousing programs encompassed by the Final Rule. Using the estimates of disenrollment from \nDHS (2.5 percent), the result would be substantial harm. As explained herein, given the well-\ndocumented positive impact living in federally-assisted housing has on residents, especially \nchildren, even a minimal amount of disenrollment can be expected to result in substantial harm. \nIndividuals who disenroll will lose an affordable source of housing and other benefits in the \nareas of health, educational attainment, and earnings. \n3 \nAdd3\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 58\nII.  Background \nA.  Characteristics of Federal Housing Programs Included in the Final Rule \n9.  I have been asked by counsel to describe the key features and eligibility \ncriteria of the Federal housing programs included in the Final Rule, including the income \nhouseholds can receive while maintaining eligibility for public housing. \nSection 8 Housing Choice Vouchers \n10.  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (“HCV” program) is the \nlargest federally subsidized housing program in the United States, serving approximately 2.5 \nmillion households and 5.3 million residents in 2018. First established by the Housing and \nCommunity Development Act of 1974, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are used by low-\nincome families to rent housing in the private market. A low-income family that uses a voucher \npays 30 percent of its income for rent and utilities (or $50, whichever is larger), and the voucher \npays the balance of the rent and utility costs, up to a limit. Local public housing authorities set \nthese limits as a proportion of Fair Market Rents (FMRs), which are adjusted by apartment size \nand calculated annually by HUD for over 2,600 housing markets across the U.S.1 FMRs vary \nconsiderably in municipalities across the United States and sometimes within municipalities, \ndepending upon rental housing costs in each area. \n11.  Initial Eligibility. To participate in the program, an apartment must be \ninspected and certified to meet minimum standards related to space and physical quality. In \nterms of financial eligibility, vouchers tend to be targeted to very needy families, with 75 percent \nof new families receiving a voucher each year classified as “extremely low income” (generally, \nhousehold incomes not exceeding 30 percent of the area median income (“AMI”) or the federal \n                                                 \n1 Schwartz, Alex F. 2015. Housing Policy in the United States (Third Edition). New York: Routledge. \n4 \nAdd4\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 58\npoverty line, whichever is higher).2 The balance of new families receiving a voucher must have \nhousehold incomes no more than 80 percent of the AMI.  \nProject-Based Section 8 Rental Assistance \n12.  The Project-Based Section 8 Rental Assistance program (“PBRA”) creates \nmulti-year rental assistance agreements with owners of private multi-family properties to make \nall or some of the units available to low-income families. The PBRA program includes about 1.3 \nmillion housing units and approximately 2 million residents nationwide. \n13.  Similar to the HCV Program, families renting housing in the PBRA \nprogram pay 30 percent of their household income (or $25, whichever is greater) each month. A \nmonthly payment to the owner of the building and the PBRA program supplies the balance of the \ncosts associated with maintaining and operating the apartment. In addition, about two-thirds of \nhouseholds living in PBRA housing are headed by seniors (i.e., individuals over age 65) or \npeople with disabilities. \n14.  Financial eligibility. At least 40 percent of units in each building that \nbecome vacant are allocated for “extremely low income” families (defined as households earning \n30 percent or less of the AMI) and most of the remainder of units are allocated to very low-\nincome families (household incomes of no more than 50 percent of AMI).3   \nPublic Housing \n \n15.  In contrast to the HCV and PBRA programs described above, public \nhousing is housing that is owned and operated by the federal government under the auspices of \nlocal public housing authorities. Families living in public housing contribute 30 percent of their \n                                                 \n2 “Policy Basics: The Housing Choice Voucher Program.” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nWashington, DC (https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/policy-basics-the-housing-choice-voucher-\nprogram, last accessed on August 21, 2019). \n3 Ibid.  \n5 \nAdd5\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 58\nincome each month toward rent or a minimum rent set by the housing authority. Nationwide the \npublic housing program includes about 1 million units and serves nearly 2 million residents. \n16.  Financial eligibility. At least 40 percent of families newly admitted to the \nprogram each year must be “extremely low-income” households, with the balance of households \nearning no more than 80 percent of the AMI.4  \nContinued eligibility for HCV, PBRA and Public Housing.  \n17.  In order to maintain eligibility for each of the Federal housing benefits, the \nhousehold’s income may not exceed household income limits determined by HUD, generally no \ngreater than 80 percent of the AMI. The below chart lists 50 percent and 80 percent AMI income \nlimits for four-person households in each of the key jurisdictions encompassed by the cases in \nwhich I am serving as an expert for fiscal year 2019: \n \nGeographic Area  50% AMI Family Income Limit ($)  80% AMI Family Income Limit ($) \nConnecticut  50,450  75,500 \nNew York  41,100  65,750 \nNew York City \n(Metro Area)  53,350  85,350 \nVermont  39,750  63,600 \n \nNote: Income limit data are from HUD’s FY 2019 Income Limits Documentation System \n(https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/il2019/select_Geography.odn, accessed on September 5, \n2019). \n \n18.  Note that each of these income limits exceeds 125 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Guideline for a family four which is $32,187.50. As discussed below, and as these \nnumbers show, many families who use federal housing benefits start out with low income, but \n                                                 \n4 Ibid. \n6 \nAdd6\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 58\nhaving the stability that comes with subsidized rent, they are able to achieve greater economic \nstability while maintaining eligibility for the Federal housing programs.  \n    B.  Volume of Federal Housing Program Units and Demand  \n19.  As Table 1 in Exhibit B describes, in 2018 these programs in aggregate \nrepresented 4,827,662 housing units, or 96 percent of the federally subsidized units of housing \navailable in the United States. The supply of these subsidized housing units has shrunk in recent \nyears. In 2015, the available number of housing units in these three programs numbered \n4,798,257, about 29,000 more units than in 2018. In addition to representing the vast majority of \nthe federally subsidized housing units, these programs also represent nearly all of the residents \nliving in federally subsidized housing. In 2018, the programs accommodated 9,308,020 \nindividual residents, or about 98 percent of the total residents living in federally subsidized \nhousing units.5 \n20.  The current demand for federally subsidized housing units is substantial. \nMost public housing authorities maintain a wait list for families that are eligible to live in \nfederally subsidized housing, but are unable to move into a unit because none are available. \nRecent estimates indicate that nationally there are 1.5 families waiting for every Housing Choice \nVoucher program unit under contract and 1.7 families waiting for every public housing unit.6 \n21.  However, these are underestimates because so many public housing \nauthorities (“PHAs”) have closed their wait lists. In 2012, about 60 percent of HCV wait lists and \n17 percent of public housing wait lists were closed, effectively limiting the number of families \nthat appear on wait lists. If wait lists remained open for all PHAs then presumably the number of \n                                                 \n5 While there are a variety of other subsidized housing programs operated by HUD, the three programs \ndescribed above are the largest in terms of number of housing units and number of residents. \n6 Housing Agency Waiting Lists and the Demand for Housing Assistance, 2019. \nhttps://www.housingcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/waiting-list-spotlight.pdf \n7 \nAdd7\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 58\neligible families waiting for federally subsidized housing would be significantly larger. After \ncorrecting for closed wait lists, nationally there are about 4 families waiting for each HCV unit \nand 1.8 families for each public housing unit.7 This translates into a wait of 1.5 years for the \nmedian family on the waitlist for HCV and nine months for the median family on the waitlist for \npublic housing.8 These median values obscure significant variation in wait times, particularly at \nthe high end of the distribution. For example, 25 percent of HCV waitlists had a wait time of 3 \nyears or longer and 25 percent of public housing waitlists had a wait time of 1.5 years or longer.9  \n22.  In some cases, waitlists for public housing and HCV are particularly long. \nFor example, counsel has advised me that in New York City the waits can be substantially longer \ndue to low turn-over, high demand, and depending on the type of housing, factors like household \nsize and the availability of the requisite size apartment and other priority factors. \nC.  Immigrant Eligibility for Federal Public Housing  \n23.  Counsel has advised me that under current law, the following categories of \nnoncitizens are eligible for Federal housing benefits: (a) lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”) \n(regardless of time in LPR status); (b) refugees; (c) asylees; (d) persons granted parole; (e) \npersons granted withholding of removal; (f) persons granted 1986 amnesty status (entered U.S. \npre-January 1, 1982); (g) lawful U.S. residents under the Compacts of Free Association with \nMicronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Guam; (h) certified victims of trafficking; and (i) \nVAWA self-petitioners (includes VAWA cancellation of removal applicants; VAWA suspension \nof deportation applicants).  \n                                                 \n7 Ibid. \n8 These estimates come from a survey of PHAs in 2015-2016 by the National Low Income Housing \nCoalition (NLIHC) (https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/HousingSpotlight_6-1.pdf, last accessed August \n21, 2019). \n9 Ibid. \n8 \nAdd8\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 58\n24.  Noncitizens who do not fall into one of the above categories can live in \nFederal housing program units, but are required to pay a pro rata share of the rent. It is important \nto note that the income of non-eligible members of families is included in the family income \nfigure used to determine eligibility for living in the housing and the rent that the family owes, \ndespite the fact that non-eligible family members cannot receive a subsidy. \n25.  A new Rule introduced by HUD for notice and comment on May 10, 2019 \n(the “Proposed HUD Rule”), would change these rules. Under the proposed new rule, non-\neligible noncitizens would not be permitted to remain in HUD-sponsored housing, including \npublic housing, and would not be permitted to live in a household in which HCV or PBRA \nsubsidizes the rent.10 \n26.  Noncitizen eligibility for Federal housing programs is limited under \ncurrent law, but noncitizens have always been present in such programs and have never been \ncategorically excluded by Congress. \n27.  The United States Housing Act of 1937, sponsored by Representative \nHenry B. Steagall (D-AL) and Senator Robert F. Wagner (D-NY), created a United States \nHousing Authority that worked through newly created public housing agencies at the sub-\nnational level to create subsidized rental housing for low-income families.  This legislation \nspecified income eligibility criteria, but was silent on other eligibility requirements such as \nnativity or citizenship. The historical record indicates that many PHAs awarded a substantial \nnumber of units to households with noncitizen members. Of the 101,482 residents living in \npublic housing in 1940, a total of 11,174 (11 percent) were foreign born with 8,161 residents \n                                                 \n10 Housing and Community Development Act of 1980: Verification of Eligible Status.” Federal Register \n84(91), RIN 2501-AD89, Docket No. FR-6124-P-01. \n9 \nAdd9\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 11 of 58\nnaturalized citizens (8 percent) and 3,013 noncitizens (3 percent).11  While some local PHAs \nlimited access to public housing to citizens in the early years of the program,12 Congress passed \nno legislation that prohibited access to public housing by immigrants regardless of citizenship \nstatus. \n28.  Over the course of the next four decades, Congress modified the public \nhousing program in the United States incrementally in terms of its budget and goals for the \nnumber of public housing units it created, while core eligibility features remained consistent. \nProposed eligibility requirements for public housing residents changed starting with provisions \nincluded in Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980. The next \nyear, Congress proposed wider exclusions for immigrants through a revision of Section 214 in \nthe Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, but the proposed rules for interpreting the regulatory \nchanges were not implemented immediately because Congress did not appropriate funds \nnecessary for implementation and the regulatory changes were challenged by various lawsuits.13  \n                                                 \n11 These figures are based on the author’s analysis of a unique dataset of all public housing residents in \nthe United States at the time of the 1940 Census. For more information about the dataset, see the \nfollowing reference: Allen, Ryan and Van Riper, David. Forthcoming. “The New Deal, the Deserving \nPoor and the First Public Housing Residents in New York City.” Social Science History. Of the \nnaturalized citizens, it is unclear what percentage began residence in public housing prior to attaining \ncitizenship, but it can be assumed that a number of them did given the noncitizens in public housing in \nthat same year. In comparison, 8.8 percent of the U.S. population was foreign born in 1940 including 5.5 \npercent naturalized citizens, 2.6 percent noncitizens and 0.6 percent with unreported citizenship status. \n“1940 Census of Population: Volume 2.

Dzubow, Jason. 1995. “HUD Shuts the Door: Restrictions on Housing Assistance to Noncitizens.” \nGeorgetown Immigration Law Journal 9:801-826. Subsequently, Congress barred HUD from \nimplementing the rule and HUD submitted multiple revised versions of the rule to implement the \nregulations in Section 214 throughout 1986, and delayed implementation of the rule until October 1, \n1987. \n10 \nAdd10\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 12 of 58\n29.  In 1987 Congress amended Section 214 once again to respond to the \nissues raised in the lawsuits. As amended, Section 214 allowed aliens in federally-subsidized \nhousing who had been temporarily admitted or paroled into the United States as specified in \nSection 245A of the Immigration and Naturalization Act or who had family members who were \nineligible. In the latter case, this provision preserved the integrity of mixed-status families by \nletting families with some members who are ineligible noncitizens continue to live in subsidized \nhousing. After publishing a rule in 1988 related to this version of Section 214, HUD failed to \nimplement the rule citing a lack of authorization to collect information on citizenship or alien \nstatus from residents or applicants to federally subsidized public housing. A final rule to \nimplement Section 214 was published in the Federal Register on March 20, 1995, about 15 years \nafter Congress passed the original restrictions from federally subsidized housing.14  \n                                                 \nImmediate implementation of the rule was delayed for two primary reasons. First, Congress did not \nallocate to HUD the additional funding required to implement the rule. The failure to allocate the \nnecessary funds is most readily explained by the fact that Congress passed the Immigration Reform and \nControl Act of 1986 (IRCA), which changed the process used to verify immigrant status. Dzubow, Jason. \n1995. “HUD Shuts the Door: Restrictions on Housing Assistance to Noncitizens.” Georgetown \nImmigration Law Journal 9:801-826. As a result, it remained unclear what protocols HUD should use to \nverify immigrant status before Congress issued final guidelines associated with IRCA. Second, a district \ncourt in California issued a nation-wide preliminary injunction on implementing the regulation based on \narguments made in Yolano-Donnelly Tenants’ Association v. Pierce. Yolano-Donnelly Tenants’ \nAssociation v. Pierce, E.D. Cal. No. CIV. S-86-846-MLS (1986). In this case the court recognized that \nimplementing the new regulation would result in the eviction of thousands of families currently residing \nin federally-subsidized housing because either they or some members of their households were ineligible \nto live in the housing due to a lack of documentation. Dzubow, Jason. 1995. “HUD Shuts the Door: \nRestrictions on Housing Assistance to Noncitizens.” Georgetown Immigration Law Journal 9:801-826. \nThe court reasoned that in some cases this would result in the eviction of citizens and properly \ndocumented aliens.  \nAn additional lawsuit in 1986, City of New York v. Pierce, charged that the regulations would unduly \nburden the City of New York because it would increase the homeless population and the administrative \nburden experienced by the City. City of New York v. Pierce, 86-CIV-6068, U.S. District Court, Southern \nDistrict of New York (1986). Together these lawsuits resulted in delayed implementation of the original \nrestrictions to federally subsidized housing for certain groups of immigrants contemplated and enacted by \nCongress.  \n14 Dzubow, Jason. 1995. “HUD Shuts the Door: Restrictions on Housing Assistance to Noncitizens.” \nGeorgetown Immigration Law Journal 9:801-826. \n11 \nAdd11\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 13 of 58\n30.  Although the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996 called for widespread changes to the eligibility criteria and structure \nof many parts of the U.S. welfare system, it ultimately did not have a meaningful impact on \nFederal housing programs.15 Battered qualified aliens were only recognized as eligible for public \nhousing in 2016.16 \n31.  HUD anticipates that the Proposed HUD Rule, if implemented, would \nhave a large impact on the number of noncitizens residing in Federal housing programs. HUD’s \nRegulatory Impact Analysis estimates that 25,045 households living in federally subsidized \nhousing would be affected by this rule change, including a total of 108,104 people.17 HUD \nbelieves that over three-quarters of the households that would be affected by this rule change will \nterminate housing assistance, with the remaining households splitting apart so that members of \nthe household eligible to receive a subsidy remain in assisted housing. Overall, HUD estimates \nthat 76,141 of the 108,104 individuals living in households that would be affected by this \nproposed rule change are eligible to receive federal housing subsidies. It is difficult to determine \nthe likely degree of overlap between the households that HUD has estimated would be affected \nby the Proposed HUD Rule change and the households that may be affected by the Final Rule, \nbut it is safe to assume that there will be at least some overlap given the focus on noncitizens by \neach rule change. Despite this potential for overlap, in the discussion below regarding the likely \n                                                 \n15 P.L. 104-193 §431(c) (1) (A); 8 U.S.C. §1641, as cited in McCarty, Maggie and Siskin, Alison. 2015. \n“Immigration: Noncitizen Eligibility for Needs-Based Housing Programs.” Congressional Research \nService, RL31753. \n16 https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/Eligibility-of-VAWA-Self-Petitioners_121416.pdf (accessed on \nSeptember 5, 2019). \n17 “Housing and Community Development Act of 1980: Verification of Eligible Status, Regulatory \nImpact Analysis.” Docket No. FR-6124-P-01, April 15, 2019. \n12 \nAdd12\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 14 of 58\neffect of the Final Rule on households with foreign-born members, I do not attempt to capture \nany of the effects associated with the Proposed HUD Rule.  \nD.  Characteristics of Households Living in Federally Subsidized Housing \n32.  Table 1 in Exhibit B describes some basic descriptive information about \nresidents living in public housing, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, Project-Based Section \n8 developments, and all HUD programs in 2018 in the U.S., Connecticut, New York, Vermont, \nand New York City. While households earning less than 80 percent of the AMI are eligible for \nliving in public housing or Project Based Section 8 units, or using a Housing Choice Voucher, \nthe majority of households in these programs are classified as very low-income (earning less than \n50 percent of AMI). In 2018, 96 percent of households living in Project Based Section 8 units \nearned less than 50 percent of the AMI in the United States. In the Section 8 Housing Choice \nVoucher program and public housing 95 percent and 91 percent of households earned less than \n50 percent of the AMI in the United States in 2018, respectively. Given the geographical \nvariation in the AMI as described above, even families with income less than 50 percent of the \nAMI, do not necessarily have income below 125 percent of the FPG.  \n33.  Compared to public housing and the Housing Choice Voucher program, \nthe Project Based Section 8 program tends to have smaller family sizes living in its units. \nNationally, the average size of a family in Project Based Section 8 in 2018 was 1.7 people, \ncompared to 2.1 in public housing and 2.3 in Housing Choice Vouchers.  \n34.  I do not have data on the length of stay in Federal housing programs \namong noncitizens, and they may vary considerably from the length of stay statistics for tenants \ngenerally. Nationally, households living in a federally subsidized housing unit typically do not \nremain in these units for an extended period of time. Based on the most current and \ncomprehensive analysis available using HUD administrative data on exits from assisted \n13 \nAdd13\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 15 of 58\nhousing,18 average households living in federally subsidized housing leave assisted housing after \nabout six years.19 Differences in length of stay in federally subsidized housing by household type \ncan be substantial. For example, in New York City, given the demand for public housing and \nlack of availability of affordable housing, the low vacancy rate, and the relatively high income a \nhousehold can have and maintain eligibility, families stay in public housing much longer. \nAnother estimate of length of stays in public housing uses longitudinal data from the Panel \nSurvey of Income Dynamics (1987-2011) and found that most individuals who entered public \nhousing stayed less than five years, with only 12 percent staying longer than 10 years.20 This \nevidence suggests that federally-assisted housing serves as a temporary source of support for \nmost families that use it, but that there can be exceptions in housing markets characterized by \nhigh rents and low vacancy rates. \n   \n                                                 \n18 In this case, “assisted housing” is a general term that includes the three largest federally subsidized \nhousing programs specified in the Final Rule, plus several smaller programs not included in the Final \nRule. \n19 McClure, Kirk. 2018. “Length of Stay in Assisted Housing.” Cityscape 20(1): 11-38. \n(https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26381219) \n20 Dantzler, Prentiss A. 2019. “Reconsidering Poverty Dynamics by Analyzing Housing Spells.” The \nSocial Science Journal (In Press, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2019.06.004).  \n14 \nAdd14\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 16 of 58\nIII.  Benefits of Living in Federally Subsidized Housing \n35.  In connection with preparing this declaration, I have undertaken a review \nof research conducted regarding the positive impacts of living in housing subsidized by the \nFederal housing programs that are included in the Final Rule because the benefits, in turn, speak \nto the harm caused to noncitizen families who lose access to Federal housing programs because \nof the Final Rule.  \n36.  Research on residents living in federally-assisted housing shows that \nresiding in such housing is associated with positive health and economic outcomes.21 Living in \npublic housing has positive associations with (a) better health outcomes, (b) educational \nattainment, (c) employment earnings, and (d) other benefits.  \n37.  Health outcomes. A number of studies have found a positive association \nbetween living in assisted housing and positive health outcomes for children and adults. Relative \nto children in families on a waitlist for federally-assisted housing and controlling for \nneighborhood context, children in families living in public housing have fewer symptoms of \nmental health stress and experience fewer emotional difficulties.22 Similarly, relative to adults in \nfamilies on a waitlist for federally-assisted housing and after controlling for neighborhood-level \ncharacteristics, adults in families in public housing had lower odds of being in fair or poor health \n                                                 \n21 It is important to note that the most methodologically sound research on outcomes associated with \nliving in Federal housing program appropriately controls for the selection bias inherent to applying for \nand obtaining a unit of assisted housing. Selection criteria for admission to Federal housing programs \nmean that families are low income, a characteristic that has an independent relationship with educational, \nemployment, health, and other outcomes. It is important to distinguish the relationship between living in \nhousing supplied by a Federal housing program with these outcomes and the relationship between living \nin a poor family and these outcomes. \n22 Fénelon, Andrew, Slopen, Natalie, Boudreaux, Michel, and Newman, Sandra J. 2018. “The Impact of \nHousing Assistance on the Mental Health of Children in the United States.” Journal of Health and Social \nBehavior 59(3): 447-463. \n15 \nAdd15\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 17 of 58\nand lower odds of psychological distress.23 Children living in assisted housing have lower Blood \nLead Levels (BLLs) than children who did not receive housing assistance.24 Many residents of \npublic housing have poor health, but frequently health problems exist for residents prior to \nbecoming residents of public housing. For example, in a study of Atlanta public housing \nresidents 19 percent were diagnosed with diabetes and 23 percent were diagnosed with asthma, \nbut of those diagnosed with these health problems at least three-quarters received the diagnosis \nprior to entering public housing.25 In general, research indicates that public housing tends to \nprovide a safety net for residents that had existing health problems when they arrived in assisted-\nhousing rather than cause these health problems.26 \n38.  Educational achievement. Much of the available evidence suggests that \nchildren living in federally-assisted housing experience comparable or better educational \nachievement than children who do not live in federally-assisted housing. Children living in \npublic housing are less likely to be held back a grade than those not living in public housing27 \nand those living in voucher-assisted housing experience better math achievement.28 Research that \ncompares educational outcomes for children living in public housing and voucher-assisted \n                                                 \n23 Fenelon, Andrew, Mayne, Patrick, Simon, Alan E., Rossen, Lauren M., Helms, Veronica, Lloyd, \nPatricia, Sperling, Jon, and Steffen, Barry L. 2017. “Housing Assistance Programs and Adult Health in \nthe United States.” American Journal of Public Health 107(4): 571-578. \n24 Ahrens, Katherine A., Haley, Barbara A., Rossen, Lauren M., Lloyd, Patricia C., and Aoki, Yutaka. \n2016. “Housing Assistance and Blood Lead Levels: Children in the United States.” American Journal of \nPublic Health 106(11): 2049-2056; Chiofalo, Jacqueline M., Golub, Maxine, Crump, Casey, and Calman, \nNeil. 2019. “Pediatric Blood Lead Levels Within New York City Public Versus Private Housing, 2003-\n2017.” American Journal of Public Health 109(6): 906-911. \n25 Ruel, Erin, Oakley, Deirdre, Wilson, G.

Employment outcomes and earnings. A variety of research indicates that \nliving in federally-assisted housing either has no effect or improves employment outcomes and \nearnings. Despite the frequent location of federally-assisted housing in neighborhoods with high \nrates of poverty, which might be associated with reduced labor force activity, analysis of \nemployment outcomes in the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (MSCUI) found no \nrelationship between living in public housing and labor force activity.30 However, in a study that \nfocused on the effects of living in public housing for a time between 1968 and 1982 on outcomes \nfor young adults, researchers found that every year of residence in public housing between the \nages of 10 and 16 increased the probability of working by seven percentage points when the \nyouth was between the ages of 25 through 27.31 The result of this increased chance of \nemployment increased annual earnings by $1,860.32  \n40.  Based on a particularly strong longitudinal research design that compares \nthe earnings of siblings from around the United States who lived in public housing for different \nlengths of time, the most recent study focused on the relationship between living in federally-\nassisted housing and earnings found that living in assisted housing as a teenager has a positive \nassociation with higher earnings and lower rates of incarceration as an adult. Females receive \n                                                 \n29 Jacob, Brian A. 2004. “Public Housing, Housing Vouchers, and Student Achievement: Evidence from \nPublic Housing Demolitions in Chicago.” American Economic Review 94(1): 233-258. \n30 Reingold, David A., Van Ryzin, Gregg G., and Ronda, Michelle. 2001. “Does Urban Public Housing \nDiminish the Social Capital and Labor Force Activity of Its Tenants?” Journal of Policy Analysis and \nManagement 20(3): 485-504. \n31 Newman, Sandra J. and Harkness, Joseph M. 2002. “The Long-Term Effects of Public Housing on \nSelf-Sufficiency.” Journal of Policy Analysis and Management 21(1): 21-43. \n32 Ibid. \n17 \nAdd17\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 19 of 58\nabout a five percent increase in earnings for each additional year in either public housing or \nvoucher housing, while males receive about a five percent increase in earnings for each \nadditional year in public housing and a 2.6 percent increase in earnings for each additional year \nin voucher housing.33 Each additional year of living in public housing as a teenager increased \nestimated total discounted lifetime pre-tax earnings by $45,400 for females and $47,300 for \nmales.34 For each additional year of living in voucher-assisted housing as a teenager, the \nestimated total discounted lifetime pre-tax earnings increased by $43,600 for females and \n$24,100 for males.35 Based on assumptions about increased tax revenues due to the increased \nestimated total discounted lifetime pre-tax earnings attributable to living in assisted housing and \nthe cost to the federal government of providing a subsidy for assisted housing, the study \nconcludes that providing public housing and voucher programs are nearly cost-neutral.36 It is \nimportant to point out that the study likely underestimates the benefit of federally-assisted \nhousing because it only estimates the intergenerational financial benefit to the federal \ngovernment from providing assisted housing to poor families. With increased lifetime earnings, \nindividuals who lived in assisted-housing as teenagers will probably be less likely to use welfare \nbenefits as adults.37 \n                                                 \n33 Andersson, Fredrik, Haltiwanger, John C., Kutzbach, Mark J., Palloni, Giordano E., Pollakowski, \nHenry O., and Weinberg, Daniel H. 2018. “Childhood Housing and Adult Earnings: A Between-Siblings \nAnalysis of Housing Vouchers and Public Housing.” NBER Working Paper Series, Working Paper 22721 \n(https://www.nber.org/papers/w22721). \n34 Ibid. \n35 Ibid. \n36 Ibid. \n37  One concern registered about Federal housing programs is that using assisted housing discourages \nemployment and encourages dependence on government benefits. A review of the available early \nscholarship on the relationship between living in assisted housing and employment found no relationship \nbetween the two. Shroder, Mark. 2002. “Does Housing Assistance Perversely Affect Self-Sufficiency? A \nReview Essay.” Journal of Housing Economics 11(4): 381-417. A more recent study found a small \nsuppressive effect of using a voucher on labor supply and earnings, though this study is limited to public \nhousing residents in Chicago raising questions about its external validity. Jacob, Brian A. and Ludwig, \n18 \nAdd18\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 20 of 58\n41.   Other benefits. Emerging evidence indicates that children growing up in \nassisted housing have relatively small chances of returning to assisted housing as adults38 and \nliving in public housing has no effect on teenage parenthood for females and may decrease the \nprobability of teenage parenthood for males.39 For families receiving housing assistance as well \nas cash assistance (“welfare”) benefits, receiving federal housing assistance does not appear to \nhave a positive relationship with remaining on welfare40 and there is some evidence that living in \npublic housing as a child reduces welfare use as an adult by 0.70 of a year.41 More recent \nresearch indicates that welfare use among families living in assisted housing declined after \nmoving into assisted housing, although the rate of welfare use still exceeded that of families not \nliving in assisted housing.42 \n42.  At least two causal mechanisms could explain the relationship between \nliving in assisted housing and better health outcomes, educational achievement and increased \nemployment and earnings.  \n                                                 \nJens. 2012. “The Effects of Housing Assistance on Labor Supply: Evidence from a Voucher Lottery.” \nAmerican Economic Review 102(1): 272-304.

First, evidence suggests that families living in voucher-supported housing \nare less prone to moving43 and have more stable household compositions.44 Moving, particularly \nwhen it is precipitated by economic necessity or stress, is associated with increased anxiety and \ndepression.45 Other measures of housing insecurity, such as doubling up, overcrowding, and \nfrequent moves, are associated with poor health outcomes for children, including food insecurity, \nlower weight, and developmental risk.46 Women experiencing eviction, a particularly dramatic \nform of housing insecurity, experienced difficulty obtaining necessities and were more likely to \nexperience depression, poor health outcomes and parenting stress.47 Finally, frequent moves that \ninclude a change in schools for children are associated with poor education outcomes for \nchildren.48 Increased residential stability that accompanies living in assisted housing may \npromote better health and educational outcomes for children, and improved mental and physical \nhealth for adults, eventually leading to better economic outcomes. \n                                                 \n43 Berger, Lawrence M., Heintze, Theresa, Naidich, Wendy B., and Meyers, Marcia K. 2008. “Subsidized \nHousing and Household Hardship among Low-Income Single-Mother Households.” Journal of Marriage \nand the Family 70:934-949; Gubits, Danile et al. 2016. “Family Options Study: 3-Year Impacts of \nHousing and Services Interventions for Homeless Families.” Office of Policy Development and Research: \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \n44 Carlson, Deven, Haveman, Robert, Kaplan, Thomas, and Wolfe, Barbara. 2012. “Long-Term Effects of \nPublic Low-Income Housing Vouchers on Neighborhood Quality and Household Composition.” Journal \nof Housing Economics 21(2): 101-120. \n45 Burgard, Sarah A., Kristin S.

Second, living in assisted housing is associated with decreased housing \ncost burden, allowing households to spend a larger proportion of their household incomes on \nother household expenses that may lead to improved educational, health and economic outcomes. \nFor example, a family spending around 30 percent of its income on housing is associated with \nincreased investment in enrichment activities for children, leading to higher cognitive \noutcomes.49 Similarly, living in assisted housing is associated with less material hardship, \nincluding food insecurity, residential overcrowding, and postponed healthcare investments, \nresulting in better health and behavioral outcomes for children.50 In turn, these outcomes are \nrelated to improved educational outcomes, which lead to better employment and earnings \noutcomes. \nIV.  The Effect of the Final Rule on Immigrant Use of Assisted Housing \n45.  The Final Rule requires immigration officials at DHS to determine \nwhether applicants for adjustment of status not exempt from public charge are currently enrolled \nin a Federal housing program that supplies them with a housing subsidy or whether they are \nlikely to be enrolled in such a program and receive a subsidy at any point in the future.51  \nAccordingly, of those persons currently eligible to adjust, or who will be eligible in the future, \nthe Final Rule will likely have a greater impact on those noncitizens predicted to be likely to \nreceive Federal housing benefits at any time in the future than those who are currently receiving \nFederal housing benefits and who are applying for adjustment. The reasoning behind this \n                                                 \n49 Newman, Sandra J. and Holupka, C.

Counsel has asked me for purposes of this declaration to base my \nprojections of harm on the numbers provided by DHS in the Regulatory Impact Analysis \n(“RIA”) accompanying the Final Rule.52 I reserve the right to provide additional analyses using \ndifferent assumptions at a later date.  \n47.  DHS estimates that 8,801 households will disenroll from public housing, \nthe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, or the Project Based Section 8 Rental \nAssistance Program.  DHS arrives at this number using the fact that 6.97 percent of the U.S. \npopulation is a foreign-born noncitizen (based on the 2012-2016 American Community Survey \n(ACS) 5-year Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau). DHS multiplies this percentage by \n5,051,000, the number of households residing in federally subsidized housing, to arrive at \n352,055 as the number of households residing in federally-subsidized housing that contain at \nleast one noncitizen. DHS further assumes that noncitizens that adjust their visa status and \ntrigger a public charge review and determination by immigration officials at USCIS will be \naffected by the Final Rule. They estimate that approximately 2.5 percent of the foreign-born \nadjust their status on an annual basis. To determine the number of households that are likely to \ndisenroll, DHS multiplies 2.5 percent and 352,055 households with at least one noncitizen to \narrive at a figure of 8,801. They do not estimate the number or citizenship status of people living \n                                                 \n52 “Regulatory Impact Analysis,” Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Final Rule (8 CFR Parts \n103, 212, 213, 214, 245, and 248), RIN: 1615-AA22, CIS No. 2637-19, DHS Docket No.: USCIS-2010-\n0012, August 2019.  \n22 \nAdd22\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 24 of 58\nin these families, nor do they attempt to estimate the costs or harm that disenrollment will create \nfor these families or individuals.  \n48.  As discussed below, the harm caused by 8,801 households disenrolling \nfrom federally-assisted housing benefits is substantial. There are multiple reasons to assume that \nthe actual harm is likely to be greater and to view the 8,801 estimate as very conservative.  \n49.  First, the Final Rule indicates that immigration officials will assess the use \nof benefits over a three year period when determining whether an immigrant should be \ndesignated a public charge. Using the logic DHS describes —that is, 2.5 percent of people will \ndisenroll annually—it would be more appropriate to assume 7.5 percent of foreign born \nnoncitizens would disenroll from a benefit at some point in a given three-year period. This would \neffectively triple DHS’s estimate of households that would disenroll from public housing and \nmore closely match the estimate produced by HUD of the number of households living in \nfederally subsidized housing that include at least one non-eligible immigrant (about 25,000).53 \n50.  Second, DHS's use of the 6.97 percent of the foreign born population to \nestimate the number of noncitizen households residing in federally subsidized housing is likely \nto result in an underestimation of the households containing at least one noncitizen residing \ntherein and consequently the number of individuals and households affected by the Final Rule. \nUsing this figure to produce the estimates involves two faulty assumptions. The first mistake is \nto assume that the distribution of noncitizens in the U.S. population matches the distribution of \nnoncitizens enrolled for or using one of the non-cash benefits named in the Final Rule (SNAP, \nMedicaid, and Federal housing programs). According to 2017 ACS data, 35 percent of \nhouseholds that contain at least one foreign born member are headed by noncitizens. Among \n                                                 \n53  “Housing and Community Development Act of 1980: Verification of Eligible Status, Regulatory \nImpact Analysis.” Docket No. FR-6124-P-01, April 15, 2019. \n23 \nAdd23\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 25 of 58\nhouseholds eligible to live in federally-assisted housing, 46 percent of households that contain at \nleast one foreign born member are headed by noncitizens. Being eligible to live in public housing \nis different than actually living in public housing, but the larger proportion of noncitizens in the \neligible pool suggests that DHS underestimates the households with at least one noncitizen in its \nanalysis. The second mistake is to assume that the 6.97 percent of the population who are \nnoncitizens are the only residents that will disenroll due to the Final Rule. Evidence suggests that \nnoncitizens are not alone in changing their behavior because of the Final Rule. A report by \nresearchers at the Urban Institute indicates that noncitizen legal permanent residents and \nnaturalized citizens withdrew from public benefits named in the Final Rule or declared that they \nwould not apply, despite the fact that their immigration status would not be affected by the Final \nRule.54   \n51.  These flaws in the methodology used by DHS to estimate the chilling \neffect on foreign-born resident use of federally subsidized housing due to the Final Rule suggest \na significant underestimate by DHS of the chilling effect related to the Final Rule. \n52.  Although I adopt DHS’s definition of the chilling effect as a dynamic that \ncauses disenrollment for the purposes of this declaration, other studies have noted that the Final \nRule is also likely to cause noncitizens to refrain from applying for benefits implicated by the \nFinal Rule.55  DHS does not estimate the number of people who would not apply to Federal \n                                                 \n54 Bernstein, Hamutal, Gonzalez, Dulce, Karpman, Michael, and Zuckerman, Stephen. 2019. “One in \nSeven Adults in Immigrant Families Reported Avoiding Public Benefit Programs in 2018.” Washington, \nDC: The Urban Institute. (https://www.urban.org/research/publication/one-seven-adults-immigrant-\nfamilies-reported-avoiding-public-benefit-programs-2018, accessed on August 28, 2019). \n55 Based on research results from a study by the Urban Institute that documented adults living in \nhouseholds with at least one foreign-born member reporting disenrolling from or choosing to not apply to \nfederal benefit programs named in the Final Rule, individuals eligible for Federal housing programs by \nvirtue of their family incomes will likely choose to not apply to Federal housing programs due to \nconcerns about how the Final Rule could affect their immigration status or the immigration status of a \n24 \nAdd24\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 26 of 58\nhousing programs due to the Final Rule. Nonetheless, the omission of such an estimate from \nDHS’s analysis is another reason the agency’s estimates should be viewed as conservative. In \nfuture analyses of the chilling effect I may elect to calculate a different chilling effect, using \ndifferent data and a different methodology.  \n53.  Using the DHS calculation of 8,801 households that would disenroll from \nFederal housing programs due to Final Rule, I can quantify some of the categories of harm, \nbeyond the immediate harm to the individuals forced to move from their homes after \ndisenrolling.  \n54.  Loss of lifetime earnings. Given the benefits associated with living in \nfederal housing, discussed above in Part III, the chilling effect associated with the Final Rule will \nbe costly for the people who, absent the implementation of the Final Rule, would have continued \nto live in federal housing. Recent research estimates a substantial increase in life-time earnings \nfor each additional year that a teenager lives in either public housing or voucher-assisted \nhousing.56 While there are also benefits for young children and adults who live in federal \nhousing, the estimates of increased lifetime earnings for teenagers allow me to make a \nconservative estimate of the future harm that will occur for people that disenroll from Federal \nhousing programs because of the chilling effect of the Final Rule. \n                                                 \nfamily member.

The increased lifetime earnings (discounted to 2000 U.S. dollars) for each \nadditional year that a teenager (aged 13-18) lives in public housing is $24,700 for females and \n$25,700 for males, or an average of $25,200.57 The increased lifetime earnings (discounted to \n2000 U.S. dollars) for each additional year that a teenager lives in voucher-housing is $23,700 \nfor females and $13,100 for males, or an average of $18,400.58 According to Table 1 in Exhibit \nB, public housing and Project-Based Section 8 housing units together accounted for about 47.6 \npercent of federal housing units, while vouchers accounted for 52.4 percent of federal housing \nunits.59 Using these proportions, a weighted average of the life-time earnings for each additional \nyear that a teenager lives in federal housing is $21,637.  The lifetime earnings figures in this \nparagraph are discounted to present value. \n56.  Given that families with children live in public housing for an average of \nfour years,60 I assume that teenagers who are 13 and 14 live in federal housing for four years \nbefore moving out. For teenagers aged 15, 16, 17, and 18, I assume that they live in federal \nhousing for 4, 3, 2, and 1 years respectively. Given variation in length of stay in Federal housing \nprograms by jurisdiction, using this approach will likely underestimate the number of years that \nteenagers between the ages of 13 and 14 stay in housing in New York and especially the high \nrent, low vacancy market of New York City. As a result, this approach will likely underestimate \nthe lifetime earnings that these teens could expect to earn if they had not disenrolled from \nFederal housing programs. \n                                                 \n57 Ibid. \n58 Ibid. \n59 I assume that Project-Based Section 8 are more similar to public housing than they are to HCVs, so I \ntreat them as public housing units for the purposes of understanding what effect living in a Project-Based \nSection 8 unit will have on a teenagers life-time earnings. \n60 McClure, Kirk. 2018. “Length of Stay in Assisted Housing.” Cityscape 20(1): 11-38. \n(https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26381219). \n26 \nAdd26\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 28 of 58\n57.  Estimating the lifetime earnings that do not accrue to teenagers because \nthey are chilled from living in federal housing due to the Final Rule is a simple matter of \narithmetic: ((number of 13-year olds chilled from federal housing x 4 years x $21,637) + \n(number of 14-year olds chilled from federal housing x 4 years x $21,637) + (number of 15-year \nolds chilled from federal housing x 4 years x $21,637) + (number of 16-year olds chilled from \nfederal housing x 3 years x $21,637) + (number of 17-year olds chilled from federal housing x 2 \nyears x $21,637) + (number of 18-year olds chilled from federal housing x 1 year x $21,637)) = \nforegone lifetime earnings.  \n58.  To estimate foregone lifetime earnings it is necessary to calculate the \nnumber of people living in the 8,801 families that DHS estimates will disenroll from Federal \nhousing programs if the Final Rule is implemented. To produce this estimate, I use the ACS 50 \npercent of AMI sample to calculate the average family size of families eligible to live in Federal \nhousing programs. ACS data indicate that 18,352,744 people in the United States live in \n6,400,436 families that contain at least one foreign-born member and earn less than 50 percent of \nAMI.61 Therefore, the average family size among this population in the United States is 2.87 \n(18,352,744 / 6,400,436 = 2.867). Using this average family size estimate for the U.S., the 8,801 \nfamilies estimated to disenroll from Federal housing programs by DHS contain 25,232 people \n(8,801 x 2.87 = 25,232). \n59.  To estimate foregone earnings for the people included in the national \nestimate from DHS I need to calculate the number of people aged 13 to 18 in the estimated \n                                                 \n61 The population estimate comes from Table 2 in Exhibit B. The number of families is based on the \nauthor’s analysis of 2017 ACS and HUD determined family income limits based on 50 percent AMI. \nSteven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas and Matthew \nSobek.

Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2019. \nhttps://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V9.0. \n27 \nAdd27\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 29 of 58\nchilled population of 25,232 people. To achieve this I use the ACS 50 percent AMI data on the \ndistribution of teenagers in the eligible population in Table 3 in Exhibit B. I divide the number of \n13 through 18 year olds in this population by the total population amount to calculate the \nproportion of the total population that is each age. Next I multiply the proportion of each age \ngroup by the chilled population estimated by DHS (25,232) to determine the number of people \nfor each age in the population. I present these results in Table 4 in Exhibit B.  \n60.  Once I have estimated the number of teenagers in this population it is a \nsimple matter of arithmetic to estimate the total foregone earnings among teenagers that DHS \nestimates would disenroll from Federal housing programs ((number of 13 year olds x 4 years x \n$21,637) + …+ (number of 18 year olds x 1 year x $21,637)). For the United States, the foregone \nearnings total $183,569,800.  \n61.  As stated earlier, it is also important to note that DHS estimates of the \nnumber of people subject to a chilling effect are likely to be an underestimate. The Urban \nInstitute’s report indicates that nearly 20 percent of adults living in low income families reported \ndisenrolling from or choosing to not apply to federal non-cash benefits named in the Final Rule \n(compared to 13.7 percent in the overall sample).62 Since families living in Federal housing \nprograms are low income, they may disenroll at greater rates than the 2.5 rate DHS estimates. \n62.  With these limitations in mind, the analysis of the chilling effect presented \nin this declaration has erred on the side of caution by using conservative estimates of the chilling \neffect. I also confine my estimates of the foregone earnings to teenagers disenrolling from \nFederal housing programs due to the Final Rule despite the fact that the benefits of public \n                                                 \n62 Bernstein, Hamutal, Gonzalez, Dulce, Karpman, Michael, and Zuckerman, Stephen. 2019. “One in \nSeven Adults in Immigrant Families Reported Avoiding Public Benefit Programs in 2018.” Washington, \nDC: The Urban Institute.

In this declaration I come to the conclusion that implementation of the \nFinal Rule will result in harm to families that disenroll from Federal housing programs because \nthey fear that remaining in these programs will affect their immigration status or the immigration \nstatus of a family member. Because living in Federal housing programs confers substantial \nbenefits to residents, disenrolling will cause these individuals to experience substantial costs, \nincluding worse educational outcomes, lower earnings, and poorer health. Using the DHS \nestimate of chilling effect, I estimate that the foregone lifetime earnings of the teenagers who \nwould disenroll due to the Final Rule would be $183,569,800. \n \n29 \nAdd29\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 31 of 58\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on this~  day of~ ' 2019. \nAdd30\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 54 of 58\n \n \n \n \n \nEXHIBIT B \nAdd31\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 55 of 58\n \nTable 1: Characteristics of Federally Subsidized Housing Programs \n \nHousing Choice  Project Based  Summary of All \nPublic Housing Vouchers Section 8 HUD Programs\nUnited States\nSubsidized units available           1,015,505           2,527,803           1,284,354           5,035,824\nTotal number of residents           1,985,172           5,259,207           2,063,641           9,535,360\nPeople per unit                        2.1                        2.3                        1.7                        2.1\nHousehold income per year \n(mean) $              15,183 $              14,863 $              12,863 $              14,347\n% very low income (< 50% \nAMI) 91 95 96 94\nConnecticut\nSubsidized units available                 14,104                 42,329                 23,731                 82,830\nTotal number of residents                 25,824                 87,246                 36,173               152,497\nPeople per unit                        2.0                        2.3                        1.6                        2.0\nHousehold income per year \n(mean) $              15,986 $              16,722 $              15,172 $              16,090\n% very low income (< 50% \nAMI)                          96                         9 6                         9 9                         9 7\nNew York\nSubsidized units available               200,076               258,322               107,384               592,467\nTotal number of residents               408,772               526,365               169,931           1,134,562\nPeople per unit                        2.2                        2.3                        1.7                        2.1\nHousehold income per year \n(mean) $              22,550 $              17,318 $              17,260 $              19,046\n% very low income (< 50% \nAMI)                          87                         9 5                         9 4                         9 2\nVermont\nSubsidized units available                   1 ,291                   7 ,756                   3 ,392                 12,866\nTotal number of residents                   2 ,035                 13,589                   4 ,851                 20,911\nPeople per unit                        1.7                        2.0                        1.5                        1.8\nHousehold income per year \n(mean) $              16,722 $              15,431 $              15,624 $              15,579\n% very low income (< 50% \nAMI)                          93                         9 5                         9 3                         9 5\nNew York City\nSubsidized units available               170,039               146,134                 62,785               393,993\nTotal number of residents               357,293               292,078               106,883               773,577\nPeople per unit                        2.2                        2.3                        1.8                        2.1\nHousehold income per year \n(mean) $              23,534 $              17,830 $              18,658 $              20,388\n% very low income (< 50% \nAMI)                          87                         9 5                         9 2                         9 1  \nNote: Picture of Subsidized Housing (POSH), Department of Housing and Community Development, \n2018 (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/assthsg.html). \nAdd32\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-1   Filed 09/09/19   Page 56 of 58\n \nTable 2: People Living in Households with a Foreign-Born Person, Eligible to Live in Federal Housing \n(50% AMI), 2017 \n \nLower  Upper \nEstimate Bound Bound\nNative-Born Citizen      7,464,412      7,334,584      7,594,240\nForeign-Born \nNaturalized Citizen      4,409,184      4,346,268      4,472,100\nForeign-Born Non-\nCitizen      6,479,148      6,371,779      6,586,517\nTotal    18,352,744    18,143,312    18,562,176\n \n \nNote: Based on author’s analysis of 2017 ACS and HUD determined family income limits based on 50% \narea median incomes.

In May of 2019, I was nominated by Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont to serve \nas DSS Commissioner. I have served as Commissioner-Designate since June 21, 2019, pending \nconfirmation by the Connecticut General Assembly. Immediately before assuming my current role, \nI served as Deputy Director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) at the federal \nCenters for Medicaid and Medicare Services, an office within the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services. I have also been Medicaid Director in the Rhode Island Executive Office of \nHealth and Human Services and Director of State Policy and Programs at the National Association \nof Medicaid Directors (NAMD). \n4.  Created in 1993 when the Connecticut General Assembly merged two existing state \nagencies, DSS is charged by statute with administering key social support programs including, but \nnot limited to: Medicaid; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF); energy assistance for low-income families (LIHEAP); \nstate supplements to the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program (State Supplement); \nand federally-funded assistance programs for refugees and asylees. The DSS Commissioner is \nauthorized to establish rules, regulations, and policies to carry out the Department's statutory \nresponsibilities, including administering and operationalizing rules, regulations, and policies that \ndetermine how public assistance programs are provided in Connecticut. \n5.  DSS is working towards a Connecticut where every resident has the opportunity to \nbe  healthy,  secure,  and  thriving.  We  fulfill  our  mission  of enhancing  the  well-being  of \nConnecticut's individuals, families, and communities through delivering and funding a wide range \nof health and human services programs and services.  Every year,  we  serve  about  1 million \nAdd37\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford / 3 \nConnecticut residents of all ages - approximately 28% of the state's total population - across all \nof the state's 169 cities and towns. \n6.  DSS delivers services to Connecticut residents through more than 1,700 full-time \nstaff members working at a central office and 12 field offices across the state. To promote easy \nand seamless  access  for  residents,  DSS  has created a web  portal,  ConneCT, through which \nresidents can obtain information about, apply for, and manage their participation in many of the \ncritical services and supports that DSS provides. In compliance with the Affordable Care Act, DSS \nhas also created a system to support state-based marketplace determinations of eligibility for \nMedicaid, CHIP, and qualified health plans (QHPs). The state-based marketplace is operated in \nconjunction with our partner, Access Health CT. \n7.  I am aware of, and strongly oppose, the public charge rule (the \"Final Rule\" or the \n\"Rule\") promulgated by the federal Department of Homeland Security. I understand that, among \nmany troubling provisions, the Final Rule instructs immigration officials to consider an expanded \nrange of public benefits in determining whether an immigrant is subject to a public charge inquiry. \nThat  expanded  range  of benefits,  in  my  understanding,  would  include  Medicaid  and  the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Both of those programs are administered in \nConnecticut by DSS. \n8.  The Final Rule will severely and irreparably harm Connecticut and its residents. \nDSS strives to make Connecticut and its residents healthier and more economically secure. The \nFinal Rule will directly frustrate those goals, leaving our residents less healthy and less secure, and \ndamaging our statewide economy. \n9.  The Rule will disincentivize immigrants and their families from participating in \npublic benefits programs. And many immigrants who are not directly implicated by the Rule will, \nAdd38\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford / 4 \nout of fear or confusion, disenroll from or avoid enrolling in public benefits programs. The rules \nfor determining whether someone is a \"public charge\" are technical and complex, and so are the \neligibility rules for many of the benefits programs in which immigrants and their families may \nparticipate. For instance: In Connecticut, Medicaid-a benefit susceptible to public charge analysis \n- and CHIP - a benefit that is excluded from the analysis under the Final Rule - are both known \nas HUSKY. (They are called \"HUSKY A\" and \"HUSKY B,\" respectively.) Potential recipients \napply for both benefits through the same portal. It seems likely that many recipients do not know \nthe distinction: Instead, they simply know that they receive public health insurance benefits, and \nthat those benefits are now under threat. \n10.  So the number oflow-income immigrant families that choose not to receive benefits \nif the Final Rule is implemented would likely exceed - by a sizable amount - the number that \nwould ultimately be subject to a \"public charge\" determination. Analysis of American Community \nSurvey  data  suggests  that  nearly  200,000  Connecticut residents  - fully  5.6%  of our  state's \npopulation - could be deterred, or \"chilled,\" from participating in public benefits programs. This \npopulation  comprises  non-citizen residents  of Connecticut,  and  their  family  members,  with \nincomes less than 250% of the federal poverty level - residents who are likely to qualify for \nbenefits that DSS delivers and therefore likely to experience hunger and endure unmet health needs \nif they are deterred from participating. \n11.  By disincentivizing, discouraging, and frightening families away from accessing \nvital health and food benefits, the Rule will leave up to 200,000 individuals in Connecticut, \nincluding children who are U.S. citizens, vulnerable to a lack of preventive health care or nutritious \nfoods - benefits that have been shown to improve both short- and long-term health for individuals \nAdd39\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford / 5 \nand advance population-scale public health interests such as curbing the spread of communicable \ndiseases and reducing chronic health conditions. \n12.  In addition to the projected public health harms, analysts project that because of \nenrollment losses in federally-subsidized programs,  states will suffer cuts  in  federal funding, \nsignificant economic ripple effects, and thousands oflostjobs because of the Final Rule. The Fiscal \nPolicy Institute looked at the results for Connecticut, and all 49 other states, if the potentially \nchilled  population avoids  benefits  because  of the  Rule.  Even a low-end  estimate of a  15% \ndisemollment rate in SNAP and Medicaid among the potentially-chilled population as a result of \nthe rule is calculated to cost the state $79 million in federal funding; $154 million in economic \nripple effects; and  1,046 jobs lost. If benefits disenrollment hits the higher-end mark of 35%, \nConnecticut will suffer a $183 million drop in federal funding; $359 million in ripple effects; and \nthe loss of 2,441 jobs. \n13.  Finally, implementing the Rule would force DSS to expend resources and take on \nother administrative burdens that it cannot recover. \nBy Reducing SNAP Participation, the Final Rule Will Cause Irreparable Harm to the Health \nand Wellbeing of Connecticut Residents and to the State's Economy \n14.  The purpose of the federally-funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(SNAP) is to reduce hunger and malnutrition by supplementing the food purchasing of eligible \nlow-income individuals and families, including low-income working people, senior citizens, and \nthe disabled. SNAP eligibility and benefit levels are based on household size, income, and other \nfactors, including immigration status. \n15.  SNAP provides nutrition for some of Connecticut's most vulnerable residents; lifts \nfamilies out of poverty; and boosts our state economy. Reducing  SNAP participation without \nAdd40\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 6 \nreducing underlying poverty will irreparably harm the health of the state's residents and damage \nour economy. \n16.  Over the course of CY 2018, a total of 493,600 Connecticut residents-nearly 14% \nof the state population-received SNAP benefits, including 168,489 children under the age of 18. \nEach month during CY 2018, on average nearly 16,000 non-citizens including over 3,000 non \ncitizen children received SNAP benefits. Over 5% of SNAP recipients lived in households with at \nleast one non-citizen. \n17.  SNAP is narrowly targeted to help Connecticut's most vulnerable residents. In \nFiscal Year 2017, 73% of Connecticut's SNAP households had incomes below the federal poverty \nline - including 32% of recipients whose incomes were at or below 50% of the poverty line. \nBetween 2009 and 2012 -the most recent years for which such data is available - SNAP lifted an \naverage of 70,000 Connecticut residents out of poverty every year. \n18.  The  Final  Rule will  disincentivize  and discourage  Connecticut residents from \nparticipating in SNAP, whether or not their immigration status is actually implicated by the rule. \nIndividuals whose immigration status is subject to the Final Rule will likely be disincentivized \nfrom applying for or continuing to receive those benefits implicated by the Final Rule, including \nSNAP. Additionally, policy experts agree that individuals whose immigration status may not be \nimplicated by the Final Rule could also forgo benefits that the Final Rule covers - like SNAP -\nbecause of fear or confusion.  DSS  expects that the  Final Rule will drive  many Connecticut \nresidents to disenroll, or to refrain from enrolling, in SNAP. \n19.  By disincentivizing enrollment or continued participation in SNAP, the Final Rule \nwill likely result in food insecurity for a large population of immigrants and their families in \nConnecticut. Food insecurity generally means that individuals have challenges meeting basic food \nAdd41\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 7 \nneeds because of a lack of money or resources.  Food insecurity is  costly for individuals and \nfamilies.  Because of food  insecurity,  individuals may face  poor  physical  and mental  health, \nreduced nutrient intake, and an increase in the likelihood of experiencing chronic diseases. \n20.  SNAP  is  particularly important for  children,  and  depriving  children and  their \nfamilies of SNAP does lifelong damage. Research shows that children of immigrants who receive \nSNAP benefits are more likely to be in good or excellent health, be food secure, and reside in \nstable housing. Compared to children in immigrant families without SNAP, families with children \nwho participate in the program have more resources to afford medical care and prescription \nmedications. Each additional year of SNAP eligibility for young children with immigrant parents \nis associated with health benefits in later childhood and adolescence. \n21.  By reducing SNAP participation, the Final Rule will also harm our state's economy. \nIn 2017, the average Connecticut SNAP household member received $133 in monthly benefits. In \ntotal that year, Connecticut SNAP recipients  spent $653.08  million  at  some  2,600  approved \nauthorized retail locations. Those expenditures buoyed the state's economy: USDA's Economic \nResearch  Service  has  shown  that  for  every  dollar  in  SNAP  benefits  received,  there  is  an \napproximate $1.79 in increased economic activity, and every billion dollars in SNAP benefits \ncreates between 8,900 and 17,900 full-time jobs. \nBy Reducing Medicaid Enrollment, the Final Rule Will Cause Irreparable Harm to the \nHealth and Wellbeing of Connecticut Residents and to the State's Economy \n22.  DSS  supports  the  medical,  dental,  and  behavioral  health  of nearly  850,000 \nConnecticut residents through administering the HUSKY Health programs, which include both \nMedicaid and  the  Children's  Health  Insurance  Program.  In  CY  2018,  566,045  Connecticut \nresidents participated in Medicaid (called \"HUSKY A\" in Connecticut), and 31,672 Connecticut \nresidents participated in CHIP (\"Husky B \"). \nAdd42\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 8 \n23.  Medicaid  is  an  important  source  of primary  health  insurance  coverage  and \nsupplementary coverage for low-income residents and the most vulnerable Connecticut residents. \nMedicaid enrollees do  not pay premiums and have little to  no  out-of-pocket costs for many \nservices. \n24.  In Connecticut, nearly 161,000 citizen-children under the age of 18 have at least \none foreign-born parent. An estimated 45,000 children with noncitizen parents -including children \nwho are either naturalized or U.S.-born - participate in Medicaid or CHIP. As I noted above: \nAnalysts have estimated that the Final Rule may deter 15%-35% of such eligible children from \nparticipating  in  Medicaid  and  CHIP,  meaning  that  up  to  15,750  U.S.  citizen  children  in \nConnecticut may lose health care coverage under the Rule.  Furthermore, the total number of \nConnecticut children otherwise eligible for Medicaid who may lose coverage due to confusion and \nconcern about the Rule is likely to be greater, because Connecticut is one of the states that opts to \nprovide Medicaid insurance for lawfully present immigrant children under the age of 21, without \nregard to the 5-year waiting period for qualified aliens. \n25.  Medicaid and  CHIP have helped reduce the number  of uninsured Connecticut \nresidents. In Connecticut, the uninsured rate for people making less than 200% of the Federal \nPoverty Level fell from 27% in 2013 to 15% in 2017, while the overall uninsured rate fell from \n9% to 6%. But the final rule, by deterring Medicaid and CHIP participation, will reverse this \nimportant public health progress. \n26.  Some people who are kept from Medicaid access by the Final Rule will likely go \nwithout coverage, with negative effects for their own health and productivity and the health and \nproductivity of their families. \nAdd43\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 9 \n27.  Diminished public health. By decreasing access to health insurance, the Final Rule \nwill leave many Connecticut residents without preventive care, potentially leading to more acute \nand less treatable conditions in the future. Access to health insurance also improves the likelihood \nthat patients receive recommended and potentially life-saving care. Studies have also shown that \nexpanded Medicaid is associated with positive outcomes including lower mortality rates, higher \ncancer detection rates, and lower infant mortality rates. \n28.  Harms  to  maternal health.  Medicaid  also  provides  essential  prenatal  care  to \npregnant women, covering a full  spectrum of prenatal and postpartum care services that are \ntypically associated with positive health outcomes for mothers and children. Although the Final \nRule excludes pregnant women who access Medicaid, because of the Final Rule's chilling effect, \nincluding Medicaid as a public benefit for purposes of a public charge determination could induce \npregnant immigrants to refuse crucial prenatal care. Inadequate prenatal care increases the risk of \npremature birth, low birth weight, and a range of poor health outcomes for babies who, in many \ninstances, will be U.S. citizens. \n29.  Harms to children's health. Although it excludes Medicaid coverage received by \nchildren under 21  years  of age  from  the  definition of \"public benefit,\" the  Final Rule will \nnevertheless discourage parents from enrolling their eligible children in Medicaid. By confusing \nand  intimidating  parents,  the  Rule  will  negatively  impact long-term outcomes  for  children, \nincluding education and employment - both of which contribute to self-sufficiency and decrease \nthe likelihood of needing public assistance in the future. Children's well-being is inseparable from \ntheir parents' and families' well-being, so help received by parents is central to children's health \nand well-being in the short- and long-term. Children thrive when their parents can access needed \nhealth care, and when their families have enough to eat and a roof over their heads. Conversely, \nAdd44\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 11 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 10 \nparents' stress and health challenges impede effective caregiving and can undermine children's \ndevelopment. A parent's lack of access to health insurance can jeopardize a child's health and \nperformance in school. \n30.  Without coverage, children will likely suffer the consequences of inconsistent well-\nchild visits  and primary  care,  resulting  in potentially serious health issues.  Instead of early \ntreatment for illness, children without health coverage will resort to emergency room visits for \ntreatment of more serious conditions, at a greater cost than doctor's office visits. \n31.  Lack of primary care for some children has a ripple effect in the community, putting \nevery child at risk.  For example:  Uninsured children are more likely to skip immunizations, \nincreasing the likelihood that communicable diseases will spread. \n32.  A less-productive woriforce. By disincentivizing Medicaid participation, the Rule \nwill reduce economic productivity and create instability in Connecticut's workforce. Having a \nreliable source of health insurance, such as Medicaid, improves individuals' overall health and \nwell-being. Workers who receive Medicaid report performing better in their jobs and feeling better \nprepared to seek a new or better job. Likewise, jobseekers report feeling better prepared to enter \nthe workforce when they have Medicaid coverage. Without stable, affordable health insurance, \nand the preventive care it provides, individuals that forgo Medicaid because of the Final Rule are \nlikely to spend more time suffering from preventable illnesses and thus missing work. Working \nparents are at increased risk of harm; not only is their own health at risk, but they may be forced \nto take time off from work to care for children who are sicker due to lack of preventive care. \n33.  Decreased financial self-sufficiency.  Workers with affordable health care - like \nMedicaid - enjoy improved financial well-being and self-sufficiency. Financial security and self \nsufficiency are improved when a person can pay their medical bills, and Medicaid coverage puts \nAdd45\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 12 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford / 11 \nfull payment within reach for many. Other studies have shown that insurance coverage results in \nhigher credit scores and lower medical debt, and reduces the probability of new bankruptcy filings. \nBy contrast, individuals without health insurance have a harder time paying their medical bills and \noverall have worse financial health than those with coverage. Immigrants who are saddled with \nmedical debt and low credit scores will be less likely to contribute to Connecticut's economic \ngrowth. \n34.  Rising costs ofh ealth care and other social supports. Of course, some Connecticut \nresidents who lose or are deterred from obtaining Medicaid coverage as a result of the Final Rule \nwill still receive care - but the cost of that care will be borne by individuals, hospitals, and state \nand local governments. And because people without health insurance tend to wait longer to seek \ncare during a health crisis, the care they eventually receive will be more costly, forcing state and \nlocal public health programs to undergo significant financial strain as immigrants rely on these \nexpensive services instead of Medicaid. Connecticut Medicaid has extensive preventative medical, \nbehavioral health and dental services, and has  greatly increased provider capacity to support \nmembers. These preventative services enable early identification of chronic and acute health care \nconditions; support effective self-management; and often eliminate or forestall the need for high \ncost hospital and nursing facility care. \n35.  Reducing low-income immigrants' access to Medicaid will leave many of them \ncovered only for care in hospital emergency departments. Not only will this exacerbate the costs \nof uncompensated care, but it will likely negatively influence people's work readiness and capacity \nto retain employment; compromise their ability to retain stable housing; and have cascade effects \non their overall economic security. In the absence of Medicaid benefits, people will likely fall back \nAdd46\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 13 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 12 \non  state,  local,  and  nonprofit  supports  - including  interventions  designed  to  respond  to \nhomelessness - that could otherwise be entirely avoided. \n36.  Increasing the number of uninsured patients will,  as  was the case historically, \nexpose hospitals to significant costs of uncompensated care, and will also reduce the overall pool \nof patients  being  served.  The  Affordable  Care  Act's  (ACA)  Medicaid  expansion  was  of \nconsiderable support to hospitals in providing health care coverage for over a quarter of a million \npeople in Connecticut, reducing uncompensated care. Medicaid expansion had an important role \nin mitigating hospital closures and improving the overall financial profile of hospitals, particularly \nin rural areas with higher rates of uninsured adults. The contraction of coverage that is likely to \nresult from implementation of this Rule could result in more hospital closures. \n37.  The Final Rule will also have a devastating impact on Connecticut's Federally \nQualified Health Centers (FQHCs). One analysis estimates the cost of the Rule to Connecticut \nFQHCs at between $4.4 million and $11.4 million, with dozens of employees being laid off and \nsignificant loss of care capacity as a result. \nThe  Final  Rule  Will  Impose  Significant  and  Unrecoverable  Costs  and  Administrative \nBurdens on DSS \n38.  The Final Rule will interfere with DSS' statutory obligations to assist vulnerable \nConnecticut families, and will create new and costly administrative and logistical burdens for the \nstate. \n39.  Information .collection and document production for the federal government. The \nFinal  Rule  will  burden  the  state  by  forcing  it  to  collect  information  and  produce  new \ndocumentation in response to federal government demands. The Rule appears to require applicants \nfor status adjustment to gather and submit detailed supporting documentation about public benefits \nthat they may have received. But DSS does not have such standardized historical documentation \nAdd47\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 14 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 13 \nreadily available. Developing standardized documentation of public benefits will be expensive and \ntime-consuming, and require work across multiple computer systems. Further, the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services will likely request additional information from benefit \ngranting agencies if it has insufficient information to determine whether a public charge bond has \nbeen breached. These requests from USCIS will create additional work for DSS with time needed \nto review, process, and respond to requests. \n40.  The  costs of enrollee churn.  The Rule will force DSS to expend resources on \nenrollee \"churn,\" to cover the transaction costs involved in participants leaving and re-enrolling in \nstate programs. If the Final Rule becomes effective, DSS anticipates that many immigrants and \nfamily members of immigrants will terminate their participation in programs like SNAP and \nMedicaid. But, because these programs meet vital needs for families, some of these families would \nlikely return to the caseload as services are needed, then request that assistance be discontinued at \na later time in an attempt to limit the negative consequences of receiving assistance for a prolonged \nperiod of time. This on-again-off-again enrollment not only yields negative results for families, \nbut also results in duplicative and expensive work for state agencies: In one study of SNAP-related \nchurn, the costs averaged $80 for each instance of churn that requires a new application. \n41.  Responding to consumer inquiries.  The 837-page Final Rule is overwhelmingly \ncomplex. Connecticut residents will be confused, and they will seek guidance and instruction from \nDSS. In response, DSS will experience increased call volume and walk-in traffic from consumers \nconcerned about the new policies. Advising a family on whether they would be subject to a public \ncharge determination and how receipt of various benefits might play out can require technical \nknowledge of immigration law beyond the expertise of most state employees or the state's call \nAdd48\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 15 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 14 \ncenter contractors. We anticipate that these activities will occupy significant staff time and will \ndisplace other vital program administration responsibilities for DSS. \n42.  Modifying  existing communications,  web portals,  and forms  related to public \ncharge. For almost twenty years, Connecticut has worked under consistent and clear rules about \nwhen a resident's use of public benefits could result in a public charge determination. The new \nrules, in addition to being vastly more complex, carry dramatically different and more onerous \npenalties for a much large swath of the department's clients. In order to properly inform clients of \nthe new risks,  a wide variety of forms,  notices, websites,  software  applications and training \nmaterials will need to be modified before the rule goes into place. \n43.  Connecticut has created two integrated web-based applications for residents to \napply for state and federal benefits. Residents apply for SNAP and some medical coverage through \nConneCT, and most use Access Health CT to apply for Medicaid. If the Final Rule takes effect, \nthese systems will need to be radically revised. Eligibility determinations will need to be delinked \nwhere  the provision of one type of benefit automatically confers eligibility for  another,  and \nconsumers will need to be provided with clear and accurate information about the nature of the \nprograms to which they are applying and the implications of that application for their immigration \nstatus. Our information technology department anticipates costs in the millions of dollars for the \nprogramming work on the portals alone. \n44.  If the Rule takes effect, in addition to notifying thousands of current non-citizen \nbeneficiaries who have already been determined eligible, the state must immediately plan to halt \nautomated  Medicaid  benefit  renewals  for  current  beneficiaries  (a  process  required  by  the \nAffordable Care Act) in order to give clients an opportunity to evaluate the new rules. These \nrenewals are generally triggered approximately 60 days in advance of the expiration of the prior \nAdd49\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 16 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 15 \nperiod of eligibility - or around September 1st  for benefits expiring in October.  Stopping this \nprocess and developing notices and procedures to support this change in operations requires costly \nand intensely rapid system changes. DSS reasonably anticipates a deluge of questions regarding \napplication of this massive new rule, draining capacity for other work and increasing operational \ncosts. \n45.  An additional  example of the challenges faced by  DSS  concerns benefits that \nautomatically  confer  eligibility  for  other  benefits.  For  instance,  a  non-citizen  may  file  an \napplication with DSS requesting only cash assistance. If DSS determines the non-citizen is eligible \nfor State Supplement and grants this benefit, the computerized eligibility system will automatically \ngrant Medicaid coverage as  well,  because  eligibility rules  provide  that a  recipient  of State \nSupplement is categorically eligible for Medicaid coverage. Because the Final Rule changes the \ndefinition of \"public charge\" to mean an \"alien who receives one or more designated public \nbenefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period receipt (such that, \nfor instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months),\" 84 Fed. Reg. 41,295 \n(Aug.  14, 2019), and because non-emergency Medicaid is, in most instances, now one of the \ndesignated public benefits considered for public charge purposes, DSS will need to reprogram its \ncomputer  eligibility  system  to  \"delink\"  these  two  benefits.  DSS  will  need  to  create  new \ncorrespondence for these situations that clearly explains a non-citizen's options and the potential \nramifications of accepting Medicaid coverage. DSS will incur a cost for making these changes to \nits computer system and correspondence, and for providing training to its staff. \n46.  If implemented, the Rule will impose administrative burdens and costs on the \nstate's health insurance Marketplace. Federal law requires state health insurance Marketplaces \nto first determine Medicaid eligibility for anyone applying for subsidized health insurance \nAdd50\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-6   Filed 09/09/19   Page 17 of 17\nDeclaration of Dr. Deidre S. Gifford/ 16 \ncoverage. Therefore, all applicants for Marketplace programs, including individuals seeking to \napply enroll in CHIP, the Basic Health Program, or a Qualified Health Plan with an Advance \nPremium Tax Credit (APTC), must be found ineligible for Medicaid before their eligibility \ncan be determined for other programs.  As such, the state's information technology system is \ncurrently set up so that a Medicaid application is a threshold requirement before applications \nfor other programs are permitted. \n47.  If enacted, the Rule will require Connecticut to make changes to  its  online \neligibility platform and consumer notices to ensure immigrant applicants are informed of the \npotential risk that applying  for  or renewing existing health insurance  may  pose to their \nimmigration  status.  Changing  this  platform  would  be  tremendously  costly  and  time \nconsuming for Connecticut to implement. \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Connecticut and the United \nStates of America that the foregoing is true and correct. \nDATED this August 27, 2019 at Hartford, Connecticut. \nDEIDRE S.

I respectfully submit this \nDeclaration in my capacity as President and CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals in order to place \nbefore the Court testimony relevant to the reliefrequested in this action.  I am familiar with the \nAdd52\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 3 of 11\nmatters set forth herein, either from professional knowledge, conversations with NYC Health+ \nHospitals staff, or on the basis of documents that have been provided to and reviewed by me.  I \nhave also familiarized myself with the public charge inadmissibility rule (the \"Public Charge Rule\" \nor \"the Rule'') in order to understand its immediate impact upon NYC Health+ Hospitals and its \npatients. \n2.  This Declaration provides:  (i) general information on my background and NYC \nHealth+ Hospitals' mission and work; (ii) examples of the Public Charge Rule's harmful effect \non NYC Health+ Hospitals' patients; (iii) an analysis of the impact the Public Charge Rule will \nhave on the NYC Health+ Hospitals' patients; and (iv) an assessment of the significant costs and \nburdens the Public Charge Rule will impose on the administration of our already overburdened \nfacilities. \nMy Professional Background \n3.  I have dedicated my career to the service of public health systems.  I have served \nas President and CEO at NYC Health+ Hospitals since January 8, 2018.  Before coming to NYC \nHealth+ Hospitals, I was the Director of the Los Angeles County (\"LAC\") Health Agency, \nwhich has a budget of $7 billion, 28,000 employees, and a large number of community partners, \nI also served as the Director of the LAC Department of Health Services, the second largest \npublic safety~net health care system in the United States. \n4.  Prior to working in Los Angeles, I served as the Health Officer of the San \nFrancisco Department of Health for 13 years.  I worked on funding needle exchange programs, \ncreating Healthy San Francisco (a health access program), outlawing the sale of tobacco at \npharmacies, and winning ballot measures for rebuilding San Francisco's public hospitals. \n5.  I am a graduate of Yale College and Harvard Medical School, completed an \ninternal medicine residency at the University of California, San Francisco Medical School and \n2 \nAdd53\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 11\nwas a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar.  Currently, I am the Deputy Editor of JAMA \nInternal Medicine and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. \n6.  In addition to my administrative leadership roles, throughout my professional \ncareer, I have continued to provide direct care to patients and currently provide primary care at \none of NYC Health+ Hospitals' federally qualified health center sites. \nNYC Health+ Hospitals' Work and Mission \n7.  NYC Health+ Hospitals is New York City's municipal hospital system and the \nlargest public health care system in the United States.  Our dedicated, culturally competent, \ndiverse workforce of 40,000-plus health care professionals protects and promotes the health and \nwell-being of 8.5 million New York City residents across all five boroughs,  We estimate more \nthan 40 percent of NYC Health+ Hospitals' patients were born outside the United States.  In its \nrole as the public health care safety net, NYC Health + Hospitals' mission is to deliver the best \nc~ for all patients, regardless of ability to pay. \n8.  With an operating budget of approximately $8 billion, NYC Health+ Hospitals is \nan integrated health care system consisting of:  eleven acute care hospitals; five post-acute/long \nterm care facilities; a federally qualified health center consisting of a network of ambulatory care \nclinics offering primary care services across the five boroughs; a certified home health agency; \nand one of the largest correctional health services in the nation. \n9.  NYC Health+ Hospitals' wholly-owned subsidiaries include:  \"MetroPlus,\" a low \nto no-cost health insurance plan serving more than 500,000 New York residents; and \"OneCity \nHealth,\" the largest Medicaid Performing Provide~ System in the State composed of hundreds of \nhealth care providers, community-based organizations, and health systems. \n10.  On August l, 2019, NYC Health + Hospitals began implementing NYC Care, a \nhealthcare access program that guarantees low-cost and no-cost services to Nevv York City \nAdd54\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 11\nresidents who do not qualify for public insurance coverage or cannot afford health insurance. \nThis program is entirely funded by New York City and all health care services provided under \nthe NYC Care program are currently provided through NYC Health + Hospitals. \nImpact of the Public Charge Rule on NYC Health+ Hospitals Patients \nSeeking Healthcare and Coverage fo1· Care \n11.  Staff at NYC Health + Hospitals has already seen how fear and confusion \nwrought by the Public Charge Rule has led, and will continue to lead, our patients and their \nfamilies to avoid obtaining critical health care services and coverage for those services.  As the \nexamples I provide below demonstrate, this fear and confusion has had a chiliing effect on our \npatients-immigrants not targeted by the Public Charge Rule (for example those with Green \nCards or visas not targeted by the Public Charge Rule) are declining needed services and \nimmigrant patients are avoiding services that would not be subject to the Public Charge Rule. \nSome of NYC Health+ Hospitals' patients have already declined to enroll in, or have requested \nto disenroll from, Medicaid and its MetroPlus health plan.  Others have opted out of the Women, \nInfants, and Children (\"WIC\") program, a supplemental nutrition initiative for women, infants, \nand children. \n12.  After the proposed rule was published and before the Rule was finalized, an infant \ngirl was admitted to an NYC Health+ Hospitals inpatient setting in Manhattan due to severe \nanemia and malnutrition.  Her parents have three children, all born in the United States.  The \nparents told our staff that they had avoided applying for WIC and Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (\"SNAP\") because others in their immigrant community had warned them \nthat the children's receipt of food assistance might be held against the parents in the future. \nNYC Health+ Hospitals gave the parents nutritional advice and provided calories to the girl \nwhile she was at the hospital.  She was able to rebound.  She stopped losing weight  Her anemia \n4 \nAdd55\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 11\nturned around.  The parents experienced this fear of using benefits for their children even though \nthe proposed rule clearly stated that usage of any new benefits added to the Rule, before the Rule \nbecomes effective, would not be used against applicants subject to the Rule. \n13.  After the Public Charge Rule came out, an uninsured couple did not want to apply \nfor insurance or for H+H Options (NYC Health+ Hospitals' sliding fee scale program) due to \nfear that they might be deemed public charges.  The couple said they were advised by their \nattorney to not apply for health insurance programs because the act can adversely affect their \nlegal status as well as their sponsor.  The couple was apprehensive even though H+H Options is \nnot implicated by the Rule and the Rule had not yet taken effect. \n14.  In the Summer of2019 after the Rule was published, a patient in Queens who was \nenrolled in Medicaid managed care requested to cancel his insurance coverage because of what \nhe heard on the news relating to the Public Charge Rule.  A staff member referred the patient to \nan immigration legal hotline we make available to our patients.  Although it was unclear whether \nthis individual would have been subject to the public charge test after the Rule's effective date on \nOctober 15, 2019, his enrollment prior to this date would not be used in a public charge \ndetermination.  The patient was extremely fearful and adamant about his desire to cancel his \nexisting coverage. \n15.  In another instance during the Summer of 2019 after the Rule was finalized, two \nwomen participating in a breast cancer program at one of our acute care facilities in Manhattan \ndeclined to pursue follow-up care.  These women were enrolled in H+H Options and each \nreported that she was declining follow-up care out of fear that continued participation in H+H \nOptions would adversely affect her immigration case.  Our staff exp] ained that the Rule does not \napply to H+H Options, but the patients still refused care. \n5 \nAdd56\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 11\n16.  As these examples show, the Public Charge Rule has had an actual chilling effect \non New York City residents receiving care at NYC Health+ Hospitals-including immigrants \nwho are not directly targeted by its provisions and others who are too afraid to access benefits \nand services that are not affected by the Rule.  Even if NYC Health+ Hospitals continues its \nsignificant investment in educational efforts to help its immigrant patients understand the Rule's \napplication, based on the pervasive fear and reactions we have seen, we believe that the chilling \neffect will continue. \n+ \nSensitivity Analysis of the Public Charm~ Rule on NYC HcaJtb  Hospitals Patients \n17.  NYC Health+ Hospitals staffhas conducted an analysis ofhow the Public Charge \nRule may affect its patients and will continue to update the analysis as data becomes available. \nNYC Health+ Hospitals estimates that, based on data from the 2017 American Community \nSurvey and NYC Health+ Hospitals' data for fiscal year 2018, approximately 283,000 patients \nmay be noncitizens (including 163,000 insured patients and 120,000 uninsured/self-pay patients) \nand will either be directly affected by or be subject to the chilling effect of the Public Charge \nRule and respond simi]arly to the patients whose stories are shared above. \n18.  NYC Health + Hospitals has modeled a range of potential patient responses to the \nRule in its first year of implementation:  disenrolling from federally-subsidized Medicaid and \nMedicaid managed care plans; reducing use of primary care and preventive services resulting in \npoorer health outcomes and more costly care; and providing incomplete contact or insurance \ninformation to avoid diagnoses and utilization being tied to themselves (i.e., \"collectability\"), \nresulting in lower collectability and reimbursement for NYC Health + Hospitals. \n19.  For each type of patient response, NYC Health+ Hospitals modeled a worst, \nmedium, and best case scenario.  For example, the medium case scenario for potential patient \nresponses regarding disenrollment from Medicaid assumes 20 percent disenrollment by \n6 \nAdd57\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 11\npotentially directly affected patients. This assumption is based on a conservative estimate of the \nchilling effect resulting from the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nAct of 1996.  Under the medium case scenario, 11,200 Medicaid patients would disenroll and \nbecome uninsured and NYC Health+ Hospitals could face a net financial loss of $42 million due \nto reduction in Medicaid reimbursement in the first year of the Rule's implementation.  Layering \nin the medium case scenario for potential responses of patients, including a reduction in their use \nof primary care and preventive services as well as a reduction of the cost collectability from \nthese patients, the potential loss is S 121 million in the first year. The potential loss \nencompassing all types of potential patient responses to the Rule could range from $50 million in \nthe best case scenario to as much as $187 million in the worst case scenario. \n20.  In addition to the potential financial impact of patient responses, NYC Health + \nHospitals estimates it would cost up to $1.8 million over the first year to implement necessary \nadministrative steps to respond to the rule change. This reflects costs for multiple rounds of staff \ntraining for key frontline personnel, outreach, preparation of education materials, and additional \nfinancial counseling and legal services to support our patients. \n21.  Although not reflected in the above estimate of the Rule's impact on NYC Health \n+ Hospitals, MetroPlus, the managed care plan owned by NYC Health + Hospitals, faces a \npotential financial loss resulting from decreased enrollment and the cost of implementation. \nBased on experiences to date, it is expected that a number of individuals will disenroll from their \nMedicaid coverage through MetroPlus for fear of its impact on their immigration status.  The \nRule will force MetroPlus to invest significant resources in staff training and member outreach to \nensure its membership understands the Rule's impacl and implications for their health care \ncoverage. \n7 \nAdd58\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 11\nIncreased Administrative Burdens on NYC Health + Hospitals \n22.  The Rule has imposed, and will continue to impose administrative burdens and \ncosts on NYC Health+ Hospitals.  Staff wilJ need to be retrajned to be prepared to understand \nquestions from certain patients and make necessary referrals to pro bono immigration legal \nservice attorneys.  Education materials will need to be prepared, translated, and distributed. \nThe administrative and implementation costs, as well as the on-the-ground support needed \nfor staff regarding this rule, will be felt for years to come. \n23.  NYC Care:  We expect that the Rule wi11 shift health and medical costs covered \nby federal funds to the City of New York.  Individuals who forgo Medicaid or other health \ninsurance programs may seek services under NYC Care.  NYC Care is available to all New York \nCity residents regardless of their ability to pay and enrollment in NYC Care is not included in the \npublic charge determination.  Alternatively, some Medicaid or even NYC Care patients may \ndisengage from health care entirely, posing individual and public health risk, as well as the \npotential for long-term increases in emergency care. \n24.  Staff training and resources:  Since the proposed Public Charge Rule was \nreleased in the Fall of 2018, NYC Health+ Hospitals has spent hundreds of staff hours to \nanalyze its impact and educate its staff and community members on the proposed Rule and now \nthe final Rule. \n25.  Contact center;  NYC Health+ Hospitals runs numerous telephonic contact \ncenters to answer questions, including but not limited to those about insurance matters and \neligibility for services.  Beyond its core staff, an \"overflow\" model is used such that when \ncall volumes are high, the \"overflow\" volume is transferred to an outside vendor which \ncharges based on call volume.  Given the inherent complexities among various types of \nhealth insurance coverage available to our patients, the Rule could cause an increase in calls \n8 \nAdd59\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 11\nas patients seek information about the health care access, their insurance coverage, and the \npotential impacts of the Rule.  Such an increase in volume would place a financial burden on \nNYC Health + Hospitals for every minute of additional \"overflow\" call time needed to \nsupport our patients. \n26.  Lega/Health Partnership with New York Legal Assistance Group \n(\"NYLAG''):  NYC Health+ Hospitals has a long-standing partnership with NYLAG to \nprovide pro bono legal services for its patients on a range of issues~ including immigration \nmatters.  NYC Health+ Hospitals provides this service through NYLAG at all of its \nhospitals and many neighborhood clinics.  Telephonic services are also provided, and a new \nhotline has been established in order to specifically handle calls related to public charge \nissues.  NYC Health+ Hospitals pays for this service and provides physical space at its \nfacilities to host these services.  If more patients were to call with concerns about the Rule, \nthere may be a need for increased legal capacity, which would come at greater cost to NYC \nHealth + Hospitals. \nCONCLUSION \n27.  For these reasons, NYC Health+ Hospitals opposes implementation of the Rule \ngiven its destructive, far-reaching, and irreversible consequences on the economy, health, and \nadministration of NYC Health+ Hospitals and in tum, the City of New York.  I respectfully \nrequest that this Court grant plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. \n9 \nAdd60\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-10   Filed 09/09/19   Page 11 of 11\nI declare under penalty that the foregoing is true and correct and of my own personal \nknowledge. \nIP \nExecuted on this  ~September, 2019 \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nNew York City Health and Hospitals \nCorporation \n\\ \nJO \nAdd61\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 2 of 97\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK, et al.,    \n   \n  Plaintiffs,   \n   \n  v.  19 Civ. 7777 (GBD)  \n \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \n \nHOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n  Defendants.   \n \n \nI, Leighton Ku, declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the following is true and \ncorrect: \n1.

I have been engaged by counsel for the Plaintiffs in this case to evaluate the effect \nof the new public charge rule on Medicaid enrollment, public health, and health systems.   \nOverview \n9.  This declaration examines the potential effects of the final regulation issued by \nthe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding inadmissibility on public charge \ngrounds on August 14, 2019 (“the public charge rule” or “the rule”),4 specifically the health \nconsequences and effects of the rule related to the receipt of health insurance benefits under the \nfederal Medicaid5 program. In this declaration I:  \n(A) summarize key aspects of the public charge rule,  \n(B) describe the Medicaid program, and provisions related to lawful immigrants,  \n                                                      \n4   Department of Homeland Security.

Those harmed are disproportionately low-income \nmembers of racial and ethnic minority groups, especially Latino and Asian families, and many \nhave serious chronic health problems.  The loss of Medicaid will substantially reduce their \nability to access affordable health care and will lead to serious health problems for many, such as \ndiabetics who will no longer be able to afford insulin or other medications or medical services. \nAs a result, there could be as many as 1,300 to 4,000 excess premature deaths per year.  The \nreduction in Medicaid revenue, and subsequent increase in the number of low-income uninsured \npeople will also cause financial harm to health care providers, especially safety net facilities like \ncommunity health centers and safety net hospitals, as well as to local and state governments.  \nA. Summary of the Revised Public Charge Rule \n10.  Section 531 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996 (IIRIRA) included five criteria that could be considered when making public charge \ndeterminations for admissibility to the United States, approval of lawful permanent residency \n(LPR) or other adjustments of immigration status: age; health; family status; assets, resources \nand financial status; and education and skills.6  In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS), which oversaw the immigration system at the time, specified that being primarily \n                                                      \n6   Public Law 104-208, Div C. Section 531, 8 USC 1182(1)(4). \n5 \nAdd66\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 97\ndependent on cash assistance income maintenance (e.g., Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) benefits) or institutionalized for long-term care \nat government expense (e.g., nursing home expenses paid by Medicaid) could result in public \ncharge determinations.7  The INS explained that this was consistent with a historical approach to \nthe concept of public charge, that it would apply to those who were “primarily dependent” on the \ngovernment for income or for institutionalization. Non-cash benefits, such as Medicaid (other \nthan the long-term care benefits mentioned above), the Children’s Health Insurance Program \n(CHIP), or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), were not to be considered in \ndetermining public charge status under the 1999 guidance.   \n11.  Under the new public charge rule, DHS will now include the receipt of non-cash \nbenefits such as Medicaid, SNAP, and public housing as grounds to make a public charge \ndetermination to deny status adjustments, including approval for lawful permanent residency. \n12.  Under § 212.22(c)(1)(ii) of the final regulation, the following will be considered a \n“heavily weighted negative factor” in consideration of a determination of public charge \ninadmissibility: “The alien has received or has been certified or approved to receive one or more \nof the public benefits, as defined in § 212.21(b) for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \nany 36-month period, beginning no later than 36 months prior to the alien’s application for \nadmission for admission or adjustment of status on or after October 15, 2019.” The public \nbenefits in § 212.21(b) include non-cash benefits like Medicaid, SNAP, and public housing, and \ncash benefits like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI). Section 212.21(b) indicates that receipt of Medicaid counts as a highly weighted \nnegative factor, except for certain circumstances, such as the receipt of Medicaid due to \n                                                      \n7   Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Notice: Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility \non Public Charge Grounds.  (Federal Register.  Mar. 26, 1999.  Pg. 28689-92). \n6 \nAdd67\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 97\nemergency medical conditions, Medicaid services received under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, school-based Medicaid services and services provided to immigrants \nunder the age of 21 or a woman who is pregnant (up to 60 days postpartum).  \n13.   If the immigrant receives two or more benefits, the receipt of each benefit will be \nsummed in reaching the 12-month limit; i.e., an immigrant who receives Medicaid, SNAP and \n--\npublic housing benefits for more than four months each would exceed the 12-month criterion.  \nAn immigrant may be considered “likely to become a public charge” if the immigration officer \nbelieves he or she will receive one or more of these benefits.  Applying for Medicaid (or related \nbenefits) after October 15, 2019 will not be considered “receipt” of benefits, but can be \nconsidered in determining public charge status (§ 212.22(b)(4)(E)).  \n14.  Other factors which will be considered negative factors include: having an income \nbelow 125% of Federal Poverty Guidelines (“FPG”), being a child or elderly, low education, \npoor health, being uninsured and having been denied entry or adjustment in the past.   \n15.  Although certain exclusions apply with respect to receipt of Medicaid benefits, \nmany Medicaid enrollees with such exclusions are still at risk of public charge determinations for \nother reasons.   For example, children or pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid could still be \ndeemed public charges because they are: under 18 (§ 212.22(b)(1)), have serious health problems \n(§212.22(b)(2) and §212.22(c)(1)(iii)(A)), are members of large families (§212.22(b)(3)), have \nincomes below 125 percent of federal poverty guidelines (§212.22(b)(4)), or for other related \nreasons.  For example, an immigration officer could interpret that pregnancy (and subsequent \nlabor and delivery) constitutes a “medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \ntreatment or institutionalization” (§212.22(b)(2) and §212.22(c)(1)(iii)(A)) which therefore \nauthorizes a public charge determination, even though the child born would be a native-born \n7 \nAdd68\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 97\nU.S. citizen.  In fact, a pregnant woman could be considered a public charge even if she has not \nbeen enrolled in Medicaid, simply because of her health condition. \nB. Brief Description of Medicaid \n16.  Medicaid, authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, provides health \ninsurance coverage to low-income populations.  As of May 2019, 65.7 million individuals were \nenrolled in federally-funded Medicaid, about 20% of the U.S. population.  (An additional 6.6 \nmillion children were enrolled in CHIP; as noted below some of these children could be \nconsidered Medicaid recipients as well, depending on how states have decided to structure their \nprograms.)8  Medicaid is the nation’s largest health insurance program.  Medicaid is an \nentitlement program whose eligibility rules and benefit levels are established by federal and state \nlaws and regulations; total spending is not limited by appropriations limits.  The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicaid, does not provide detailed \ninformation about the immigration status of Medicaid participants. \n17.  Medicaid serves a wide range of low-income beneficiaries including children, the \nelderly, persons with disabilities, non-elderly adults and pregnant women.  Eligibility is based on \nmultiple criteria including age, income, category (e.g., child, adult, elderly, pregnant woman), \ndisability status, state residency and immigration status. Medicaid offers a broad health benefit, \nincluding preventive and primary health care, acute medical care, emergency and inpatient \nhospital care, and long-term care services. Children on Medicaid receive other important \nservices, including dental care and therapies that address developmental problems.

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program.  Within the federal regulatory \nframework, states have great flexibility to establish policies.  The federal government funds the \nmajority of Medicaid expenditures based on a federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), \nwhich annually establishes the percent of total Medicaid expenditures that will be paid by the \nfederal government, while state or local governments fund the remaining costs.  Under Medicaid, \n36 states (plus the District of Columbia) cover non-elderly adults with family incomes up to 138 \npercent of the federal poverty level (about $29,435 per year for a family of three), but 14 states \nhave not expanded Medicaid as permitted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and \nmany do not provide any coverage to non-elderly adults without dependent children.9  The range \nof income eligibility criteria in Medicaid is very broad.  At the high end, in the District of \nColumbia, adults with incomes up to 221 percent of the poverty level are eligible for Medicaid. \nThirty-six states use 138 percent of the poverty level as the income cutoff.  At the low end, \ntwelve states use a threshold below 50 percent of the federal poverty level.10  The lowest \nthreshold is in Texas where Medicaid eligibility for parents ends at 17 percent of poverty ($3,600 \nper year for a family of three) and non-disabled, non-elderly adults without dependent children \nare not eligible at all, regardless of income.  Thus, eligibility criteria related to use of Medicaid \nwould only affect very poor parents in Texas, but may affect low-income working class adults in \n                                                      \n9   Kaiser Family Foundation.

Moreover, predicting future Medicaid use would depend \nheavily on predicting where an individual will live in the future.    \n19.  Medicaid Eligibility for Legal Immigrants.  Special policies exist for Medicaid \neligibility for legal immigrants.  Citizens, including naturalized citizens and citizen children with \nnoncitizen parents, are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP on the same terms as U.S.-born citizens.  \nUndocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits.  The Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunities Reauthorization Act of 1996 (PRWORA)11 restricted \nlegal immigrants’ eligibility for certain means-tested programs, including Medicaid.  In 2009, \nCongress modified the rules under Section 214 of the Children’s Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) and gave states the option to expand eligibility for \nlawfully residing children and pregnant women.  This section is sometimes called the “ICHIA” \nprovision, named after a legislative proposal, Immigrant Children’s Health Improvement Act, \nthat evolved into Section 214.12  Federal policies as of July 23, 2019 (prior to issuance of the \nfinal regulation) are summarized by the Department of Health and Human Services’ \nHealthCare.gov website: \nImmigrants and Medicaid and CHIP \nImmigrants who are “qualified non-citizens” are generally eligible for coverage \nthrough Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), if they \nmeet their state’s income and residency rules. \nIn order to get Medicaid and CHIP coverage, many qualified non-citizens (such as \nmany LPRs or green card holders) have a 5-year waiting period. This means they \nmust wait 5 years after receiving “qualified” immigration status before they can \nget Medicaid and CHIP coverage. There are exceptions. For example, refugees, \nasylees, or LPRs who used to be refugees or asylees don’t have to wait 5 years. \nThe term “qualified non-citizen” includes: \n  Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR/Green Card Holder) \n                                                      \n11   See 8 USC 1601-1646.   \n12   Public Law No: 111-3 (02/04/2009). \n10 \nAdd71\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 12 of 97\n  Asylees \n  Refugees \n  Cuban/Haitian entrants \n  Paroled into the U.S. for at least one year \n  Conditional entrant granted before 1980 \n  Battered non-citizens, spouses, children, or parents \n  Victims of trafficking and his or her spouse, child, sibling, or parent or individuals \nwith a pending application for a victim of trafficking visa \n  Granted withholding of deportation \n  Member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or American Indian born in Canada \nMedicaid & CHIP Coverage for Lawfully Residing Children and Pregnant \nWomen. \nStates have the option to remove the 5-year waiting period and cover lawfully \nresiding children and/or pregnant women in Medicaid or CHIP. A child or \npregnant woman is “lawfully residing” if they’re “lawfully present” and otherwise \neligible for Medicaid or CHIP in the state…. \nGetting emergency care \nMedicaid provides payment for treatment of an emergency medical condition for \npeople who meet all Medicaid eligibility criteria in the state (such as income and \nstate residency), but don’t have an eligible immigration status. \nMedicaid, CHIP, and “public charge” status \nApplying for Medicaid or CHIP, or getting savings for health insurance costs in \nthe Marketplace, doesn’t make someone a “public charge.” This means it won’t \naffect their chances of becoming a Lawful Permanent Resident or U.S. citizen. \nThere’s one exception.

The provisions decribed above concern eligibility for immigrants under federal \nMedicaid policies that govern the availability of federal funds (i.e., FMAP).  But many states \nextend Medicaid or similar health insurance coverage to additional immigrants, including legal \nimmigrants who do not meet federal criteria as well as undocumented immigrants, using state \nfunds.  In July 2019, California enacted Senate Bill 104 which will extend “eligibility for full-\n11 \nAdd72\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 13 of 97\nscope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals 19 to 25 years of age, inclusive, and who are otherwise \neligible for those benefits but for their immigration status.”13  (Medi-Cal is California’s name for \nMedicaid.)  This expands upon a 2015 California law (SB 75) that expanded Medi-Cal eligibility \nfor children 0 to 18 regardless of immigration status.14  The District of Columbia, Illinois, \nMaryland (in some counties), Massachusetts, New York and Oregon provide state-funded health \ninsurance coverage to income-eligible children regardless of immigration status.15  Sixteen states \nprovide prenatal care coverage to income-eligible women regardless of immigration status \n(Arkansas, California, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New \nJersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas and Washington)16   \n21.  The public charge rule only applies to federally-funded Medicaid and does not \ncount state-funded assistance in public charge determinations.17  However, it is important to note \nthat numerous state programs are called or considered Medicaid (often under a state-specific \nname, like Medi-Cal in California, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) in \nArizona or MassHealth in Massachusetts) although the source of funds may not include federal \nMedicaid funds.  As a result, many participants may not know whether the “Medicaid” in which \n                                                      \n13   California Senate Bill 104.  \nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB104.

New York offers health coverage to residents who are not eligible for federally-\nfunded Medicaid, including many immigrants.  These programs include state-funded Medicaid, \nChild Health Plus (New York’s version of CHIP) and Essential Plan, a Basic Health Program \nauthorized under the Affordable Care Act.18  These programs provide services similar to \nMedicaid..  These programs are not federal Medicaid, and are not cited as a heavily-weighted \nnegative factor under the public charge rule, but many recipients may not be able to distinguish \nthese programs from federal Medicaid.  State and federal Medicaid are indistinguishable to \nparticipants.  Most Medicaid recipients in New York are covered through private Medicaid \nmanaged care plans, and most health insurance companies that offer Medicaid plans also provide \ncoverage in the other programs listed above. In many cases, the insurance cards for these various \nprograms look almost identical.  Thus, many New Yorkers who are covered under these \nprograms could be confused about whether they are in federally-funded Medicaid.  As I explain \nbelow, this confusion will likely result in New Yorkers mistakenly disenrolling from healthcare \ncoverage programs that are not federally-funded Medicaid in order to avoid potential negative \nconsequences when seeking an adjustment of status for immigration purposes.  \n23.  The draft form USCIS I-944, titled “Declaration of Self-Sufficiency,”19 must be \ncompleted by those applying for adjustment of status and will be used by DHS officials to \ndetermine public charge status.  It is long and extremely complicated; its complexity (and lack of \nclarity) could lead to many erroneous determinations of public charge status by DHS officials.  \n                                                      \n18  https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov. \n19   US Citizenship and Immigration Service.

OMB No. \n1615-0142.  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-63772. \n13 \nAdd74\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 15 of 97\nThe form is 19 pages long and asks for detailed information and documentation related to \nincome, prior year tax filings, assets (including bank accounts, homes and cars), home value \nappraisals, mortgages, a credit score from within the past year, proof of education (such as \ndegrees or transcripts), and occupational licenses, in addition to information about public benefit \nuse.  More pertinent to Medicaid, Form I-944 asks “Have you EVER received or are currently \ncertified to receive in the future any of the following benefits,” one of which is “federal-funded \nMedicaid.” If the answer is yes, it asks for the beginning and ending dates of receiving Medicaid \nand the total value of benefits received.   \n24.  There are at least three flaws that could lead to erroneous reporting using Form I-\n944.  First, it is not clear whether “you” in the sentence above applies to the individual or to his \nor her whole household.  Because this question is in a section titled “You and Your Household \nMembers’ Assets, Resources and Financial Status,” the implication is that “you” means the \nentire household.  This can produce errors since an immigrant applicant might not receive \nMedicaid him or herself, while another family member, such as a U.S.-born citizen child, spouse \nor other household member is the recipient.  But the public charge rule is supposed to apply only \nto the applicant’s use of benefits, not the use of benefits by other family members.  The form, \nhowever, could lead to the determination that the immigrant applicant used Medicaid and is \ntherefore a public charge, even though the immigrant him or herself did not actually receive \nMedicaid, only another household member. Second, many, perhaps most, applicants will not \nknow if the Medicaid they received is “federal-funded Medicaid” or not. Presumably, DHS used \nthis phrase to differentiate the benefit from state-funded medical assistance programs, such as \nthose described above.  But the definitions and names may not be clear to enrollees.  All \nMedicaid programs are state-administered, they sometimes have names other than Medicaid \n14 \nAdd75\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 16 of 97\n(e.g., Medi-Cal in California, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) in \nArizona or MassHealth in Massachusetts) and the insurance card many enrollees receive may \nonly have the name of a private managed care plan (e.g., Aetna or United) that is contracted to \nprovide Medicaid benefits; thus many applicants will be unable to report if they used “federal-\nfunded Medicaid.”  Finally, Form I-944 asks for the dollar amount received.  Almost no \nMedicaid recipient knows the dollar value of benefits received; it is not reported to them, and it \nis unclear whether such information could be obtained on demand, so how could they know?  \nDHS provides no guidance on this point.  The net effect is that it will be extremely difficult for \nan immigrant applying for adjustment of status to complete these parts of the I-944 correctly, \nleading to a substantial risk of erroneous public charge determinations.  There is the further risk \nthat many applicants may simply give up due to confusion and will therefore not apply for \npermanent residency or other status adjustments—even if they are individuals who are unlikely \nto be deemed public charges based on their receipt of public benefits.   \nC. The Public Charge Rule Will Have Substantial and Broad Effects in Reducing \nImmigrants’ Participation: the “Chilling Effect” \n25.  The public charge rule is ostensibly targeted at certain federal public benefits, \nincluding Medicaid.  In reality, a substantial share of candidates for adjustment of status do not \nreceive these benefits because they are already ineligible to receive them under existing law.  \nThus, the rule is not only disconnected from the reality of immigrants’ actual federal benefits \nusage, it also poses a significant threat to lawful use of benefits by members of immigrant \nfamilies who are not covered by the rule.  In both the preamble to the rule and the regulatory \n--\n15 \nAdd76\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 17 of 97\nimpact analysis that accompanies the rule,20 DHS acknowledges that a large number of \nimmigrants and members of their families who are eligible for Medicaid will lose benefits but \ndeclares that these are “indirect effects” of the rule, as the rule itself does not change the \neligibility criteria for Medicaid or other programs.  DHS concedes, however, that many members \nof immigrant families who are lawfully eligible for these programs will disenroll or forego \nenrollment in order to avoid a public charge determination, though as explained below its \nestimates of the number of people who will drop coverage is seriously flawed. \n26.  While the specifics of who is subject to the public charge rule are detailed in the \nmore than 200-page regulation and preamble, experience and research indicates there will be \nmuch broader “chilling effects” for those in immigrant families, including U.S.-born citizen \nchildren, naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents and others who are not specifically \ndescribed by the rule.  In this context, “chilling effect” refers to the likelihood that many \nmembers of immigrant families will disenroll or forego participation in public benefit programs, \neven if they are lawfully eligible, because they are fearful of harmful repercussions for \nthemselves or members of their family.  As described below, these fears extend beyond the \ndirectly affected immigrants, but creep out to other family members, who may be citizens, \nalready have green cards, or whose benefit use is excluded from consideration.  Stated \ndifferently, the chilling effect extends far beyond the specific individuals eligible for an \nadjustment of status who, in DHS’s view, rationally choose to forego public benefits in order to \nreduce the odds of a public charge determination.  Many who are supposed to be exempt from \nthe rule, such as pregnant women or refugees fleeing persecution in their homelands, will be \nunderstandably confused about the rule and will avoid Medicaid too.  \n                                                      \n20   Dep’t of Homeland Security.  “Regulatory Impact Analysis: Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds.”  Aug. 2019.  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-63741. \n16 \nAdd77\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 18 of 97\n27.  While the details of the public charge rule matter, the effects can be much larger \nand broader because of the ways that immigrant families perceive these rules.  DHS references \nthe existence of chilling effect in its regulatory impact analysis.21  On pages 90 and 91, DHS \ncites one study from the US Department of Agriculture which estimated that legal immigrants’ \nfood stamp participation fell by 54 percent after the immigrant restrictions in the 1996 PRWORA \nwent into effect22 and another Urban Institute report which found that welfare enrollment by \nforeign-born individuals, including both citizens and non-citizens, fell by 21 percent in the years \nafter PRWORA’s immigrant restrictions.23  DHS, moreover, was well aware of potential chilling \neffects because various comments on the proposed rule raised concerns about them.  \n28.  The most direct, recent evidence of the magnitude of the chilling effects comes \nfrom a study conducted by the non-partisan Urban Institute,24 which was based on a nationally \nrepresentative survey conducted in December 2018, after the proposed rule was released in \nOctober 2018 and included a sample of 2,950 adults in immigrant families (i.e., at least one \nperson in the family was an immigrant).  The survey, called the Well-Being and Basic Needs \nSurvey, was a nationally representative sample of adults 18 to 64.  It is based on a stratified \nrandom sample drawn from Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel, a probability-based online basis; it \nincluded an oversample of noncitizen respondents.  The survey was conducted in English and \n                                                      \n21   Ibid.   \n22   Genser J.

To ensure that the findings corresponded to nationally accepted representativeness, the \ndata were weighted based on benchmarks drawn from the Census Bureau’s American \nCommunity Survey.   The researchers found that: \n  Overall, about one-seventh (13.7%) of all adults in immigrant families reported that \nthey avoided noncash public benefits in the past year because of concerns that they or \na family member could be disqualified from obtaining a green card (lawful permanent \nresident status).  Hispanics, low-income members of immigrant families, and \nimmigrant families with children were more likely than other groups to avoid such \nbenefits. \n  The rate of avoidance was higher (20.7%) among low-income members of immigrant \nfamilies whose incomes were below 200% of the federal poverty line ($25,100 for a \nfamily of four in 2018); this subpopulation is more likely to need public benefits and \nmore prone to suffer long-term consequences from their avoidance.   \n  Of those who said they avoided noncash benefits, 46% said they avoided receiving \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, 42% said they avoided \nMedicaid or CHIP, and 33.4% said they avoided public housing subsidies.   \n  These concerns were greatest among Hispanics (20.6%), more than double the levels \nexpressed by non-Hispanic whites (8.5%).   \n  The share avoiding benefits was higher (17.4%) among immigrant families with \nchildren, but was still substantial in families without children (8.9%).   \n  Avoidance of public benefits occurred even in families where all the foreign-born \nmembers were naturalized citizens (9.3%) and where all the noncitizen family \nmembers were already permanent residents (14.7%).  In other words, avoidance \n18 \nAdd79\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 20 of 97\noccurred even in families in which no one was subject to denial of an adjustment of \nstatus due to a public charge determination.   \n  Awareness of the public charge rule was related to avoidance: Most adults in \nimmigrant families reported awareness of the public charge rule (62.9 %). Adults who \nhad heard “a lot” about the proposed rule were the most likely to report chilling \neffects in their families (31.1%).    \nThese data form a credible lower bound of the impact of the public charge rule; it is reasonable \nto believe that the effects will be even larger once the public charge rule is implemented and \nenforced.  Implementation, denials of adjustment applications, and word of mouth in the \nimmigrant community will cause far more members of immigrant families to avoid Medicaid \nand related programs.  \n29.  An example of the dramatic effect of the implementation of public charge rules \ncan be seen from statistics from the State Department reporting on visa denials following the \nJanuary 2018 issuance of a revised public charge policy in its Foreign Affairs Manual, which is \nused by consular offices across the globe in determining who can receive visas to enter the \nUnited States.25  The revised State Department policy was a precursor to DHS’s public charge \nrule.  It revises how sponsor affidavits of support and the use of noncash benefits by applicants, \nfamily members, and sponsors are evaluated prior to entry to the United States. The number of \nvisa applications denied on the basis of public charge determinations rose from 1,076 in 2016, \nusing earlier public charge guidance, to 3,237 in 2017, at which time public charge restrictions \n                                                      \n25  National Immigration Law Center.

The number of public-charge visa denials jumped to 13,450 in 2018 \nafter more restrictive guidance was issued.26  By comparison, the number of visa applications \ndenied due to drug abuse, criminal activity or terrorism remained relatively stable: 4,991 denied \nin 2016, 4,652 in 2017 and 4,916 in 2018.27  In other words, in 2018, after the public charge \nchanges were implemented, the State Department denied about 12 times as many visa applicants \ndue to public charge than in 2016 before the rule was modified, whereas the number of denials \nbased on these other categories remained relatively constant. The level of denials rose even in \n2017, when the issue was being discussed and then surged after formal adoption. These data \ncollectively suggest that the rise in public charge denials was not due to a fundamental change in \nthe composition of applicants but instead due to increasingly stringent criteria in public charge \ndeterminations. As rates of denials increase under the new rule, the corresponding chilling effect \nwill also increase.  Similarly, after the DHS public charge rule is implemented, the number of \ndenials of adjustment applications on the basis of public charge can also be expected to surge.  \nAs the rate of denial increases under the rule, the corresponding chilling effect will also increase. \n30.   Other research on the chilling effect has also shown that policies designed to \nlimit participation by noncitizen immigrants have repercussions on others, including citizen \nchildren in immigrant families. Soon after the 1996 PRWORA immigrant restrictions were \nenacted, data showed that there were significant reductions in use of Medicaid and similar \n                                                      \n26   Based on statistics from Table XX of the State Department’s Annual Reports of the Visa Office for \n2016, 2017 and 2018.  https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html.  \nThese statistics do not include counts of cases subsequently overturned.

Participation also fell sharply among refugees, who were exempt from \nPRWORA eligibility changes.28  A rigorous analysis by researchers at Columbia University and \nthe University of Illinois at Chicago found that the reduction in participation by U.S.-born citizen \nchildren in immigrant families was slightly higher than for children in immigrant families born \noutside the U.S. (18% reduction for U.S.-born citizen children vs. 14% reduction for foreign-\nborn children).29   \n31.  It is clear from its regulatory impact analysis that DHS was aware of at least two \nresearch reports30 about chilling effects and, given the numerous comments in response to the \nproposed regulation received, ought to have been aware of other related evidence, such as the \nreports cited above, but disregarded them in its final analysis.  All of the available analyses, \nincluding those two studies cited by DHS and other reports cited in the paragraph above, find \nthat changes in policies aimed at noncitizen immigrants have substantial and broad repercussions \nand lead to reductions in participation by others, including citizen members in immigrant \nfamilies.   \n                                                      \n28   Zimmerman W, Fix M.

There could be multiple reasons for the chilling effect.  First of all, the policies \nare very complicated and difficult to understand.  For example, the final public charge rule is 217 \npages long in the Federal Register (three columns with a small font size) and is highly technical.  \nEven the DHS website31 which tries to summarize the rule in plain language is 15,572 words \nlong, or about 60 double-spaced, typed pages.  According to a readability scoring system called \nthe Gunning Fog index, a person would need over 14 years of formal education (completed \nsophomore year of college) in order to read the information in the website easily.32  Many, \nwhether immigrant or U.S.-born, lack the literacy or time to comprehend such policies.  (About \nhalf of Americans 18 to 64 have less than this level of education.33)  Moreover, there are many \ntechnical immigration and public assistance issues embedded in the rule that require \nsophisticated understanding of policies to comprehend. \n33.  The extent to which immigrants take actions to avoid Medicaid or similar benefits \nafter implementation of the rule is intensified by the climate of fear that already exists in \nimmigrant communities. Since the rule was released, there has been substantial publicity \npointing out that immigrants may face negative consequences for using these benefits, turning \nspeculative suspicions into concrete hazards. As described earlier, the implementation of public \ncharge policies in the State Department led to a massive increase in public charge denials.   \n                                                      \n31   US Citizenship and Immigration Services, DHS.

Serious Flaws in the Department of Homeland Security’s Regulatory Impact Analysis \n34.  The DHS analysis of the impact of the rule is flawed because it relies on faulty \nassumptions to determine that only 2.5% of Medicaid recipients will be affected, fails to account \nfor the three-year lookback of benefit use as provided by the DHS rule, and uses a severe \nundercount of the total number of Medicaid recipients in its calculations. \n35.  DHS presented its analysis of the potential effects of the public charge rule in a \nRegulatory Impact Analysis.34  Evidence cited by DHS in its regulatory impact statement \nindicates that participation reductions among members of immigrant households have been as \nhigh as 21 percent35 or 54 percent36 following prior changes to laws affecting immigrants’ access \nto public benefits. The preamble to the final rule itself, however, relies on the lowest of the \nagency’s estimates of the potential impact. DHS’s analyses of the chilling effect included critical \nomissions and was seriously flawed.   \n36.  In Table 14 of the impact analysis, DHS begins by reporting that 34,706,865 \npeople are Medicaid recipients and, based on 2012-2016 Census data, proceeds to estimate that \n3,069,651 Medicaid recipients are members of households including foreign-born non-citizens.  \nIn Table 16, it estimates that 2.5 percent of the estimated Medicaid recipients (76,741 people) are \n“members of households that include foreign-born non-citizens expected to disenroll or forego \n                                                      \n34   Dept of Homeland Security.  “Regulatory Impact Analysis: Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds.”  Aug. 2019.  https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-63741.  \nDepartment of Homeland Security.

DHS \npresumes that all immigrants who are adjusting status that year drop Medicaid, but that no others \ndo so.  (Using a similar logic, DHS estimates that 129,563 will disenroll or forego SNAP \nbenefits and 8,801 will avoid federal rental assistance.)  In Table 17, DHS estimates that this \nwould lead to a $1.06 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid benefits per year, which \nis about two-thirds of the $1.46 billion in federal public benefit payments foregone annually; the \nremainder is other lost benefits, including SNAP, TANF, Supplemental Security Income and \nfederal rental assistance.   \n37.  In Table 18, DHS provides alternative budget estimates that acknowledge that it \nmight be more appropriate to consider a three-year lookback period given that public charge \ndeterminations focus on receipt of public benefits during the prior 36-month period.  Assuming \npeople avoid benefits for three years, not just one, the total projected annual foregone benefits \n(from all public benefit programs including Medicaid) would total $4.4 billion, or three times the \n$1.46 billion cited in the final regulation as the official estimate.  It also notes that “the number \nof people who may disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefit programs in one year \ncould be as many as the combined three-year total,” i.e., it could be three times higher based on \nthe three-year lookback period in the rule.  In Table 19, DHS provides alternative evidence-based \nparticipation loss estimates much higher than 2.5 percent of the immigrant population that could \n24 \nAdd85\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 26 of 97\nreach as high as 21 percent or 54 percent, based on prior research about chilling effects; these \nlead DHS to estimate Medicaid enrollment losses between 644,627 and 1,657,612 individuals.37   \n38.  Despite these alternative estimates, the official estimate used by DHS in the final \nrule is based on the lowest of these estimates, shown in Table 8 of the preamble for the rule, \nbased on the reduction in federal benefit payments that would otherwise have been made on \nbehalf of members of immigrant families who avoided Medicaid and other benefits.38  Table 8 \nalso notes that there could be other costs, including “Potential lost productivity, Adverse health \neffects, Additional medical expenses due to delayed health care treatment,” but makes no effort \nto quantify them. \n39.  Although the regulatory impact analysis included alternative estimates of effects \nthat could be over twenty times larger -- up to 1.66 million losing Medicaid (Table 19, page 100 \nof the impact analysis) rather than 76,741 – DHS chose to use the lowest estimates as the basis of \nimpact for the final rule.  DHS says: “While previous studies examining the effect of PRWORA \nin 1996 showed a reduction in enrollment from 21 to 54 percent, it is unclear how many \nindividuals would actually disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefits programs due \nto the final rule. The previous studies had the benefit of retrospectively analyzing the chilling \neffect characterized by disenrollment or forgone enrollment after passage of PRWORA using \nactual enrollment data, instead of being limited to prospectively estimating the number of \n                                                      \n37   For the 21 percent estimate, DHS cites Genser J.

DHS furthermore says that its \nestimate should be related to the number who have to adjust status each year, but it presents no \nevidence that effects would occur only in that year (and in fact it also indicates that a three-year \ntimeframe might be more appropriate).   \n40.  DHS’s estimate flouts substantial evidence, including the recent Urban Institute \nreport, that chilling effects are often far broader than the targeted individuals.  I note that the \nUrban Institute report was released in May 2019; those data were available before DHS \ncompleted its August 2019 impact analysis.  DHS disregards standard methods for sound policy \nanalysis and research by rejecting actual evidence-based research findings and substituting a \nflawed metric that yields disenrollment estimates far below the range of other estimates.  (The \nalternative estimates that I produce in the next section are more strongly based on recent and \ndirectly relevant evidence.) \n41.  It is noteworthy that DHS only discusses its estimate of 2.5 percent of immigrants \nadjusting status annually, rather than its own alternative estimate that the rate could be three \ntimes higher, based on the three-year lookback period actually included in the rule.  DHS \ndisregards the research evidence of the scope of effects caused by prior immigration policy \nchanges to select a much lower number and also disregards a three-times higher rate that better \ncorresponds with the rule. \n                                                      \n39   DHS, Regulatory Impact Analysis, pages 91-92, just before Table 16. \n26 \nAdd87\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 28 of 97\n42.  The only estimate in the preamble of the number who are expected to disenroll \nfrom or forego Medicaid, SNAP or public housing benefits is the reference to 2.5 percent of \nmembers of non-citizen households receiving benefits on page 41313 of the rule. It is only in the \nregulatory impact analysis that DHS converts this to actual human terms – reporting that 76,741 \npeople would lose Medicaid.  But this estimate is far too low. \n43.  As noted before DHS primarily assumes that 2.5 percent of members of non-\ncitizen households will avoid Medicaid participation because 2.5 percent of immigrants seek to \nadjust immigration status each year.  But since the public charge rule uses a three-year lookback \nperiod – receipt of benefits of at least 12 months out of the last 36 months – a more appropriate \nfactor, even accepting DHS’s baseline estimate, would be three times higher, or 7.5 percent.40  In \naddition, as the Urban Institute analyses and other prior studies of chilling effects described \nearlier indicate, chilling effects are much broader and affect many who are in naturalized citizen \nhouseholds, mixed-status households and are likely to deter participation regardless of when the \nimmigrant is considering applying for adjustment.   \n44.  There are additional serious flaws with the DHS analysis.  First of all, DHS \nbegins with an estimate that there are 34.7 million Medicaid recipients, based on a five-year \naverage of data from 2012 to 2016.41  However, more recent reports show that 65.7 million \n                                                      \n40   This is because each year there would be a new group of individuals looking ahead to an adjustment \nof status in 36 months, so the dollar value associated with their Medicaid avoidance must be added to \nthe group that already began avoiding Medicaid.  In any given year, three years’ worth of expected \nadjusters—those applying in one year, those applying in two years, and those applying in three \nyears—would be avoiding Medicaid. \n41   Department of Homeland Security.

Because \nthe Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion was largely implemented in 2014, inclusion of \ndata from earlier years vastly reduces the average number of Medicaid participants per year.  \nFurther, several states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Indiana expanded Medicaid after \n2014, making the use of this five-year average even more flawed. Even if one accepted other \nparts of the DHS methodology, this flaw alone leads to a serious underestimate, even if the 2.5 \npercent assumption was correct.   \n45.  Moreover, because DHS uses this flawed participation estimate to compute the \naverage Medicaid expenditure per person, this leads to an unjustifably high estimate of the cost \nof federal Medicaid benefits per person, $13,755 per person (Table 17.)  In contrast, an official \nestimate by the Department of Health and Human Services of federal Medicaid expenditures per \nperson was $5,522 per person for 2019.43 \nE.

Thus, I provide low and \nhigh estimates, expecting that the “true” impact would fall in between those limits. Although my \nestimates of those who lose coverage are higher than the 76,741 estimate used by DHS, they are \nmore conservative than other independent estimates.  For example, in October 2018, the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation estimated that between 2.1 and 4.9 million members of immigrant families \ncould lose Medicaid due to the proposed public charge rule.44  The Migration Policy Institute \nestimated, based on earlier estimates of chilling effect losses under PRWORA, that 5.4 million to \n16.2 million immigrants and members of their families could disenroll from public benefit \nprograms.45 \n48.  My calculations begin with the number of people receiving Medicaid as of May \n2019, as reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 65.7 million.46  Note that \nbecause this data represents only federally-funded Medicaid, it is a conservative starting point \nbecause it does not include individuals enrolled in state-funded programs who may drop \ncoverage.

I identify immigrant-headed families, i.e., where the respondent or spouse is a \nforeign-born immigrant.48  Because Medicaid is a program for low-income people, I limit the \nanalyses to those who report having incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty line.  As \nseen in Table 1, about one-quarter of Medicaid enrollees, 16.5 million, are members of a low-\nincome immigrant family.  Of the 16.5 million members of immigrant families, 6.9 million are \nadults 21 or older and 9.6 are children under 21.  A large share of the members of immigrant \nfamilies, especially children, are U.S. citizens.  As described above, there is ample evidence that \npolicies aimed at non-citizen immigrants also have harmful effects on their citizen children, \nbecause of the chilling effect. \n49.  To estimate the effects of the public charge rule in causing people to forego or \ndisenroll from Medicaid, I use estimates from the Urban Institute’s May 2019 study,49 described \n                                                      \n47   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

I downloaded the 2017 data and \nconducted statistical analyses using standard statistical methods; 2017 is the last year for which \npopulation characteristics and income were available as of August 2019.   \n48   I use the population of immigrant families, which includes some naturalized citizens, rather than of \nfamilies containing one or more non-citizens, as DHS used.  I use this population to align with the \nestimates of the Urban Institute report by Bernstein, et al. (2019), which found that 20.7% of adults in \nimmigrant households avoided noncash benefits due to the chilling effect. While DHS used a base of \nnon-citizen households, in that case the percentage of people avoiding benefits would be higher.  That \nwould produce a smaller population base, but a higher percentage of people affected, which ought to \nproduce a similar level of estimates.  Moreover, as the Urban Institute report found, and other studies \ncorroborate, even citizens are affected by the chilling effect. \n49   Bernstein H, Gonzalez D, Karpman M, Zuckerman S.

The public charge rule was proposed in October 2018, \nand the survey was fielded soon thereafter in December 2018.  Its findings are comparable to \nprior studies about the effects of PRWORA immigrant benefit restrictions, but more specific \nabout the reaction to the public charge rule and based on data from late 2018.  The study found \nthat 20.7% of members of low-income immigrant families avoided non-cash benefits due to \ngreen card concerns and that 42 percent of those who avoided noncash benefits specifically \navoided Medicaid or CHIP; this leads to an estimate that 8.7 percent of low-income adults in \nimmigrant families (20.7 percent times 42 percent) will forego or disenroll from Medicaid as the \nlow estimate.  This is the low estimate because those levels of avoidance were occurring before \nthere was any implementation or enforcement of the policy and before there was as much \npublicity about impending changes in the public charge rules.   \n50.  Because of evidence that effects increase after policies are adopted (including \ndata about public charge denials at the State Department and about the consequences of \nimplementation of PRWORA immigrant restrictions), I set a high estimate at three times that \nlevel (26.1 percent reduction), assuming that additional awareness increases avoidance.  A few \nfactors led me to conservatively determine that a three-fold increase is reasonable.  First, the \nUrban Institute found that almost one third (31 percent) of immigrants who avoided benefits said \nthey had heard a lot about the proposed rule; it is reasonable to assume that awareness and \navoidance will rise sharply after implementation and enforcement.50  Second, visa denials rose \nfrom 1,076 in 2016, prior to the implementation of recent State Department public charge \n                                                      \n50   Ibid. \n33 \nAdd94\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 35 of 97\npolicies, to roughly three times more (3,237) in 2017 when the changes were under \nconsideration, to an additional four-fold increase (to 13,450) in 2018 after the change was \nimplemented.51 Large reductions in applications occurred in the wake of implementation of \nPRWORA immigrant restrictions; for example, in Los Angeles County the number of enrolled \ncitizen children with immigrant parents fell by 48 percent from 1996-98, despite the fact that \ncitizen children remained eligible for coverage.52  It is reasonable to assume that awareness of \nrisks associated with public charge and avoidance will increase substantially after \nimplementation, based on prior experiences. \n51.  For children, I use a similar approach, but reduce the estimated effects for \nchildren by 50 percent, compared to the level for adults.  The final regulation excludes Medicaid \nbenefits received by children under 21 from being considered as a heavily weighted factor.  \nDespite this shift from the proposed rules, there is still strong evidence that children in immigrant \nfamilies will be harmed, including citizen children, as found in the research on the impact of \nPRWORA immigrant restrictions, cited earlier. Moreover, as explained before, the confusing \ndirections for Form I-944 about how to report use of Medicaid by the family suggest that \nerroneous determinations of public charge status could be common because immigrants might \nreport other family members’ use of Medicaid rather than their own, such that families could be \npenalized for their children’s use of Medicaid benefits.   \n                                                      \n51   Based on statistics from Table XX of the State Department’s Annual Reports of the Visa Office for \n2016, 2017 and 2018.  https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html.  \nThese statistics do not include counts of cases subsequently overturned.

Finally, there is ample evidence indicating that parental participation in Medicaid \naffects children’s participation: when parents gain Medicaid coverage, their children are more \nlikely to enroll, even if the eligibility criteria for children do not change.  My research \ndemonstrated this relationship about twenty years ago53 and the effect has been confirmed in \nmultiple studies since.54  Evidence indicates that the reverse holds true too; when parents lose \nMedicaid coverage, many of their children disenroll too, even though the children remain \neligible.  For example, in 2012 the state of Maine cut Medicaid eligibility for parents.  Although \neligibility levels for children did not change, about 6,000 Maine children lost Medicaid \nbenefits.55  Insurance coverage is often considered as a family matter, so policies that force \nparents off trigger the loss of children’s insurance coverage too.  Since DHS only announced the \nchange in policy that exempts consideration of Medicaid benefits received by children under 21 \nas a heavily weighted negative factor in early August, I am not aware of any direct evidence \nshowing how this might reduce effects for children, so I determined that a 50 percent reduction \nwas a reasonable estimate, splitting the difference between no effect and the full adult effect.  \nThus, in Table 1, I estimate that the number of children in immigrant families who lose Medicaid \nwill range from 0.4 million to 1.25 million. \n                                                      \n53   Ku L, Broaddus M.

Taken together, these analyses indicate that between 1.02 million and 3.06 million \nmembers of low-income immigrant families will lose Medicaid coverage after the public charge \nrule is fully implemented and enforced.  This corresponds to a 6.2 percent to 18.5 percent loss of \nMedicaid among those who are members of low-income immigrant families.   \n54.  Using additional data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey, we can \nalso describe some characteristics of those who could be harmed by the public change rule.   \n  The low-income adults on Medicaid in immigrant families are about twice as likely to \nhave serious health problems as adults who are not in immigrant families and not on \nMedicaid.  Almost one-third (29 percent) of the low-income immigrant group report \nbeing in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of non-immigrant non-\nMedicaid adults.  About one-quarter (27 percent) of the immigrant group report \nhaving a functional limitation, such as difficulty walking, vision problems or having a \nhealth problem that impairs work versus 15 percent of the non-immigrant, non-\nMedicaid adults.  The burdens of the public charge rule will fall disproportionately on \nthose with poorer health.  Because the low-income adults on Medicaid in immigrant \nfamilies are less healthy, they are more likely to need medical care and are more \nlikely to experience harm to their health if they must forego Medicaid.  In addition, \nthe public charge rule also penalizes applicants in general if they are in poor health.   \n  Those affected by the public charge rule are far more likely to be members of \nracial/ethnic minorities.  The low-income members of immigrant families receiving \nMedicaid group are 56 percent Hispanic, 13 percent non-Hispanic white, 9 percent \nnon-Hispanic black and 21 percent Asian.  In comparison, those who are not in \nimmigrant families and not on Medicaid are 80 percent white, 7 percent Hispanic, 11 \n36 \nAdd97\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 38 of 97\npercent non-Hispanic black, 2 percent Asian and 1 percent other/mixed race.  Those \nwho are harmed by the public charge rule are far more likely to be Hispanic or Asian \nand much less likely to be non-Hispanic whites. \nF. Harm to Members of Immigrant Families Due to the Loss of Medicaid Benefits  \nDue to the Public Charge Rule \n55.  A substantial body of research has demonstrated how Medicaid helps improve \naccess to health care, helps people recover from illness or stay healthy, reduces mortality and has \nother important socially beneficial effects.  Much of this literature has developed because of the \nMedicaid expansions that occurred under the Affordable Care Act or other high quality research \nstudies.  In turn, this means that the loss of Medicaid benefits, as caused by the public charge \nrule, will create serious harm for those who lose Medicaid benefits due to the public charge rule. \n56.  A March 2018 review of the literature by the Kaiser Family Foundation identified \nover 200 studies about the effects of Medicaid expansions across a variety of areas.56  The \nreview found that Medicaid expansions (a) increased insurance coverage and reduced the number \nof uninsured, benefiting both rural and urban residents and those who are African-American, \nwhite and Latino, (b) strengthened access to health care services, increasing the ability of people \nto obtain preventive, primary and acute care services, medication and mental health care, (c) \nincreased low-income families’ financial security, (d) improved a variety of health outcomes, \nand (e) reduced uncompensated care costs and stabilized safety net health care providers.  A \nmore focused review on health benefits conducted by faculty at Harvard University and \n                                                      \n56   Antonisse L, Garfield R, Rudowitz R, Artiga S.

A new analysis by researchers at the University of Michigan, the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Census Bureau and the University of California at Los Angeles found \nthat expanding Medicaid eligibility was associated with significantly lower mortality, \nparticularly disease-related deaths (e.g., as opposed to accidents) and the effect increases over \ntime.59  Specifically, it estimated that Medicaid expansions were associated with 0.13 percent \nreduction in the mortality rate.  If we assume that this estimated change in mortality rates can be \napplied to the number of persons that I have projected to lose Medicaid coverage, the public \ncharge rule could eventually increase the number of premature deaths by between 1,300 and \n4,000 (0.13 percent times 1.02 million to 3.06 million losing Medicaid coverage).  This \ncorroborates an earlier study that examined the reduction in mortality after Massachusetts \nincreased insurance coverage under its state health reform, which found that every increase in \n                                                      \n57   Sommers B Gawande A, Baicker K.

I note that mortality rates might be slightly lower among those in \nimmigrant families.  Other research indicates that immigrants have slightly lower mortality rates \nthan those who are native-born, so the effect might be less pronounced.61 On the other hand, \nevidence indicates that the loss of health services for low-income people, many with poor health, \nwould lead to more serious health problems, including higher mortality.  \n58.  As noted earlier, a significant share of the immigrants who could be affected by \nthe public charge rule have fair or poor health or have limitations because of health problems.  \nThis is because the final rule assigns negative weight to individuals who have a serious medical \ncondition.  Analyses of the 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey reveal more detail about \ndisease prevalence among immigrant adults now covered by Medicaid.62  About 14 percent of \nlow-income immigrant adults enrolled in Medicaid report having diabetes, 27 percent have high \nblood pressure, 29 percent have high cholesterol, 3.4 percent have a history of cancer, and 5 \npercent have a history of coronary heart disease.  These are all serious chronic diseases, which \ngenerally require ongoing medical care and/or medication.   \n59.  To illustrate the consequences of the loss of Medicaid insurance coverage, I \npresent a hypothetical example about problems for a person with diabetes.  Loss of Medicaid \nwould make it much harder for a diabetic to continue to afford insulin or other diabetes-related \n                                                      \n60   Sommers B, Long S, Baicker K, Changes in Mortality after Massachusetts Health Care Reform: A \nQuasi-Experimental Study, Ann.

The average cost of insulin (without insurance) was $450 per \nmonth in 2016, compared to $234 in 2012.63  When diabetes is adequately controlled, diabetics \ncan function well in work and other normal activities of life, but the loss of medical care could \nlead to severe medical problems, including death and impairments such as heart disease, loss of \nvision or amputation.64 With adequate medical care, an immigrant could hold a job, go to school, \nsupport a family and pay taxes, but the loss of Medicaid could put all of that at risk and lead to \nserious, long-term health problems. \n60.  A recent study examined some of the medical needs of children who could be \naffected by the public charge rule, looking at children who lived with at least one noncitizen \nadult, based on analyses of the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.  Of these children: 11 \npercent had asthma, 18 percent had experienced gastrointestinal problems, 14 percent had the flu, \nand 9 percent had neuromuscular problems.  Forty percent needed care for an illness or injury \nand 18 percent needed medication.65  Forgoing Medicaid could have serious medical \nconsequences for these children that could not only impair their health, but reduce their \nopportunities to function well in school. \n61.  The public charge rule creates other harms for immigrants.  As noted earlier, \nmany in immigrant families are already under serious psychological stress due to the public \ncharge rule and perceptions of other Trump Administration policies.  The loss of Medicaid \nwould compound these problems.  Research has shown that receiving Medicaid helps reduce \n                                                      \n63   Thomas K.

Another harm of the public charge rule is the risk of family separation.  As noted \nby the Cato Institute, about 40 percent of those subject to the public charge rule are spouses or \nminor children.67  If they do not meet the public charge rule’s requirements, their ability to \nremain in the United States – and their ability to remain with their citizen or permanent resident \nspouses or children – is jeopardized, increasing the risk of family separation.  This risk increases \nthe pressure for immigrant families to avoid public benefits, while also adding to their \npsychological distress. \nG. Harm to State and Local Governments and Health Care Facilities \nDue to the Public Charge Rule \n63.  The harm caused by the public charge rule extends beyond the harm caused to \nmembers of immigrant families; there are broader repercussions that would create serious harm \nto state and local governments, health care providers and other members of these communities \nwho are not in immigrant families.  Safety net health care providers will lose Medicaid revenue, \nwhich will threaten their ability to serve their communities, including patients who are not \nmembers of immigrant families.  Many state or local governments will be forced to spend more \nto provide health care to indigent patients, increasing their state and local budget pressures.  \nFinally, the loss of federal Medicaid revenue (as well as the loss of federal SNAP benefits) \nwould have broader effects on state and local economies and employment.   \n                                                      \n66   Baicker K, et al.

The problem can be clearly understood in the case of health care. If fewer people \nhave Medicaid coverage, then health care providers, such as hospitals or community health \ncenters, will collect less insurance revenue; this is particularly a problem for safety net health \ncare providers that care for a large number of Medicaid patients.  But uninsured patients still \nneed medical care and often seek care at these facilities as uninsured patients. Safety net facilities \noften continue to care for uninsured patients, whether because of legal mandates or because of \ntheir mission to serve needy patients.  For example, as a condition of receiving federal funds \nunder Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, community health centers must serve all \npatients, regardless of their ability to pay for care.68  Thus, the health center must continue to \nprovide care, even if patients are uninsured and cannot pay.   \n65.  In this section, I summarize data from several reports that were released in late \n2018 that examine the effects of the public charge rule, as it was proposed in October 2018.  If \nthese analyses were conducted now the results might be slightly different because of changes in \nthe final regulation, such as the exclusion of consideration of Medicaid benefits used by children \nand pregnant women or the availability of more recent information.  But the general methods \nused in these reports appear technically reasonable and the direction of findings should be \napproximately valid, even if they were revised in light of the final regulation or more recent data. \n66.  In a November 2018 report, I and colleagues at George Washington University \nexamined the financial impact of the then-proposed public charge rule for community health \ncenters.69  The key results from that report are reproduced in Table 2 below. Nationwide, we \n                                                      \n68   42 U.S.C. 254b(k)(3)(G). \n69   Ku L, Sharac J, Gunsalus R, Shin P, Rosenbaum S.

In order to make up for that loss in revenue, we considered scenarios in which they \nwould either reduce the number of patients served or reduce their staffing.  We estimated that \nthis would cause health centers to serve between 295,000 and 538,000 fewer patients or reduce \nstaffing by around 3,400 to 6,100 staff.  Because health centers cannot discriminate and must \nserve all patients regardless of their ability to pay (or their immigration status), they must lower \ntheir overall patient caseloads, which would result in losses in the broader patient community \nand most of those patients would not be immigrants or members of immigrant families, or reduce \nstaff, most of whom are not immigrants.  The public charge rule would have repercussions that \nreduce services for broader communities, not just members of immigrant families.   \n67.

Similar analyses were conducted about the impact of the proposed public charge \nrule on the Medicaid revenues of hospitals across the country by Manatt Health, on behalf of \nAmerica’s Essential Hospitals, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American \nHospital Association, the Catholic Health Association of the United States, the Children’s \nHospital Association, and the Federation of American Hospitals.70  Like the community health \ncenter report, this November 2018 report was issued before the final regulation was issued.  \nResults today might differ somewhat, although the general nature and magnitude of results ought \nto remain similar.  This report analyzed the potential effect of the loss of Medicaid revenues in \nevery state and in many metropolitan areas across the nation.  Like health centers, hospitals \nwould need to compensate for the loss of revenue by reducing the number of patients served, \nincluding many who are not in immigrant families, reducing services and/or reducing staffing.  \nOverall, the report concluded that American hospitals could lose an estimated $17 billion, \nharming them and the communities they serve.  Because hospitals are so much larger and \nprovide much costlier care, the size of the losses is far higher for hospitals than community \nhealth centers.  The losses reported in this report include all types of hospitals, but the losses will \nbe higher in hospitals that serve more Medicaid patients or in areas with higher immigrant \npopulations, many of which are public hospitals or hospitals that receive substantial state or local \nsubsidies.  Table 3 provides the estimates of hospital losses by state; Table 4 shows them instead \narrayed by metropolitan areas.   \n   \n                                                      \n70   Mann C, Grady A, Orris A.

The Manatt report estimated that hospital losses due to the proposed public charge \nrule in New York State could total $2.7 billion, in California $5.2 billion, in Connecticut $163 \nmillion and in Vermont $3 million.  In the New York City-Newark metropolitan area the losses \ncould be $3.1 billion and losses could reach $2.0 billion in the Los Angeles area.   \n70.  Public health directors have commented on the major damage engendered by the \npublic charge policies.  In November 2018, Mitchell Katz, MD, MPH, who directs New York \nCity’s Health and Hospitals system and previously led the health departments of Los Angeles \nCounty and San Francisco and is one of the nation’s foremost authorities on public health and \nhealth care systems stated: “If enacted as proposed, this public charge provision could decrease \naccess to medical care and worsen the health of individuals, threaten public health, and undercut \nthe viability of the health care system.”71   \n71.  The results of the loss of Medicaid benefits would spill over into harm for \nhospitals, clinics and related facilities, both because of their underlying commitments to serve \ndisadvantaged patients, but in many cases because of state laws that require them to provide care \nto the indigent who are otherwise uninsured.  For example, under Section 2807-k(9-a) of the \nNew York State Public Health Law, the state requires that hospitals must limit what they can \ncharge low-income uninsured patients, effectively requiring them to accept losses to care for \nsuch patients.72  Section 17000 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code requires cities \nand counties to assume responsibilities for care:  “Every county and every city and county shall \nrelieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons, and those incapacitated by age, \ndisease, or accident, lawfully resident therein, when such persons are not supported and relieved \n                                                      \n71   Katz M, Chokshi D.

Other researchers have analyzed broader economic consequences of the public \ncharge rule.  For example, a report by researchers at the University of California73 estimated the \nimpact of the proposed public charge rule on California. The researchers began by estimating the \npotential loss of Medicaid and SNAP (called Medi-Cal and CalFresh in California) benefits by \nmembers of immigrant families in California, then estimated the level of federal revenue \n(Medicaid matching funds and federal SNAP payments) would be lost, a combined loss of $1.7 \nbillion in federal benefits received in California.  Because these benefits pay for health care \nservices and food, the lost federal revenue decreases money going to pay hospitals, doctors’ \noffices, grocery stores, and other businesses, and this in turn lower payments made to staff and to \nvendors, such as food producers, which have effects that multiply through the economy.  The \nresearchers then used economic models to estimate the number of jobs that would be lost due to \nthe reduction in federal revenue.  They estimated that this could cost California 17,700 jobs, \nabout half of which are in health care, 10 percent in the food sector and the rest in other areas of \nthe state’s economy.   \n73.  The reports cited above are just a portion of the analyses, mostly conducted soon \nafter the proposed public charge rule was released, that attempt to demonstrate the economic \n                                                      \n73   Ponce N, Lucia L, Shimada T.

Other Harmful Health Care Aspects of the Public Charge Rule \n74.  The public charge rule includes other provisions that relate to health insurance \ncoverage or health status.  Not only is the receipt of Medicaid a heavily weighted negative factor, \nso are: (a) having a serious medical condition that could result in hospitalization or extensive \nmedical care or interfere with the ability to work or (b) being uninsured with no prospect of \nobtaining private insurance, nor having the ability to pay for care (§212.22(c)(1)(iii)).  In \ncontrast, heavily weighted positive factors include having an income greater than 250 percent of \nthe federal poverty line or having private insurance, not including private coverage obtained \nthrough the Health Insurance Marketplace (also known as “Obamacare”) subsidized with \npremium tax credits (§212.22(c)(2)).   \n75.  Table 5 presents data on the health insurance coverage of adults who are low-\nincome (with incomes below 200 percent of poverty) members of immigrant families and of low-\nincome and upper-income families without immigrants, based on further analyses of the 2017 \nNational Health Interview Survey.74  Low-income members of immigrant families are much \nmore likely to be uninsured (38 percent) than low-income adults not in immigrant families (19 \npercent) and higher-income adults not in immigrant families (7 percent).  Moreover, members of \n                                                      \n74   Author’s analysis of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey.  \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm. \n50 \nAdd111\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 52 of 97\nlow-income immigrant families are less likely to be covered by private insurance, Medicaid or \nother insurance than low-income adults who are not in immigrant families.  \nTable 5.\nHealth Insurance Coverage of Adult (21-64) Members of Immigrant Families and Those\nWho are Not Members of Immigrant Families, 2017\nLow-income Low-income Not Low-income\nMember of   Not Member of  Not Member of \nImmigrant  Immigrant  Immigrant \nFamily Family Family\nPrivate Insurance 28.5% 35.4% 83.4%\nHealth Insurance Marketplace 1.5% 1.2% 1.3%\nMedicaid /CHIP 29.0% 35.7% 4.2%\nOther (e.g., Medicare, military) 3.0% 8.6% 3.8%\nUninsured  38.0% 19.1% 7.3%\nTotal 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nSource: Author's analysis of 2017 National Health Interview Survey\n \n \n76.  Medicaid eligibility for non-citizen immigrants was sharply restricted by \nPRWORA; analyses show that non-citizen immigrants are much less likely to get Medicaid than \nlow-income citizens.75  But the largest reason that immigrants are less insured is that, although \nthey have high labor participation rates, immigrants often work in jobs, such as construction, \nagriculture, hospitality or food processing jobs, that do not offer insurance to their employees.76  \nImmigrants are simply less likely to be offered insurance, whether by the government or by their \nemployers.  The public charge rule creates a further disadvantage to the uninsured, which \n                                                      \n75   Ku L, Bruen B.

Having private insurance is a heavily weighted positive factor in public charge \ndeterminations, but immigrants have lower opportunities to get private insurance than those who \nare not in immigrant families.  Data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey indicate \nthat 21 percent of immigrants who lack coverage report that it was because it was not offered in \ntheir jobs, because they were rejected by an insurance company, lost their job or changed \ncompanies, changed family status (e.g., divorced), or because the cost was too high, compared to \n10 percent of low-income adults not in immigrant families and 4 percent of higher income adults \nnot in immigrant families.  In addition, since those who get insurance through the Health \nInsurance Marketplaces with federal tax subsidies cannot count that insurance as a heavily \nweighted positive factor, about 1.5 percent of the low-income members of immigrant families \nwill not receive this positive factor either.   \n78.  Under the public charge rule, members of immigrant families can be penalized if \nthey use Medicaid or are uninsured.  Any expectation that they may make up this gap by gaining \nprivate insurance is unrealistic.  For example, in 2018, the average total cost of health insurance \nin an employer-sponsored plan was $6,715 for single person and was $19,565 for a family; these \nlevels are out of reach for almost all low-income immigrants if they are not offered insurance by \ntheir employers or get federal tax premiums to help them buy coverage through Health Insurance \nMarketplaces.  Less than a third of the adults in low-income immigrant families (28.5 percent) \nhave the private insurance that could count as a highly weighted positive factor; most of the rest \nwould face negative immigration consequences under the rule. \n52 \nAdd113\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-11   Filed 09/09/19   Page 54 of 97\nI.  Current or Past Status of Immigrants Does Not Predict Their Future Economic Success \n79.  According to DHS, the overarching goal of its revised public charge policies is to \n“better ensure that applicants for admission to the United States and applicants for adjustment of \nstatus to lawful permanent residency…are self-sufficient.”77   To accomplish this DHS will use \ncurrent or past characteristics of immigrant applicants, such as use of public benefits, being \nuninsured or having a low income, to effectively predict the future economic status of \nimmigrants. \n80.  A fundamental question is whether receiving Medicaid interferes with a \nrecipient’s economic status or employment.  The strongest evidence comes from a rigorous study \nconducted in Oregon by Harvard University researchers that found that receiving Medicaid did \nnot significantly discourage employment or lower earnings by low-income adults.78  Medicaid \ndid not harm their chances of employment or earnings; it just gave them health insurance \ncoverage to address their medical needs. This study used a randomized experiment, the strongest \npossible evaluation design, to compare those who received Medicaid and those who did not and \nfound that those who gained Medicaid coverage had equivalent employment rates and earnings \nlevels as those who did not.  Receiving Medicaid does not make recipients less likely to work or \nable to meet their economic needs.  Instead it provides health insurance coverage that helps them \nmeet their health care needs that can help them maintain employment and well-being.  \n81.  Research and experience also indicates the hazard of predicting future economic \nstatus based on past performance.  Immigrants are often initially disadvantaged when they first \narrive in the United States; they have limited American job experience and have not developed \n                                                      \n \n78   Baicker K, Finkelstein A, Song J, Taubman A.

Research consistently shows that when immigrants first enter, they tend to have lower \nincomes than similar U.S.-born adults, but their earnings grow rapidly as they remain in the US \nand gain experience, skills and opportunities, enabling them to integrate into the economic \nmainstream.79 The prototypical immigrant success story is one of a person who comes to the U.S. \nwith nothing in his or her pocket, but, through hard work and persistence, eventually becomes a \nsuccess.  For example, analyses of Census data reveal that immigrants without a high school \neducation, such as those targeted by the public charge rule, initially have lower average incomes \nthan similar U.S.-born citizens (with the same gender, age, and education), but the immigrants’ \nincomes catch up and then surpass their U.S.-born peers within six or seven years.80 Public \ncharge policies make it harder for the immigrant to remain in the U.S. and thus jeopardize their \nability to improve their economic status.  There is even stronger evidence of the economic and \neducational success of “second generation” immigrants, the U.S.-born children of immigrants.81 \nPublic charge policies that reduce the ability of immigrants or their children to remain in the \nUnited States could short-circuit their subsequent economic well-being. \n                                                      \n79   See, e.g., Chiswick B.

My name is Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach. I make this declaration in support of \nPlaintiffs’ Request for a preliminary injunction.  \nBackground  \n2.  I am the Director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, \nwhere I am also the Margaret Walker Alexander Professor of Social Policy and Economics.  For \nthe past two decades, I have conducted and published numerous peer-reviewed research studies \nand book chapters on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as \nSNAP. I recently served as a member of the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Examination \nof the Adequacy of Food Resources and SNAP Allotments, and the Committee on National \nStatistics of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Improving Consumer Data for \nFood and Nutrition Policy Research for the Economic Research Service, United States \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA). I was previously the Director of the Hamilton Project, an \neconomic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution. I hold a Ph.D. in economics from \nPrinceton University. My declaration draws primarily from research that I have conducted or \n1 \n \n \nAdd117\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 3 of 38\n \nreviewed that use economic and econometric methods to consider the role of SNAP and other \ninfluences on food consumption, food insecurity, economic well-being, and other outcomes.  My \nCurriculum Vitae is attached as Exhibit A to this declaration. \n3.  I have previously testified before the House Agriculture Committee and the U.S. \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry regarding SNAP. I have previously \nprovided an expert declaration in Texas Taxpayer & Student Fairness Coalition, et al. v. \nEdgewood Independent School District, et al. v. Robert Scott, Cause No. D-1-GN-11-003130 \n(200th Judicial District, Texas). I have not provided testimony in any other litigation. \n4.  I have been engaged by counsel for Plaintiffs in this case to evaluate the effect of \nthe new public charge rule (“the public charge rule” or “the Rule”)1 on the use of SNAP benefits \nand the resulting effects on individuals, communities, and the nation.   \nSummary \n5.  As described below, from my expert review, I conclude that because of the \nchilling effects of the public charge rule, enrollment among SNAP households with immigrant \nmembers will decline by nearly 20 percent and that 524,897 households will not participate in \nSNAP due to the Rule. These households include 1.78 million individuals, many of whom are \ncitizens. The loss of SNAP benefits will cause substantial harm to households and their \ncommunities, and will especially cause harm to young children in those households; 35 percent \nof participating SNAP households with noncitizen members had a young child between ages 0 \nand 4 in the household. Research reviewed below suggests that the loss of these benefits will \nhave lasting impacts on health and well-being in the short-, medium, and long-term.  I also \nconclude that the annual economic loss from foregone SNAP benefits due to the Rule will be \n                                                 \n1   Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. \n103, 212, 213, 214, 245, 248). \n2 \n \n \nAdd118\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 38\n \n$2.0 billion and that the economic multiplier impacts of these losses yields a likely annual \neconomic loss of $3.2 billion.  \n6.  My findings show that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) misunderstand the supplemental nature of SNAP.  \nParticipating SNAP households with immigrant members on average receive a minority of their \ntotal resources from SNAP payments. In data from 2017, over half of SNAP households with \nimmigrant members that did not contain an elderly or disabled member had earnings in the \nmonth they received benefits.   \n7.  I also found significant problems in DHS’s estimates. First, DHS substantially \nunderstates the number of immigrant households that may be impacted. I estimate that there are \n2.6 million households on SNAP that include noncitizen members, and these households include \n6.5 million people who receive SNAP, and 8.9 million individuals overall in the households, \nwhereas DHS estimates that there are 1.5 million households on SNAP that include noncitizen \nmembers, and these households include 5.1 million individuals. \n8.  Second, DHS compounds this error by making an unreasonable estimate of a \nlikely disenrollment effect based on chilling effects estimates that are substantially outside of the \nrange of credible social science estimates. A justifiable estimate is that enrollment among SNAP \nhouseholds with immigrant members will decline by around 20 percent. I estimate that 524,897 \nhouseholds will not participate in SNAP due to the Rule. These households include 1.78 million \nindividuals, whereas DHS estimates that there will be 65,612 households and 222,868 \nhouseholds that will not participate. \n3 \n \n \nAdd119\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 38\n \n9.  I predict the annual total amount of foregone SNAP benefits due to the Rule will \nbe $2.0 billion. This figure is about 10 times greater than DHS’s estimates,2 which are flawed \nboth in terms of the number of SNAP households with immigrant members and in the likely rate \nof disenrollment or foregone enrollment. Including the economic multiplier impacts of these \nlosses yields a likely annual economic loss of $3.2 billion. The estimated lost benefits to the state \nof New York will be $179 million annually, which will result in $287 million in lost economic \nactivity. Connecticut is estimated to lose $22.7 million in benefits and $36.3 million in economic \nactivity. Vermont is estimated to lose $1.0 million in benefits and $1.6 million in economic \nactivity. \nI.  Background on SNAP \nA.  Overview of SNAP \n10.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as \nthe Food Stamp Program, is a cornerstone of the U.S. safety net. SNAP is the only social benefits \nprogram universally available to low-income Americans, and, in 2018, it assisted 40 million \npeople in a typical month—about one out of every eight Americans. Overall, $60.6 billion was \nspent on benefits in 2018. SNAP benefits typically are paid once per month on an electronic \nbenefits transfer card that can be used in a food retailer’s checkout line like a debit card, to \npurchase eligible goods which include most foods that are intended to be taken home and eaten.  \n11.  SNAP is designed to prop up families’ purchasing power when their incomes are \nlow, and helps to buffer households’ economic shocks due to job loss or other income declines. \nSNAP also has a stated goal of strengthening the agricultural economy, and every $1 increase in \n                                                 \n2   See Regulatory Impact Analysis, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Table 22. \n4 \n \n \nAdd120\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 38\n \nSNAP benefits has been shown to increase economic activity in the economy by $1.60.3 In \naddition, SNAP plays an important role as an automatic stabilizer, responding powerfully and \nquickly in times of economic downturns. During a recession, as unemployment rises, many \nfamilies’ incomes fall, making more of them eligible for SNAP benefits (or making those already \neligible for SNAP eligible for larger benefits). Benefits are quickly spent, generally in the local \neconomy, providing an economic stimulus.4 \n12.  SNAP benefits are designed to fill the gap between a family’s resources that are \navailable to purchase food and the price of a low-cost food diet. Maximum benefits vary by \nhousehold size. The maximum monthly benefit for a family of three in fiscal year 2019 is $505, \nor about $17 per day. Most families do not receive the maximum benefit because they have some \nresources (for example, earnings) that they can spend on groceries, and SNAP benefits are \nreduced accordingly. The average monthly SNAP benefit received for a family of three in 2019 \nis $378, or a little over $12 per family per day (approximately $4 per person per day).5 \n13.  By design, SNAP can very quickly adapt to declining economic conditions. \nDuring a recession as more households become eligible for the program they can be quickly \nenrolled, with total program outlays automatically increasing along with need. SNAP payments \nand caseloads increased in the wake of the Great Recession, and, at their peak in 2012, 15 \npercent of the population participated in SNAP.6 As the economy has recovered and \nunemployment rates have declined, caseloads have fallen such that by 2018 the participation rate \n                                                 \n3   Bivens, Josh. 2011.

Eligibility for SNAP  \n14.  Under federal rules, to be eligible for SNAP a household’s income and assets \nmust meet three tests. First, their gross monthly income (before any deductions are applied) must \nbe no higher than 130 percent of the poverty line, unless there is an elderly or disabled member \nin the household. Second, their net income must be no higher than 100 percent of the poverty \nline (after a series of deductions—including a standard deduction available to all households, \nsome earned income, childcare expenses, legally obligated child support, housing costs that \nexceed half of the family’s net income, and medical expenses for elderly or disabled household \nmembers).8 Third, the household’s assets must fall below $2,250, or $3,500 (which generally \ninclude bank accounts, but not other significant assets such as retirement savings, most \nautomobiles, or homes of residence) for households with an elderly or disabled member. States \nhave the option to raise the gross income and asset limits; in 2019, 31 states have adopted higher \nincome and asset limits, and another nine states have adopted higher asset limits only.9 As a \nresult, many SNAP participants have income above the poverty line and many have significant \nassets.10,11 During normal economic times, unemployed, nondisabled childless adults (also \n                                                 \n7   Greenstein, Robert, Brynne Keith-Jennings, and Dottie Rosenbaum. 2018. Factors Affecting SNAP Caseloads. \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities. \n8   All SNAP households are eligible for the standard deduction, 69 percent claim the shelter deduction, and 31 \npercent claim the earnings deduction. Childcare, child support, and medical expense deductions are claimed by \nfour, two, and six percent, respectively (CBPP, A Quick Guide to SNAP Eligibility and Benefits). \n9   Schanzenbach, Diane. 2019.

Some noncitizens are eligible for SNAP, and may be awarded benefits if they also \nsatisfy the program’s other eligibility requirements such as income and resource limits. \nNoncitizens may be eligible if they are in a qualified aliens category and, in most cases, meet one \nadditional condition. Qualified aliens include: lawfully admitted for permanent residence (LPRs, \nor green card holders) also including Amerasian immigrants; asylees; parolees; deportation (or \nremoval) withheld; conditional entrants; Cuban or Haitian entrants; battered noncitizens; \nrefugees; trafficking victims; Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants; certain American Indians \nborn abroad; and certain Hmong or Highland Laotian tribal members. In addition, most qualified \naliens must also meet one of the following conditions to be eligible for SNAP: five years of \nUnited States residence; 40 qualifying work quarters; under the age of 18; blind or disabled; \nelderly who lawfully resided in the U.S. on August 22, 1996; and active duty military (excluding \nNational Guard) or honorably discharged veterans. Noncitizens that are tourists or students are \ngenerally not eligible. Undocumented noncitizens have never been eligible for SNAP, though \nsuch individuals may live in a household that receives SNAP benefits for other members.  \n16.  In some cases, an intending immigrant undergoing adjustment would be eligible \nfor SNAP before his or her green card application is approved. More commonly, the applicant \nundergoing the public charge determination only would be eligible for SNAP five years after he \nor she adjusts. But an adjusted LPR may be eligible for SNAP sooner if he or she is under age \n18, in receipt of a disability-based benefit, can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of work, \nor was lawfully residing in the United States and 65 or older when PRWORA was signed into \nlaw on August 22, 1996. \n7 \n \n \nAdd123\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 38\n \nC.  Background on Characteristics of SNAP Users  \n17.  USDA collects information on participating SNAP households in its “Quality \nControl (QC) Data,” which are publicly available on the agency’s website.12 In this section, I use \nthese data to describe SNAP households in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia, broken \ninto two groups: (1) all households on SNAP, for comparison; and (2) households that receive \nSNAP benefits and contain at least one member who is a noncitizen, whether or not the \nnoncitizen member(s) are eligible for or themselves participate in SNAP. DHS’s Regulatory \nImpact Analysis issued with the Rule stated that it based its calculations on the total share of \nforeign-born noncitizens as a percentage of the U.S. population,13 and my analysis mirrors that \napproach. As shown in Table 1, 11.3 percent of SNAP households have a noncitizen household \nmember (column 2). \n18.  As shown in Table 1, 11.3 percent of SNAP households have a noncitizen \nhousehold member (column 2). Households with noncitizens are more likely than households on \nSNAP in general to have any child or a young child (age 0 to 4) in the household and less likely \nto have an elderly or disabled member as the overall caseload. Households with noncitizens have \nlarger household sizes than SNAP households overall, and all else equal, that implies that they \nwill receive larger SNAP benefits due to the larger household size.  \nTable 1: Demographic Characteristics of SNAP Households (2017) \nSNAP \nAll SNAP  Households \nHouseholds  with Any \n   (1)  Noncitizen  \n                                                 \n12   The SNAP QC data are generated from monthly reviews of SNAP cases conducted by state SNAP agencies, to \nassess the accuracy of eligibility determinations and benefit calculations. The public-use database contains \ndetailed demographic, economic, and SNAP eligibility information for a nationally representative sample of \napproximately 45,500 SNAP units. The data are released annually, and are available at the following website: \nhttps://www.fns.usda.gov/resource/snap-quality-control-data. \n13 See Regulatory Impact Analysis, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Table 14. \n8 \n \n \nAdd124\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 38\n \n(2) \nShare of HH’s on SNAP  100.0%  11.3% \nShare of HH’s with children aged \n0–4  20.4%  34.6% \nShare of HH’s with children < \nage 18  41.7%  67.4% \nShare of HH’s w/elderly or \ndisabled member  44.4%  28.3% \nAverage household size  2.18  3.33 \n \n19.  SNAP households with noncitizens are substantially more likely to include \nsomeone who is employed (measured as having earnings greater than zero) than the overall \nSNAP caseload. Among SNAP households that do not contain an elderly or disabled member, \n58.7 percent of households with noncitizen members have earnings in a given month, compared \nwith 31.4 percent of SNAP households overall. In my calculations, earnings are measured as a \nsnapshot — measuring those having positive earnings in the month that they participated in the \nSNAP QC data collection. Studies that use different datasets that can follow SNAP participants \nover time (including in months that they do not receive SNAP benefits) estimate even higher \nshares of employment.14 SNAP participants tend to work in sectors that have variable hours and \nhigher rates of job turnover and unemployment.15 As a result, measuring employment in a single \nmonth for this population understates the share that will be employed at some point in the \nmonths surrounding SNAP receipt. Consistent with this increased likelihood of having earnings, \nSNAP comprises a smaller share of the total household budget for households with noncitizen \n                                                 \n14   These studies follow SNAP participants in general, and due to data limitations cannot reliably separate \nimmigrant SNAP participants. Longitudinal studies find that 74 percent of adults on SNAP work in the year \nbefore or after they receive SNAP benefits. About two-thirds of SNAP recipients are not expected to work, \nprimarily because they are children, elderly or disabled.

Among \nSNAP households with a married couple head and at least one child in the household, I calculate \nthat 13.6 percent of spouses have different immigration statuses from one another. As shown in \nTable 3 below, 5.7 percent of SNAP households overall have at least one noncitizen parent and \nat least one citizen child (including 4.8 percent with only a citizen child or children, and 0.9 \npercent that have at least two children, at least one of whom is a citizen and at least one of whom \nis not). The majority of mixed-status families have young children, ages 0 to 4, in the household. \nPrior research (further described below) suggests that a substantial share of citizen children with \nimmigrant parents dropped off SNAP when many immigrants were temporarily barred from the \nprogram in 1996, even though citizen children were still eligible for SNAP.17 Research also \nshows that the impact of SNAP on later-life economic and health outcomes is important for \n                                                 \n16   SNAP as a share of total income is calculated as SNAP benefits as a share of SNAP benefits plus earnings plus \nunearned income. \n10 \n \n \nAdd126\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 12 of 38\n \nchildren through age 18, and is particularly large for young children, underscoring the need to \nprotect young children from the loss of SNAP benefits.18  \nTable 3: Characteristics of Households Receiving SNAP, by Citizenship of Parents and \nChildren (2017) \nNoncitizen \nCitizen  Parent,  Noncitizen \nParent,  Noncitizen  Mixed- Parent, \nCitizen  Parent,  status  Noncitizen \nChild  Citizen Child Children  Child \n   (1)  (2)  (3)  (4) \nShare of total caseload  33.5%  4.8%  0.9%  0.6% \nHousehold contains a young child (0–4) 49.6%  53.1%  60.4%  14.0% \nAverage benefit  $402.12  $353.71  $337.02  $340.84 \nD.  Positive Impacts to Individuals and Families Who Receive SNAP  \n20.  Many studies have documented a range of positive impacts of SNAP benefits on \nthose who participate, both in the short-run and for children in the medium- and long-run. Loss \nof access to SNAP benefits will cause substantial harm to households and their communities, and \nwill especially cause harm to young children in those households.19 \n21.  Studies show that SNAP reduces poverty: SNAP kept 8.4 million people out of \npoverty in 2015 (the most recent data available), including 3.8 million children. It also lifted 4.7 \nmillion people, including 2.0 million children out of deep poverty, defined as household income \n                                                                                                                                                             \n17   East, Chloe N.

American Economic Review 106 (4): 903–34. \n19   Most of the SNAP studies described below measure the impact on participants generally—not just on \nimmigrants, however, it is reasonable to assume that SNAP impacts on immigrants are similar to those on \nparticipants overall. This assumption can be tested in the case of pregnant women’s access to SNAP. Studies of \nthe overall SNAP population and those limited to immigrants show that SNAP benefits have similar positive \nimpacts on birth outcomes for both groups. See Almond, Douglas, Hilary W.

SNAP has long-lasting positive effects: Recent research has documented \nimportant benefits of SNAP beyond the short-term “in the moment” reductions in poverty and \nfood insecurity. SNAP is a very good investment that helps prevent lasting negative effects of \ninadequate childhood resources, demonstrably improving children’s health in the short, medium, \nand long run, and children’s economic outcomes in the long run.  \n23.  Some of the best evidence comes from studies of birth cohorts that had \ndifferential access to SNAP—then called the food stamp program—when it was originally \nintroduced in the 1960s as part of the War on Poverty. Congress phased in the program across \ndifferent counties over the span of a decade, which provides researchers the opportunity to \nstatistically isolate the program’s impact by comparing children born at different times—and \nliving in different counties in the same states—during the rollout period.  \n24.  One study using this design demonstrates that when a pregnant woman had access \nto the program during her third trimester, her baby weighed more at birth, and was also less \nlikely to weigh below the clinical threshold of low birth weight.23 This outcome was significant \n                                                 \n20   Wheaton, Laura and Victoria Tran. 2018.

Subsequent studies evaluate adult outcomes for those given access to SNAP \nduring childhood, and find that SNAP causes improvements in education, health, and economic \noutcomes. In particular, access to SNAP from conception through age 5 increased a child’s \nlikelihood of graduating from high school by 18 percentage points.25  \n26.  Adult health—measured as an index comprising obesity, high blood pressure, \ndiabetes, heart disease and heart attack—was markedly improved if the individual had access to \nthe program during early childhood.26 Looking at a broader range of economic and education \noutcomes, among women SNAP access improved an index of adult economic outcomes \nincluding educational attainment, employment, earnings, family income, and reduced the \nlikelihood that they would be poor or participate in SNAP or TANF (the cash welfare program) \nduring adulthood. There were positive impacts on economic and education outcomes for SNAP \naccess from age 6 through 18 as well as from conception through age 5.27  \n27.  More recent research extends this work and finds that early life access to SNAP \nbenefits leads to improvements in long-term earnings and education, and reductions in mortality \nand criminal activity.28 In other words, SNAP provides critical benefits to children, which \nincreases their health and human capital accumulation during childhood, which, in turn, helps \n                                                 \n24   Figlio, D., Guryan, J., Karbownik, K. and Roth, J., 2014.

A decline in the availability of benefits is likely to \nlead to worse outcomes for these children in adulthood.29 \n28.  Other high-quality evidence on the impact of SNAP are based on a policy change \nwhich temporarily barred many legal immigrants from the program. In 1996 after the passage of \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act as part of welfare reform, many legal \nimmigrants were barred from SNAP participation.30 In 1998 and 1999, a few states began \nrestoring benefits using their own state funds. At the Federal level, benefits were restored in \nApril 2003 for many immigrants. One study focuses on these SNAP immigrant eligibility \nchanges to investigate the impact on U.S. citizen children born to immigrants.31 Even though the \nchildren’s eligibility for SNAP remained unchanged, a substantial share of them stopped \nparticipating in SNAP when their parent(s) lost access to the program. The study finds that \nSNAP participation rates among children of immigrants declined by eight percentage points \nwhen their parent(s) lost access, and that on average this policy change resulted in $185 in \nmonthly SNAP benefits lost per household. The study then estimates the impact of this decline in \nSNAP participation during early childhood (conception through age 4) on subsequent health \n(measured at ages 6–16), and finds declines in parent-reported health and increases in school \nabsences. Furthermore, loss of access to SNAP among pregnant women in their third trimester \ndue to this policy change resulted in lower birth weights and an increased likelihood of a low \nbirth weight birth.  \n \n \n                                                 \n29   Hoynes, Hilary W. and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach. 2018.

There are a number of spillover impacts onto society at large from SNAP \nparticipation among immigrant families. SNAP has an important direct stimulus impact on the \neconomy. Its recipients quickly spend the benefits, providing a relatively rapid fiscal stimulus to \nthe local economy including the retail, wholesale, and transportation systems that deliver the \nfood purchased. The USDA estimates that every $5 in new SNAP benefits generates as much as \n$9 of economic activity.32 This translates into almost 10,000 jobs from $1 billion dollars in \nadditional SNAP spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that on average $1 in \nchanged SNAP spending yields $1.50 in economic benefits, while Mark Zandi of Moody’s \nAnalytics’ Economy.com estimates the benefits to be $1.70 for every dollar in changed SNAP \nspending. In the simulations that follow, I adopt the midpoint between these estimates, $1.60 for \nevery $1 in changed SNAP spending.33 \n30.  Many of the direct effects described in the section above also have spillover \nimpacts to the broader society. Increased food insecurity will likely increase demand at food \nbanks and other food charities.34 Decreases in SNAP participation result in worse health \noutcomes,35,36 and are associated with increased health care expenditures.37 There are expected \neducation costs as well. Declines in SNAP participation increase school absence rates38 and \n                                                 \n32   Hanson, Kenneth. 2010.

For example, increased earnings result in decreased costs for future social benefits \nprograms and increased tax revenues; removing children from SNAP would reverse these long-\nterm gains.42  \nII.  Likely Adverse Impacts of Public Charge Rule  \nA.  Impact on Noncitizen Households \n31.  To determine the likely impact of the Public Charge rule, one must estimate the \nnumber of people living in households that participate in SNAP that also have a noncitizen \nmember of the household, in order to determine the population “at risk” of nonparticipation in \nSNAP. One must also estimate the share of this group who will drop off of SNAP or will forego \napplying for benefits due to the Rule. Multiplying the “at risk” population by the share who are \nlikely to drop off gives the number of people expected to exit or forego SNAP due to the Rule. \nEstimating the average benefit per person in households with immigrants allows for calculation \nof the total dollar amount of benefits expected to be lost. Finally, to assess the overall economic \nimpact of the lost SNAP payments one must multiply benefits by an accepted macroeconomic \n                                                 \n39   Davis, Lisa. 2019.

It is important to base the analysis on all SNAP households that contain \nnoncitizens, because research has shown that there are important spillover effects from SNAP \nrule changes that affect noncitizens, even onto groups that are not directly affected by the rule \nchanges. For example, studies of the 1996 policy change which temporarily barred many legal \nimmigrants from the program document that groups living in households with noncitizens who \ngenerally were not themselves barred from participation reduced their participation in SNAP, \nincluding refugees43 and citizen children of noncitizen parents.44 A recent study asked adults in \nimmigrant families whether they or a family member did not participate in a government benefits \nprogram in 2018 for fear of risking future green card status, and found that adults in 20.7 percent \nof low-income immigrant families reported avoiding public benefits. Even though the Rule \nwould only directly impact adults who do not hold a green card, nonetheless there were reports \nof benefit avoidance even among households with immigration and citizenship statuses that \nwould never be subject to the Rule.45 These studies imply that analysis of the impact of the Rule \nshould be based on all SNAP households with noncitizen members.  \n33.  Table 4 below presents estimates of the number of SNAP households, and the \nnumber of individuals residing in those households, that contain noncitizen members.

In column 3, I present the number of SNAP households containing a noncitizen \nmember, which I calculated from the 2013–2017 USDA SNAP Quality Control (QC) data, using \nsampling weights provided in the dataset. The number of SNAP households containing a \nnoncitizen member I calculate is 2.6 million, which is 1.7 times the number reported by DHS. \nThe implied share of SNAP households with noncitizen members (dividing column 3 by column \n2 in row A) is 11.83 percent. In column 4, I calculate from the SNAP QC data the number of \npeople residing in SNAP households that contain noncitizen members, and find that the \npopulation is 8.9 million people.47 This number includes 4.5 million children under the age of 18, \nand 1.6 million children aged 0 to 5. \nTable 4: Estimates of Numbers of People in SNAP Households with Noncitizens \n# People in \n# HH’s on  SNAP HH's \nSNAP w/  w/  % HH w/ \nPeople on  Households  Noncitizen  Noncitizen  Noncitizen \nSNAP(1)  on SNAP(2) Members(3) Members(4)  Member(5) \nA.

Next, in Table 5, I estimate annual SNAP benefits received by households with \nnoncitizen members.48 I calculate annual SNAP benefits per recipient49 to be $1,556, and annual \nSNAP benefits per participating household to be $3,794.  \n                                                 \n46   Data are available here: https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/SNAPsummary-8.pdf. \n47   Note that not all of these individuals living in SNAP households are themselves receiving SNAP benefits; some \nare ineligible or otherwise not participating, although other member(s) of their households participate in SNAP. \nThe average household size among SNAP households with noncitizen members in the SNAP QC data is 3.39. \n48   The SNAP QC data measure monthly SNAP benefits, and to translate this into an annual estimate I multiply the \nmonthly benefit by 12. \n18 \n \n \nAdd134\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 20 of 38\n \nTable 5: Estimates of Annual SNAP Benefits in SNAP Households with Noncitizens \nAverage  Average \nSNAP/Recipient  SNAP/Household \nAnnual  Annual \nBenefits(1)  Benefits(2) \nA.

Next, I calculate the number of individuals and households that would be \nexpected to disenroll from SNAP or avoid enrolling in SNAP due to the public charge rule. The \nsocial science research indicates that many immigrants will avoid participating in SNAP even if \nthey are still eligible for the program. A number of research estimates, described below, imply \nthat participation will decline by around 20 percent.  \n37.  Some of the best estimates from the research literature of the likely disenrollment \nimpact come from studies that investigated the barring of many immigrants from SNAP in 1996, \nfollowed by the subsequent restoration of eligibility for many immigrants. These studies show \nthat disenrollment impacts will not only impact those who lose eligibility directly, but also \nestablish a chilling effect onto other populations that also reduce their participation in response to \npolicy changes. One study finds that U.S. citizen children, who did not experience any changes \nin SNAP eligibility, were less likely to enroll in SNAP when their immigrant parent(s) lost \naccess.50 The magnitude of the enrollment decline implies a 19.3 percent decline in the levels of \nSNAP participation among U.S. citizen children with immigrant parents.51 A different study \n                                                                                                                                                             \n49   SNAP benefits per recipient are calculated as household SNAP benefits divided by the number of household \nmembers participating in SNAP. On average, there are 2.46 household members who receive SNAP benefits, \nand 3.42 household members in total, including those who do not receive SNAP benefits. \n50   East, Chloe N. Forthcoming. The Effect of Food Stamps on Children’s Health: Evidence from Immigrants’ \nChanging Eligibility. Journal of Human Resources. \n51   To arrive at an estimate of implied caseload decline, I estimated the likelihood that citizen children living with \nnoncitizen adults participate in SNAP in 2016, and calculated the decline in number of participants if the \nlikelihood were to decline by eight percentage points, as estimated by East. See East, Chloe N. Forthcoming. \n19 \n \n \nAdd135\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 21 of 38\n \nusing a broader measure of participation in social benefits programs after many immigrants lost \naccess to SNAP estimated a 21 percent decline in immigrants’ use of social benefits programs \nafter welfare reform.52 This study also found similar sharp declines among refugees, even though \nfew refugees lost their eligibility to participate in the programs.  \n38.  Studying the landscape today, a 2019 Urban Institute report finds that 20.7 \npercent of adults in low-income immigrant families did not participate in a social benefits \nprogram because of the “chilling effects” of the proposed changes to the public charge rule.53  \n39.  Together, these studies have two implications. First, the expected decline in \nparticipation will impact more than the groups directly impacted by the Rule, but will also \nimpact other groups such as refugees and citizen members of households containing noncitizens. \nSecond, a reasonable assumption of the likely magnitude of the decline in SNAP participation \nwill be around 20 percent.54  \n40.  In Table 6 below, I calculate the predicted declines in SNAP participation based \non the range of findings from the studies described above. Assuming a 20 percent \nnonparticipation rate, I predict that 1.78 million people will be living in the 524,897 households \nthat are predicted not to participate in SNAP. I also provide predictions based on each study \ndescribed above, with nonparticipation rates estimated to be 19.3 percent, 20.7 percent, and 21.0 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nThe Effect of Food Stamps on Children’s Health: Evidence from Immigrants’ Changing Eligibility.

The prior studies (East; Fix and \nPassel) find that disenrollment continues for several years after a policy change until the total impact on \nenrollment is realized, and the same is expected in this case.  In addition, the recent Urban Institute study \n(Bernstein et al.) finds that 31 percent of adults in immigrant families who had heard a lot about the Rule \navoided benefits. The avoidance rates were smaller for those who had heard “some” about the proposed rule \n(fifteen percent avoided benefits) and those who had heard “nothing at all” about the proposed rule (six percent \navoided benefits).  As the Rule receives additional publicity while it is scheduled to go into effect, more \nfamilies will know more about it, and they will become more likely to avoid benefits. \n20 \n \n \nAdd136\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 22 of 38\n \npercent, respectively. For completeness, I also present estimates based on the DHS preferred \nestimate for nonparticipation, which is 2.5 percent, well out of the range of the prior studies. \nDHS also considers a 54 percent nonparticipation effect, which is from an estimate of the \nimpacts of welfare reform on SNAP participation among immigrants published by the USDA’s \nFood and Nutrition Service’s Office of Analysis, Nutrition and Education.  The number of non-\nparticipating households are 65,612 at DHS’s 2.5 percent rate, and 1.42 million at the 54 percent \nrate. \nTable 6: SNAP Non-participation due to Public Charge Rule, Various Assumptions \nHousehold-\nPerson-level \nlevel \nAnalysis(1) \nAnalysis(2) \nA. 20% Assumption   1,782,947  524,897 \nB. 19.3% Assumption (East 2018)  1,720,544  506,525 \nC. 20.7% Assumption (Urban Institute 2019)  1,845,350  543,268 \nD. 21% Assumption (Urban Institute 1999)  1,872,094  551,141 \nE.

The estimated dollar value of annual foregone SNAP benefits is shown below in \nTable 7 in row C, and is estimated to be $2.0 billion.55 As described above, since SNAP benefits \nare quickly spent, generally in the recipient’s local community, this will have spillover effects to \nother aspects of the economy such as food retailers.

The median SNAP fiscal multiplier described in a recent \nreport on fiscal multipliers is 1.6.56 Accounting for this SNAP fiscal multiplier effect, the \nestimated annual direct economic cost of the public charge rule will be $3.2 billion. The USDA \nestimates that the SNAP multiplier could be as high as 1.8. On the low side, Blinder and Zandi \nestimate that during good economic times it could be 1.22. Using these fiscal multipliers, the \nrange of total economic impact could be as high as $3.6 billion or as low as $2.4 billion.57 Note \nthat these estimates do not include all costs. For example, they do not include the long-term harm \nthat would be expected to occur for children in affected households, and they do not include \nadministrative costs to SNAP. \nTable 7: Estimated Cost of SNAP Non-Participation due to Public Charge Rule \nA.

Basis of My Conclusions and Flaws in DHS Analysis  \n44.  My estimated cost of SNAP nonparticipation is 16 times the DHS estimate.59 My \nestimate is based on sound social science principles using appropriate data. In contrast, DHS’s \nanalysis is not based on reasonable assumptions and does not use appropriate data.    \n45.  The DHS deficiencies are revealed by examining three differences in calculations. \nFirst, I estimate that the number of households on SNAP with noncitizen members is 1.7 times \n                                                 \n58   Numbers drawn from Kaiser Family Foundation reports on state noncitizen populations, see \nhttps://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-citizenship-status/ \n59   See Regulatory Impact Analysis, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Table 17. \n23 \n \n \nAdd139\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 25 of 38\n \nthe number estimated by DHS.60 Second, I assume a 20 percent nonparticipation impact, 8 times \nlarger than the DHS assumption of 2.5 percent. Third, I estimate the costs based on a direct \nmeasure of benefits paid to SNAP households with noncitizens. I describe each difference in \nmore detail below. \n46.  First, DHS’s incorrect estimates of the number of SNAP households including \nnoncitizens are presented in row B of Table 4.61 I calculate this number from the SNAP QC data, \nwhich are the appropriate source for this information and is the administrative data source that \nUSDA uses to measure characteristics of the SNAP caseload.62  DHS could have also done this \nanalysis. The data on actual SNAP participation is readily available.  Instead, DHS chose a crude \nmethod of calculating the number of these households—it simply assumed that the percentage of \nhouseholds containing foreign-born noncitizens on SNAP was equal to the proportion of \nhouseholds containing foreign-born noncitizens relative to the overall number of U.S. \nhouseholds (i.e., 6.97%). DHS estimated the number of households containing foreign-born \nnoncitizens participating in SNAP by multiplying the number of households on SNAP by the \n6.97 percent, which DHS reports to be the Census Bureau’s estimate of the share of the overall \nU.S. population that are foreign-born noncitizens.63 DHS’s method results in a substantial \nunderestimate; calculated from the SNAP QC data, we see that the share of households on SNAP \nwith noncitizen members is actually 11.83 percent. Correcting the flawed DHS assumption \n                                                 \n60   I also estimate SNAP benefits per household containing noncitizen members to be 94 percent of the DHS \nestimate. This difference would imply that in this step I would calculate a smaller total cost than DHS. \n61   These are reproduced from Regulatory Impact Analysis, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Table 14. \n62   See Lauffer, Sarah, Alma Vigil, Chrystine Tadler, and Elaine Wilcox-Cook. 2018. Technical Documentation for \nthe Fiscal Year 2017 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Quality Control Database and the QC \nMinimodel. Mathematica Policy Research Report. \n63   The DHS estimate of the average number of people on SNAP and households on SNAP (2013–2017) differs \nslightly from my calculations; this is likely due to the release of revised data between the time when their \nanalysis was conducted in 2018 and when mine was conducted in 2019. Note that DHS reports in the footnotes \nto Table 14 that they estimate the number of households by dividing the number of people by an average \nhousehold size of 2.64. This appears to be incorrect, and they appear to have obtained the data on household \nparticipation directly from USDA.  \n24 \n \n \nAdd140\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-16   Filed 09/09/19   Page 26 of 38\n \nincreases the number of SNAP households with noncitizens by 70 percent, to 2.6 million \nhouseholds.64 \n47.  Second, DHS estimates the potential SNAP nonparticipation rate due to the public \ncharge rule change to be 2.5 percent. They come to this by estimating that 2.5 percent of foreign-\nborn noncitizens apply for an adjustment of status, and that the impact of the public charge rule \nwill primarily impact this group. This ignores potential spillover impacts onto other groups, and \nassumes that the impacts are limited only to the group applying for an adjustment of status in one \nparticular year. As described above, research suggests the DHS assumption is far too low. \nResearch based on the impacts of welfare reform as well as current estimates on the share of \nimmigrants avoiding participation in public benefits clearly show that the nonparticipation \nimpacts will spill over to a larger group. For example, prior research found declines in \nparticipation among refugees and citizens residing in households with noncitizens, even though \ntheir eligibility for SNAP and other benefits programs was not substantially changed.65 This prior \nresearch estimates a nonparticipation response around 20 percent, which is eight times the DHS \nestimate.  \n48.  Third, DHS underestimates the average SNAP benefit for households with \nnoncitizens. In its calculations, DHS uses overall average SNAP benefits per recipient. This is an \ninaccurate estimate, because it does not account for different characteristics among households \nwith noncitizens that affect benefit amounts, such as larger household sizes and a higher \n                                                 \n64   As shown in Table 5, the DHS estimates of average SNAP benefits per person or household differ from the ones \nI calculate from the SNAP QC data. At the household level, I estimate SNAP benefits to be 22 percent higher \nthan those estimated by DHS. \n65   See East, Chloe N. Forthcoming.

I am familiar with the matters set forth herein based on a \ncareer spanning more than l.-8 y~ in fi~cing, cJeveJoping. and rehabilitating affordable \nhousing in New York State, and revitalizing disinvested communities through housing-based \ninitiatives.  ~or to my role as Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of NYSHCR, I served \nas the Managing Director of the Housing Advisory Board for the Robin Hood Foundation, where \nwe·funded initiatives to increase the quality and quantity of affordable housing for low-income \nNew Yorkers.  Before joining the Robin Hood Foundation, I worked at the New York City \nDepartment of Housing Preservation and Development (NYC HPD), where I also briefly served \nas Commissioner.  At NYC HPD, I continued to promote the agency's mission of developing \nand preserving affordable housing in New York City and enforcing the City's Housing \nMaintenance Code. \nOverview of NYSCHR \n2.  NYSHCR is New York State's affordable housing umbrella agency,' with a \nmission to build, preserve, and protect affordable housing and increase home ownership across \nNew York State. \n3.  As Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, it is my role to advance this \nmission and to carry out initiatives that further these goals.  NYSHCR offers numerous programs \nto develop, preserve, and protect affordable housing within the State of New York.  NYSHCR \nfinances new construction and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily rental properties through \nState and Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, loan programs, U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance, and tax-exempt or taxable bonds. \n1 NYSCHR is comprised of five New York State agencies-the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the \nHousing Trust Fund Corporation, the Housing Finance Agency, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the \nAffordable Housing Corporation. \n2 \nAdd145\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 16\nNYSHCR also invests in communities to increase affordable housing, develop small businesses, \nand repair infrastructure.  In addition, NYSHCR is tasked with enforcing New York State Rent \nRegulation Laws and protecting the rights of tenants who are facing harassment or rental \novercharge by their landlord. \n4.  Overall, NYSHCR provides financing and/or regulatory oversight to \napproximately 400,000 affordable housing units in almost 10,000 buildings throughout the State. \nIn addition, NYSCHR administers Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers for approximately \n44,332 individuals and families and oversees approximately 900,000 rent-regulated housing units \npursuant to New York state law. \n5.  NYSHCR is also a Public Housing Authority (PHA) that administers the HUD \nSection 8 program in 51 counties throughout New York State.  Most counties and/or \nmunicipalities with large populations also administer their own Section 8 and Federal Public \nHousing programs through their local PHA directly with HUD.  NYSHCR does not administer \nFederal Public Housing as none exists in its portfolio.  There are over 130 PHAs in New York \nState in addition to the NYSHCR PHA. \nNew York Housing Market is Highly Competitive \n6.  NYSHCR carries out its mission in-the midst of, and in response to, a housing \nmarket plagued by low vacancies and high rents.  The vacancy rate in New York State for non \nrural areas is 4.3% compared to 6.1% nationally.2  Nearly 80% ofNew Yorkers living in non \nrural areas confront a rental housing market that has less than a 5% vacancy rate.  Extremely low \nvacancy rates can be found throughout New York: Albany (4.8%), Buffalo (4.9%), New \nRochelle (3.8%), Troy (4.3%) White Plains (2.3%) and New York City (3.4%). \n2 Census data. \n3 \nAdd146\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 16\n7.  In addition, the median rent in New York State, $1,075, is hundreds of dollars \nhigher than the national median rent ($827). 3 The disparity is wider for many other \nmunicipalities including New Rochelle ($1,324), White Plains ($1,599), Hempstead ($1,237), \nNew York City ($1,213) and Manhattan in particular ($1,512). \nThe Receipt of Federal Public Housing Assistance by Non-Citizens \n8.  Pursuant to Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of \n1980, federal housing assistance is only available to limited groups of non-citizens. \n9.  Additionally, Section 214 allows for the receipt of prorated housing benefits by \nso-called \"mixed-status families\" in which some members are U.S. citizens or eligible \nnoncitizens and others are ineligible noncitizens.  In these households, federal housing benefits \nare only paid on behalf of the eligible family members.  The ineligible members must pay their \nportion of the rent.  Additionally, ineligible members' income is calculated in the total household \nincome thereby reducing the housing subsidy the household receives as a whole.  The \ncombination of proration and higher work income in mixed-status families means that generally, \nmixed-status families receive less federal subsidy than fully eligible families. \n10.  In New York State, approximately 3,000 of these \"mixed-status\" families receive \npublic housing assistance.4  According to HUD, of the 25,000 mixed-status families nationwide \nin federally-assisted housing, 71 percent are eligible members.  Of those, 73 percent are children. \nOf the 29 percent of the ineligible household members, 93 percent are adult, S percent are \nchildren and 2 percent are elderly. \n3 For purposes of this declaration, \"median rent\" includes both private and public housing rents and does not \ndifferentiate between types of apartments (e.g. studios, I-bedroom, etc.). \n4 On May 10, 2019, HUD posted a proposed rule that would severely curtail access to these prorated benefits among \nmixed-status families. (Docket No. FR-6124-P-0 11 ). Through its Regulatory Impact Analysis for that proposed rule, \nHUD estimated that there are approximately 3,000 of these mixed-status families are in New York. \n4 \nAdd147\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 16\nPrimm Programs Implicated by the Public Charge Rule \n11.  The Public Charge Rule extends the public charge analysis to a broad anay of \nfederal programs administered by NYSHCR and other New York PHAs.  These include Section \n8 Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Vouchers, Veteran Affairs Supportive Housing \n(HUD VA  SH) vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance and Federal Public Housing. \n12.  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program (also called the tenant-\nbased voucher program) is the federal government's major program for assisting very low \nincome families, the elderly, veterans (through the HUD-VASH program), persons with \ndisabilities and those in homeless shelters or at risk of becoming homeless, including survivors \nof domestic violence, to afford decent, safe and sanitary housing in the private market.  The \nsubsidy is paid on behalf of households directly to a private landlord.  The family is then \nrequired to pay the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount \nsubsidized by the program, which is no more than 30 percent of the family's gross income (and \n40 percent in limited instances).  HCV vouchers are portable and can be used by the participating \nfamily in a unit of their choice including apartments, single-family homes and townhouses that \npass an inspection proving that it meets the standards of health and safety set by HUD. \n13.  HUD-V ASH vouchers are a collaborative effort between HUD and the United \nStates Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to move veterans and their families out of \nhomelessness and into permanent housing.  VA  SH combines HCV rental.assistance for homeless \nveterans with clinical and supportive services provided by the VA's health care system. \nNYSHCR administers 1,055 HUD-V ASH vouchers. \n14.  Project-Based Vouchers (P~Vs) are a subset of the HCV program, and are \nhousing subsidies that are attached to specific dwelling units through contracts between the PHA \ns \nAdd148\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 16\nand rental property owners that have an initial term of20 years.  Unlike HCVs, the subsidy does \n·not travel with individual tenants as they move.  NYSHCR utilius PBVs as a component in \nfinancing larger affordable housing developments. \n15.  NYSHCR is currently administering 44,332 vouchers (including HCVs, PBVs \nand HUD-V ASH vouchers) on behalf of participating families throughout New York State.  Of \nthese families, 73% are female-headed, 39% have children under 18, 23% have a person with a \ndisability, 31 % are elderly and 43% are race or ethnic minorities of which 27% are African \nAmerican and 14% are identified as Hispanic.  Only 3% of households count welfare (TA  NF, \nGeneral Assistance, or Public Assistance) as the household's major source of income.  The \naverage family expenditure for rent is $4S 1 a month and the average federal spending per unit is \n$864 a month. \n16.  Another program that NYSHCR administers is Project-Based Rental Assistance. \nThis assistance is provided to private owners of multifamily housing to lower rental costs.  In \n2018, NYSHCR administered this assistance to over 92,000 apartments in 986 buildings for \napproximately 150,000 people statewide.  Of this population. 58% are elderly, 23% are families \nwith children, and 12% have a family member who is disabled.  In addition. 25% identified as \nAfrican-American/Black, 34% as Hispanic and 6% as Asian. The average family expenditure for \nrent is $399 per month. \n17.  Although not administered by NYSHCR. Federal Public Housing is operated by \nPHAs with HUD funding pursuant to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.A. § \n1437).  Unlike HCVs and Project-Based Rental Assistance, where the subsidy is unit by unit, all \nunits in Federal Public Housing are subsidized.  Public housing residents must have incomes \nbelow 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI). \n6 \nAdd149\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 16\n18.  Under all of these pro~ an individual's benefit is tied to his or her income. \nTherefore, families can have work income and still be eligible for these housing benefits. \nNYSCHR's Federal Housing Assistance Program3 are Vital to Promoting 8ousing Stability and \nReducing Homelgsness \n19.  The very purpose of federal housing programs such as the Section 8 Housing \nChoice Voucher Program is to house those that are vulnerable to homelessness and unsafe living \nconditions.  The United States Housing Act of 1937, which first established the federal public \nhousing program, declared that it was the policy of the United States ''to remedy the unsafe and \nunsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for \nfamilies of low-income, in rural or urban communities, that are injurious to the health, safety, \nand morals of the citizens of the nation.\" 5 \n20.  NYSHCR and other PHAs in New York use federal housing assistance to \npromote housing stability and reduce homelessness.  They are used to house veterans with \nsupportive services, the elderly and disabled who live with fixed incomes, economically \ndisadvantaged parents with children who struggle to work and pay rent in a tight and expensive \nhousing market, and the homeless, including survivors of domestic violence, who use vouchers \nas a pathway out of homelessness and abusive situations.  In addition, project-based vouchers are \nused to build and rehabilitate thriving communities with deeper affordability and accessibility \nfeatures for those with disabilities. \nThe Public Charge Rule Dramatically Undermines NYCHR's Work by Creating a Chilling \nEffect on Uptake of Subsidized Housing \n21.  Because of the Final Rule, for the first time, a public charge determination will \ntake into account housing benefits received on behalf of individuals residing in New York.  This \nP.L. 75-412. \n$ \n7 \nAdd150\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 16\nchange creates a confounding scenario where families who are legally entitled to housing \nbenefits will either have to make the choice to forgo housing benefits or have their receipt of \nthese benefits be weighed against them in a public charge determination. \n22.  For example, a family with a member who is a parolee can receive a Section 8 \nvoucher that is not prorated because parolees are eligible for federal housing assistance. \nHowever, if that member seeks to adjust their status to a Legal Permanent Resident through a \nfamily-based visa petition because he or she  is marrying a U.S. citizen, that person will be \nsubject to a public charge determination based on his or her lawful receipt of federal housing \nbenefits.  To avoid this, this person may seek to disenroll himself or his entire family, which may \ninclude U.S. citizen children.  The effect of disenrolling himself or bis family would result in a \nsteep increase in rent they must pay if they are participants in a Section 8 voucher program.  If he \ndisenrolls the family while in public housing, it means they would have to move out or be \nevicted from the unit. \n23.  The 3,000 mixed-status families that currently make use of pro-rated federal \nhousing benefits may be concerned that continued receipt of public housing benefits on behalf of \nany members of the household will negatively reflect on a public charge determination. \nAccordingly, the Final Rule may result in mixed-status households, including U.S. citizen \nchildren and other citizen household members, disenrolling from federal housing benefits, \nincreasing the risk of housing instability.  OHS acknowledges as much in the preamble to the \nFinal Rule, noting that \"U.S. citizens who are members of mixed-status households\" are among \nthose who will opt to forgo benefits.  84 Fed. Reg. 41300. \n24.  In addition, the chilling effect from the Final Rule could extend well beyond New \nYork's approximately 3,000 mixed-status families to non-citizens who are lawfully entitled to \n8 \nAdd151\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 16\nreceive public housing benefits and are not subject to the public charge test, but, because of fear \nand confusion, may dis-enroll even from housing programs that are not covered by the Final \nRule such as those financed with Low Income Housing Tax Credits. \nDeterring Families from Accessing Housing Benefits Leads to Housing Instability and \nHomelessness \n25.  If the Final Rule goes into effect, New York families whose members cease \nparticipation in subsidized housing programs will have to move out of their homes or experience \nsubstantial rent increases with loss of subsidy. \n26.  In a search for other affordable housing options, they will face a highly \ncompetitive market with very low rates of affordability and/or vacancy.  The burdens of a move \nare well-known and include the search process and potentially thousands of dollars of necessary \nexpenses such as deposits, brokers fees, up-front rent payments, storage and moving fees, as well \nas potential loss of hourly wages as they engage in the housing search process. Recipients of \nhousing assistance often do not have these economic resources to move.  The difficulty \nconfronted by these families will be compounded by the fact that similarly situated families will \nbe searching simultaneously.  Families facing this process may be forced into temporary and \nunstable living situations, including moving in with other families, shelters and other transient \narrangements, while they search for stable and affordable housing.  The combined effect of these \nfactors is that families, many with U.S. citizen and otherwise eligible children, may be left \nhomeless, overcrowded or in otherwise substandard housing conditions that do not meet housing \nquality and safety standards that are a hallmark of Section 8 programs. \n9 \nAdd152\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 11 of 16\nIrreparable Hann to Health and Well-Being of New Yorkers \nLimiting Availability ofA ffordable Housing/or Families ls Detrimental \n27.  New York State and its residents will be banned if powerful affordable housing \ntools are removed from the State's arsenal to confront difficult housing market forces. \nHomelessness, experienced by tens of thousands of New Yorkers on any given day, is often the \nacute part of a larger episode of housing stability that for many families can last months or years. \nA major contributing factor to a family's housing instability is a lack of affordable housing, \nwhich is felt by many throughout the State.  Section 8 and other federal housing assistance \nprovide the exact tools to help combat this instability, reduce resulting homelessness and \nminimize the personal and societal costs of such instability. \n28.  Research has shown the importance of access to affordable housing across \nnumerous aspects of families' lives.  Studies have found that increasing access to affordable \nhousing for families leads to increased stability, including fewer moves and a lower likelihood of \nhomelessness.6  This stability manifests in numerous positive outcomes. · \n29.  For example, families living in affordable housing who are not cost-burdened by \nhigh-cost rent are better able to invest in themselves and their futures.  One study found that in \n2011, families living in affordable housing were able to spend five times as much money on \nhealthcare compared to families cost-burdened by rent, as well as more on nutrition and \nretirement savings. 7  Such stability also allows families to avoid the negative outcomes \nassociated with overcrowding, substandard housing and frequent moves, such as lifelong \n6 Enterprise Community Partners, \"Impact of Affordable Housing on Families and Communities: A Review of the \nEvidence Base\" (2014), available at https:/'www.enterprisecommunit,.org/rcsources/impact-atfordable-hom,ing \nfamilies-and-communitie>:-re, ieY.-evidence-base-13210. \n7 Enterprise Community Partners, \"Impact of Affordable Housing on Families and Communities: A Review of the \nEvidence Base\" (2014), available at https:i www.enterprisesommunity.org resourcc!,!impact-affordable-housing \nfamilies-and-communities-rcview-evideoce-base-13210. \n10 \nAdd153\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 12 of 16\nphysical and mental health banns, lack of access to nu1ritious and sufficient food.  Specifically, \none study found that individuals who are residentially stable and not cost-burdened are far less \nlikely to complain of mental distress and difficulty sleeping, which can lead to negative mental \nand physical health outcomes.•  Further, access to affordable housing has been identified as \ncritical in avoiding the negative educational outcomes for children associated with housing \ninstability and homelessness, such as poor academic performance, low school attendance, grade \nretention and dropping out. \nHousing Instability and Homelessness Have Lifelong Negative Impacts on Children \n30.  As the Commissioner ofNYSHC~ I am aware ofa multitude of banns attending \nhousing instability and homelessness.  Housing instability and homelessness have drastic \nnegative consequences for individuals, especially children, across a wide array of areas.  There is \nclear evidence linking childhood homelessness with lifelong health problems.  Homelessness and \nother forms of housing instability are associated with increased hospital visits and mental health \nproblems, such as depression and anxiety. 9  Child poverty and housing instability also cause \nsevere stress.  This type of stress in children \"disrupts normal brain and organ development and, \nconsequently, damages brain architecture and neurocognitive systems.\"10  These health \nconsequences may be felt by these children for the rest of their lives. \n• Enterprise Community Partners, \"Impact of Affordable Housing on Families and Communities: A Review of the \nEvidence Base\" (2014), available at https:  ww\\\\.enterprisecommunit\\.orglresources impact-affordable-housing \nfamilies-and-communities-review-evidencc-base-13210. \n9 Meredith Horowki, Housing Instability and Health: Findings from the Michigan Recession and Recovery Study, \nNational Poverty Center Policy Brief#29 (March 2012), \nhnp:  \"'ww .npc.umich.edu publications policv  briefsfbriet29/NPC%20Policv%20Brie~o20-%2029 p<if. \n10 Heather Sandstrom et al., The Negative Effects of Instability on Child Development: A Research Synthesis, Urban \nInstitute, 13 (September 2013), https;//ww\\\\ .urban.org sites/defaulVfilcs/publicat1on 3:?706,412899-The-Negative \nEftects-of-lnstabilit1,-on-C'hild-Developmcnt-A-Research-Svnthesis.PDF. \n11 \nAdd154\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 13 of 16\n31.  A lack of access to safe and affordable housing can also limit a child's \neducational opportunities and exacerbate child poverty.  Statistically, homeless children have \nlower passing rates across a number of academic subjects, have higher rates of absenteeism, and \nare more likely to face disciplinary action than children who live in stable housing. 11 \nAdditionally, children who lack safe and secure housing will suffer long-term negative economic \nconsequences. 12  Housing instability can also lead directly to employment insecurity among \nadults.13 \nThe Final Rule Increases Costs for State and Local Governments \n32.  The Final Rule will place significant new costs and administrative burdens on \nNew York State and local governments within the State as families with nonciti7.en members \nrefrain from participating in affordable and sustainable housing options.  Limiting families' \naccess to affordable, long-term housing only exacerbates chronic and destabilizing housing \nconditions, resulting in greater costs to the State and a detrimental social impact. \n33.  The State and local governments will bear the financial brunt of increased \nhomelessness and housing instability caused by the Final Rule, both in the short- and long-term. \nThe lack of participation in affordable housing programs will increase emergency shelter use, \nwhich will place a substantial financial strain on states and municipalities. \n34.  Short-term costs include an increase in emergency shelter use as families tum \naway from available affordable housing programs to which they are legally entitled. This will \n11 Anne Ray et al.

Long-tenn economic costs of homelessness and housing instability, including an \nincrease in health, public assistance and educational costs, will further the regressive impact of \nthe Final Rule on New York State and local governments.  Research indicates that unstable \nhousing among families with children will cost the U.S. health care system an estimated $111 \nbillion in expenditures through 2027.14  Increased housing instability caused by the Final Rule \ncould substantially increase these numbers. \n36.  In addition, State and local governments will have to make up for the shortfall in \nfunding as per-family housing subsidies increase due the replacement of higher-income pro-rated \nmixed-status families by fully eligible families with generally less income.  With fewer families \nserved with the same amount of federal funding, the State and 1~ governments will face the \nresulting increased need for affordable options and/or homeless services. \n37.  Finally, NYSHCR will be required to undertake a significant public information \ncampaign in response to the Final Rule.  In order to serve the residents of New York State, \nNYSHCR must take on the increased expenses and administrative burdens of educating affected \ncommunities of their rights and risks under this new legal framework, including costs associated \nwith increased calls, staff training, ·and preparing guidance materials.  This process is particularly \ncostly in light of the confusion generated by the proximity between this Final Rule and HUD's \nrecent Proposed Rule governing the receipt of prorated benefits by mixed-status families. In \naddition to direct outreach regarding the impact of the Rule, NYSHCR plans to work with \n14 Ana Poblacion et al., Stable Homes Make Healthy Families, Children's Health Watch (July 2017), \nhnps: 'lbit.ly/2hDjRE2. \n13 \nAdd156\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 15 of 16\npartners and community organizations to disseminate information because NYSHCR fears that \nmany in vulnerable populations affected by the Rule will be reluctant to seek guidance from \ngovernment agencies for assistance.  This will create additional administrative and financial \nburdens. \nThe Final Rule Imposes Significant Administrative Hanns On NYSCHR \n38.  There are significant programmatic and structural difficulties that would prevent \nindividuals who terminate their housing benefits in reliance on this Final Rule from reenrolling \nin their benefits at a later date. \n39.  All federal housing programs in New York State have waiting lists.  Therefore, \nvacancies in these programs are filled almost immediately.  Any individual who terminates their \nhousing benefits would not simply be able to recover their Housing Choice Voucher or return to \ntheir old apartment or neighborhood if, at some future date, this Rule was either enjoined or \nrevoked.  The voucher allotment would have been given to someone else and/or the relevant \nhousing unit filled with a new family from the waitlist.  It would be impossible to remove the \nsuccessor family from reoccupied apartments as they now have a legal right to reside there. \n40.  In some contexts, the effects of disenrollment and re-enrollment will be \nparticularly costly.  For example, NYSHCR currently has no policies or procedures in place to \nassist individuals in reentering federal housing programs after termination because re-enrollment \nis rare.  If the Final Rule were to go into effect, NYSHCR would need to devise policies and \nprocedures to address how to assist families that may relinquish their housing because of fear, \nbut then may subsequently seek housing because of a change in circumstances.  If the Final Rule \nwere to go into effect and not be immediately enjoined, NYSHCR would need to devise policies \nand procedures to address terminated families that reenroll at a later time when the Rule is finally \n14 \nAdd157\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-17   Filed 09/09/19   Page 16 of 16\nenjoined or invalidated by the court.

I make this \ndeclaration in my capacity as Commissioner after consultation with New York State Department \nof Health (“Department”) staff implementing the initiatives detailed below.  I respectfully submit \nthis Declaration in order to place before the Court certain testimony and documents relevant to \nthe relief requested.  I am familiar with the matters set forth herein, either from professional \nknowledge, conversations with Department staff, or on the basis of documents that have been \nprovided to and reviewed by me. \n2.  I have extensive medical knowledge, particularly in the fields of pediatric \nmedicine and care.  I am board-certified in six specialties/subspecialties and trained in pediatrics \nat Johns Hopkins Hospital, anesthesiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, \npediatric critical care medicine/pediatric anesthesiology at The Children’s Hospital of \nAdd159\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 3 of 26\nPhiladelphia, and pediatric cardiology at Children’s Hospital Boston/Harvard Medical School.  I \nwas a professor of clinical anesthesiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva \nUniversity and pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.  I \nalso served as associate professor of clinical pediatrics and anesthesiology at Columbia \nUniversity College of Physicians & Surgeons and pediatric director of the ICU at New York \nPresbyterian Hospital.  I am a former Columbia University Pediatrics Teacher of the Year. \n3.  As Commissioner of Health, I must “take cognizance of the interests of health and \nlife of the people of the state, and of all matters pertaining thereto and exercise the functions, \npowers and duties of the department prescribed by law.”  Public Health Law (“PHL”) \n§206(1)(a).   \n4.  The Department’s mission is to protect, improve, and promote the health, \nproductivity and well-being of all New Yorkers, which includes refugees and other non-citizens. \nConsistent with this mission, the Department administers a wide range of public health \nprograms.  These programs address emergency preparedness and response, disease prevention \nand control, environmental health protection, and promotion of healthy lifestyles.  In addition to \nadministering these programs, the Department also manages the Medicaid program for the State; \nadministers NY State of Health, New York State’s Insurance Marketplace (“NY State of Health \nMarketplace”); conducts healthcare surveillance in hospitals, home care agencies, and nursing \nhomes throughout the state; conducts research and maintains diagnostic and reference \nlaboratories at the Wadsworth Center, New York State’s premier public health lab; and owns and \noperates four veterans’ homes and Helen Hayes Hospital. \n5.  As Commissioner of Health, I am deeply troubled by the destructive and far-\nreaching health, economic, and programmatic consequences of the Inadmissibility on Public \nAdd160\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 4 of 26\nCharge Grounds Final Rule, to be codified at 8 CFR Parts 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, and 248 (the \n“Final Rule” or the “Rule”).  The Fiscal Policy Institute estimates that 24 million individuals, 2.1 \nmillion of whom reside in New York, will be harmed by the Final Rule.1  This means that over 2 \nmillion New Yorkers could face hunger, forego care for treatable medical conditions, and \ndevelop serious chronic health conditions if the Rule is implemented.   \n6.  The Department administers several programs that will be directly or indirectly \nimplicated by the Final Rule, including Medicaid2, the Essential Plan3 (New York State’s Basic \nHealth Program), Child Health Plus4 (New York State’s version of the Children’s Health \nInsurance Program), Qualified Health Plans5 (QHP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).    \n1 Fiscal Policy Institute, “Only Wealthy Immigrants Need Apply: How a Trump Rule’s Chilling Effect Will Harm \nNew York,” (Oct. 2018), http://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/US-Impact-of-Public-Charge.pdf.  \n2 The term “Medicaid,” as used throughout, means the New York State- and federally-funded healthcare program for \nlow-income New Yorkers whose income and/or resources are below certain levels. It also includes state-funded \nMedicaid for individuals who are ineligible for federally funded Medicaid due to their immigration status. Eligible \npopulations include children, pregnant women, single individuals, families, and individuals certified blind or \ndisabled.  In addition, certain persons with medical bills may be eligible for Medicaid if paying such bills allows \nthem to spend down their income and resources to meet required Medicaid income levels.  Medicaid enrollees do \nnot pay premiums and have little to no out-of-pocket costs for many services.  The term “Medicaid” does not \ninclude the Essential Plan, Child Health Plus, or Qualified Health Plans.  \n3 The Affordable Care Act provides states with the option of creating a Basic Health Program (BHP).  42 USC § \n18051.  New York established a BHP, called the Essential Plan.  NY Social Services Law § 369-gg. The Essential \nPlan covers New Yorkers who are not eligible for Medicaid and have incomes up to 200 percent of the federal \npoverty level.  The Essential Plan lowers monthly premiums to $20 or $0, depending on income, and provides \ncomprehensive benefits with no annual deductibles, free preventive care, and low copayments. \n4 Eligibility for Child Health Plus begins where Medicaid eligibility ends (223 percent of the federal poverty level \nfor children under 1 year and 154 percent of the federal poverty level for children over 1 year).  There is no Child \nHealth Plus premium for children in households with incomes below 160 percent of the federal poverty level, and a \nsliding scale premium for those in households with incomes between 160 and 400 percent of the federal poverty \nlevel.  Households with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level have the option to purchase Child \nHealth Plus or Qualified Health Plan coverage at full premium.  95 percent of children enrolled in Child Health Plus \nare enrolled with no premium or sliding scale premiums, and 5 percent are enrolled with full premiums. \n5 Qualified Health Plans are health plans that have been certified by and are available through the Marketplace in \naccordance with the Affordable Care Act and federal regulations.  42 § USC 18021(a).  Enrollment in a Qualified \nHealth Plan with financial assistance is available for individuals who have a household income at or below 400 \npercent of the federal poverty level, and do not have access to other affordable health insurance that meets minimum \nessential coverage. \nAdd161\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 5 of 26\n7.  Individuals whose immigration status is subject to the Final Rule could be \ndisincentivized from applying for or continuing to receive benefits implicated by the Final Rule, \nsuch as Medicaid, and not seek medical care as a result.  Many others will be indirectly impacted \nby the Final Rule, notwithstanding that they are not covered by it, and/or that the public benefit \nfor which they are eligible is not a program implicated by the Final Rule, such as WIC, the \nEssential Plan, Child Health Plus, fully State-funded Medicaid, and Medicaid for children under \n21, pregnant women, and women during the 60 days following childbirth.  Policy experts agree \nthat individuals will be frightened and confused about the potential consequences of applying for \nbenefits and therefore will forego public assistance altogether.6  This consequence is the “chilling \neffect” of the Final Rule.  \n8.  New York State’s economy will undoubtedly suffer because of the direct and \nindirect consequences of the Final Rule.  Specifically, the Final Rule will cause a reduction in \nhealth insurance coverage, an increase in uncompensated healthcare costs faced by all healthcare \nproviders, and a decrease in the stability and productivity of New York’s workforce.       \n9.  The Final Rule will also have irreparable consequences on the health and well-\nbeing of New Yorkers.  Programs like Medicaid, the Essential Plan, Child Health Plus, QHPs, \nand WIC help ensure that families, including families with U.S. citizen children living with an \nimmigrant caretaker, have access to basic human needs such as food and medical care.  By \ndisincentivizing access to these vital benefits, the Final Rule will leave millions of individuals in \nNew York State, including U.S. citizen children, without access to preventive healthcare or \nnutritious foods – benefits that have been shown to improve both short- and long-term health and \nadvance public health interests such as curbing the spread of communicable diseases and \n6 Id.  \nAdd162\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 6 of 26\nreducing chronic health conditions.   Because 94 percent of children under age six living in the \nU.S. with at least one non-citizen parent are U.S. citizens,7 there is a strong government interest \nin ensuring that these children have access to public benefits for which they are eligible to better \ntheir health and improve their economic security. \n10.  The Final Rule will also impose significant administrative burdens on New York \nState.  The Final Rule will require NYSDOH to advise immigrant applicants to the NY State of \nHealth Marketplace of the potential risk of applying for health insurance.  Additionally, \ndecreased participation in Medicaid among WIC families (primarily because of the indirect \neffects of the Final Rule) would have a significant and costly impact on WIC’s certification \nprocess.  The additional time spent on income certification in clinics will increase administrative \ncosts, strain WIC resources, and divert staff time from important public health initiatives – like \noffering breastfeeding support – to conducting managerial tasks.  \n11.  For these reasons, as described in detail below, the Department strongly opposes \nthe Final Rule.   \nIrreparable Harm to New York State’s Economy Caused by Disincentivizing Medicaid \nParticipation and Enrollment \n12.  Medicaid is an important source of primary health insurance coverage and \nsupplementary coverage for low-income residents and the most vulnerable New Yorkers.  \nDuring the 2019 fiscal year, Medicaid provided comprehensive health insurance coverage to \n6,243,498 New Yorkers, including children, pregnant women, single individuals, families, and \nindividuals certiﬁed blind or disabled.  Medicaid enrollees do not pay premiums and have little to \nno out-of-pocket costs for many services.   \n7 Migration Policy Inst., \"Children in U.S. Immigrant Families,\" https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-\nhub/charts/children-immigrant-families (accessed June 28, 2019) (based on 1990 Decennial Census and 2016 \nAmerican Community Survey data). \nAdd163\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 7 of 26\n13.  By making health insurance more affordable, programs like Medicaid have helped \nreduce the number of uninsured New Yorkers.  The NY State of Health Marketplace uses a \nsingle application that helps people check their eligibility for Medicaid, Child Health Plus, the \nEssential Plan, and QHPs and enroll in these programs if they are eligible.  Financial \nassistance is available to applicants to help them afford health insurance purchased through the \nMarketplace.  Family members who may be eligible for different programs are able to apply \ntogether in a streamlined manner.  In 2013, at the inception of NY State of Health Marketplace, \nthe uninsured rate in New York was 10 percent.  This rate has been reduced to 4.7 percent due to \nthe gains in coverage made through NY State of Health Marketplace, including Medicaid.  As a \nresult, New York hospitals have reported a dramatic decrease in self-pay hospital utilization \nbecause patients have gained insurance.  According to NYSDOH administrative data, New York \nState Institutional Costs Reports show a 23 percent reduction in self-pay hospital emergency \nroom visits, a 40 percent reduction in self-pay inpatient services, and a 17 percent reduction in \nself-pay outpatient visits from 2013 to 2015.   \n14.  The Department estimates that the Final Rule could disincentivize up to 2 million \nNew Yorkers from applying for or continuing to receive health insurance, given the number of \nnon-citizens and their children currently enrolled in Medicaid, the Essential Plan, Child Health \nPlus, and QHPs. \n15.  The Department anticipates that these individuals will be affected by the Final \nRule due to confusion about the potential consequences of applying for food, health, and housing \nsupports for which they qualify.8  Others may not understand whether they receive the type of \nbenefit directly implicated in the Final Rule.  For example, New Yorkers receiving Medicaid \n8 Fiscal Policy Institute, supra, note 1. \nAdd164\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 8 of 26\nmay not know whether they are receiving state-only funded Medicaid or federally-funded \nMedicaid.  Indeed, even before the Final Rule has gone into effect, consumers have been calling \nNY State of Health Marketplace’s customer service center, participating health plans, and \ncertified Assistor agencies who help consumers apply for coverage, inquiring about canceling \ntheir Medicaid or other health insurance coverage because of the Final Rule.   \n16.  By disincentivizing enrollment or continued participation in health insurance \nprograms like Medicaid, the Final Rule will increase uncompensated care and reverse important \nprogress in making healthcare more accessible.  Individuals without coverage will still need and \nreceive care.  With no insurance to pay for the care received, those costs will be borne by the \nhealthcare delivery system.9 \n17.  Moreover, because individuals without health insurance tend to wait longer to \nseek care during a health crisis, the care they eventually receive, often from emergency \ndepartments, is more costly and not compensated to the healthcare provider.  \n18.  By disincentivizing enrollment or continued participation in health insurance \ncoverage for individuals who are eligible for such coverage under federal law, the Final Rule will \ndrive up the State’s uninsured rate, resulting in increased uncompensated care costs to the \nhealthcare delivery system.  Federal and State Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding is \na pre-determined amount of money intended to reimburse healthcare providers for the services \nthey provide to patients who are unable to pay for the cost of their care.10  However, these funds \nare already insufficient and federal funding is scheduled to be reduced further.11  As such, \nalready strained DSH funds will not cover the additional financial burden caused by the Final \n9 Coughlin, Teresa A. \"Uncompensated care for the uninsured in 2013: A detailed examination.\" (2014). \nhttps://www.kff.org/uninsured/report/uncompensated-care-for-the-uninsured-in-2013-a-detailed-examination/ \n10 See N.Y. Public Health Law §§ 2807-c, 2807-k(5-a)(d); 42 USCS § 1396r-4(f)((7). \n11 42 USCS § 1396r-4(f)((7)(A). \nAdd165\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 9 of 26\nRule.  Pending cuts by the Federal government to Medicaid DSH funds, in concert with the Rule, \nwill exacerbate hospitals’ financial status. \n19.  Increasing the number of uninsured patients will also weaken hospitals’ financial \nfooting.  Medicaid expansion was associated with fewer hospital closures and stronger hospital \nfinancial performances.12  The contraction of coverage that is likely to result from \nimplementation of this Rule could result in public hospital closures, all of which are heavily \nreliant on state funding and predominantly serve lower-income populations. \n20.  Medicaid also provides affordable health insurance to children and their families.  \nMore than one third, or 34 percent, of Medicaid enrollees statewide are children. \n21.  By indirectly discouraging parents from enrolling eligible children in Medicaid \nand other forms of health insurance coverage, the Final Rule will negatively impact long-term \noutcomes for these children, including their education and employment, both of which contribute \nto self-sufficiency and decrease the likelihood of needing public assistance in the future.    \n22.  For example, reduced vaccination rates among children can have extensive \nconsequences on a child’s education.  PHL § 2164 requires those with a parental relationship to a \nchild to vaccinate their children against serious diseases, including measles, chicken pox, \nwhooping cough, and others.  Unvaccinated children cannot be admitted to or attend any public, \nprivate, or parochial school (which includes a child caring center, day nursery, day care agency, \nnursery school, kindergarten, elementary, intermediate, or secondary school) in excess of 14 days \nunless certain limited exceptions are met.  See PHL § 2164[7][a], [8]; Education Law § 914[1]; \n10 NYCRR § 66-1.3.   \n12 Lindrooth, Richard C., et al. \"Understanding the relationship between Medicaid expansions \nand hospital closures.\" Health Affairs 37.1 (2018): 111-120. \nhttps://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0976 \nAdd166\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 10 of 26\n23.  Parents who do not vaccinate their children, and whose children do not have a \nvalid medical exemption, still must ensure that their children of compulsory school age are \neducated and, thus, would need to provide home instruction for those children. See Education \nLaw § 3205.  In order to provide such homeschooling, immigrant parents may be forced to \nreduce their work hours or leave the workforce entirely in order to homeschool their children. \n24.  Uninsured children are more likely to miss immunizations.13  Therefore, by \ndiscouraging non-citizens from participating or enrolling in affordable health insurance options, \nlike Medicaid, the Final Rule jeopardizes the ability of children of non-citizen parents to attend \npublic, private, or parochial school in New York State, and may reduce the self-sufficiency of \nimmigrant families by forcing some parents to leave the workforce in order to homeschool their \nchildren.  \n25.  The Final Rule will also have additional negative impacts on New York’s \nworkforce.  Having a reliable source of health insurance, such as Medicaid, improves \nindividuals’ overall health and well-being.  Working individuals who receive Medicaid report \nperforming better in their jobs and feeling more prepared to seek a new or better job.14  Likewise, \njobseekers report feeling better prepared to enter the workforce when they have affordable health \ninsurance coverage. \n26.  Additionally, without stable, affordable health insurance, and the preventive care \nit provides, individuals that forego health insurance because of the Final Rule are likely to spend \nmore time suffering from preventable illnesses and thus missing work.

Access to affordable health coverage like Medicaid helps improve self-sufficiency\nand therefore advances financial well-being.  Most individuals who receive Medicaid are not \noffered employment-based health insurance, and it is cost prohibitive for the few who are.  By \nproviding an affordable alternative, Medicaid improves health and increases self-sufficiency by \nallowing individuals to work regularly.  Numerous studies document the positive effects that the \nAffordable Care Act (ACA), and particularly Medicaid expansion, has played in improving \nfinancial well-being of previously uninsured individuals.  Financial security and self-sufficiency \nare improved when a person can pay their medical bills, and Medicaid coverage puts full \npayment within reach for many.15  Other studies have shown that insurance coverage results in \nhigher credit scores, lower medical debt, and reduces the probability of new bankruptcy filings.16 \n28. The Rule will harm financial well-being by removing an affordable health\ninsurance option for many immigrants in New York State.  Individuals without health insurance \nhave a harder time paying their medical bills and overall have worse financial health than those \nwith coverage.  When saddled with medical debt and low credit scores, these immigrants will be \nless likely to contribute to New York State’s economic growth. \n15 Hu, Luojia and Kaestner, Robert and Mazumder, Bhashkar and Miller, Sarah and Wong, Ashley, The \nEffect of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansions on Financial Wellbeing \n(2016-09-21).

By creating confusion  about the consequences of receiving non-private,\nsubsidized health insurance, the Final Rule makes it more difficult for immigrants to \nremain in the country if they access affordable health insurance.  As such, the Rule will \nnegatively impact the labor force of the healthcare industry, potentially causing the healthcare \nindustry to face a labor shortage, particularly in New York State, where the share of foreign-born \nhealth industry workers is more than double the national level.17  \nIrreparable Harm to New York State’s Economy Caused by the Chilling Effect on WIC \nParticipation \n30. Each month, the WIC program serves approximately 380,000 prenatal and\npostpartum women, infants and children up to age five in New York.  WIC promotes healthy \npregnancies and births by reducing preterm births, low birthweight, and other complications.  \nWIC also works to prevent infant mortality and ensure adequate nutrition in the critical first year \nthrough breastfeeding support and preventing iron deficiency. \n31. By promoting positive birth outcomes and healthy babies, WIC reduces the first-\nyear medical cost burden on both individual families and the broader healthcare system, leading \nto significant healthcare cost savings overall.  The average preterm birth costs $49,033 in first-\nyear medical expenses compared to a mere $4,551 for an uncomplicated birth.18  Meanwhile, an \nincrease of just one pound at birth for a very low birthweight baby can save approximately \n$28,000 in first year medical costs.19  WIC’s prenatal intervention has reduced the incidence of \nlow birthweight by approximately one-third and reduced preterm births by 29 to 48 percent.20 \n17 Id. \n18 Institute of Medicine, Preterm Birth: Causes, Consequences, and Prevention (2006). \n19 March of Dimes, \"The Cost of Prematurity and Complicated Deliveries to U.S. Employers\" (2008). \n20 Kathryn Fingar, et al., \"Reassessing the Association between WIC and Birth Outcomes Using a Fetuses-at-\nRisk Approach,\" 21 J Maternal and Child Health 825 (2017). \nAdd169\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 13 of 26\n32.  Additionally, for every dollar spent on WIC, there are associated savings in \nMedicaid costs during the first 60 days after birth, from $1.77 to $3.13 for newborns and mothers \nand from $2.84 to $3.90 for newborns only.21  The associations are larger when costs from days \n61 through one year are included.22 \n33.  The Department expects WIC participation to decline due to the chilling effects \ncaused by this Rule.  Individuals who are not directly impacted by the Rule will forego public \nassistance, like WIC, due to the fear and confusion generated by this Rule.23  The widespread \nchilling effect of the Rule on WIC participation can already be seen.  Since the Rule was \nproposed, WIC agencies in at least 18 states have seen drops in WIC enrollment of up to 20 \npercent.  In New York State, Public Health Solutions, the largest WIC provider in the state, saw \nWIC caseloads fall after press coverage of the proposed public charge changes.24 \n34.  Lower WIC enrollment will financially strain New York State’s economy due to \nhigher healthcare costs associated with low birthweights and childbirth complications.  From its \ninception, WIC has been recognized by Congress as a “program that, in the long run, will save \nthis country money by heading off disease and the handicapping of children in the early \nformative months and years in such a way as to avoid much more costly results to our society \nlater on.”25  Reduced WIC participation will frustrate these goals, and the costs will be borne by \nNew York State. \n21 U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, The Savings in Medicaid Costs for Newborns and their Mothers from Prenatal \nParticipation in the WIC Program  (1990) , https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/savings-medicaid-costs-newborns-and-\ntheir-mothers-resulting-prenatal-participation-wic-program.  \n22 U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, WIC Medicaid II Feasibility Study: Final Report (2018), \nhttps://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/special-supplemental-nutrition-program-women-infants-and-children-wic-medicaid-\nii-feasibility-study \n23 Fiscal Policy Institute, supra, note 1.  \n24 Helena Bottemiller Evich, “Immigrants, fearing Trump crackdown, drop out of nutrition programs,” Politico \n(online, Sept. 3, 2018), https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/03/immigrants-nutrition-food-trump-crackdown-\n806292.  \n25 124.

WIC also improves access to nutritious foods like whole grains and vegetables.  \nAccess to healthy foods improves early childhood eating habits while also reducing the \nprevalence of pediatric obesity.  By reducing childhood obesity rates, WIC significantly reduces \nlong-term healthcare expenditures.  The Medicaid costs of a child being treated for obesity are \nestimated at $6,730 annually, while the average healthcare costs for children covered by \nMedicaid is $2,446.39.  As WIC works to provide nutritious foods and educate families on \nhealthy eating habits, WIC’s preventive role in reducing childhood obesity leads to additional \nhealthcare savings. \n36.  In New York State, retailers authorized to accept WIC are required to stock fresh \nproduce.  Research indicates that the vast majority of WIC participants purchase their \nsupplemental WIC foods at the same store where they do most of their other food shopping.26  In \nthe 2016 fiscal year, $3.95 billion was spent on the redemption of WIC foods at over 45,000 \nunique vendor sites.27  In 2018, in New York State, WIC participants purchased approximately \n$370 million worth of WIC foods at nearly 3,000 retailers statewide.  As a result, the WIC \nprogram has led to increased expenditures in retail grocery stores and improved access to healthy \nfoods for all consumers.  Changes to the WIC food package in 2009, including the addition of a \ncash-value voucher (CVV) for fruits and vegetables, further advanced access to healthy foods for \nall shoppers.28   \n26 U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, \"Where Do WIC Participants Redeem Their Food Benefits?

WIC’s positive health outcomes are also associated with a long-term increase in \neconomic productivity.  Early brain development – which is linked to the attainment of adult \neconomic productivity – is deeply impacted by access to adequate nutrition and healthcare in \nthe prenatal and early childhood periods.29  Prenatal and early childhood access to nutrition \nsupport and health services ensures that children grow up to be healthier and achieve more \nin school.30  These children are more likely to be active participants in the workforce and \nbecome self-sufficient in adulthood.31  Indeed, WIC's role in reducing childhood obesity can \nhelp address the significant costs (estimated at $4.3 billion annually) associated with \nobesity-related absenteeism in the workplace.32  \n38.  By decreasing WIC enrollment, the Rule will have long-term effects on not \nonly individual health, but also New York’s workforce.  Reduced WIC participation can \nthreaten children’s academic success and contribute to the prevalence of obesity in New \nYork and, ultimately, obesity-related absenteeism.  Overall, these effects will lead to \ndecreased economic output in New York State.  \n \n29 Institute of Medicine, From Neurons to Neighborhoods: The Science of Early Childhood Development \n(2000) (\"[V]irtually every aspect of early human development, from the brain's evolving circuitry to the child's \ncapacity for empathy, is affected by the environments and experiences that are encountered in a cumulative \nfashion, beginning in the prenatal period and extending throughout the early childhood years.\"). \n30 Hilary Hoynes, et al., \"Long-Run Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net,\" 106 Amer.

Medicaid provides both primary health insurance coverage and supplementary \ncoverage for low-income residents and vulnerable individuals.  Health insurance increases the \nlikelihood of people having both a usual source of care and access to care when they need it.  \nAccess to health insurance also improves the likelihood that patients receive recommended and \npotentially life-saving care.33  Studies have also shown expanded Medicaid is associated with \npositive outcomes including lower mortality rates, higher cancer detection rates, and lower infant \nmortality rates.34   \n40.  The Rule will severely diminish immigrants’ access to health insurance.  Many \nimmigrant families have limited access to employer-sponsored insurance.  If there is access to \nemployer sponsored health coverage, it is often unaffordable for individuals with incomes below \nthe Medicaid income level.  For example, it would cost a household of three about 20 percent of \nhousehold income to enroll in employer-sponsored health insurance.  Medicaid is thus often the \nonly affordable health insurance option. \n41.  By including Medicaid in the public charge test for some immigrant categories, \nthe Department anticipates that many non-citizens will disenroll from or choose not to enroll in \nMedicaid due to a misunderstanding about the scope of Medicaid’s implication in the public \ncharge test.  Likewise, the Department expects that many immigrants may choose not to enroll \nin, or disenroll from, other low-cost health insurance programs, such as the Essential Plan, Child \nHealth Plus, and QHPs, out of concern that receipt of any form of public assistance will harm \ntheir ability to adjust status.  In so doing, the Final Rule will effectively leave many non-citizens \n33 Baicker, Katherine, et al. 2013. \"The Oregon Experiment-Medicaid's Effects on Clinical Outcomes.\" New \nEngland Journal of Medicine 368, no. 18: 1713-1722. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1212321 \n34 Antonisse, L., supra, note 16. \nAdd173\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 17 of 26\nwithout a viable insurance alternative.  Without access to health insurance, these New Yorkers \nwill go without preventive care, potentially leading to more acute and more difficult-to-treat \nconditions in the future.  \n42.  By increasing uninsurance rates, the Final Rule will also worsen children’s health \nand well-being.  A parent’s poor health and lack of access to health insurance can jeopardize a \nchild’s health and performance in school.35  Additionally, studies suggest that expanding \ncoverage eligibility to adults has, in some cases, caused significant reductions in children's \nuninsured rates.36  Therefore, a reduction in the number of insured parents could lead to a \nreduction in insurance coverage among their children, regardless of whether their children are \ndirectly impacted by the Rule. \n43.  Without coverage, children will likely suffer the consequences of inconsistent \nwell-child visits and primary care, resulting in potentially serious health issues.  Instead of early \ntreatment for illness, children without health coverage will resort to emergency department visits \nfor treatment of more serious conditions, at a greater cost than doctor's office visits. \n44.  Finally, New York State has made great strides towards ending the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic through programs linked to Medicaid.  The Medicaid Redesign Team Housing \nContracts offer affordable housing for high-need Medicaid recipients living with HIV; residents \nare charged only 30 percent of their monthly adjusted income as rent.  Further, the New York \nState Medicaid Program for Persons with HIV assists approximately 67,000 New Yorkers living \nwith HIV by allowing them to receive their healthcare and other support services through the \n35 Institute of Medicine Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance, \"Family Well-Being and Health \nInsurance Coverage,\" Health Insurance Is a Family Matter, (Washington, DC: National Academics Press, \n2002), available online at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books / NBK221008/. \n36 \"Medicaid Expansion: Good for Parents and Children.\" 2014.

The care and treatment of persons living with HIV leads to viral \nsuppression, which improves health and prevents transmission of HIV.  Likewise, treatment of \npersons at risk for HIV with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents acquisition of HIV. \n45.  If the Rule goes into effect, New York State’s progress in combating the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic will be stalled and the spread of life-threatening communicable diseases \nwill likely rise.  As more than half of persons living with HIV in New York State receive care \nthrough the Medicaid program, disincentivizing HIV-positive immigrants from enrolling in \nMedicaid due to the Rule’s chilling effects would effectively prevent them from receiving life-\nsaving healthcare and prescription drugs that maximize virus suppression and prevent further \ntransmission.  In addition, those at risk for HIV who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid \nmay forego treatment with PrEP due to their inability to pay for preventive care visits or \nmedication, thus putting more New Yorkers at risk of HIV. \n46.  Additionally, most housing programs supported by the Medicaid Redesign Team \nHousing Contract are currently at capacity, and several have waiting lists.  Due to the limited \ncapacity of these facilities, paired with the lack of alternative affordable housing in many \ncommunities, HIV-positive persons may be at increased risk of homelessness if they choose to \ndisenroll in Medicaid out of fear generated by the Final Rule.   \nIrreparable Harm to the Health and Well-Being of New Yorkers Caused by the Chilling \nEffect on WIC Participation \n47.  WIC aims to reach eligible women as early as possible to maximize the \nprogram’s impact on the pregnancy and reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes including \ninfant mortality, premature birth, and low birth weight.  Longer participation in WIC \nthroughout the pregnancy is associated with lower risk of preterm birth and a greater chance \nAdd175\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 19 of 26\nof preventing low- or very low-birthweight.37  In addition to having serious health \ncomplications, low-birthweight babies are also more likely to die in the first year of life.38  \nOver 23,000 infants die each year in the United States.39  WIC’s intervention plays a \nsignificant role in reducing perinatal and infant mortality by ensuring adequate nutrition and \nhealthy development in pregnancy and the first few weeks of life.40 \n48.  The Department expects that the chilling effects of the Rule will cause fewer \nnon-citizen mothers to participate in WIC, which puts their U.S. children at risk of birth \ncomplications, malnutrition, and even death.   \n49.  WIC continues to offer health benefits after pregnancy has ended.  WIC \npromotes and supports breastfeeding in several key ways, including providing educational \nmaterials, one-on-one consultations with peer and professional staff, group classes and \nsupport groups, and 24/7 hotlines for questions.  The WIC program also works to establish \ncommunity partnerships to ensure systematic community support for breastfeeding in all \nsettings, and each local WIC provider must employ breastfeeding experts and peer \ncounselors. \n50.  The highly successful breastfeeding peer counselor program, along with other \ninitiatives, has helped improve the breastfeeding rates of WIC mothers nationally, from 42 \npercent in 1998 to 71 percent in 2016, and has contributed to a reduction in breastfeeding \n37 Kathryn, Fingar, et al., \"Reassessing the Association between WIC and Birth Outcomes Using a Fetuses-at-\nRisk Approach,\" 21 J Maternal and Child Health 825 (2017); Ralitza Gueorguieva, et al., \"Length of prenatal \nparticipation in WIC and risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant: Florida, 1996-2004,\" 13 J of \nMaternal Child Health 479 (2009); Marianne Bitler & Janet Currie, \"Does WIC Work?

There is strong evidence of the strong positive health impacts of \nbreastfeeding.  Infants breastfed for 3 months are 30 percent less likely to have type 1 \ndiabetes.43  Breastfeeding is associated with lower rates of pediatric overweight or obesity,44 \nand reduced risk of other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and \nsome forms of cancer.45  Breastfeeding is also positively correlated with cognitive \ndevelopment.46   \n52.  Many immigrant mothers will likely disenroll from, or choose not to enroll in, \nWIC out of concern that participation will affect their immigration status.  These mothers \nwill be left without access to the breastfeeding support services offered through WIC.  As a \nresult, the Department expects fewer immigrant mothers to breastfeed, or to breastfeed for a \nshorter period.  By hindering breastfeeding education and support, the Rule puts U.S. citizen \nchildren at greater risk of short- and long-term adverse health impacts correlated with \nreductions in breastfeeding, including diabetes, obesity, and chronic disease, as well as \nreduced cognitive development. \n41 U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, “WIC Participant and Program Characteristics 2016 Final Report,” 142 (Apr. 20, \n2018), https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/ops/WICPC2016.pdf. \n42 U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, “WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study – 2: Infant Year Report,” https://fns-\nprod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/ops/WIC-ITFPS2-Infant.pdf (Jan. 2017).  \n43 Bernardo Horta, et al., “Long-term consequences of breastfeeding on cholesterol, obesity, systolic blood pressure, \nand type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,” 104 Acta Paediatrica 30 (2015). \n44 Laurence Grummer-Strawn & Zuguo Mei, “Does Breastfeeding Protect Against Pediatric Overweight?

WIC also offers preventative nutrition assistance through its nutritious food \npackage, which was overhauled in 2009 to offer greater access to whole-grain foods, fruits, \nand vegetables for WIC participants.  The 2009 food package changes resulted in a marked \nincrease in whole-grain and vegetable consumption among WIC participants, and a similarly \nsignificant reduction in whole milk consumption.47  These changes have contributed to a \nmodest decline in severe childhood obesity among young children of WIC families, \nhighlighting how WIC's health benefits continue past the infancy period.48  Only 13.9% of \n \nchildren aged two to five are obese,49 and yet pediatric obesity is known to be a significant \ncause of adult obesity and can lead to serious chronic health conditions, including heart \ndisease, some types of cancers, type-2 diabetes, and hypertension.50 \n54.  WIC’s food package also leads to higher iron intake, which is a critical \nsupplement for those at risk of iron deficiency.51   Notably, there remain nearly 200,000 \nannual ambulatory care visits as a result of anemia, with most cases due to a nutritional \ndeficiency; approximately 5,200 individuals died as a result of iron-deficiency anemia in \n2015.52  \n55.

Impeded access to healthy foods will put many \nU.S.-citizen children at risk of anemia and pediatric obesity and open the door to the long-term \nhealth consequences of an unhealthy diet, including adult obesity and chronic disease.   \nIncreased Administrative Burdens and Costs on New York State \n56.  If implemented, the Final Rule will impose administrative burdens and costs on \nNYSDOH, including those imposed on the NY State of Health Marketplace.  \n57.  Federal law requires the health insurance Marketplaces to use a single \nstreamlined application process.  42 USC § 18083; 45 CFR § 155.405(a).  Under this \napplication process, Marketplaces must determine Medicaid eligibility for anyone applying \nfor subsidized health insurance coverage.  42 USC § 18083(a); 45 CFR §§ 155.305(c), \n155.310(b).  Therefore, all applicants for Marketplace programs, including individuals \nseeking to apply for enrollment in Child Health Plus, the Essential Plan, or a QHP with an \nAdvance Premium Tax Credit (APTC), must be found ineligible for Medicaid before their \neligibility can be determined for other programs.  As such, the State’s information \ntechnology system is currently set up so that a Medicaid application is a threshold \nrequirement, before applications for other programs are permitted. \n58.  Marketplaces are also legally constrained from determining eligibility only for \na particular insurance affordability program.  45 CFR §§ 155.305(c)-(g), 155.310(b).  NY \nState of Health Marketplace thus must evaluate eligibility for all potential subsidized \nprograms, including Medicaid.  \n59.  Accordingly, even if non-citizens choose not to enroll in Medicaid out of fear \nthat their participation will affect their ability to adjust their immigration status, the \nDepartment will be legally and administratively constrained from allowing them to apply for \nAdd179\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 23 of 26\nother forms of low-cost health insurance, such as Child Health Plus, the Essential Plan, or a \nQHP.  \n60.  As a result, these individuals may forego health insurance altogether unless \nthe Department is able to effectively communicate to non-citizens the narrow scope of \nMedicaid’s implication in the Final Rule. \n61.  In total, NY State of Health Marketplace’s increased Customer Service Center \nvolume following the Final Rule’s implementation could cost the state millions of dollars. \n62.  In addition, NYSDOH will have to expend resources preparing for \nimplementation of the Final Rule before the October 15, 2019 effective date.  For example, \nNYSDOH has developed materials to communicate with consumers about these rule \nchanges. \n63.  The Final Rule, if enacted, will also impose significant costs on the WIC \nprogram.  \n64.  WIC works in tandem with Medicaid and SNAP to advance public health, as \nWIC’s targeted intervention for pregnant women, new mothers, and young children \ncomplements the broader purpose of Medicaid to provide health coverage and SNAP to \nensure adequate nutrition for low-income families.  In New York State, 86.2 percent of WIC \nparticipants are also enrolled in Medicaid. \n65.  Congress has recognized the connection between these programs by \nauthorizing adjunctive eligibility.53  Adjunctive eligibility permits individuals to be \nautomatically income-eligible for WIC if they or certain family members participate in \nMedicaid, SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or other benefit \n53 Pub. L. No. 101-147 § 123 (Nov. 10, 1989) [codified in 42 USC §l 786(d)(2)(A)(ii), (iii)]. \nAdd180\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 24 of 26\nprograms at the discretion of the state.  In 2016, 74.9 percent of WIC participants reported \nreceiving at least one of the adjunctively-eligible programs, and it is possible that even more \nWIC participants are adjunctively eligible through family members.54 \n66.  Determining income eligibility is one of the most burdensome elements of the \nWIC certification process.  WIC routinely certifies participants to ensure continuing \n  \neligibility, and certification periods last for one year, at most.55 With few exceptions, a \nparticipant must be physically present in the WIC clinic each time that participant is certified, \n  \nincluding infants and young children.56 Adjunctive eligibility therefore promotes efficiency \nby streamlining the certification process and reducing burdens on both clinics and \nparticipants. \n67.  Income certification through adjunctive eligibility also takes less time than \nincome screening involving pay stubs or other financial documents.57  These efficiency \ngains have helped reduce barriers to WIC participation, maximize clinic time for WIC’s \npublic health services, and free WIC funding for nutrition education and breastfeeding \nsupport. \n68.  Due to the benefits of adjunctive eligibility rules, New York State has \nstreamlined documentation requirements to create a smoother process for applicants to join \nWIC.  Families may now use their smart phones and tablets to prove eligibility in some cases.  \nFor example, families can use online accounts to show they are enrolled in adjunct programs \n54 U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, \"WIC Participant and Program Characteristics 2016 Final Report,\" 31-32 (Apr. \n20, 2018), https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/ops/WICPC2016.pdf. \n55 7 C.F.R. § 246.7(g)(l). \n56 Id. § 246.7(0). \n57 See National WIC Association, “WIC State Directors Value Medicaid Adjunctive Eligibility” (2015), \nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/aws.upl/nwica.org/medicaid-ae-study.pdf. \nAdd181\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 25 of 26\nlike Medicaid.  New York State has also invested in a long-term streamlining initiative to \nintegrate eligibility systems across programs and state agencies. \n69.  The inclusion of Medicaid and SNAP in public charge review will decrease \nparticipation in Medicaid and SNAP among WIC families.  Because New Yorkers are \nexpected to be deterred from participating in SNAP and Medicaid due to the chilling effects \nof the Rule (in addition to decreased participation in other health insurance coverage \noptions), the Department’s efforts to improve efficiency by streamlining the WIC \ncertification process will be impeded by the Final Rule.  By reducing the number of families \nthat are eligible through an adjunct program, WIC staff will spend additional time \nconducting income certification.  Estimates show that income screening using pay stubs or \nfinancial documents costs $12.50 per participant, whereas the administrative costs for \nincome screening with adjunctive eligibility is only $3.75 per participant.58  The additional \n$8.75 per participant cost – if applied to the whole program – could add significant new \npressures on WIC’s budget.   \n70.  Additional administrative costs would be financed through WIC’s “Nutrition \nServices & Administrative” (NSA) grant.  The NSA grant finances not only administrative \n \ncosts, but also WIC’s wide-ranging public health and education efforts.59  About one-third of \nthe total NSA grant (approximately 9.5 percent of total WIC funding) is used for program \nadministration, as WIC seeks to maximize available funding for nutrition education, \nbreastfeeding support, or other client services.60  Increased income screening in the clinics \nwill require more of the NSA grant to be devoted to administrative costs, thereby reducing \n58 Id. \n59 42 U.S.C. § 1786(b)(4). \n60 U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, \"WIC Nutrition Services and Administration Cost Study\" (Nov. 2017), https://fns-\nprod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/ops/WICNSACostStudy.pdf. \nAdd182\n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 34-19   Filed 09/09/19   Page 26 of 26\nfunding for WIC’s important nutrition education classes, breastfeeding support, and public \nhealth screenings and referrals for immunizations, tobacco cessation, postpartum depression, \nopioids, and more. \n71.  The Department anticipates that a substantial number of New Yorkers will forego \nenrollment in Medicaid and SNAP due to the chilling effects of the Final Rule, resulting in \nadjunctive eligibility in WIC being substantially impaired.  Should that occur, WIC agencies \n \nwill have to hire additional staff to conduct longer certification appointments,61 which would \ndiminish the capacity of WIC agencies and clinics to attract specialized staff with expertise in \nnutrition education and breastfeeding support, such as Registered Dietitians (RDs) or \nInternational Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs). \nCONCLUSION \n72.  For these reasons, the Department opposes implementation of the Final Rule \ngiven its destructive, far-reaching, and irreversible consequences on the economy, health, and \nadministration of New York State, and I respectfully request that this Court grant the relief \nPlaintiffs request.   \nI declare under penalty that the foregoing is true and correct and of my own personal knowledge. \n \nDATED this 6th day of September, 2019 at New York, New York. \n \n   \nHOWARD A.

Int’l \nRefugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (“IRAP”). Here, as Plaintiffs’ motion \nexplained, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has so drastically altered the balance of the \nequities that Plaintiffs require new, temporary relief during the pendency of the national \nemergency. \nDefendants do not seriously dispute that there is a direct connection between the COVID-\n19 crisis and the Public Charge Rule at issue here—indeed, they have already been forced to \nlimit the Rule in light of the COVID-19 crisis, and they have announced further changes for the \nfirst time in their response to Plaintiffs’ motion in the Supreme Court. Their arguments against \nthe narrow relief that Plaintiffs request are meritless. \nARGUMENT \n \nA.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue a new injunction.  \n \nThis Court retains authority to make new factual findings and issue new, temporary relief \nin response to the unprecedented changed circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nDefendants’ contention that any overlap between this motion and issues implicated in Plaintiffs’ \nprior injunction divests this Court of jurisdiction, Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n. to Pls.’ Mot. for \nPreliminary Injunction, Dkt. No. 176 (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 8, has no basis in law.  \nDefendants do not dispute that the district court may proceed with adjudicating the \nunderlying case while the appeal of a preliminary injunction is pending. See Pls.’ Mot. for \nPreliminary Injunction, Dkt. No. 169 (“Pls.’ Mem.”) at 13-14; Defs.’ Mem. at 6. Jurisdiction to \n“continue with proceedings,” Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 3949.1 (3d ed. Aug. 2019 update), will frequently require the district court to rule \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 6 of 17\non matters that may relate to—but do not perfectly overlap with—issues on appeal. For example, \nDefendants do not contend that the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss, though that motion rehashes arguments about standing and justiciability that \nDefendants are also pressing on appeal. Defs.’ Mem. at 8.1 District courts regularly consider the \nmerits of disputes on motions for summary judgment, even where the same issues are presented \nby a pending appeal of a preliminary injunction. See, e.g., California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 583 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (“We have repeatedly admonished district courts not to delay trial preparation to \nawait an interim ruling on a preliminary injunction”). As Plaintiffs have explained, see Pls.’ \nMem. at 16-19, the public health and global economic crisis engendered by the COVID-19 \npandemic has shifted the balance of equities, requiring new determinations to be made by the \ncourt best situated to make factual findings—this Court—and the issuance of new, narrowly \ntailored relief to stave off those harms.  \n  To the extent that there was doubt concerning this Court’s jurisdiction to make new \nfactual findings and issue new relief, the Supreme Court has obviated those concerns. In \nPlaintiffs’ application to the Supreme Court, Plaintiffs acknowledged potential uncertainty \nregarding this Court’s jurisdiction to provide relief and, accordingly, requested that the Supreme \nCourt “clarify that its stay order does not preclude the lower court from considering whether the \nnew circumstances arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic warrant temporary relief” enjoining \nthe Rule. Dep’t Homeland Sec. v. New York, No. 19A785, Mot. by Gov’t Pls. to Temporarily Lift \n                                                            \n1 Defendants’ cases are not to the contrary, but instead involve materially different situations. See Webb v. GAF \nCorp., 78 F.3d 53, 55–56 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding appeal of preliminary injunction moot where district court issued a \npermanent injunction).  Drywall Tapers & Pointers of Greater NY v. Bovis Lend Lease Interiors, Inc., No. 05 Civ. \n2746 (JG), 2006 WL 322384, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2006) (where union filed a non-party appeal of the district \ncourt’s consent judgment and “placed the question of its rightful role in this case plainly at the door of the court of \nappeals,” district court lacked jurisdiction consider union’s intervention motion). In contrast, Plaintiffs’ instant \nrequest would not undermine or moot the pending appeal.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 7 of 17\nof Modify the Court’s Stay, at 16 (Jan. 22, 2020).2 While the Court could have denied Plaintiffs’ \nrequest, or ignored it altogether, it chose not to; instead, it explained that while it was denying \nPlaintiffs’ application to modify its stay, it did “not preclude a filing in the District Court.” See \nDkt. No. 170-2 (Supreme Court Order). It is a “basic canon” of textual interpretation that there is \n“a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase”; this Court should reject any attempt to render \nthe text of the Supreme Court’s order meaningless. Abimbola v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 173, 179 (2d \nCir. 2004). That is, even if the Supreme Court’s stay somehow divested this Court of jurisdiction \nto consider a new request for an injunction—which it did not—the Supreme Court’s order \nclarified that this Court is the proper forum to resolve these new and urgent problems.    \n  Moreover, Rule 62.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is designed to ameliorate \nany lingering concerns about this Court’s jurisdiction. Rule 62.1(a)(3) authorizes this Court to \nmake factual findings and in issue an indicative ruling that “promote[s] judicial efficiency and \nfairness by providing a mechanism for the district court to inform the parties and the court of \nappeals how it would rule on a motion.” Amarin Pharm. Ireland Ltd. v. Food & Drug Admin., \n139 F. Supp. 3d 437, 447 (D.D.C. 2015). Issuance of both new, temporary injunctive relief and \nan indicative ruling allows the Circuit maximum flexibility in the event of a subsequent appeal.3  \nB.

See Ret. Bd. of \nPolicemen's Annuity & Ben. Fund of City of Chicago v. Bank of New York Mellon, 297 F.R.D. 218, 223 (S.D.N.Y. \n2013) (declining to issue an indicative opinion where party contended that the district court “wrongly decided” \nunderlying issue and by appealing and seeking an indicative ruling improperly “placed the same issue in front of two \ncourts at the same time”).  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 8 of 17\nemergency is necessary to remedy the widespread deterrent effects of the Rule. It will allow \nGovernmental Plaintiffs to better mitigate the spread of disease and combat the devastating \nimpacts of the pandemic, and the MRNY Plaintiffs to better address the needs of immigrant \ncommunities they serve. Defendants do not dispute that the Governmental Plaintiffs are suffering \nfrom unprecedented public health and economic harms, or that the Rule is in fact deterring \nimmigrants in the Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions and client communities from accessing crucial medical \nand nutritional benefits. Defendants contend that a temporary suspension of the Rule would not \nredress the irreparable harms that Plaintiffs identify. But Defendants’ position is without support \nin either the law or the factual record. \nAs an initial matter, the Court should not, as Defendants urge, ignore evidence of the \nRule’s harms simply because they may result from immigrants’ “mistaken beliefs about the \nRule’s application and content.” Defs.’ Mem. at 15-16. The Supreme Court has recognized that \ncognizable injury can be based on the “predictable effect[s]” of a challenged government \naction—including the effects on individuals who are not directly subject to the government’s \naction and who react based on purportedly “unfounded fears.” Dep’t. of Commerce v. New York, \n139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). Defendants have cited no case that would preclude the Court from \nsimilarly considering such predictable harms—particularly when the Rule’s deterrent effects, and \ntheir resulting harms to both the parties and the public interest, are not only predictable but are \nactually happening now. Indeed, Defendants do not deny that, as they anticipated during the \nrulemaking, the Rule is in fact causing immigrants and their families to forgo and disenroll even \nfrom benefits “not directly regulated by this [R]ule.” Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, \n84 Fed. Reg. 41,292, 41,463 (Aug. 14, 2019); id. at 41,300.  \nPlaintiffs will “suffer irreparable harm ‘but for’ the issuance of an injunction.” Sierra \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 9 of 17\nClub v.

While there “must be a \n‘sufficient causal connection’ between the alleged irreparable harm and the activity to be \nenjoined. . . a plaintiff ‘need not further show that the action sought to be enjoined is the \nexclusive cause of the injury.’” Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 886 F.3d \n803, 819 (9th Cir. 2018) (internal citations omitted); see also Friends of Merrymeeting Bay v. \nNextEra Energy Res., LLC, No. 2:11 Civ. 38 (GZS), 2013 WL 145733, at *7 (D.

Enrollment in benefits \nprograms declined when the Rule took effect in February 2020, not during the period that the \nRule was enjoined.5 And doctors and other frontline service providers aver that immigrants have \nbeen refusing COVID-related testing and treatment since March 2020 specifically because of \n                                                            \n4 The cases Defendants cite, which support the general proposition that a causal connection must exist between an \ninjunction and an alleged harm, are not to the contrary.

See \nDefs.’ Mem. at 16-17. Instead, it underscores that any remedy short of an injunction would be \ninsufficient to alleviate the confusion surrounding the complex public charge and benefits \nschemes at issue. Where an injunction would reduce the irreparable harms attendant to the Rule, \nspeculation that some immigrants may, regardless of the Rule’s status, continue to avoid benefits \ndoes not weigh against granting relief. See Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 886 F.3d at 823 (it is \npermissible for a court to “issue an injunction that does not completely prevent the irreparable \nharm that it identifies”); see also Friends of Merrymeeting Bay, 2013 WL 145733, at *7 (to \ndemonstrate that injunction would remedy damage, “[p]laintiffs need not establish that their \nrequested relief will bring about” full or complete recovery).7 Temporary injunctive relief will \npermit Plaintiffs and frontline advocates to send a clear message that the Rule is not operative \nduring the national emergency, and that immigrants and their families need not choose between \naccessing health care or nutritional benefits and remaining in the country.  \nC.

Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (No. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD)) (rejecting the argument \nthat evidence that disenrollment by some people before the Rule went into effect was evidence that the “harm \n[would not be] ameliorated by a preliminary injunction”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 11 of 17\naddress fears about benefits use during the pandemic. Defendants’ assurance that DHS will not \npenalize immigrants for receiving COVID-related testing, treatment, or preventative services \nmisses the mark. See Defs.’ Mem. at 12. Plaintiffs have already explained why Defendants’ Alert \nis inadequate and thus no substitute for the relief requested here. See Pls.’ Mem. at 21-23. \nIndeed, Defendants acknowledge the “uncertainty” attendant to the Alert, Defs.’ Mem. at 13, but \npurport to have “eliminated” that uncertainty by stating for the first time in their opposition \npapers in the Supreme Court that for enrollment in Medicaid “to receive COVID-19-related care, \nthat enrollment will not be a negative factor in a public-charge inadmissibility determination,” id. \nAs Plaintiffs have explained, however, Defendants’ substantial modification to the Alert—which \nappears nowhere in DHS guidance materials, on its website, or elsewhere other than in its \nSupreme Court briefing, which is not reasonably calculated to reach the general public—is not \nonly an improper attempt to conduct rulemaking through opposition brief, but also contradicts \nthe Alert’s express text. See Pls.’ Mem. at 22-23.8  \nAlthough the confusion over the application of the Rule during the pandemic is largely \nthe product of Defendants’ own actions, Defendants argue, remarkably, that Plaintiffs are \nresponsible for “creat[ing] ambiguity” by identifying the obvious defects of the Alert. See Defs.’ \nMem. at 14. But Plaintiffs do not “create” ambiguity merely by pointing out that ambiguity \nexists. And contrary to Defendants’ contention, id., officials and agencies in the Governmental \nPlaintiffs’ jurisdictions, as well as many other state and local officials and private organizations \nacross the country, are expending significant resources to educate the public and clarify the \n                                                            \n8 Defendants’ examples of the differing interpretations of the Alert from the District of Columbia and New York \nCity highlights the potential for confusion. While the District of Columbia interprets the Alert to mean that Medicaid \nenrollment will not be penalized if used for COVID-19 testing and treatment, New York City states only that the \ntesting and treatment itself will not be penalized. See Defs.’ Mem. at 14. And as the factual record makes clear, \nPlaintiffs’ efforts to encourage testing and treatment are inadequate so long as the Rule remains in effect.    \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 183   Filed 05/15/20   Page 12 of 17\nscope of the Rule.9  \nDefendants fail to rebut Plaintiffs’ showing of the numerous ways in which DHS’s \nequivocal and ambiguous Alert is patently inadequate to redress the irreparable harms at issue. \nSee Pls.’ Mem. at 21-23. Given these ambiguities, the Alert cannot provide—and as \ndemonstrated by the uncontroverted evidence, has not provided10—adequate assurance to \nimmigrants that they may use public benefits to address COVID-19-related needs without \nconsequence. Accordingly, absent immediate, temporary equitable relief from this Court, the \nRule will continue to undermine Plaintiffs’ efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and \neconomic devastation resulting from the pandemic. See Pls.’ Mem. at 22-23.  \nD.  The remaining factors strongly favor temporary injunctive relief during the \npendency of the national emergency.  \n \nAs this Court has previously recognized, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir claims. The Supreme Court stay opinion, which was silent on the merits, does not alter that \nconclusion. See IRAP, 137 S. Ct. at 2087 (recognizing that a stay is “often dependent as much on \nthe equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents”); Dkt. No. 170-1; see \nalso Wolf v.

Defendants will not be harmed by \ntemporarily continuing to enforce a standard that has been in place for the past century. See Pls.’ \nMem. at 24-25; Pls.’ Opp’n. to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 145, at 3-12. By contrast, the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is the largest public-health and economic disaster that the United States \nhas faced in at least a century. And the Public Charge Rule is impeding Plaintiffs’ efforts to halt \nthe virus’s spread in our communities and to stabilize the economy. The temporary and targeted \nrelief that Plaintiffs request is warranted by the severe problems that we face; lives depend on it.  \nE.  Nationwide relief is necessary and appropriate \n  \n “[T]he ordinary result” of a determination that an agency’s regulation is unlawful under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), as the Rule is here, “is that the rules are vacated—\nnot that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.” Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 \nF.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Moreover, nationwide relief is necessary to remedy the \nharm caused by the Rule for the simple reason that the spread of the coronavirus is not \ngeographically limited. COVID-19 “knows no bounds” and “doesn’t respect state lines.”12 \nCOVID-19 has been reported to have originally spread across the country through interstate \n                                                            \n11 Nor should the Ninth Circuit’s stay of the injunctions in California and Washington sway the assessment of merits \nin this case. Defendants notified of the Court of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in December 2019, Dkt. No. 127, and \ncited to the decision in their motion to stay the injunction, Dkt. No. 130. The Court properly declined to adopt the \nNinth Circuit’s analysis. See Dkt. No. 136.   \n12 See, e.g., Homeland Security Council, National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, Homeland Security Council, 2 \n(Nov. 2005), available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/pandemic-influenza-strategy-2005.pdf; \nBart Jansen, Maureen Groppe, and William Cummings, Fauci warns of ‘needless suffering’ if US fumbles reopening \nprocedures, USA Today (May 12, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/12/coronavirus-dr-anthony-fauci-testify-senate-panel-\nreopening/3108593001/ (Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine in the Department of Health \nPolicy at Vanderbilt University, stating that “[t]he virus knows no bounds”); @CNNPolitics, Twitter (Apr. 24, 2020, \n4:50 PM), available at https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1253788494255849476 (“North Carolina Gov.

See Pls.’ Mem. \nat 18. In turn, the nature of “community spread” of the virus means that new infections put \neveryone at risk.15 Discouraging noncitizens nationwide, including essential workers, from \nobtaining medical care undermines efforts by Plaintiffs and others to combat the pandemic and \nmitigate its devastating harms. A nationwide injunction is necessary and appropriate.16 \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons stated above and in Plaintiffs’ opening memorandum, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court make factual findings recognizing the harmful effects of the \nRule during this crisis, issue a new preliminary injunction forbidding implementation of the Rule \nduring the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, a stay of the effective date of the \nRule pursuant to Section 705 of the APA, and, in addition, issue an indicative ruling pursuant to \nFed.

Reg.  41,292  (Aug.  14,  2019)  (Rule). \nWhereas  a  1999  guidance  document  had  interpreted  “public  charge” \nto  mean  an  alien  who  was  at  a  minimum  “primarily  dependent”  on  a \nlimited  set  of  cash  benefits  from  the  government,  the  Rule  extends \nthe  set  of  covered  benefits  to  include  certain  designated  non-cash \nbenefits  providing  for  basic  needs  such  as  housing  and  food  and \nasks  whether  the  alien  is  likely  to  receive  such  benefits  for  more \nthan  12  months  in  aggregate  within  any  36-month  period. \nThe  Ninth  Circuit,  in  the  only  reasoned  appellate  decision  to \naddress  the  Rule  to  date,  held  that  the  Rule  “easily”  qualified  as \na  permissible  interpretation  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality \nAct  (INA),  8  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco \n  \nv.  USCIS,  944  F.3d  773,  799  (2019).  It  accordingly  stayed  a \npreliminary  injunction  entered  by  a  district  court  in  Washington \nthat  had  prevented  implementation  of  the  Rule  nationwide.  See  id. \nat  780-781.  The  Fourth  Circuit,  too,  concluded  that  DHS  is  likely \nto  prevail,  and  thus  stayed  a  second  nationwide  preliminary\n3 \ninjunction  entered  by  a  district  court  in  Maryland.  See  Order, \nCasa  de  Maryland,  Inc.  v.  Trump,  No.  19-2222  (Dec.  9,  2019). \nNotwithstanding  those  two  appellate  decisions,  the  government \nremains  unable  to  implement  the  Rule  --  even  in  the  Fourth  and \nNinth  Circuits  --  because  of  a  pair  of  nationwide  injunctions \nissued  by  a  district  judge  in  New  York.  See  App.,  infra,  66a-68a; \nid.  at  69a-‘Vla.  In  a  one-paragraph  order,  the  Second  Circuit \ndeclined  to  stay  those  nationwide  injunctions  pending  appeal, \nthereby  allowing  the  district  court’s  judgment  here  to  override \nthe  views  of  the  Executive  Branch  and  two  other  courts  of  appeals \nwith  respect  to  important  national  immigration  policies. \nIn  deciding  whether  to  grant  a  stay  in  this  posture,  the  Court \nconsiders  whether  an  eventual  petition  for  certiorari  in  the  case \nwould  likely  be  granted,  whether  there  is  a  fair  prospect  that  the \nCourt  would  rule  for  the  moving  party,  and  whether  irreparable \nharm  is  likely  to  occur  if  a  stay  is  not  granted.  Those  criteria \nare  readily  met  here. \nFirst,  the  Court’s  review  would  plainly  be  warranted.  Two \ncourts  of  appeals  have  already  concluded  that  the  Rule  is  likely \nto  be  upheld;  a  decision  by  the  Second  Circuit  affirming  the \npreliminary  injunctions  here  would  necessarily  reach  the  opposite \nconclusion,  presenting  a  circuit  conflict  over  important  questions \nof  federal  immigration  law.  Moreover,  the  nationwide  scope  of  the \ninjunctions  independently  warrants  review.  The  circumstances  here\n4 \n-~-  in  which  the  considered  decisions  of  two  federal  courts  of \nappeals  have  been  rendered  effectively  academic  by  a  Single \ndistrict  judge’s  nationwide  injunctions  --  starkly  illustrate  the \nproblems  with  allowing  district  courts  to  award  relief  untethered \nto  the  actual  cases  or  controversies  before  them. \n \nSecond,  there  also  is  a  fair  prospect  that  this  Court  would \nvacate,  or  at  least  narrow,  the  injunctions.  As  the  Ninth  Circuit \nheld,  the  Rule  “easily”  qualifies  as  an  appropriate  exercise  of \nthe  discretion  that  Congress  has  vested  in  the  agency  to  determine \nwhich  aliens  are  likely,  in  its  “‘opinion,’”  to  become  public \ncharges.  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  799  (quoting \n  \n8B  U.S.C.  11(a)8 (4)2 (A) ).  And  even  setting  aside  the  merits,  the \nscope  of  the  injunctions  extends  well  beyond  the  district  court’s \nlimited  Article  III  authority  to  resolve  only  the  cases  before  it \n--  not  hypothetical  cases  that  it  envisioned  other  plaintiffs  in \nother  parts  of  the  country  might  bring.,  \nThird  and  finally,  allowing  the  district  court’s  erroneous \nand  overbroad  injunctions  to  remain  in  effect  until  this  Court  has \nbeen  able  to  undertake  plenary  review  would  result  in  effectively \nirreparable  harm  to  the  government.  As  a  result  of  the \ninjunctions,  the  government  is  precluded  from  implementing  its \nchosen  policy  and,  indeed,  will  grant  lawful  permanent  resident \nstatus  to  aliens  who  are  statutorily  “inadmissible”  because,  in \nthe  opinion  of”  the  Executive  Branch,  each  is  “likely  *  *  *  to \n5 \nbecome  a  public  charge.”  8  U.S.C.  11(a8) (42) (A ).  No  practical \nmeans  exist  to  reverse  those  determinations  once  made. \nFor  those  reasons,  the  court  should  stay  the  district  court’s \nnationwide  injunctions  in  their  entirety,  or  at  least  limit  them \n \nto  the  actual  parties  before  the  district  court. \nSTATEMENT \nA.  The  Public-Charge  Inadmissibility  Rule \n1.  The  INA  provides  that  an  alien  is  “inadmissible”  if,  “in \nthe  opinion  of  the  [Secretary  of  Homeland  Security]  at  the  time  of \napplication  for  admission  or  adjustment  of  status,  [the  alien]  is \nlikely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge.”  8  U.S.C. \n1182((4)a (A)). }  That  assessment  “shall  at  a  minimum  consider  the \nalien’s  (I)  age;  (II)  health;  (III)  family  status;  (IV)  assets, \nresources,  and  financial  status;  and  (V)  education  and  skills.” \n8  U.S.C.  11(a)8 (42) (B ).  A  separate  INA  provision  states  that  an \nalien  is  deportable  if,  within  five  years  of  entry,  the  alien  “has \nbecome  a  public  charge  from  causes  not  affirmatively  shown  to  have \narisen”  since  entry.  8  U.S.C.  1227(a) (5). \nThree  agencies  make  public-charge  inadmissibility \ndeterminations  under  Section 1182(a)  (4):  DHS  for  aliens  seeking \n  \n1  The  statute  refers:t o  the  Attorney  General,  but  in  2002, \nCongress  transferred  the  Attorney  General’s  authority  to  make \ninadmissibility  determinations  in  the  relevant  circumstances  to \nthe  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security.  See  6  U.S.C.  557;  8  U.S.C. \n1103;  see  also  6  U.S.C.  211 (c)  (8). \n6 \nadmission  at  the  border  and  aliens  within  the  country  who  apply  to \nadjust  their  status  to  that  of  a  lawful  permanent  resident;  the \nDepartment  of  State  when  evaluating  visa  applications  filed  by \naliens  abroad;  and  the  Department  of  Justice  when  the  question \narises  during  removal  proceedings.  See  84  Fed.  Reg.  41,292,  41,294 \nn.3  (Aug.  14,  2019).  The  Rule  at  issue  governs  DHS’s  public- \ncharge  inadmissibility  determinations.  Ibid.  DHS  indicated  in \nadopting  the  Rule  that  the  State  Department  and  Department  of \nJustice  were  planning  to  adopt  consistent  guidance.  Ibid. \n2.  Although  the  public-charge  ground  of  inadmissibility \ndates  back  to  the  first  immigration  statutes,  Congress  has  never \ndefined  the  term  “public  charge,”  instead  leaving  the  term’s \ndefinition  and  application  to  the  Executive  Branch’s  discretion. \nIn  1999,  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  (INS)  proposed \na  rule  to  “for  the  first  time  define  ‘public  charge,’”  64  Fed. \nReg.  28,676,  28,689  (May  26,  1999),  a  term  that  the  INS  noted  was \n“ambiguous”  and  had  “never  been  defined  in  statute  or  regulation,” \nid.  at  28,676-28,677.  The  proposed  rule  would  have  provided  that \nin  determining  whether  an  alien  was  “‘likely  at  any  time  to  become \na  public  charge’”  “‘in  the  opinion  of’  the  consular  officer  or \nService  officer  making  the  decision,”  “public  charge”  would  mean \nan  alien  “who  is  likely  to  become  primarily  dependent  on  the \nGovernment  for  subsistence  as  demonstrated  by  either:  (i)  [t]he \nreceipt  of  public  cash  assistance  for  income  maintenance  purposes,\nr \nor  (ii)  [i]nstitutionalization  for  long-term  care  at  Government \nexpense.”  Id.  at  28,681  (quoting  8  U.S.C.  1182((4) a(A))) .  When \nit  announced  the  proposed  rule,  INS  also  issued  “field  guidance” \nadopting  the  proposed  rule’s  definition  of  “public  charge.”  Id. \nat  28,689.  The  proposed  rule  was  never  finalized,  leaving  only \n \nthe  1999  field  guidance  in  place.  84  Fed.  Reg.  at  41,348  n.295. \n3.  In  October  2018,  DHS  announced  a  new  approach  to  public- \ncharge  inadmissibility  determinations.  It  did  so  through  a \nproposed  rule  subject  to  notice  and  comment.  83  Fed.  Reg.  51,114 \n(Oct.  10,  2018).  After  responding  to  comments  received  during  the \ncomment  period,  DHS  promulgated  the  final  Rule  in  August  2019.  84 \nFed.  Reg.  at  41,501.  The  Rule  is  the  first  time  the  Executive \nBranch  has  defined  the  term  “public  charge,”  and  established  a \nframework  for  evaluating  whether  an  alien  is  likely  to  become  a \npublic  charge,  in  a  final  rule  following  notice  and  comment. \nThe  Rule  defines  “public  charge”  to  mean  “an  alien  who \nreceives  one  or  more  [designated]  public  benefits  *  *  *  for  more \nthan  12  months  in  the  aggregate  within  any  36-month  period  (such \nthat,  for  instance,  receipt  of  two  benefits  in  one  month  counts  as \ntwo  months).”  84  Fed.  Reg.  at  41,501.  The  designated  public \nbenefits  include  cash  assistance  for  income  maintenance  and \ncertain  non-cash  benefits,  including  most  Medicaid  benefits, \nSupplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  benefits,  and  federal \nhousing  assistance.  Ibid.  As  the  agency  explained,  the  Rule’s \n8 \ndefinition  of  “public  charge”  differs  from  the  1999  field  guidance \nin  that  (1)  it  incorporates  certain  non~cash  benefits;  and  (2)  it \nreplaces  the  “primarily  dependent”  standard  with  the  12-month/36- \nmonth  measure  of  dependence.  Id.  at  41,294-41,295. \nThe  Rule  also  sets  forth  a  framework  the  agency  will  use  to \nevaluate  whether,  considering  the  “totality  of  an  alien’s \nindividual  circumstances,”  the  alien  is  “likely  at  any  time  in  the \nfuture  to  become  a  public  charge.”  84  Fed.  Reg.  at  41,369;  see \nid.  at  41,501-41,504.  Among  other  things,  the  framework  identifies \na  number  of  factors  an  adjudicator  must  consider  in  making  a \npublic-charge  inadmissibility  determination,  such  as  the  alien’s \nage,  financial  resources,  employment  history,  education,  and \nhealth.  Ibid.  The  Rule  was  set  to  take  effect  on  October  15, \n  \n2019.  Id.  at  41,292. \nB.  Procedural  History \n1.  Respondents  are  four  governmental  entities  (three  States \nand  the  City  of  New  York)  and  five  non-governmental  organizations \nthat  provide  services  to  immigrants.  In  August  2019,  they  filed \ntwo  suits  --  one  by  the  governmental  entities,  the  other  by  the \nnon-governmental  organizations  --  challenging  the  Rule  in  the \nUnited  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  New  York. \nSee  App.,  infra,  la-2a;  id.  at  25a-26a.  They  argued  that  the \nRule’s  definition  of  “public  charge”  is  not  a  permissible \nconstruction  of  the  INA,  that  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  and  capricious,\n9 \nthat  the  Rule  violates  the  Rehabilitation  Act,  and  that  -- \naccording  to  the  non-governmental  organizations  --  the  Rule \nviolates  constitutional  equal-protection  principles.  See  id.  at \nlla-18a;  id.  at  36a-45a. \n2.  On  October  11,  2019,  the  district  court  granted \nrespondents’  requests  for  nationwide  preliminary  injunctions  and   \nstays  under  5  U.S.C.  705  barring  DHS  from  implementing  the  Rule. \nApp.,  infra,  66a-68a;  id.  at  69a-7la. \nIn  a  pair  of  largely  overlapping  opinions,  the  district  court \nfirst  concluded  that  plaintiffs  had  standing  and  that  they  had \nasserted  injuries  within  the  zone  of  interests  protected  by  the \npublic-charge  provision.  App.,  infra,  7a-10a  (opinion  in  suit  by \ngovernmental  plaintiffs);  id.  at  3la-36a  (opinion  in  suit by  non- \ngovernmental  plaintiffs).  Turning  to  the  merits,  the  court \nconcluded  that  plaintiffs  were  likely  to  prevail  on  their  claim \nthat  the  Rule’s  definition  of  “public  charge”  is  not  a  reasonable \ninterpretation  of  the  statute.  Id.  at  lla-l4a;  id.  at  36a-39a. \nAfter  reciting  the  statute’s  text  and  some  of  its  history,  the \ncourt  stated  that  “one  thing  is  abundantly  clear  --  ‘public  charge’ \nhas  never  been  understood  to  mean  receipt  of  12  months  of  benefits \nwithin  a  36-month  period.”  Id.  at  13a;  id.  at  38a  (same).  In  the \ncourt’s  view,  Congress  was  “content  with  the  current  definition \nset  forth  in  the  Field  Guidance,  which  defines  public  charge  as \nsomeone  who  has  become  or  is  likely  to  become  primarily  dependent \n10 \non  the  government  for  cash  assistance.”  Ibid.  In  support  of  that \nview,  the  court  cited  a  pair  of  legislative  proposals  in  1996  and \n2013  that  would  have  “extend[ed]  the  meaning  of  public  charge  to \ninclude  the  use  of  non-cash  benefits”  but  that  were  not  ultimately \nenachted.  Ibid. \nThe  district  court  also  concluded  that  respondents  were \nlikely  to  succeed  in  demonstrating  that  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious,  because  DHS  allegedly  failed  to  provide  reasoned \nexplanations  for  departing  from  the  1999  field  guidance’s \ndefinition  of  “public  charge”  and  adopting  its  chosen  framework. \nApp.,  infra,  l14a-lva;  id.  at  39a-43a.  The  court  stated  that \nrespondents  had  raised  a  “colorable  argument”  that  the  Rule \nviolates  the  Rehabilitation  Act  because  it  “considers  disability \nas  a  negative  factor  in  the  public  charge  assessment.”  Id.  at \n18a;  id.  at  43a-44a  (same).  And  the  court  stated  that  the  non- \ngovernmental  respondents  had  “a  likelihooodf   success  on  the  merits \nof  their  equal  protection  claim,”  because  the  court  could  find  “no \nreasonable  basis  for  Defendants’  sharp  departure  from  the  current \npublic  charge  determination  framework.”  Id.  at  44a—45a. \nRegarding  the  other  preliminary-injunction  factors,  the \ndistrict  court  concluded  that  the  injuries  respondents  anticipated \nas  a  result  of  the  Rule  --  the  “burden  of  providing  services  to \nthese  who  can  no  longer  obtain  federal  benefits  without \njeopardizing  their  [immigration]  status”  --  were  irreparable.\n11 \nApp.,  infra,  19a;  id.  at  45a-46a  (similar).  The  court  also  found \nthat  the  balance  of  equities  and  public  interest  weighed  in  favor \nof  preliminary  injunctions.  Id.  at  20a-21;  id.  at  46a-48a. \nFinally,  the  district  court  concluded  that  nationwide \ninjunctions  were  appropriate,  rejecting  the  government’s  argument \nthat  any  relief  should  be  narrower.  App.,  infra,  2la-24a;  id.  at \n48a-50a.  The  court  concluded  that  “[i]t  would  clearly  wreak  havoc \non  the  immigration  system  if  limited  injunctions  were  issued, \nresulting  in  different  public  charge  frameworks  spread  across  the \ncountry”  that  it  believed  “‘would  likely  create  administrative \nproblems  for  the  Defendants.’”  Id.  at  23a  (citation  omitted);  id. \nat  49a  (same).  Moreover,  in  the  court’s  view,  nationwide \ninjunctions  were  “necessary  to  accord  [respondents]  and  other \ninterested  parties  with  complete  redress,”  because  “an  individual \nshould  not  have  to  fear  that  moving  from  one  state  to  another  could \nresult  in  a  denial  of  adjustment  of  status.”  Id.  at  23a;  id.  at \n50a  (same).  Ina  footnote,  the  court  observed  that  “[t]he  standard \nfor  a  stay  under  5  U.S.C.  705  is  the  same  as  the  standard  for  a \npreliminary  injunction,”  and  “[a]ccordingly  *  *  *  grant[ed]  the \nstay[s]  for  the  same  reasons  it  grant[ed]  the  injunction[s].”  Id. \nat  24a  n.5;  id.  at  50a  n.4  (same). \n3.  The  government  filed  motions  to  stay  the  preliminary \ninjunctions  pending  appeal,  which  the  district  court  denied  on \nDecember  2,  2019.  App.,  infra,  52a-57a;  id.  at  58a-63a.\n12 \n4,  While  these  cases  were  pending,  the  government  also  was \nlitigating  challenges  to  the  Rule  filed  in  four  other  district \ncourts.  Two  of  those  district  courts  issued  nationwide  injunctions \nagainst  implementation  of  the  Rule.  See  Casa  de  Maryland,  Inc.  v. \n  \nTrump,  19-cv-2715  (D.  Md.);  Washington  v.  DHS,  No.  19-cv~-5210  (E.D. \n  \nWash.).  The  remaining  two  courts  issued  more  limited  injunctions \nin  the  three  cases  before  them.  See  Cook  County  v.  Wolf,  19-cv-   \n6334  (N.D.  Ill.)  (Illinois);  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco  v. \n  \nUSCIS,  No.  19-cv-4717  (N.D.  Cal.)  (plaintiff  counties);  California \nv.  DHS,  No.  19-cv-4975  (N.D.  Cal.)  (plaintiff  States  and  D.C.). \nOn  December  5,  2019,  the  Ninth  Circuit  granted  the \ngovernment’s  motions  for  stays  pending  appeal  in  the  three  cases \nfiled  in  that  circuit,  including  one  case  in  which  the  district \ncourt  had  entered  a  nationwide  injunction.  City  &  County  of  San \n  \nFrancisco  v.  USCIS,  944  F.3d  773.  In  a  lengthy  opinion  that \ncanvassed  the  history  of  the  public-charge  provision  and  related \nimmigration  laws,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  “DHS  has  shown  a \nstrong  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits,  that  it  will  suffer \nirreparable  harm,  and  that  the  balance  of  the  equities  and  public \ninterest  favor  a  stay.”  Id.  at  781.  In  particular,  it  held  that \nthe  statutory  term  “public  charge”  was  “ambiguous”  and  “capable  of \na  range  of  meanings,”  id.  at  792,  that  Congress  had  historically \ngranted  the  Executive  Branch  broad  discretion  to  define  the  term, \nand  that  the  Executive  Branch  had,  in  fact,  interpreted  the  term \n13 \ndifferently  over  the  previous  150  years,  id.  at  792-797.  The  court \nthen  held  that  the  Rule  was  “easily”  a  reasonable  interpretation \nof  the  statute,  particularly  in  light  of  Congress’s  express  intent \nthat  its  1996  welfare-reform  and  immigration-reform  legislation \nwould  help  ensure  that  “aliens  within  the  Nation’s  borders  not \ndepend  on  public  resources  to  meet  their  needs.”  Id.  at  799 \n(quoting  8  U.S.C.  1601(2)). \nOn  December  9,  2019,  the  Fourth  Circuit  likewise  granted  the \ngovernment’s  motion  for  a  stay  pending  appeal  of  the  nationwide \ninjunction  entered  by  a  district  court  in  Maryland.  Order,  Casa \nde  Maryland,  supra,  No.  19-2222, \n  \nOn  December  23,  2019,  the  Seventh  Circuit  denied,  without \nopinion,  the  government’s  motion  for  a  stay  pending  appeal  of  the \ninjunction,  applicable  only  in  Illinois,  entered  by  a  district \ncourt  in  Chicago.  Order,  Cook  County  v.  Wolf,  No.  19-3169.? \n5.  Notwithstanding  the  decisions  by  the  Fourth  and  Ninth \nCircuits,  the  nationwide  injunctions  entered  by  the  district  court \nhere  continued  to  prevent  the  government  from  implementing  the \nRule  anywhere  in  the  country.  On  January  8,  2020,  the  court  of \nappeals  issued  a  one-paragraph  order  denying  the  government’s \nmotions  to  stay  these  remaining  nationwide  injunctions.  App., \n  \n2  If  this  Court  grants  the  present  stay  application,  the \ngovernment  intends  to  ask  the  Seventh  Circuit  to  reconsider  its \ndenial  of  a  stay  pending  appeal.\n14 \ninfra,  65a.  The  court  noted  that  it  had  “set  an  expedited  briefing \nschedule  on  the  merits  of  the  government’s  appeals,  with  the  last \nbrief  due  on  February  14,”  and  oral  argument  to  “be  scheduled \npromptly  thereafter.”  Ibid. \nARGUMENT \nThe  government  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  grant  a \nstay  of  the  district  court’s  preliminary  injunctions  pending \ncompletion  of  further  proceedings  in  the  court  of  appeals  and,  if \nnecessary,  this  Court.  A  stay  pending  the  disposition  of  a \npetition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  is  appropriate  if  there  is  (1) \n“a  reasonable  probability  that  four  Justices  will  consider  the \nissue  sufficiently  meritorious  to  grant  certiorari”;  (2)  “a  fair \nprospect  that  a  majority  of  the  Court  will  conclude  that  the \ndecision  below  was  erroneous”;  and  (3)  “a  likelihood  that \nirreparable  harm  will  result  from  the  denial  of  a  stay.” f  Conkright \nv.  Frommert,  556  U.S.  1401,  1402  (2009)  (Ginsburg,  J.,  in  chambers) \n(orackets,  citation,  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).?%  All \nof  those  requirements  are  met  here. \n  \n3  Under  this  Court’s  Rule  23  and  the  All  Writs  Act,  28 \nU.S.C.  1651,  a  single  Justice  or  the  Court  has  authority  to  enter \na  stay  pending  proceedings  in  a  court  of  appeals.  See,  e.g.,  Trump \nv.  International  Refugee  Assistance  Project,  138  S.  Ct.  542  (2 017) . \n \n15 \nI.  THERE  IS  A  REASONABLE  PROBABILITY  THAT  THIS  COURT  WOULD  GRANT \nCERTIORARI  IF  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS  UPHOLDS  THE  DISTRICT \nCOURT’S  NATIONWIDE  INJUNCTIONS \nIf  the  court  of  appeals  ultimately  upholds  the  district \ncourt’s  nationwide  preliminary  injunctions  in  this  case,  there  1s \na  “reasonable  probability”  that  the  Court  will  grant  certiorari. \nConkright,  556  U.S.  at  1402  (citation  omitted).  That  is  true  for \nat  least  two  reasons. \nFirst,  sucha  decision  would  implicate  a  “conflict”  among  the \ncourts  of  appeals  “on  the  same  important  matter.”  Sup.  Ct.  R. \n10(a).  As  explained  more  fully  below,  the  Ninth  Circuit  concluded \nthat  “Congress  left  DHS  and  other  agencies  enforcing  our \nimmigration  laws  the  flexibility  to  adapt  the  definition  of  ‘public \ncharge’  as  necessary,”  and  held  that  the  definition  DHS  has  adopted \n“easily”  fits  within  the  range  of  permissible  definitions.  City \n&  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  797,  799,  The  Fourth \n  \nCircuit  likewise  held  that  DHS  is  likely  to  prevail.  See  Nken  v. \nHolder,  556  U.S.  418,  426  (2009)  (stay  pending  appeal  requires  the \napplicant  to  make  “a  strong  showing  that  he  is  likely  to  succeed \non  the  merits”).  To  uphold  the  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunctions  here,  however,  the  Second  Circuit  would  need  to  find \nprecisely  the  opposite  --  namely,  that  respondents  are  likely  to \nsucceed  in  showing  that  the  Rule  is  unlawful.  See  Winter  v. \nNatural  Res.  Def.  Council,  Inc.,  555  U.S.  7,  20  (2008).  It  is  at \n  \nleast  reasonably  probable  that  this  Court  would  grant  a  writ  of \ncertiorari  to  review  such  a  conflict,  especially  given  that  it\n16 \nconcerns  an  important  Rule  implicating  the  Executive  Branch’s \ndiscretion  in  making  inadmissibility  determinations. \nSecond,  a  decision  by  the  court  of  appeals  upholding  the \ninjunctions  here  would  also  squarely  present  the  question  of \nwhether  nationwide  injunctions  are  consistent  with  the  federal \ncourts’  targeted  authority  to  redress  the  concrete  injuries  shown \nby  the  parties  before  them  in  specific  cases  and  controversies. \nSee  Marbury  v.  Madison,  5  U.S.  (1  Cranch)  137,  170  (1803)  (“The \nprovince  of  the  court  is,  solely,  to  decide  on  the  rights  of \nindividuals,  not  to  enquire  how  the  executive,  or  executive \nofficers,  perform  duties  in  which  they  have  a  discretion.”).  In \nthe  past  three  years,  federal  courts  have  issued  dozens  of \nnationwide  or  even  global  injunctions,  blocking  a  wide  range  of \nsignificant  policies  involving  immigration,  national  security,  and \ndomestic  issues. \nThe  circumstances  here,  in  which  decisions  by  muitiple  courts \nof  appeals  have  been  rendered  effectively  meaningless  within  their \nown  territorial  jurisdictions  because  of  a  single  district  court’s \nnationwide  injunctions,  starkly  illustrate  the  problems  that  such \ninjunctions  pose.  If  the  Second  Circuit  were  to  uphold  the \nnationwide  scope  of  those  injunctions,  that  result  would  present \nan  additional  “important  federal  question”  warranting  a  writ  of \ncertiorari,  and  indeed  would  call  out  for  “an  exercise  of  this \nCourt’s  supervisory  power,”  Sup.  Ct.  R.  10(a)  and  10(c).  See  Trump\n17 \nv.  Hawaii,  138  S.  Ct.  2392,  2429  (2018)  (Thomas,  J.,  concurring) \n(“If  federal  courts  continue  to  issue  [universal  injunctions],  this \nCourt  is  duty-bound  to  adjudicate  their  authority  to  do  so.”). \nIt.  THERE  IS  AT  LEAST  A  FAIR  PROSPECT  THAT  THE  COURT  WOULD  VACATE \nTHE  INJUNCTIONS  IN  WHOLE  OR  IN  PART \n \nThere  is  also  at  least  a  “fair  prospect”  that  if  this  Court \ngranted  a  writ  of  certiorari,  it  would  vacate  the  injunctions  in \nwhole  or  in  part.  Conkright,  556  U.S.  at  1402.  That  is  true  both \nbecause  respondents’  claims  are  unlikely  to  succeed,  and  because \nthe  nationwide  scope  of  the  preliminary  injunctions  is  not  an \nappropriate  means  of  redressing  respondents’  alleged  injuries. \nA.  As  a  threshold  matter,  respondents  are  unlikely  to \nsucceed  because  they  have  not  adequately  alleged  a  cognizable \ninjury  within  the  relevant  zone  of  interests. \nThe  district  court  concluded  otherwise  with  respect  to  the \ngovernmental  respondents  because  the  Rule  will  “decrease \nenrollment  in  benefits  programs,”  which  it  thought  might  reduce \nrevenue  at  their  hospitals,  increase  consumption  of  emergency  and \nother  services  for  which  they  sometimes  pay,  and  cause  adverse \n“ripple  effects”  in  their  economies.  App.,  infra,  7a-8a  (citation \nomitted).  But  the  Rule  exempts  Medicaid  coverage  for  emergency \nservices,  and  other  reductions  in  benefit-program  enrollment  are \nlikely  to  save  money  for  the  governmental  respondents,  who  fund \nsuch  programs.  See  84  Fed.  Reg.  at  41,363,  41,300-41,301.  Their \nclaims  of  harm  thus  depend  on  an  “attenuated  chain  of \n18 \npossibilities,”  not  the  “certainly  impending”  injury  Article  III \nrequires.  Clapper  v.  Amnesty  Int’l  USA,  568  U.S.  398,  410  (2013). \n  \nThe  district  court  was  likewise  incorrect  in  concluding  that \nthe  non-governmental  respondents  have  organizational  standing \nbecause,  if  the  Rule  goes  into  effect,  they  will  “devote   \nsubstantial  resources  to  mitigate  its  potentially  harmful \neffects.”  App.,  infra,  33a.  This  Court  has  held  that  merely \nshowing  that  governmental  action  would  be  a  “setback  to  [an] \norganization’s  abstract  social  interests”  is  insufficient  to \nestablish  standing,  Havens  Realty  Corp.  v.  Coleman,  455  U.S.  363, \n  \n379  (1982);  that  insufficiency  is  not  cured  by  an  organization’s \ninsistence  that  it  would  seek  to  “mitigate”  the  “effects”  of  that \nsetback,  App.,  infra,  33a.  Cf.  Clapper,  568  U.S.  at  418  (finding \n“self-inflicted  injuries”  insufficient  to  establish  standing). \nIn  any  event,  even  if  respondents’  claims  of  harm  were \nsufficient  to  satisfy  Article  III,  their  asserted  interest  in \nmaintaining  enrollment  in  public-benefits  programs  is \n“inconsistent”  with  the  purpose  of  the  public-charge \ninadmissibility  ground  --  namely,  to  reduce  the  use  of  public \nbenefits  --  and  thus  outside  the  relevant  zone  of  interests. \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish  Band  of  Pottawatomi  Indians  v.  Patchak, \n  \n567  U.S.  209,  225  (2012). \nB.  As  the  Ninth  Circuit  recognized,  challenges  to  the  Rule \nare  also  unlikely  to  succeed  because  they  lack  merit.  The  INA’s \n19 \ntext  and  structure  make  clear  that  receipt  of  public  benefits, \nincluding  non-cash  benefits  that  are  not  intended  to  serve  as  a \nprimary  means  of  support,  is  an  important  consideration  in \ndetermining  whether  an  alien  is  inadmissible  on  public-charge \ngrounds.  The  Rule  thus  gives  the  statute  its  most  natural  meaning \nby  specifying  that  an  alien  who  depends  on  public  assistance  for \n \nnecessities  such  as  food  and  shelter  for  extended  periods  may \nqualify  as  a  “public  charge”  even  if  that  assistance  is  not \nprovided  through  cash  benefits  or  does  not  provide  the  alien’s \nsole  or  primary  means  of  support.  That  interpretation  also  follows \nCongress’s  direction  --  in  legislation  adopted  contemporaneously \nwith  the  current  public-charge  provision  --  that  it  should  be  the \nofficial  “immigration  policy  of  the  United  States”  to  ensure  that \n“availability  of  public  benefits  not  constitute  an  incentive  for \nimmigration  to  the  United  States.”  8  U.S.C.  1601(2).  At  the  very \nleast,  the  Rule  represents  a  reasonable  and  lawful  exercise  of  the \nsubstantial  discretion  Congress  has  long  vested  in  the  Executive \nBranch  to  make  public-charge  inadmissibility  determinations. \n1.  The  INA  renders  inadmissible  “[a]ny  alien  who  *  *  *  in \nthe  opinion  of  the  [Secretary]  *  *  *  is  likely  at  any  time  to \nbecome  a  public  charge,”  based  “at  a  minimum”  on  an  assessment  of \nspecified  factors  such  as  “health,”  “financial  status,”  and \n“education  and  skills.”  8  U.S.C.  1182{a) (4) (A)  and  (B).  As  the \nNinth  Circuit  explained,  that  statutory  text  provides  four \n20 \nimportant  indicators  that  Congress  intended  to  give  DHS \nsubstantial  discretion  over  public-charge  inadmissibility \ndeterminations. \nFirst,  Congress’s  reference  to  the  “opinion”  of  the  relevant \nExecutive  Branch  official  “is  the  language  of  discretion,”  under \nwhich  “the  officials  are  given  broad  leeway.”  »  City  &  County  of   \n  \nSan  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  791;  see  Thor  Power  Tool  Co.  v. \n     \nCommissioner,  439  U.S.  522,  540  (1979)  (recognizing  that  where  a \nstatute  specifies  that  a  determination  be  made  “in  the  opinion  of” \nan  agency  official,  it  confers  “broad  discretion”  on  the  official \nto  make  that  determination).  Second,  “the  critical  term  ‘public \ncharge’  is  not  a  term  of  art.  It  is  not  self-defining.  *  *  *  In \na  word,  the  phrase  is  ‘ambiguous’  under  Chevron;  it  is  capable  of \na  range  of  meanings.”  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at \n  \n792.  Third,  although  the  statute  provides  a  non-exhaustive  list \nof  factors  that  the  Executive  Branch  official  must  take  into \naccount  “‘at  a  minimum,’”  it  “expressly  did  not  limit  the \ndiscretion  of  officials  to  those  factors.”  Ibid.  Fourth,  Congress \nexpressly  “granted  DHS  the  power  to  adopt  regulations  to  enforce \nthe  provisions  of  the  INA,”  indicating  that  “Congress  intended \nthat  DHS  would  resolve  any  ambiguities  in  the  INA.”  Ibid.  (citing \nEncino  Motorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S.  Ct.  2117,  2125  (2016)). \n  \nRelated  statutory  provisions  show  that  Congress’  also \nrecognized  that  receipt  of  public  benefits,  including  non-cash \n21 \nbenefits,  could  often  be  relevant  to  determining  whether  an  alien \nis  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.  One  such  set  of  provisions \n‘requires  that  many  aliens  seeking  admission  or  adjustment  of  status \nmust  submit  “affidavit[s]  of  support”  executed  by  sponsors  --  such \nas  a  family  member  or  employer  --  to  avoid  a  public-charge \ninadmissibility  determination.  See  8  U.S.C.  1182(a) (4)  (C)  and \n(D).  Aliens  who  fail  to  obtain  the  required  affidavit  are  treated \nby  operation  of  law  as  inadmissible  on  public-charge  grounds, \nregardless  of  their  individual  circumstances.  }  8  U.S.C. \n1182 (a)  (4).  Moreover,  Congress  specified  that  the  sponsor  must \nagree  “to  maintain  the  sponsored  alien  at  an  annual  income  that  is \nnot  less  than  125  percent  of  the  Federal  poverty  line,”  8  U.S.C. \n1183a((1)a ()A) ,  and  Congress  granted  federal  and  state  governments \nthe  right  to  seek  reimbursement  from  the  sponsor  for  “any  means- \ntested  public  benefit”  the  government  provides  to  the  alien, \n8  U.S.C.  1183a((1)b ()A) ,  including  non-cash  benefits.  Taken \ntogether,  those  provisions  mean  that  to  avoid  being  found \ninadmissible  on  public-charge  grounds,  a  covered  alien  must  have \na  sponsor  who  is  willing  to  reimburse  the  government  for  any  means- \ntested  public  benefits  the  alien  receives  while  the  sponsorship \nobligation  is  in  effect  (even  if  those  benefits  are  only  minimal). \nCongress  itself  thus  provided  that  the  mere  possibility  that  an \nalien  might  obtain  unreimbursed,  means-tested  public  benefits  in \nthe  future  would  in  some  circumstances  be  sufficient  to  render\n22 \nthat  alien  likely  to  become  a  public  charge,  regardless  of  the \nalien’s  other  circumstances. \nLikewise  supporting  the  Rule’s  consideration  of  non-cash \nbenefits  are  INA  provisions  stating  that  when  making  public-charge \ninadmissibility  determinations  for  certain  aliens  who  have  “been \nbattered  or  subjected  to  extreme  cruelty  in  the  United  States,” \n8  U.S.C.  1641((1)c ()A) ,  DHS  “shall  not  consider  any  benefits  the \nalien  may  have  received,”  including  various  non-cash  benefits, \n8  U.S.C.  1182(s);  see  8  U.S.C.  1611-1613  (specifying  the  public \nbenefits  for  which  battered  aliens  and  other  gualified  aliens  are \neligible,  such  as  “public  or  assisted  housing,”  “food  assistance,” \nand  “disability”  benefits).  The  inclusion  of  that  express \nprohibition  for  a  narrow  class  of  aliens  presupposes  that  DHS \ngenerally  can  consider  the  past  receipt  of  non-cash  benefits  such \nas  public  housing  and  food  assistance  in  making  public~charge \ninadmissibility  determinations  for  other  aliens.  Cf.  Husted  v.  A. \nPhilip  Randolph  Inst.,  138  S.  Ct.  1833,  1844  (2018)  (“There  is  no \n  \nreason  to  create  an  exception  to  a  prohibition  unless  the \nprohibition  would  otherwise  forbid  what  the  exception  allows.”). \nSurrounding  statutory  provisions  also  leave  no  doubt  about \nwhy  Congress  would  have  intended  the  Executive  Branch  to  take  such \npublic  benefits  into  account  in  making  public-charge \ninadmissibility  determinations.  In  legislation  passed \ncontemporaneously  with  the  1996  enactment  of  the  current  public—\n23 \ncharge  provision,  Congress  stressed  the  government’s  “compelling” \ninterest  in  ensuring  “that  aliens  be  self-reliant  in  accordance \nwith  national  immigration  policy.”  8  U.S.C.  1601(5).  Congress \nemphasized  that  “[s]jelf-sufficiency  has  been  a  basic  principle  of \nUnited  States  immigration  law  since  this  country’s  earliest \nimmigration  statutes,”  8  U.S.C.  1601(1),  and  it  “continues  to  be \nthe  immigration  policy  of  the  United  States  that  *  *  *  (A)  aliens \nwithin  the  Nation’s  borders  not  depend  on  public  resources  to  meet \ntheir  needs,  *  *  *  and  {B)  the  availability  of  public  benefits \nnot  constitute  an  incentive  for  immigration  to  the  United  States,” \n8  U.S.C.  1601(2).  Congress  equated  a  lack  of  “self-sufficiency” \nwith  the  receipt  of  “public  benefits”  by  aliens,  8  U.S.C.  1601(3), \nwhich  it  defined  broadly  to  include  any  “welfare,  health, \ndisability,  public  or  assisted  housing  *  *  *  or  any  other  similar \nbenefit,”  8  U.S.C.  16(c)1 (1)1 (B ). \n2.  Respondents  have  no  persuasive  answer  to  the  INA’s  text \nand  structure,  which  make  the  receipt  of  public  benefits,  including \nnon-cash  benefits,  an  important  aspect  of  “public  charge” \ndeterminations.  Respondents  argue  instead  that  the  Rule’s \ninterpretation  is  inconsistent  with  historical  usage  of  the  phrase \n“public  charge,”  which  they  contend  refers  exclusively  and \nunambiguously  to  aliens  who  are  “‘likely  to  become  primarily  and \npermanently  dependent  on  the  government  for  subsistence.’”  App., \ninfra,  12a  (citation  omitted);  see  id.  at  37a.\n24 \nAs  the  Ninth  Circuit  explained,  historical  evidence  does  not \nsupport  that  contention.  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d \n  \nat  792-798.  Instead,  the  common  thread  through  Congress’s \nenactment  of  various  public-charge  provisions  has  been  an  intent \nto  preserve  Executive  Branch  flexibility  to  “adapt”  public-charge \nprovisions  to  “change[s]  over  time”  in  “the  way  in  which  federal, \nstate,  and  local  governments  have  cared  for  our  most  vulnerable \npopulations.”  Id.  at  792.  In  the  late  nineteenth  and  early \ntwentieth  century,  for  example,  those  who  were  not  self-sufficient \nwere  often  “housed  in  a  government  or  charitable  institution,  such \nas  an  almshouse,  asylum,  or  penitentiary.”  Id.  at  793.  In  that \ncontext,  therefore,  it  made  sense  that  “the  likelihood  of  being \nhoused  in  a  state  institution”  would  be  “considered  *  *  *  to  be \nthe  primary  factor  in  the  public-charge  analysis.”  Id.  at  794. \nAs  the  “movement  towards  social  welfare”  broadened  the \navailability  of  other  types  of  more  limited  public  benefits  over \nthe  twentieth  century,  however,  the  open-ended  phrase  allowed  the \nExecutive  Branch  to  take  into  account  those  changes.  Id.  at  795. \nFor  example,  both  the  1933  and  1951  editions  of  Black’s  Law \nDictionary  indicated  that  the  term  “public  charge,”  “{a]s  used  in” \nthe  1917  Immigration  Act,  meant  simply  “one  who  produces  a  money \ncharge  upon,  or  an  expense  to,  the  public  for  support  and  care” \n--  without  reference  to  the  type  of  expense.  Black’s  Law \nDictionary  (3d  ed.  1933);  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (4th  ed.  1951). \n \n25 \nA  1929  treatise  did  the  same.  See  Arthur  Cook  et  al.,  Immigration \nLaws  of  the  United  States  §  285  (1929)  (noting  that  “public  charge” \n  \nmeant  a  person  who  required  “any  maintenance,  or  financial \nassistance,  rendered  from  public  funds,  or  funds  secured  by \ntaxation”).  And  as  early  as  1948,  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals \n \n(Board)  held  that  an  alien  may  qualify  as  a  “public  charge”  for \ndeportability  purposes  if  the  alien  (or  a  sponsor  or  relative) \nfails  to  repay  a  public  benefit  upon  demand  by  a  government  agency \nentitled  to  repayment,  even  where  the  benefits  in  question  are \n“clothing,  transportation,  and  other  incidental  expenses.”  [In re. \nB-,  3  I.  &  N.  Dec.  323,  326-327  (B.I.A.  1948);  see  City  &  County \nof  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  795  (discussing  In  re  B-).? \n  \nCongress’s  intent  to  preserve  the  Executive  Branch’s \nflexibility  has  not  just  been  implicit.  In  an  extensive  report \nthat  served  as  a  foundation  for  the  original  enactment  of  the  INA, \nthe  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  recognized  that  “[d]ecisions  of  the \ncourts  have  given  varied  definitions  of  the  phrase  ‘likely  to \n  \n4  The  Board  concluded  that  the  alien  in  In  re  B-  was  not \ndeportable  as  a  public  charge  based  on  the  care  she  received  at  a \nstate  mental  hospital  because  Illinois  law  did  not  allow  the  State \nto  demand  repayment  for  those  expenses.  3  I.  &  N.  Dec.  at  327. \nBut  the  Board  indicated  that  she  would  have  been  deportable  as  a \npublic  charge  if  her  relatives  had  failed  to  pay  the  cost  of  her \n“clothing,  transportation,  and  other  incidental  expenses,”  because \nTllinois  law  made  her  “legally  liable”  for  repayment  of  those  non- \ncash  benefits.  Ibid. \n26 \nbecome  a  public  charge,’”  and  that  “‘different  consuls,  even  in \nclose  proximity  with  one  another,  have  enforced  [public-charge] \nstandards  highly  inconsistent  with  one  another.’”  S.  Rep.  No. \n1515,  81st  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  347,  349  (1950).  Rather  than  adopt \none  of  those  specific  standards,  the  Committee  indicated  that \nbecause  “the  elements  constituting  likelihooodf   becoming  a  public \ncharge  are  varied,  there  should  be  no  attempt  to  define  the  term \nin  the  law.”  Id.  at  349. \nConsistent  with  that  recommended  approach,  neither  the  INA \nnor  any  subsequent  congressional  enactment  has  provided  a  more \nspecific  definition  of  “public  charge.”  Instead,  Congress  has \n“described  various  factors  to  be  considered  ‘at  a  minimum,’  without \neven  defining  those  factors,”  making  it  “apparent  that  Congress \nleft  DHS  and  other  agencies  enforcing  our  immigration  laws  the \nflexibility  to  adapt  the  definition  of  ‘public  charge’  as \nnecessary.”  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  797. \n  \nThe  district  court  drew  a  different  conclusion  from  a  pair  of \nnever-enacted  legislative  proposals  in  1996  and  2013.  See  App., \ninfra,  13a-14a.  Those  proposals  would  have  resulted  in  statutory \ndefinitions  of  “public  charge”  that,  like  the  Rule,  contained \nspecific  public-benefit  thresholds  --  though  they  would  have \ncovered  a  significantly  larger  number  of  aliens.>°  The  court \n  \n5  The  1996  proposal  would  have  included  aliens  who \nreceived  benefits  during  twelve  months  over  a  seven-year,  rather \nthan  three-year,  period.  See  H.R.  Rep.  No.  828,  104th  Cong.,  2d\n27 \nconciuded  from  those  respective  non-enactments  that  Congress  must \nhave  wanted  to  “endorse[]”  a  narrower  understanding  of  “public \ncharge.”  Id.  at  13a.  But  the  far  better  inference  in  light  of \nthe  history  is  that  Congress  simply  wanted  to  preserve  Executive \nBranch  discretion  by  leaving  the  statutory  term  undefined  --  not \n \nthat  it  wanted  to  constrain  Executive  Branch  discretion  by  silently \n“endors[ing],”  App.,  infra,  13a,  a  narrower  definition  that  would \nthen  be  fixed  for  all  time.  Indeed,  the  legislative  history  of \nthe  1996  proposal  indicates  that  it  was  dropped  at  the  last  minute \nin  part  because  the  President  objected  to  the  proposal’s  rigid \ndefinition  of  “public  charge”  and  threatened  to  veto  the  bill. \nSee  H.R.  Rep.  No.  828,  104th  Cong.,  2d  Sess,  241  (1996);  142  Cong. \nRec.  26,666,  26,679-26,680  (Sept.  30,  1996). \nke  ke  & \nGiven  Congress’s  direction  that  “the  availability  of  public \nbenefits”  should  not  be  “an  incentive  for  immigration  to  the  United \nStates,”  8  U.S.C.  1601(2),  and  its  longstanding  history  of \npreserving  flexibility  in  the  meaning  of  “public  charge,”  the  Rule \n“easily”  qualifies  as  a  reasonable  interpretation  of  the  statute, \nCity  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d  at  799.  Nothing  in  the \n  \nstatute  precludes  the  agency  from  considering  non-cash  benefits  or \n  \nSess.,  138,  240-241.  The  2013  proposal  would  have  included  aliens \nwho  received  any  covered  public  benefits.  S.  Rep.  No.  40,  113th \nCong.,  lst  Sess.,  42,  63. \n28 \npublic  benefits  that  do  not  provide  an  alien’s  sole  or  primary \nmeans  of  support,  and  the  Rule’s  use  of  the  12-months  in  36-months \nstandard  establishes  a  sensible  and  administrable  framework  for \nmaking  individualized  public-charge  determinations.  Respondents \nare  unlikely  to  succeed  in  arguing  otherwise. \n3.  Respondents’  arguments  that  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  and \ncapricious  are  similarly  unlikely  to  succeed.  For  many  of  the \nsame  reasons  discussed  above,  the  Rule  ~-  including  its  definition \nof  “public  charge”  and  its  framework  for  evaluating  which  aliens \nare,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Executive  Branch,  likely  to  become \npublic  charges  --  is  well  “within  the  bounds  of  reasoned \ndecisionmaking.”  Baltimore  Gas  &  Elec.  Co.  v.  Natural  Res.  Def. \n  \n  \nCouncil,  Inc.,  462  U.S.  87,  105  (1983). \nAs  discussed,  the  Rule  differs  from  the  agency’s  previous \ninterpretation  of  “public  charge”  in  that  it  requires  adjudicators \nto  consider  specified  non-cash  benefits  (not  only  cash  benefits) \nin  determining  whether  an  alien  is  likely  to  become  a  public \ncharge,  and  defines  the  term  “public  charge”  to  include  those  who \nreceive  such  benefits  for  more  than  12  months  in  the  aggregate \nwithin  any  36-month  period. \nThe  agency  “forthrightly  acknowledged”  its  change  in  approach \nin  the  rulemaking,  and  provided  “good  reasons  for  the  new  policy.” \nFCC  v.  Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  515,  517 \n  \n(2009).  It  explained  that  the  Rule  is  designed  “to  better  ensure\n29 \nthat  applicants  for  admission  to  the  United  States  and  applicants \nfor  adjustment  of  status  to  lawful  permanent  resident  who  are \nsubject  to  the  public  charge  ground  of  inadmissibility  are  self- \n \nsufficient  --  i.e.,  do  not  depend  on  public  resources  to  meet  their \nneeds,  but  rather  rely  on  their  own  capabilities  and  the  resources \nof  their  family,  sponsor,  and  private  organizations.”  83  Fed. \nReg.  at  51,122;  84  Fed.  Reg.  at  41,317-41,319.  Because  Congress \nitself  viewed  the  receipt  of  any  public  benefits,  including  non- \ncash  benefits,  as  indicative  of  a  lack  of  self-sufficiency,  the \nagency  reasoned  that  the  Rule,  which  it  promulgated  through  notice- \nand-comment  rulemaking,  is  more  consistent  with  congressional \nintent  than  the  1999  agency  field  guidance  and  abandoned  attempt \nat  rulemaking.  83  Fed.  Reg.  at  51,123. \nThe  agency  also  explained,  at  length,  its  reasons  for \nincluding  in  the  Rule  the  various  factors  it  identified  as  weighing \non  the  question  whether  an  alien  is  likely  to  become  a  public \ncharge.  See  83  Fed.  Reg.  51,178-51,207.  The  factors  implemented \nCongress’s  mandate  that  the  agency  consider,  at  a  minimum,  each \nalien’s  “age”;  “health”;  “family  status”;  “assets,  resources,  and \nfinancial  status”;  and  “education  and  skilis”  in  making  a  “public \ncharge”  determination.  See  id.  at  51,178;  8  U.S.C.  11(a)8 (42) (B ). \nThe  agency  described  in  detail  how  each  of  the  various  factors \nbore  positively  or  negatively  on  the  determination  whether  an  alien \nis  likely  to  receive  public  benefits  over  the  designated  threshold \n30 \nin  the  future,  while  retaining  the  “totality  of  the  circumstances” \napproach  that  allows  each  adjudicating  officer  to  make  a  decision \nappropriate  to  each  alien’s  individual  circumstances. \nAs  the  Ninth  Circuit  recognized,  those  explanations  were \nclearly  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  deferential  arbitrary-and- \n \ncapricious  standard.  See  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco,  944  F.3d \n  \nat  800-805.  For  purposes  of  applying  that  standard,  it  is \nimmaterial  whether  DHS  demonstrated  to  the  district  court’s \n“satisfaction  that  the  reasons  for  the  new  policy  are  better  than \nthe  reasons  for  the  old  one;  it  suffices  that  the  new  policy  is \npermissible  under  the  statute,  that  there  are  good  reasons  for  it, \nand  that  the  agency  believes  it  to  be  better.’”  Id.  at  801  (quoting \nFox  Television,  556  U.S.  at  515).  DHS  made  all  of  those  showings \n  \nhere.  Id.  at  805.  Respondents’  arbitrary-and-capricious  claim  is \ntherefore  unlikely  to  succeed. \nAY  Respondents  are  also  unlikely  to  succeed  on  their \nRehabilitation  Act  and  equal-protection  claims. \nThe  Rehabilitation  Act  provides  that  “{n]o  otherwise \nqualified  individual  *  *  *  shall,  solely  by  reason  of  her  or  his \ndisability,”  be  denied  the  benefits  of  a  federal  program.  29 \nU.S.C.  794(a).  “(Bly  its  terms,”  the  statute  “does  not  compel \n[governmental]  institutions  to  disregard  the  disabilities  of” \nindividuals;  instead,  it  merely  requires  them  not  to  exclude  a \nperson  who  is  “‘otherwise  qualified’”  “‘solely  by  reason  of  his \n31 \n[disability].’”  Southeastern  Cmty.  Coll.  v.  Davis,  442  U.S.  397, \n  \n405  (1979).  The  Rule  complies  with  that  requirement,  taking \nrelevant  medical  conditions  into  account  as  one  factor  among  many \nin  a  totality-of-the-circumstances  analysis  of  whether  the  alien   \nis  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.  Moreover,  the  Rule  is \nrequired  to  account  for  those  conditions  under  the  INA,  which \ndirects  that  public-charge  determinations  “shail  *  *  *  consider” \nthe  alien’s  “health”  as  a  factor,  8  U.S.C.  1182(a)({B)4 ()1) .  See \nRadzanower  v.  Touche  Ross  &  Co.,  426  U.S.  148,  153  (1976)  (A \n  \n“specific  statute  will  not  be  controlled  or  nullified  by  a  general \none.”)  (citation  omitted).  Accordingly,  even  the  district  court \nin  California  --  which  enjoined  the  Rule  on  other  grounds  -- \nrecognized  there  is  no  “serious  question[]”  the  Rule  complies  with \nthe  Rehabilitation  Act.  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco  v.  USCIS, \n  \nNo.  19-cv-4717,  2019  WL  5100718,  at  *30  (N.D.  Cal.  Oct.  11,  2019). \nThe  equal-protection  claims  are  similarly  meritless.  The \ndistrict  court  suggested  that  “‘minimizing  the  incentive  of  aliens \nto  immigrate  to  the  United  States  due  to  the  availability  of  public \nbenefits’”  does  not  provide  a  “reasonable  basis”  for  adopting  the \nRule,  such  that  the  Rule  might  not  survive  rational-basis  review. \nApp.,  infra,  45a  (citation  omitted).  But  as  explained,  see  supra, \npp.  22-23,  that  objective  is  set  out  by  statute  as  the  official \npolicy  of  the  United  States.  See  8  U.S.C.  1601.  Attempting  to \npursue  it  more  effectively  cannot  possibly  be  irrational. \n32 \nC.  Finally,  there  is  also  a  “fair  prospect,”  Conkright,  556 \nU.S.  at  1402,  that  any  decision  of  the  court  of  appeals  upholding \nthe  district  court’s  nationwide  injunctions  would  be  reversed  on \nthe  additional  ground  that  those  injunctions  are  overly  broad. \nNationwide  injunctions  like  the  ones  here  transgress  both  Article \nIII  and  longstanding  equitable  principles  by  affording  relief  that   \nis  not  necessary  to  redress  any  cognizable,  irreparable  injury  to \nthe  parties  in  the  case.  They  also  frustrate  the  development  of \nthe  law,  while  obviating  the  requirements  for  and  protections  of \nclass-action  litigation.  This  case  exemplifies  those  harms:  the \nnationwide  injunctions  here  have  in  effect  permitted  a  single \ndistrict  judge  to  veto  the  contrary  decisions  of  two  different \ncourts  of  appeals,  even  within  their  respective  jurisdictions. \n1.  a.  To  the  extent  that  respondents  have  Article  III \nstanding  at  all,  but  see  pp.  17-18,  supra,  that  standing  cannot \nsupport  injunctive  relief  any  further  than  what  is  needed  to \nredress  an  actual  or  imminent  injury-in-fact  to  respondents \nthemselves.  “[S]tanding  is  not  dispensed  in  gross,”  and  ww a \nplaintiff  must  demonstrate  standing  *  *  *  for  each  form  of  relief \nthat  is  sought.”  Town  of  Chester  v.  Laroe  Estates,  Inc., \n     \n137  S.  Ct.  1645,  1650  (2017)  (citations  omitted).  The  remedy \nsought  thus  “must  of  course  be  limited  to  the  inadequacy  that \nproduced  the  injury  in  fact  that  the  plaintiff  has  established.” \nGill  v.  Whitford,  138  S.  Ct.  1916,  1931  (2018)  (quoting  Lewis  v. \n33 \nCasey,  518  U.S.  343,  357  (1996)).  “The  actual-injury  requirement \nwould  hardly  serve  [its]  purpose  ...  of  preventing  courts  from \nundertaking  tasks  assigned  to  the  political  branches,  if  once  a \nplaintiff  demonstrated  harm  from  one  particular  inadequacy  in \ngovernment  administration,  the  court  were  authorized  to  remedy  all \ninadequacies  in  that  administration.”  DaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v. \n  \nCuno,  547  U.S.  332,  353  (2006)  (brackets  and  citation  omitted). \nApplying  that  principle,  this  Court  has  invalidated \ninjunctions  that  afforded  relief  that  was  not  shown  to  be  necessary \nto  prevent  cognizable  injury  to  the  plaintiff  himself.  For \nexample,  in  Lewis,  the  Court  held  that  an  injunction  directed  at \ncertain  prison  practices  was  overbroad,  in  violation  of  Article \nIII,  because  it  enjoined  practices  that  had  not  been  shown  to \ninjure  any  plaintiff.  518  U.S.-at  358.  The  injunction  “mandated \nsweeping  changes”  in  various  aspects  of  prison  administration \ndesigned  to  improve  prisoners’  access  to  legal  services,  including \nlibrary  hours,  lockdown  procedures,  access  to  research  facilities \nand  training,  and  “‘direct  assistance’”  from  lawyers  and  legal \nsupport  staff  for  “illiterate  and  non-English-speaking  inmates.” \nId.  at  347-348  (citation  omitted).  This  Court  held  that  the \nplaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  seek,  and  the  district  court  thus \nlacked  authority  to  grant,  such  broad  relief.  Id.  at  358-360. \nThe  district  court  had  “found  actual  injury  on  the  part  of  only \none  named  plaintiff,”  who  claimed  that  a  legal  action  he  had  filed \n \n34 \nwas  dismissed  with  prejudice  as  a  result  of  his  illiteracy  and  who \nsought  assistance  in  filing  legal  claims.  Id.  at  358.  This  Court \ntherefore  held  that  “[it]  c[ould])  eliminate  from  the  proper  scope \nof  th[e]  injunction  provisions  directed  at”  the  other  claimed \ninadequacies  that  allegedly  harmed  “the  inmate  population  at \nlarge.”  Ibid.  “If  inadequacies  of  th[at]  character  exist[ed],” \nthe  Court  explained,  “they  ha[d]  not  been  found  to  have  harmed  any \nplaintiff  in  this  lawsuit,  and  hence  were  not  the  proper  object  of \nthis  District  Court’s  remediation.”  Ibid. \nb.  This  Court  also  has  recognized  and  applied  the  corollary \nprinciple  that,  where  a  plaintiff  faces  actual  or  imminent  injury \nat  the  outset  of  a  suit  but  that  injury  is  subsequently  redressed \nor  otherwise  becomes  moot,  the  plaintiff  no  longer  can  seek \ninjunctive  relief  to  redress  alleged  harms  to  anyone  else.  For \nexample,  in  Summers  v.  Earth  Island  Institute,  555  U.S.  488  (2009), \n    \nthe  Court  held  that  a  plaintiff  lacked  standing  to  seek  to  enjoin \ncertain  Forest  Service  regulations  after  the  parties  had  resolved \nthe  controversy  regarding  the  application  of  those  regulations  to \nthe  specific  project  that  had  caused  the  plaintiff’s  own  claimed \ninjury,  id.  at  494-497.  The  plaintiff’s  “injury  in  fact  with \nregard  to  that  project,”  the  Court  held,  “ha[d]  been  remedied,” \nand  so  he  lacked  standing  to  maintain  his  challenge  to  the \nregulations.  Id.  at  494.  The  Court  expressly  rejected  a  contrary \nrule  that,  “when  a  plaintiff  has  sued  to  challenge  the  lawfulness\n35 \nof  certain  action  or  threatened  action  but  has  settled  that  suit, \nhe  retains  standing  to  challenge  the  basis  for  that  action”  --  in \nBarth  Island,  “the  regulation  in  the  abstract”  --  “apart  from  any \nconcrete  application  that  threatens  imminent  harm  to  his \ninterests.”  Ibid.  Such  a  rule  would  “fly  in  the  face  of  Article \nTII’s  injury-in-fact  requirement.”  Ibid.;  see  Alvarez  v.  Smith, \n558  U.S.  87,  92-93  (2009)  (holding  that  plaintiffs  could  no  longer \nseek  declaratory  or  injunctive  relief  against  a  state  policy  once \ntheir  “dispute  [wa]s  no  longer  embedded  in  any  actual  controversy \nabout  the  plaintiffs’  particular  legal  rights”). \nc.  Those  principles  have  clear  application  here.  As  in \nLewis,  applications  of  the  Rule  to  an  alien  seeking  admission  at \nthe  southern  border  in  San  Diego,  or  to  an  alien  seeking  adjustment \nof  status  in  South  Carolina,  would  not  “harm[]  any  plaintiff  in \nthis  lawsuit,  and  hence  were  not  the  proper  object  of  this  District \nCourt’s  remediation.”  518  U.S.  at  358.  And  as  in  Earth  Island \nand  Alvarez,  entry  of  an  injunction  protecting  respondents  from \nconcrete  injury  while  the  case  proceeds  would  eliminate  any \n“threat[{]”  of  “imminent  harm  to  [their]  interests,”  Earth  Island, \n555  U.S.  at  494,  such  that  broader  relief  would  not  be  “embedded \nin  any  actual  controversy  about  the  plaintiffs’  particular  legal \nrights,”  Alvarez,  558  U.S.  93.  Accordingly,  if  any  relief  were \nappropriate  at  all,  it  would  be  properly  limited  to  only  those \napplications  of  the  Rule  that  harm  respondents  in  concrete  and\n36 \nparticularized  ways.  At  most,  that  would  encompass  applications \nto  aliens  whom  respondents  identify  as  receiving  services  in  the \nJurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. \nNeither  of  the  grounds  offered  by  the  district  court  to \njustify  the  unlimited  scope  of  its  injunctions  requires  a  different \nresult.  First,  the  district  court  thought  that  “an  individual \nshould  not  have  to  fear  that  moving  from  one  state  to  another  could \nresult  in  a  denial  of  adjustment  of  status.”  App.,  infra,  23a. \nBut  there  are  no  “individual”  plaintiffs  in  this  case,  let  alone \na  certified  class  of  such  individuals.  The  district  court’s  focus \nhere  on  how  the  Rule  would  affect  such  non-party  aliens  was  no \ndifferent  from  the  reliance  on  the  interests  of  non-party  prisoners \nthat  this  Court  rejected  in  Lewis.  See  518  U.S.  at  358. \nSecond,  the  district  court  believed  that  applying  “different \npublic  charge  frameworks  *  *  *  across  the  country  *  *  *  ‘would \nlikely  create  administrative  problems  for  the  Defendants.’  uf  App., \ninfra,  23a  (citation  omitted).  But  the  appropriate  parties  to \nmake  that  determination  are  the  defendants,  not  the  plaintiffs  or \nthe  court.  Any  “administrative  problems  for  the  Defendants”  are \nnot  Article  III  injuries  of  the  plaintiffs.  And  in  supplanting \nthe  Executive  Branch’s  determinations  about  whether  it  would  be \npreferable  to  suspend  the  Rule’s  effect  in  just  three  States  or \nall  fifty,  the  court  “undert [ook]  tasks  assigned  to  the  political\n37 \nbranches”  in  just  the  way  that  Article  III  is  intended  to  prevent. \nDaimlerChrysler  Corp.,  547  U.S.  at  353  (citation  omitted). \n  \n2.  Independent  of  Article  III,  the  nationwide  preliminary \ninjunctions  here  violate  fundamental  rules  of  equity  by  granting \nrelief  broader  than  necessary  to  prevent  irreparable  harm  to \nrespondents.  This  Court  has  Long  recognized  that  injunctive  relief \nmust  “be  no  more  burdensome  to  the  defendant  than  necessary  to \nprovide  complete  relief  to  the  plaintiffs.”  Madsen  v.  Women’s \nHealth  Ctr.,  Inc.,  512  U.S.  753,  765  (1994)  (citation  omitted). \n  \nSection  705  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (APA),  5  U.S.C. \n701  et  seg.,  on  which  the  district  court  also  relied,  likewise \nlimits  relief  to  that  which  is  “necessary  to  prevent  irreparable \ninjury,”  5  U.S.C.  705.  See  App.,  infra,  24a  n.5  (noting  that \n“[t]he  standard  for  a  stay  under  5  U.S.C.  §  705  is  the  same  as  the \nstandard  for  a  preliminary  injunction”  and  “grant[ing]  the  stay \nfor  the  same  reasons  it  grants  the  injunction”);  see  also  5  U.S.C. \n703  (providing  that  absent  a  “special  statutory  review \nproceeding,”  “[t]he  form  of  proceeding  for  judicial  review”  under \nthe  APA  is  “any  applicable  form  of  legal  action,  including  actions \nfor  *  *  *  writs  of  prohibitory  or  mandatory  injunction”). \nWhen,  as  here,  no  class  has  been  certified,  a  plaintiff  must \nshow  that  the  requested  relief  is  necessary  to  redress  the \nplaintiff’s  own  irreparable  harm;  the  plaintiff  cannot  seek \ninjunctive  relief  in  order  to  prevent  harm  to  others.  See  Monsanto\n38 \nCo.  v.  Geertson  Seed  Farms,  561  U.S.  139,  163  (2010)  (plaintiffs \n  \n“d{id]  not  represent  a  class,  so  they  could  not  seek  to  enjoin  [an \nagency  order}  on  the  ground  that  it  might  cause  harm  to  other \nparties”).  Even  where  a  class  has  been  certified,  relief  is \nlimited  to  what  is  necessary  to  redress  irreparable  injury  to \nmembers  of  that  class.  See  Lewis,  518  U.S.  at  359-360,  360  n.?7. \nHistory  confirms  that  the  injunctions  in  this  case  violate \n“traditional  principles  of  equity  jurisdiction.”  Grupo  Mexicano \n  \nde  Desarrollo,  S.A.  v.  Alliance  Bond  Fund,  Inc.,  527  U.S.  308,  319 \n     \n(1999)  (citation  omitted).  Absent-party  injunctions  were  not \n“traditionally  accorded  by  courts  of  equity.”  Ibid.;  Samuel  L. \nBray,  Multiple  Chancellors:  Reforming  the  National  Injunction,  131 \n  \nHarv.  L.  Rev.  417,  424-445  (2017)  (detailing  historical  practice). \nThus,  in  the  late  19th  century,  this  Court  rejected  injunctive \nrelief  that  barred  enforcement  of  a  law  to  nonparties.  Bray  429 \n(discussing  Scott  v.  Donald,  165  U.S.  58  (1897)).  As  a \nconsequence,  for  example,  in  the  1930s  courts  issued  more  than \n1600  injunctions  against  enforcement  of  a  single  federal  statute. \nBray  434.  The  nationwide  injunctions  in  this  case  are  thus \ninconsistent  with  “longstanding  limits  on  equitable  relief.” \nHawaii,  138  S.  Ct.  at  2425  (Thomas,  J.,  concurring). \n3.  Nationwide  injunctions  like  this  one  also  disserve  this \nCourt’s  interest  in  allowing  an  issue  to  percolate  in  the  lower \ncourts.  See  United  States  v.  Mendoza,  464  U.S.  154,  160  (1984).\n39 \nWhile  other  suits  may  proceed  even  after  a  nationwide  injunction \nis  issued,  once  that  injunction  is  affirmed  on  appeal,  other \nplaintiffs  may  strategically  drop  their  suits  and  rely  on  the  first \nnationwide  injunction  --  forcing  this  Court  to  either  accept \nplenary  review  of  the  first  case  to  tee  up  the  issue,  or  risk  never \nhaving  the  issue  come  before  it  again.  Permitting  nationwide \ninjunctions  also  undercuts  the  primary  mechanism  Congress  has \nauthorized  to  permit  broader  relief:  class  actions.  It  enables \nall  potential  claimants  to  benefit  from  nationwide  injunctive \nrelief  by  prevailinign   a  single  district  court,  without  satisfying \nthe  prerequisites  of  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23,  while \ndenying  the  government  the  corresponding  benefit  of  a  definitive \nresolution  as  to  all  potential  claimants  if  it  prevails  instead. \nIn  other  words,  if  multiple  plaintiffs  file  multiple  suits \nagainst  a  governmental  policy,  they  potentially  need  to  win  only \na  single  suit  for  all  of  them  to  prevail,  while  the  government \nmust  run  the  table  to  enforce  its  policy  anywhere.  That  point  is \nvividly  on  display  here,  where  the  government  has  successfully \ndefended  the  Rule  before  two  courts  of  appeals  and  yet  remains \nunable  to  put  it  into  effect  anywhere  in  the  country  because  of  a \nSingle  district  judge’s  nationwide  injunctions. \nLII.  THERE  IS  A  LIKELIHOOD  THAT  IRREPARABLE  HARM  WILL  RESULT  FROM \nTHE  DENIAL  OF  A  STAY \nFinally,  “irreparable  harm  will  result  from  the  denial  of  a \nstay.”  Conkright,  556  U.S.  at  1402  (brackets  and  citation\n40 \nomitted).  As  the  Ninth  Circuit  recognized,  “the  preliminary \ninjunctions  will,”  unless  stayed,  “force  DHS  to  grant  status  to \nthose  not  legally  entitled  to  it.”  City  &  County  of  San  Francisco, \n  \n944  F.3d  at  806.  DHS  “currently  has  no  practical  means  of \nrevisiting  public-charge  determinations  once  made,”  making  that   \nharm  effectively  irreparable.  Id.  at  805.  And  given  the \n“compelling”  interest  that  Congress  has  attached  to  ensuring  self- \nsufficiency  among  aliens  admitted  to  the  United  States,  8  U.S.C. \n1601(5),  that  harm  substantially  outweighs  whatever  limited  and \nspeculative  fiscal  injuries  respondents  claim  they  will  suffer \nduring  the  pendency  of  this  litigation. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  Court  should  stay  the  district \n—court’s  injunctions  in  their  entirety  pending  the  completion  of \nfurther  proceedings  in  the  court  of  appeals  and,  if  necessary, \nthis  Court.  At  the  least,  the  Court  should  stay  the  nationwide \neffect  of  the  injunctions  such  that  they  apply  only  to  aliens  whom \nthe  governmental  and  non-governmental  respondents  identify  as \nreceiving  services  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate. \nRespectfully  submitted. \nNOEL  J.

(App. 1.) In reliance on the stay order, the United \nStates Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented the Public Charge Rule, altering its \nprior interpretation of “public charge” as well as the test for evaluating whether an immigrant is \nlikely to become a public charge under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A), and thus be ineligible for a green \ncard. The Rule took effect on February 24, 2020. \nSince that time, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a devastating global \npandemic, afflicting at least half a million people in the United States with a potentially lethal \nillness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid and ongoing spread of COVID-19 is \ncausing a nationwide public-health crisis and wreaking havoc on the economy. The President has \ndeclared a state of national emergency. And state and local authorities—including plaintiffs here, \nthe States of New York, Connecticut, and Vermont, and the City of New York—have also declared \nstates of emergency and are undertaking extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and \nprotect the health and well-being of our residents. But the Public Charge Rule is hindering those \nefforts by deterring immigrants from accessing healthcare and public benefits that are essential \ntools for protecting the public at large by limiting the spread and severity of COVID-19 and \npromoting our nation’s recovery from the economic crisis that the disease has caused.  \nAccordingly, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court temporarily lift or modify its stay \nto halt implementation of the Public Charge Rule during the national emergency concerning \nCOVID-19 declared by the President. In the alternative, plaintiffs request that the Court clarify \n\nthat its stay does not preclude the district court here from considering whether the new circum-\nstances caused by the novel coronavirus warrant temporarily halting implementation of the Rule.1  \nSuch narrow and temporary relief from the stay is warranted because the Rule is now \ncausing additional irreparable harms to the public—citizens and noncitizens alike—that were not \npresent when the Court initially considered defendants’ motion for a stay. By deterring immigrants \nfrom accessing publicly funded healthcare, including programs that would enable immigrants to \nobtain testing and treatment for COVID-19, the Rule makes it more likely that immigrants will \nsuffer serious illness if infected and spread the virus inadvertently to others—risks that are \nheightened because immigrants make up a large proportion of the essential workers who continue \nto interact with the public. The Rule also deters access to public benefits, including nutrition \nbenefits, that are critical for both immigrants and the country as a whole to weather the economic \ncrisis triggered by COVID-19. These irreparable harms have tipped the balance of the equities \ndecidedly against maintaining the stay during the national emergency concerning COVID-19.  \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs here are authorized to state that the plaintiffs in the companion case, Make the \nRoad New York v. Cuccinelli, support this motion, including the alternative relief sought. The \nMake the Road New York plaintiffs were parties to the stay proceedings in this Court and are \nsubject to the Court’s stay order. Because the two cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in \nthe district court, see Order, New York v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 19-cv-7777 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. \n14, 2020), ECF 142, any relief afforded to plaintiffs here should also apply in that case. \n  2 \n\nSTATEMENT \nA.   Prior Litigation \nIn August 2019, DHS issued its Public Charge Rule, which modified its criteria for \ndetermining inadmissibility on public charge grounds. 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019). Under \nthe Rule, DHS officials must now deem an immigrant to be a “public charge” if the immigrant is \nlikely to receive any amount of certain “public benefits,” including supplemental benefits such as \nMedicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and Section 8 housing \nassistance, during “more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period” during the \nimmigrant’s life. Id. at 41,501. In an earlier notice of proposed rulemaking, DHS had acknow-\nledged that this regulatory change could lead immigrants who are otherwise eligible for certain \npublic benefits to disenroll or forgo enrollment in those programs, and that such withdrawal or \navoidance “could lead to . . . [i]ncreased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among \nmembers of the U.S. citizen population who are not vaccinated.” 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,270 (Oct. \n10, 2018).  \nOn October 11, 2019, the district court issued two orders that preliminarily enjoined the \nenforcement of the Public Charge Rule on a nationwide basis, and postponed the Rule’s effective \ndate pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705. On January 27, 2020, this Court issued a stay of the district court’s \norders,  thereby  allowing  the  Public  Charge  Rule  to  take  effect.  The  stay  applies  pending \ndisposition of defendants’ expedited appeal from the district court’s orders in the Second Circuit \nand disposition of defendants’ petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought.2 (App. \n                                                 \n2 On March 2, 2020, the Second Circuit heard oral argument on defendants’ expedited \nappeal. That appeal remains pending.    \n  3 \n\n1.) Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan would have denied the application for a stay. \n(App. 1.) \nOn February 21, 2020, this Court issued a similar stay of a preliminary injunction issued \nby the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that had prevented \nenforcement of the Public Charge Rule in Illinois alone.3 Wolf v. Cook Cty., Ill., 140 S. Ct. 681, \n681 (2019). Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan would have denied the application \nfor a stay. Id.  \nIn reliance on this Court’s stay orders, defendants began enforcing the Public Charge Rule \nnationwide on February 24, 2020.   \n  The Nationwide COVID-19 Crisis \nAfter the Court issued its stays, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began sweeping \nacross the United States. The spread of COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that \ntriggers  this  illness  has  become  a  global  pandemic  that  has  thrown  the  country  into  an \nunprecedented crisis with devastating consequences for public health and the economy. The novel \ncoronavirus can cause severe and life-threatening respiratory illness marked by fever, coughing, \nand difficulty breathing. See Center for Disease Control & Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19): Frequently Asked Questions (internet) (last updated Apr. 11, 2020) (see What are \nthe symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?).4 COVID-19 is already spreading \nquickly in communities throughout the country, with cases reported in all fifty States. See Center \n                                                 \n3 On February 26, 2020, the Seventh Circuit heard oral argument on defendants’ appeal in \nthat court. The Seventh Circuit appeal remains pending.    \n4 At https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html. \n  4 \n\nfor Disease Control & Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Situation Summary \n(Mar. 26, 2020) (internet) (last updated Apr. 7, 2020).5  \nCOVID-19 has already exacted a tremendous toll on the nation, and the pace of its spread \ncontinues to increase rapidly. In the United States, 525,704 individuals have confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19, and at least 20,486 people have died from the disease. Center for Disease Control & \nPrevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases in U.S. (internet) (last updated Apr. \n12, 2020).6 Plaintiffs and their residents have been particularly hard hit. In New York, which has \nbecome the current epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, 188,694 people have confirmed \ncases of COVID-19, and at least 9,384 people have died from the disease. See New York Dep’t of \nHealth, NYSDOH COVID-19 Tracker (internet) (last updated Apr. 12, 2020);7 New York Dep’t \nHealth, Fatalities by County (internet) (last updated April 12, 2020).8 In New York City alone, \nthere are currently more than 104,410 confirmed positive cases and more than 6,182 confirmed \ndeaths. See New York City Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, COVID-19: Data: Cases, \nHospitalizations and Deaths (internet) (last updated Apr. 12, 2020).9 Connecticut and Vermont \nhave also been experiencing rapidly increasing rates of infection, with 12,035 confirmed COVID-\n19 cases in Connecticut and 727 confirmed cases in Vermont to date.

See, e.g., Corona Virus: Michigan Data (internet) (last updated Apr. 12, 2020) \n(24,638 confirmed infections and 1,487 confirmed deaths in Michigan);12 Florida Dep’t of Health, \nDivision of Disease Control and Health Protection, Florida’s COVID-19 Data and Surveillance \nDashboard (internet) (last updated Apr. 12, 2020) (19,347 confirmed infections and 452 confirmed \ndeaths in Florida).13 These figures likely vastly underrepresent the number of actual infections and \nrelated deaths for a number of reasons, including that many people who likely have the virus have \nnot been tested for it. See Jacqueline Howard, US coronavirus death count likely an underestimate. \nHere’s why, CNN (Apr. 6, 2020) (internet).14 \nOn March 13, 2020, the President declared a state of national emergency concerning the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, invoking his authority under the National Emergencies Act. Proclamation \nNo. 9994, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 13, 2020); see generally 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. The \nPresident declared that “[t]he spread of COVID-19 within our Nation’s communities threatens to \nstrain our Nation’s healthcare systems.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 15,337. He directed “hospitals and medical \nfacilities throughout the country,” many of which are operated by plaintiffs or located within \n                                                 \n10 At https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/CTDPHCOVID19summary \n4122020.pdf?la=en. \n11 At https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-\nvermont. \n12 At https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html. \n13 At https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429. \n14 At https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/health/us-coronavirus-death-count-cdc-explainer/ \nindex.html. \n  6 \n\nplaintiffs’ jurisdictions, “to assess their preparedness posture and be prepared to surge capacity \nand capability” to address COVID-19. Id. He also declared that because additional measures “are \nneeded to successfully contain and combat the virus in the United States,” he was authorizing the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration to temporarily \nwaive or modify certain requirements of various public-health and medical-insurance related \nstatutes “throughout the duration of the public health emergency declared in response to the \nCOVID-19 outbreak.” Id.  \nThe governors of each of the plaintiff States, as well as the mayor of plaintiff New York \nCity, have each declared public-health emergencies in their respective jurisdictions based on the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.15 See New York Exec. Order No. 202, 9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 8.202 (2020); \nConnecticut  Office  of  the  Governor,  Declaration  of  Public  Health  and  Civil  Preparedness \nEmergencies (Mar. 10, 2020);16 Vermont Exec. Order No. 01-20 (2020).17 In each of plaintiffs’ \njurisdictions, state officials and agencies have also been taking increasingly drastic measures to \nslow the spread of the novel coronavirus and provide testing and treatment for residents who are \nalready infected. For example, state officials have required all nonessential employees to work \nfrom home, closed schools, and issued orders to increase hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 \npatients.18 \n                                                 \n15 New York declared a state of emergency on March 7, 2020; Connecticut, on March 10, \n2020; Vermont, on March 13, 2020. \n16 At https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/News/20200310-declaration-of-\ncivil-preparedness-and-public-health-emergency.pdf?la=en. \n17 At https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/EO%2001-20%20 \nDeclaration%20of%20State%20of%20Emergency%20in%20Response%20to%20COVID-\n19%20and%20National%20Guard%20Call-Out.pdf. \n18 See, e.g., New York Exec.

Order No. 202.8, 9 N.Y.C.R.R. § 8.202.8 (2020) (ordering \n  7 \n\n  The Importance of Public Benefits in Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis \nExperts in infectious disease control and public health have warned that everyone should \nbe minimizing the spread of the virus to the greatest extent possible. See Center for Disease Control \n& Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): How to Protect Yourself and Others \n(internet) (last updated Apr. 8, 2020).19 Testing for the novel coronavirus and medical treatment \nfor COVID-19 are critically important to slowing infection rates, preserving hospital capacity and \nmedical equipment, and saving lives. (App. 37, 54-63.) If individuals are deterred from testing and \nthus do not know that they are infected, they are more likely to inadvertently spread the virus to \nother people—who will then spread the virus to still more people. (App. 55-56, 61, 63, 114.) See \nWashington State Dep’t of Health, Testing for COVID-19 (internet) (last visited Apr. 12, 2020) \n(testing allows public-health officials to “keep people with COVID-19 and their contacts away \nfrom others to prevent spread of the virus”).20 And if individuals suffering from COVID-19 delay \nobtaining proper medical care, they are more likely to spread the virus, experience serious illness \nand need intensive care in a hospital, and potentially die from the disease. (App. 56, 61, 63, 160-\n161, 225.)  \nIndividuals who lack health insurance are much less likely to obtain necessary treatment \nfor COVID-19 because of the prohibitive costs of medical care and hospital stays. (App. 54-55, \n58-61, 175.) A recent report from a nonprofit organization that analyzes healthcare costs estimated \n                                                 \nall nonessential workers in New York to work from home); New York Exec.

FAIR \nHealth, COVID-19: The Projected Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the US \nHealthcare System 2, 8, 13, 16 (Mar. 25, 2020). And the cost of treatment will be higher for patients \nwho suffer more severe symptoms or require longer hospital stays. See Center for Disease Control \n& Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Interim Clinical Guidance for Manage-\nment of Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (internet) (last updated Apr. \n6, 2020) (median time in intensive care unit for severely ill COVID-19 patient ranges from ten to \ntwelve days, and median length of hospitalization among survivors ranges from ten to thirteen \ndays).21  \nMany immigrants residing in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions and in other jurisdictions are highly \nvulnerable to COVID-19 because they work in industries that have been deemed “essential” and \nthus  continue  to  operate  during  the  crisis.  For  example,  executive  orders  in  New  York, \nConnecticut, and Vermont that direct residents to work from home do not apply to workers in \nessential sectors such as healthcare, grocery stores, food and retail delivery, building maintenance, \nfarms and agriculture, and sanitation. See New York Exec. Order No. 202.8, supra; Connecticut \nExec. Order No. 7H § 1 (2020) (internet);22 Vermont Exec. Order No. 01-20, add. 6 (2020) \n(internet).23 Because immigrants compose a significant proportion of the workers in these front-\nline industries, they must often interact with others or spend time in high-risk environments—such \nas  providing  healthcare  in  hospitals,  caring  for  the  aging  in  nursing  homes,  cleaning  and \n                                                 \n21 At https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-\npatients.html. \n22 At https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Office-of-the-Governor/Executive-Orders/Lamont-\nExecutive-Orders/Executive-Order-No-7H.pdf?la=en. \n23 At https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%206%20 \nTO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf. \n  9 \n\ndisinfecting public spaces, and preparing or delivering food and supplies to other residents who \nare required to stay at home. (See App. 126-127, 225.) These workers are as a result more likely \nto be exposed to the virus, and, without adequate testing and treatment, these workers, if infected, \nare more likely to suffer worse health outcomes and to spread the virus to others inadvertently. \n(See App. 55-56, 61, 63, 114; see also App. 225 (immigrant workers in Colorado meatpacking \nplants and dairies are essential workers at high risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19).)  \nIn addition to the urgent public-health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered a \nsevere economic crisis, with millions of workers losing significant income or their employment, \nand thereby needing to turn to supplemental benefit programs like Medicaid and SNAP in order to \nweather this economic crisis. (See App. 63-65.) Approximately sixteen million individuals applied \nfor unemployment benefits in the three-week period from March 19 to April 4. Patricia Cohen & \nTiffany Hsu, ‘Sudden Black Hole’ for the Economy With Millions More Unemployed, N.Y Times \n(Apr. 10, 2020) (internet).24 And the number of individuals seeking unemployment benefits in \nplaintiffs’ jurisdictions has steeply increased due to the pandemic. In New York, for example, the \nnumber of new unemployment claims rose from 14,272 in the week ending March 21, 2020, to \n79,999 in the week ending March 28, 2020—an increase of 460%. News Release, United States \nDep’t of Labor, Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims 7 (Apr. 2, 2020) (internet).25 In that same \nweek, the rate of unemployment-insurance claims in Connecticut rose by approximately 620% \ncompared to the prior week, and in Vermont the rate increased by approximately 450%. Id. \nImmigrant  workers,  particularly  in  the  hospitality  and  service  industries,  have  been \n                                                 \n24 At https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-\nnumbers-coronavirus.html. \n25 At https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/040220.pdf.  \n  10\n\ndisproportionately impacted by layoffs and furloughs. (App. 119 (immigrants in New York have \nlost jobs in restaurants and as domestic workers); App. 202-203 (immigrants in Illinois have lost \njobs as domestic workers, personal care aides, and nannies).)   \nWorkers who lose their jobs because of the pandemic are likely to turn temporarily to \nsupplemental benefit programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, until they can get back on their \nfeet. (See App. 63-65.) For example, many workers who lose their jobs and their employer-\nsponsored health insurance because of the pandemic are likely to need Medicaid coverage until \nthey can find another job. (See App. 64-65.) And SNAP benefits respond rapidly to changing \neconomic conditions by allowing newly eligible individuals to obtain benefits and allowing \nexisting participants to receive higher amounts of benefits if their incomes decrease. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgriculture, Building a Healthy America: A Profile of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram,  at  1,  3  (Apr.  2012).  Programs  like  SNAP  will  also  be  particularly  important  to \nimmigrants and their family members, many of whom are ineligible for unemployment insurance \nbenefits or certain COVID-19 related benefits recently enacted by Congress. See Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, § 6428(d), 134 Stat. 281, 335 (2020).  \n  The Harms Imposed by the Public Charge Rule and the COVID-19-Related \nGuidance Issued by the Department of Homeland Security \nAs DHS has acknowledged, e.g., 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,270, and the record evidence here \nconfirms, the Public Charge Rule’s expansion of the grounds for deeming immigrants inadmissible \nas a public charge has already deterred many immigrants from using supplemental public benefits, \nincluding Medicaid and SNAP benefits, or led them to disenroll from programs that provide such \nbenefits. Since the Public Charge Rule came into effect following this Court’s stay orders, \nincreasing numbers of immigrants have begun forbearing from Medicaid coverage and other \n  11\n\npublicly funded healthcare benefits based on concerns that using such benefits will render them a \n“public charge” and thus jeopardize their ability to obtain legal permanent resident (LPR) status \nand, eventually, citizenship. (App. 194-195, 220-222.) Immigrants have also increasingly been \ndeclining  to  use  SNAP  benefits,  as  well  as  other  nutrition  programs,  such  as  the  Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), that are not implicated \nin the public-charge analysis.26 (App. 139-140, 178-179, 194-196.) And the Public Charge Rule’s \ndeterrent effects have not been limited to the LPR applicants or public-benefit programs that are \ndirectly subject to the Rule, since substantial fear and confusion, along with the complicated nature \nof many benefits programs, have led immigrants and their family members to avoid state-funded \nhealth insurance programs, reduce their use of medical services, and forbear from using other \npublic benefits not covered by the Rule. (App. 145-146, 194-195, 220-222.)  \nThe Rule’s impacts have become particularly acute as the COVID-19 crisis has escalated. \nSee infra, at 18-24. As a result, on March 6, the Attorneys General of the plaintiff States, fifteen \nother state Attorneys General, and over fifty other elected officials sent a letter to DHS requesting \nthat the agency temporarily halt implementation of the Public Charge Rule given the harms to \npublic health from implementing the Rule during the COVID-19 crisis. (App. 40-43; see also App. \n226-229 (letter from New York City agencies to DHS).) DHS did not respond.  \nOn March 13, DHS posted an alert on the website of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS). The alert stated that DHS officials conducting public-charge determinations \n                                                 \n26  Agencies  and  nonprofit  organizations  that  work  with  immigrants  experienced  a \nsubstantial increase in inquiries about the Public Charge Rule after the Rule took effect in February \n2020. (App. 116 (during February 2020, calls to New York City’s immigration-related telephone \nhotline “increased to 2,973, a 57% increase from the monthly average in 2019,” and the “number \nof those calls that related to the Rule also increased”); App. 171 (health educator received “more \nquestions  about  public  charge”  during  February  and  March  than  she  had  ever  previously \nreceived).) \n  12\n\nwould not “consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine \nbecomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination \n. . . even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or more public benefits” targeted by the \nRule, such as federally funded Medicaid. (App. 44.) However, the alert also stated that the Rule \nwill still require DHS officials to treat as a negative factor an applicant’s receipt of public benefits, \nincluding federally funded Medicaid, even when such benefits “may be used to obtain testing or \ntreatment for COVID-19.” (App. 44.) Thus, under the alert, an LPR applicant who obtains or \nmaintains Medicaid coverage that helps him access COVID-19 testing or treatment will still \nreceive an automatic negative factor in the public-charge analysis based on his Medicaid coverage, \neven if his COVID-19 test or treatment will not itself be considered. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422 \n(DHS will consider “any application, approval, or certification for, or receipt of, public benefits as \na negative factor”).  \nDHS’s alert appears to leave in place other aspects of the Rule during the COVID-19 crisis, \neven though these aspects of the Rule deter immigrants from using supplemental benefits that will \nhelp plaintiffs’ residents and the country recover from the current economic crisis. Thus, an \napplicant who applies for SNAP benefits because a COVID-19 public-health order forced him out \nof his job will continue to receive a negative factor in the public-charge inquiry. See 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,422. At most, the alert states that an applicant may inform DHS if “disease prevention \nmethods” such as social distancing prevent him from working or attending school during the \noutbreak, and DHS officials will consider such information to the extent it is “relevant and \ncredible.”27 (App. 44.)   \n                                                 \n27 After DHS posted the alert on its website, the Attorneys General of the plaintiff States \nand fifteen other state Attorneys General sent DHS another letter explaining that the alert did not \n  13\n\nARGUMENT \nTHE COURT SHOULD TEMPORARILY LIFT OR MODIFY ITS STAY \nDURING THE NATIONAL PUBLIC-HEALTH EMERGENCY CREATED \nBY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC \nPursuant to Rules 21 and 23 of the Rules of this Court; the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651; \nand § 705 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 705, plaintiffs request that the Court \ntemporarily lift or modify its stay to halt implementation of the Rule until the end of the national \nemergency declared by the President on March 13 concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. See \nProclamation No. 9994, supra. Such targeted relief is warranted despite this Court’s prior ruling \non petitioners’ stay application because the unprecedented public-health and economic crisis \nfacing the country has dramatically shifted the balance of equities in allowing defendants to \nenforce the Public Charge Rule while the Second Circuit considers defendants’ appeal.  \nAs explained further below, the Rule’s deterrent effect on immigrants’ access to healthcare \nand other public benefits for which they are indisputably eligible is impeding efforts to stop the \nspread of the coronavirus, preserve scarce hospital capacity and medical supplies, and protect the \nlives of everyone in our communities—citizens and noncitizens alike. In particular, the Rule is \ndeterring many immigrants and their family members, including those who are U.S. citizens, from \nseeking testing or treatment for COVID-19, obtaining publicly funded health insurance, and using \nother supplemental benefits such as SNAP. Without proper testing and medical care, immigrants \nare more likely to suffer serious illness or death from COVID-19, and more likely to spread the \nnovel coronavirus to others inadvertently. And immigrants who delay needed medical care, \nwhether for COVID-19 or other serious conditions, are more likely to use hospitals, emergency \n                                                 \naddress the harms imposed by the Public Charge Rule during the pandemic. (App. 48-51.) DHS \ndid not respond to this letter. \n  14\n\nrooms, and publicly funded clinics when they fall ill, thereby taxing public-health systems that are \nalready under intense strain.  \nThe record that this Court considered in issuing a stay in these proceedings did not and \ncould not include these newly apparent harms. In light of these new circumstances, the Court \nshould temporarily lift or modify its stay to halt implementation of the Public Charge Rule during \nthe national emergency concerning COVID-19. Alternatively, this Court should clarify that its stay \ndoes not preclude the lower court from considering whether the new circumstances presented by \nthe COVID-19 crisis warrant a narrow and time-limited delay of the Public Charge Rule.  \n  Plaintiffs Seek Temporary Relief from the Stay Tailored to \nthe National COVID-19 Crisis. \nPlaintiffs are not seeking wholesale reconsideration of this Court’s previous decision to \nstay the district court’s preliminary injunction and § 705 orders. Rather, the drastically changed \ncircumstances presented by the COVID-19 crisis provide new grounds for this Court to consider \nwhether the balance of the equities continues to support a stay of the lower court’s orders. To \nrespond to these circumstances, this Court can either temporarily lift its stay during the national \nemergency, thereby allowing the district court’s orders of preliminary relief to take effect; or \ntemporarily postpone the effective date of the Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705 until the national \nemergency ends.28 Pursuant to the National Emergencies Act, the COVID-19 national emergency \nwill end when the President issues a proclamation terminating the emergency, Congress enacts \n                                                 \n28 Section 705 provides that “[o]n such conditions as may be required and to the extent \nnecessary to prevent irreparable injury, the reviewing court, including the court to which a case \nmay be taken on appeal from or on application for certiorari or other writ to a reviewing court, \nmay issue all necessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an agency action \nor to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n  15\n\ninto law a joint resolution terminating the emergency, or the President declines to renew the \nemergency at any annual expiration of the declaration, whichever is earlier. See 50 U.S.C. § 1622.  \nIn the alternative, plaintiffs request that the Court clarify that its stay order does not \npreclude the lower court from considering whether the new circumstances arising out of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic warrant temporary relief halting implementation of the Public Charge Rule. \nCf. Cities Serv. Gas Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 487 U.S. 1245 (1988) (modifying stay and remanding \nto district court to consider whether to approve parties’ proposed settlement). In making such a \ndetermination, the lower court could consider evidence and issue factual findings about, inter alia, \nthe proper duration and scope of any temporary relief. And the district court’s findings and \ndeterminations would then be subject to appellate review.      \nPlaintiffs are seeking temporary relief directly from this Court rather than from the district \ncourt or Second Circuit as an initial matter because of the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand substantial doubt as to whether the lower courts could provide any meaningful relief given the \nCourt’s stay. See Heckler v. Turner, 468 U.S. 1305 (1984) (Rehnquist, J, in chambers) (issuing \nstay where grant of certiorari made it doubtful that lower courts “had the authority to modify the \ninjunction”). The Court’s stay applies until both the Second Circuit resolves defendants’ appeal \nand this Court resolves a petition for certiorari, if any such petition is timely filed. Accordingly, \nthe district court’s orders will remain stayed, and the Rule will remain in effect, even if the Second \nCircuit affirms the district court’s decision to postpone the effective date of the Rule during this \nlitigation. This Court is thus the appropriate forum to either modify the stay or clarify that the stay \ndoes not preclude the district court from considering whether the current COVID-19 crisis warrants \ntemporary, tailored relief from the Public Charge Rule.  \n  16\n\n  The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Drastically Changed the Balance of the Equities \nAgainst  Enforcing  the  Public  Charge  Rule  During  the  Current  National \nEmergency.  \nThe appropriateness of a stay pending appeal is “an exercise of discretion and judgment” \nthat depends primarily on the “equities of a given case.” Trump v. International Refugee Assistance \nProject, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017). In the course of exercising such discretion, a court “‘may \nmold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.’” Id. (quoting 11A Charles A. Wright, \nArthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2947 (3d ed. Aug. 2019 \nupdate)  (Westlaw)).  And  a  court  may  lift  or  modify  a  previously  granted  stay  when  new \ncircumstances arise that significantly alter the balance of the harms to the public or the parties. \nSee, e.g., King v. Smith, 88 S. Ct. 842, 843 (1968) (Black, J., in chambers) (vacating previously \nissued stay where subsequent events meant that stay would further harm public welfare and the \nplaintiffs);  Orloff  v.  Willoughby,  72  S.  Ct.  998,  998-99  (1952)  (Douglas,  J.,  in  chambers) \n(modifying previously issued stay). Indeed, the Court always retains authority to alter an ongoing \nequitable order “if satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changing \ncircumstances into an instrument of wrong.” United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114-15 \n(1932); see Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 437 (1976) (“[S]ound judicial \ndiscretion may call for the modification of the terms of an injunctive decree if the circumstances, \nwhether of law or fact, obtaining at the time of its issuance have changed, or new ones have since \narisen.” (quotation marks omitted)). \nThe Court should exercise its discretion to temporarily lift or modify the stay here. The \ncatastrophic  COVID-19  pandemic  has  drastically  altered  the  nature  and  magnitude  of  the \nirreparable harms faced by plaintiffs, their residents, and the nation due to the Public Charge Rule \n  17\n\nand tipped the balance of the equities decisively against maintaining the stay while the national \nCOVID-19 emergency continues. \n  The Public Charge Rule is impeding efforts to mitigate \nthe spread of the virus.  \nThe Public Charge Rule is irreparably harming public health in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions and \nthroughout the country during the unprecedented public-health disaster caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic. By deterring immigrants and their family members from obtaining publicly funded \nhealth insurance and medical care, the Rule is undermining efforts to slow the spread of the virus—\nputting everyone at higher risk of infection. A temporary lifting or modification of the stay is thus \nwarranted to prevent these dangerous public-health harms.  \nAs DHS itself has acknowledged, the Public Charge Rule’s expanded criteria for finding \ninadmissibility will deter immigrants from enrolling (or maintaining enrollment for) themselves \nand their family members in Medicaid, due to the understandable fear that even just applying for \nMedicaid will be deemed a negative factor in any future public-charge analysis. See 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,422. Widespread fear and confusion about the Rule are also driving many immigrants to \nforgo any publicly funded health coverage for fear that using such supplemental public benefits \nwill jeopardize their ability to obtain LPR status and, eventually, citizenship. (App. 60, 171-173, \n217, 220-222.) Indeed, since the Rule took effect, medical personnel, state and local officials, and \nstaff at nonprofit organizations have encountered many immigrants who have refused to enroll in \nMedicaid or other publicly funded healthcare coverage based on concerns that receiving such \ncoverage will increase the risk of being deemed a “public charge” under the Rule. (See, e.g., App. \n187 (patients at health clinics in Virginia refusing to participate in financial screening needed for \ncare because screening involves Medicaid application); App. 220-221.)    \n  18\n\nSuch avoidance of Medicaid and other publicly funded healthcare programs will prevent \nimmigrants  from  receiving  testing  for  the  novel  coronavirus  or  treatment  for  COVID-19, \nmaterially impeding public-health officials’ efforts to stem the current crisis. Without Medicaid or \nother health insurance, the costs of COVID-19 treatment are prohibitively high for most patients—\nparticularly if they develop severe symptoms necessitating hospitalization. For example, recent \nanalyses of healthcare costs estimate that a six-day hospital stay for COVID-19 treatment will cost \napproximately $73,300 (see supra, at 8-9)—far more than the annual income of many low- and \nmoderate-income Americans. (See App. 55 (cost of treatment for one early COVID-19 patient for \nless than a week of treatment was $34,927.43).) And since the pandemic began, doctors and others \nworking on the front lines of the crisis have seen many immigrants avoid COVID-19 testing and \ntreatment altogether, even if they might be able to obtain publicly funded care, due to the \nsubstantial fear generated by the Public Charge Rule. (App. 113, 120, 160-161, 167-168, 187, \n224.)  \nThese effects of the Public Charge Rule on COVID-19 testing and treatment are not \nhypothetical or speculative. For example:  \n  A physician in Connecticut has spoken with patients who had symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19, but were afraid to obtain COVID-19 testing or \nseek treatment due to concerns about the Public Charge Rule and fears that \nthey could not afford to pay for treatment. (App. 113.) \n  The New York Legal Assistance Group has already observed immigrants \nand their family members declining or delaying medical treatment they \nneeded because of COVID-19, due to concerns about the Public Charge \nRule. (App. 145-146.) \n  Telephone hotlines operated by Catholic Charities Community Services, \nArchdiocese of New York, in partnership with state or city agencies in New \nYork, have been receiving public-charge-related inquiries from callers who \nare fearful of seeking medical treatment for COVID-19. (App. 150-151.)  \n  19\n\n  Staff at Bronx Legal Services in New York have spoken with noncitizen \nclients who are afraid to obtain COVID-19 testing or treatment because they \nfear that doing so will require them to obtain Medicaid coverage. (App. \n140.) \n  Multiple other community organizations in New York City have reported \nthat immigrant clients are afraid to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19, even if they are feeling ill, based on concerns that doing so will \njeopardize their immigration status. (App. 120-121.) \n  Physicians in Monterey County, California, are working with an increasing \nnumber of immigrant patients who have symptoms of COVID-19, but are \nrefusing to seek medical care for these symptoms based on concerns about \nthe Public Charge Rule and the costs of treatment. (App. 160-161, 167-168.)  \n  Nonprofit  organizations  in  Chicago,  Illinois,  have  received  calls  from \nimmigrants  who  are  afraid  to  seek  virus-related  testing  and  treatment \nbecause of the Public Charge Rule. Many of these immigrants are seniors \nor individuals with underlying health conditions, who are at greater risk of \nsuffering severe illness or death from COVID-19. (App. 202-203.) \n  In  February  and  March  2020,  even  as  the  COVID-19  crisis  became \nincreasingly severe, health clinics in Virginia have continued to see an \nincreasing  number  of  immigrant  families  declining  to  seek  Medicaid \ncoverage (or withdrawing from existing coverage) because of the Public \nCharge Rule. (App. 186-187.) \n  During the past two months, a health educator in Los Angeles, California, \nhas worked with multiple clients who have forgone publicly funded health \ninsurance benefits for themselves or their citizen children based on fears \nabout the Public Charge Rule. (App. 172-173.)  \nImmigrants’ inability or unwillingness to obtain testing and treatment for COVID-19 due \nto their concerns about the Public Charge Rule jeopardizes the health and safety of not only \nimmigrants and their families but also the public at large. Without proper testing and treatment, \nimmigrants and their family members who become infected are more likely to suffer severe illness \nor death from the virus. (App. 55-56, 114.) Immigrants who lack testing and treatment are also \nmore likely to spread the virus to other people inadvertently, contributing to the current exponential \ngrowth of infection rates and fatalities. (App. 55-56, 61-63, 114, 160-161, 225.) \n  20\n\nThis risk of virus spread is further increased by the high number of immigrants who work \nin essential industries and who thus must continue to work outside of their homes and interact with \nothers by, for example, providing healthcare, preparing and delivering food to residences, cleaning \nhospitals and public spaces, and caring for the sick or aging. See supra, at 9-10. Indeed, in New \nYork City, the current epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis, noncitizens make up approximately \n42.4% of home health aides, 42.3% of cooks, 37.1% of food preparation workers, and 26.9% of \njanitors and building cleaners. (App. 126-127.) And in other areas of the country, large numbers \nof noncitizens continue to work in essential industries such as agriculture or food packing and \ndistribution. (App. 163-164, 203, 225.) By deterring these essential workers from obtaining health \ninsurance and medical care for COVID-19, the Public Charge Rule is increasing the risk of \ninfection for the public at large.  \nThe Public Charge Rule further impedes current attempts to stem the COVID-19 crisis by \ndeterring immigrants and their family members from obtaining needed medical treatment for \npreexisting conditions that either make individuals more vulnerable to the virus or make their \nCOVID-19  symptoms  worse.  Immigrants  who  decline  Medicaid  or  other  health  insurance \ncoverage because of the Rule often stop seeking primary care for conditions like diabetes, asthma, \nand heart disease. (App. 141.) But these conditions put patients at higher risk of suffering severe \nsymptoms or death from COVID-19. (App. 66, 141.) For example, staff at Bronx Legal Services \nhave already seen noncitizen clients who declined Medicaid coverage rather than risk their \nimmigration status, did not treat their serious medical conditions as a result, and have now fallen \nextremely ill with COVID-19 symptoms such as shortness of breath, high fevers, headaches, body \naches, and chills. (App. 141; see also App. 145-146 (staff at New York Legal Assistance Group \nhave seen clients declining or delaying medical treatment based on concerns about the Public \n  21\n\nCharge Rule).) Such uninsured individuals will wait to seek medical care until their condition gets \nserious (see App. 56, 66, 186), thus further straining hospitals and clinics that are already reaching \ncapacity and facing challenges obtaining ventilators and other critical medical supplies. And \nwithout insurance, these patients will likely be forced to make in-person visits to hospitals and \nclinics rather than use telehealth services, placing themselves and medical staff at higher risk of \ninfection. (App. 63.) These substantial harms to public health warrant lifting or modifying the stay \ntemporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n  The Public Charge Rule deters access to public benefits \nthat are necessary to respond to the severe economic crisis \ncaused by COVID-19.   \nThe Public Charge Rule is further injuring plaintiffs and the public interest by undermining \nefforts  to  mitigate  the  vast  economic  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The \nunemployment  rates  in  plaintiffs’  jurisdictions  and  across  the  country  are  already  reaching \nunprecedented levels due to the virus outbreak. See supra, at 10-11. And the economic downturn \nis likely to grow worse as the virus continues to spread. (App. 63-65.) Supplemental benefits like \nMedicaid and SNAP are crucial to helping employable individuals through a sudden emergency \nlike losing a job or incurring substantial medical bills for COVID-19 treatment. (See App. 64-65, \n121, 142, 202-203.) And by providing short-term help to individuals until they can get back on \ntheir feet, supplemental benefits promote economic stability and recovery for all of plaintiffs’ \nresidents and the nation.   \nMany hard-working immigrants, who are not “public charges” under any reasonable \ninterpretation of that term, have begun to face sudden financial strains as their employers cut jobs \ndue to the current economic crisis and government mandates ordering “nonessential” businesses \nto limit their services or have their employees work from home. (See App. 63-65, 121.) Indeed, \n  22\n\nthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently estimated that between February and March 2020, the \nnumber of immigrant adults who are unemployed rose by 26%. (App. 64-65.) But the Public \nCharge Rule is deterring immigrants and their family members from using such benefits to \nmaintain health and nutrition during the crisis. (See App. 113, 138-139, 161.) These irreparable \nharms further warrant lifting or modifying the stay temporarily during the current national \nemergency.  \nFor example, since the Rule went into effect, immigrants have increasingly been declining \nto participate in SNAP or other publicly funded nutrition programs due to fear that doing so will \njeopardize their immigration status. (App. 26-27, 138, 161, 217.) The Rule’s deterrent effect on \nSNAP usage has become particularly inequitable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many \nhard-working immigrants have suddenly lost substantial amounts of income or their employment. \nIndeed, under the Rule, using SNAP for just a few months during the current economic crisis \nplaces an LPR applicant at risk of being deemed a public charge. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422 (mere \napplication for SNAP is negative factor); id. at 41,506 (using SNAP and another public benefit \nduring a single month counts as two months of benefits use for calculating heavily weighted \nnegative factor of 12 out of 36 months of benefits use).    \nImmigrants’ avoidance of the public benefits covered by the Rule has already resulted in \nworse harms to both immigrants and plaintiffs during this difficult economic period. For example, \nimmigrants who decline SNAP for fear of being deemed a “public charge” are increasingly turning \nto emergency food assistance programs, such as food pantries. (App. 142, 203; see also App. 156-\n157 (Make the Road New York has been receiving many calls from immigrants seeking food \nassistance, including from food pantries).) But many food pantries have closed or sharply reduced \ntheir hours due to COVID-19. And many of the emergency food programs that are still operating \n  23\n\n“are running out of food at alarming rates.” (App. 142; see App. 179 (food banks and pantries are \nfacing increased food costs and “new challenges for accepting donated food”); App. 203 (many \nfood pantries in Chicago, Illinois have “either closed or are seeing a marked increase in requests \nfor food assistance”).) The Court should lift or modify its stay temporarily to avoid such irreparable \npublic-health and economic harms.    \n  The alert issued by defendants fails to address the new \nharms imposed by the Rule during the COVID-19 crisis.  \nBy revising its application of the Public Charge Rule during the current COVID-19 crisis, \nUSCIS has effectively acknowledged the Rule’s deterrent effect on immigrants’ willingness to \nobtain necessary medical care. On March 13, USCIS issued an alert that purports to limit this \ndeterrent effect by providing that “USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative \ncare (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public \ncharge inadmissibility determination . . . even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or \nmore public benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid).” (App. 44.) But this \nalert does not fully address the grave harms that the Rule is causing during the ongoing pandemic \nand is thus no substitute for the relief requested here. \nFirst, although the alert excludes “testing, treatment, [and] preventative care . . . related to \nCOVID-19” from future public-charge determinations (App. 44), it simultaneously continues to \ntreat as an automatic negative factor an LPR applicant’s application for or receipt of public benefits \n“that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19,” including federally funded \nMedicaid (App. 44). In other words, an LPR applicant who applies for federally funded Medicaid \nwill have that application count against him in the public-charge inquiry, even if subsequently \nobtained COVID-19 treatment paid for by federally funded Medicaid does not itself count in the \n  24\n\npublic-charge inquiry. See supra, at 13. But deterring immigrants from accessing the public \nbenefits that they need to get healthcare effectively prevents them from getting necessary testing \nand treatment for COVID-19. This aspect of the alert thus preserves the very problem USCIS has \npurported to address.  \nSecond, the alert does not provide sufficiently clear direction to assure immigrants that \nthey will not be penalized in a future public-charge determination for accessing critical healthcare \nnow. For example, it is unclear how the alert would apply to an individual who receives medical \ntreatment for COVID-19-like symptoms but is never tested, perhaps because of a shortage of \ntesting kits. Furthermore, although the alert clarifies that the Public Charge Rule will not apply to \nstate or local benefits, it is unclear how an immigrant is supposed to discern or control whether \nfederal, state, or local benefits apply—especially if she may require urgent or emergency care. And \nunder the alert, an LPR applicant will continue to be penalized for having Medicaid coverage to \nobtain treatment for medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease, even though \nthese conditions place patients at high risk of suffering more severe symptoms or death if they \ncontract COVID-19.    \nTellingly, even after DHS posted the alert on its website, the Rule has continued to deter \nimmigrants from accessing needed medical care during the pandemic. For example, in the weeks \nfollowing DHS’s issuance of the alert, physicians and others working on the front lines of the \ncurrent emergency have continued to see many immigrants and their family members expressing \nfear about and declining to obtain COVID-19 testing and treatment based on their persistent \nconcerns about the Public Charge Rule. (See, e.g., App. 167, 187-188, 208, 224.) Given the alert’s \nstatement that the Public Charge Rule will continue to penalize immigrants who access federally \nfunded Medicaid during the pandemic, the alert has likely increased fear and confusion about the \n  25\n\nRule and thus increased the Rule’s dangerous deterrent effects, rather than alleviating such harms \nto public health. (See App. 140, 157-158, 202.) \nThird, the alert is limited to testing and treatment for COVID-19, but the Public Charge \nRule will also deter immigrants from accessing public benefits that are especially critical for their \nwell-being in light of the dire public-health and economic crisis that COVID-19 has triggered. In \njust the last three weeks, this country has lost approximately sixteen million jobs, with worse losses \nlikely to follow. See supra, at 10. Placing immigrants in a situation where they must choose \nbetween forgoing essential aid for healthcare, food, or housing or risking their future chances of \nobtaining LPR status is particularly inequitable during this unprecedented moment in our history, \nand will inhibit the country’s ability to recover from the current economic crisis.  \n*  *  * \nThe nature and magnitude of the harms currently being imposed by the Rule warrant \ntemporary relief from the stay, particularly when these harms were not known to the parties or the \nCourt when the Court considered defendants’ stay application. See King, 88 S. Ct. at 842. Although \nthis case has always concerned issues of public health and welfare, the COVID-19 outbreak and \nits ramifications on public health and the economy present sudden and stark new circumstances \nnot previously considered by the Court and have vastly changed and amplified the irreparable \nharms caused by the Rule. And the likelihood of these harms occurring is no longer a prediction. \nThe Rule’s devastating effects are happening now. Given these new circumstances, the Court \nshould modify or lift its stay temporarily to meet the exigencies and equities of the current public-\nhealth and economic crisis.  \n  26\n\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should temporarily lift or modify its stay to halt implementation of the Public \nCharge Rule during the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020. In the alternative, the \nCourt should clarify that its stay does not preclude the district court from considering whether \nchanged  circumstances  from  the  COVID-19  outbreak  warrant  temporary  relief  from \nimplementation of the Public Charge Rule. \nDated:  New York, New York \nApril 13, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \nLETITIA JAMES \nAttorney General \nState ofN  ew York \nI~ \nlb!xu~ ~  \nSolicitor General \nMATTHEW COLANGELO  STEVEN C.

Should\nthe petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall\nterminate automatically. In the event the petition for a writ\nof certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the\nsending down of the judgment of this Court. \nJUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE BREYER, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, \nand JUSTICE KAGAN would deny the application. \nJUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the grant of stay. \nOn October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity began a rulemaking process to define the term “public\ncharge,” as it is used in the Nation’s immigration laws.  Ap-\nproximately 10 months and 266,000 comments later, the \nagency issued a final rule. Litigation swiftly followed, with\na number of States, organizations, and individual plaintiffs\nvariously alleging that the new definition violates the Con-\nstitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the immi-\ngration  laws  themselves.  These  plaintiffs  have  urged\ncourts to enjoin the rule’s enforcement not only as it applies \nApp. 1\n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. NEW YORK \nGORSUCH, J., concurring \nto them, or even to some definable group having something \nto do with their claimed injury, but as it applies to anyone. \nThese efforts have met with mixed results.  The Northern \nDistrict of California ordered the government not to enforce\nthe new rule within a hodge-podge of jurisdictions—Califor-\nnia, Oregon, Maine, Pennsylvania, and the District of Co-\nlumbia. The Eastern District of Washington entered a sim-\nilar order, but went much farther geographically, enjoining \nthe government from enforcing its rule globally.  But both \nof  those  orders  were  soon  stayed  by  the  Ninth  Circuit \nwhich, in a 59-page opinion, determined the government \nwas likely to succeed on the merits.  Meanwhile, across the \ncountry, the District of Maryland entered its own universal\ninjunction, only to have that one stayed by the Fourth Cir-\ncuit.  And while all these developments were unfolding on\nthe coasts, the Northern District of Illinois was busy fash-\nioning its own injunction, this one limited to enforcement\nwithin the State of Illinois. \nIf all of this is confusing, don’t worry, because none of it \nmatters much at this point.  Despite the fluid state of \nthings—some interim wins for the government over here, \nsome preliminary relief for plaintiffs over there—we now \nhave an injunction to rule them all:  the one before us, in \nwhich a single judge in New York enjoined the government \nfrom applying the new definition to anyone, without regard \nto geography or participation in this or any other lawsuit.\nThe Second Circuit declined to stay this particular univer-\nsal injunction, and so now, after so many trips up and down\nand around the judicial map, the government brings its\nwell-rehearsed arguments here.\nToday the Court (rightly) grants a stay, allowing the gov-\nernment to pursue (for now) its policy everywhere save Illi-\nnois.  But, in light of all that’s come before, it would be de-\nlusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the \nproblem. The real problem here is the increasingly common \npractice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the \nApp. 2\n\nCite as: 589 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \nGORSUCH, J., concurring \ncases before them.  Whether framed as injunctions of “na-\ntionwide,” “universal,” or “cosmic” scope, these orders share\nthe same basic flaw—they direct how the defendant must \nact toward persons who are not parties to the case. \nEquitable remedies, like remedies in general, are meant \nto redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in \na particular lawsuit.  When a district court orders the gov-\nernment not to enforce a rule against the plaintiffs in the\ncase before it, the court redresses the injury that gives rise\nto its jurisdiction in the first place.  But when a court goes\nfurther than that, ordering the government to take (or not\ntake) some action with respect to those who are strangers\nto the suit, it is hard to see how the court could still be act-\ning in the judicial role of resolving cases and controversies. \nInjunctions like these thus raise serious questions about\nthe scope of courts’ equitable powers under Article III.  See \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (THOMAS, J., \nconcurring); Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the Na-\ntional Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471–472 (2017) \n(Bray); Morley, De Facto Class Actions? Plaintiff- and De-\nfendant-Oriented  Injunctions  in  Voting  Rights,  Election\nLaw, and Other Constitutional Cases, 39 Harv. J. L. & Pub. \nPol’y 487, 523–527 (2016).\nIt  has  become  increasingly  apparent  that  this  Court\nmust, at some point, confront these important objections to\nthis increasingly widespread practice.  As the brief and fu-\nrious history of the regulation before us illustrates, the rou-\ntine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworka-\nble, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and \nall those affected by these conflicting decisions.  Rather \nthan spending their time methodically developing argu-\nments and evidence in cases limited to the parties at hand, \nboth sides have been forced to rush from one preliminary \ninjunction hearing to another, leaping from one emergency \nstay application to the next, each with potentially nation-\nwide stakes, and all based on expedited briefing and little \nApp. 3\n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. NEW YORK \nGORSUCH, J., concurring \nopportunity for the adversarial testing of evidence. \nThis is not normal.  Universal injunctions have little ba-\nsis in traditional equitable practice.  Bray 425–427.  Their \nuse has proliferated only in very recent years.  See Trump, \n585 U. S., at ___–___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at \n8–9).  And they hardly seem an innovation we should rush \nto embrace.  By their nature, universal injunctions tend to\nforce judges into making rushed, high-stakes, low-infor-\nmation decisions. Bray 461–462. The traditional system of\nlower courts issuing interlocutory relief limited to the par-\nties at hand may require litigants and courts to tolerate in-\nterim uncertainty about a rule’s final fate and proceed more\nslowly until this Court speaks in a case of its own.  But that \nsystem encourages multiple judges and multiple circuits to \nweigh in only after careful deliberation, a process that per-\nmits the airing of competing views that aids this Court’s\nown decisionmaking process.  Ibid.  The rise of nationwide \ninjunctions may just be a sign of our impatient times.  But \ngood judicial decisions are usually tempered by older vir-\ntues. \nNor do the costs of nationwide injunctions end there. \nThere are currently more than 1,000 active and senior dis-\ntrict court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts, and\nsubject to review in 12 regional courts of appeal.  Because \nplaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in\ncases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly \nboundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure \na win nationwide. Id., at 457–461. The risk of winning con-\nflicting nationwide injunctions is real too.  Id., at 462–464. \nAnd the stakes are asymmetric. If a single successful chal-\nlenge is enough to stay the challenged rule across the coun-\ntry, the government’s hope of implementing any new policy\ncould face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-\nto-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the \ncourts of appeal.  A single loss and the policy goes on ice—\npossibly for good, or just as possibly for some indeterminate \nApp. 4\n\nCite as: 589 U.

What in this \ngamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?\nI concur in the Court’s decision to issue a stay.  But I \nhope, too, that we might at an appropriate juncture take up \nsome of the underlying equitable and constitutional ques-\ntions raised by the rise of nationwide injunctions. \nApp. 5\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page3 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 1 of 24\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n----------------------------------------x \nSTATE OF NEW YORK, CITY OF NEW YORK, \nSTATE OF CONNECTICUT, and STATE OF \nVERMONT, \nPlaintiffs, \n-against-\nMEMO  NDUM DECISION \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND \nSECURITY; SECRETARY KEVIN K.

Reg. \n28,676, which \"summarize[d] longstanding law with respect to public charg  and provide[d] new \nguidance on public charge determinations\" in light ofIIRIRA, the Welfare R form Act, and other \nrecent legislation.  64 Fed.

Both the Field Guidance and p oposed rule defined \n\"public charge\" as a noncitizen who has become or is likely to become ':'pri  arily dependent on \nI \nthe government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of p  blic cash assistance \n; \nfor income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at gove  ent expense.\" Id. \n' \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Consistent with the INA, INS regulati  ns, and several INS, \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, and Attorney General decisions, they inst  cted INS officials to \n' \nevaluate a noncitizen's likelihood of becoming a public charge by examini  g the totality of the \nnoncitizen's circumstances at the time of his or her application.  Id at 28,690  The Field Guidance \nnoted that \"[t]he existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the sole criterion for \ndetermining if an alien is likely to become a public charge.\"  Id (e mphasis o  itted).

Specifically, they assert that Plaintiffs lack standing, tµe c;laims ar  no\\ ripe for judicial \nreview, and Plaintiffs fall outside the zone of interests regulated by the Rule. \n1.  Plaintiffs Have Standing. \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits the judicial power of federal  ourts to \"Cases\" or \n\"Controversies.\"  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl.  1.  To invoke ttiis power, a plaintiff must have \nstanding to sue.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'/ USA, 568 U.S. 398,408 (2013)·(ci  tion omitted).

They principally argue that Plaintiffs' claims  f iqeparable injury \n\"consist of potential future harms that, if they ever came to pass, )VOuld be sp  rred by decisions of \n'  I \nthird parties  not before the  Court,\"  and  that these  injuries  are  therefore too'' attenuated  and \nspeculative.  (Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for a Prelim.)nj. (\"Defs.  Opp'n\"), ECF No. \nI \n99, at 7).  In Defendants' view, the Rule governs only DHS persopnel and ce  ain noncitizens, but \nI \nI  , \ndoes not directly affect Plaintiffs, either by requiring or forbidding any acti  non Plaintiffs' part \nor by expressly interfering with any of Plaintiffs' programs.  (Id.)

As \nadministrators of the public benefits programs targeted by the Rule, (see Pls.' \nReply at 4 (noting INA's direct reference to states' roles as benefit admini tra\\ors)), Plaintiffs' \ninterests are all the more implicated.  Furthermore, the zone-of-interests test' does not require the \nplaintiff to be an intended beneficiary of the law in question,\" but instead a lo~s parties simply \n\"who are injured\" to seek redress.

See 5 U.S.C \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).  In analyzing an agency's interpretation of a statute and  hether the agency's \naction exceeds  statutory authority,  courts often apply  the two-step  fram {vork  articulated in \nI  . \nChevron US.A., Inc.  v.  Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  \"[T]he \nquestion ... is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congres 'has permitted it to \ndo[.]\"  City of Arlington v.  FCC,  569 U.S. 290, 298 (2013).  Under Chev bn, courts first ask \nI \nwhether the statute is clear.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.  If so, \"that is the en  '.of the matter[,] for \nthe court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously ~xpressed intent of \nCongress.\"  Id  at 842-43.  Where there is  ambiguity, however, courts th n ask  whether the \nagency's interpretation of the statute is reasonable.  Id at 843-44.  Such de  rence \"is premised \n1\non the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation fr  m Congress to the \nagency to fill in the statutory gaps.\"  FDA v.  Brown & Williamson Tobacco  prp., 529 U.S. 120, \n159 (2000).  Notwithstanding this implicit delegation, \"agencies must operat  ;'within the bounds \nI  [, \nof reasonable interpretation,\"' and \"reasonable statutory interpretation must  count for both 'the \nspecific context in which ... language is used'  and 'the broader context ~f the statute as a \nwhole.\"'  Util.

Long-Standing Definition of \"Public Charge.\" \nPlaintiffs argue that the new Rule's definition of \"public charge\" is a dr  tic deviation from \nthe  unambiguous  and  well-established  meaning  of the  term  that  has  ex sted  for  over  130 \n11 \nApp. 16\nSA 11\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page14 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 12 of 24\nyears.  (Pls.'  Mem.  at 2,  19-24.) They assert that the term has  consiste  ~ly  been interpreted \nnarrowly to  mean \"an individual who  is  or  is  likely to  become  prima · y  and  permanently \ndependent on the government for -subsistence.\"  (Id.  at 3.)  Going as far  :ack as  1882, when \nCongress passed the first federal  immigration statute, Plaintiffs note that  e statute rendered \nexcludable \"convicts, lunatics,  idiots, and any person unable to take care :of ·himself without \nbecoming a public charge,\" (id.  at 20 (quoting Immigration Act of 1882, c ·. 376, 22 Stat. 214, \n47th Cong. (1882))), and that it sought to \"prevent long-term residence in  he :United States of \nthose 'who ultimately become life-long dependents on our public charitie ~'\" '(id.  (quoting 13 \n' \nCong. Rec. 5108-10 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep. Van Voorhis)).)  As  laintiffs note, \"[f]ar \nfrom excluding as public charges immigrants who received temporary assi  nee, the same law \nauthorized immigration officials to provide 'support and relief to immigr  ts who may 'need \npublic aid' after their arrival.\"  (Id. (quoting Immigration Act of 1882 at§§ 1 2).) \n' \nPlaintiffs point to court decisions in the years that followed, confirm·  g this definition of \n\"public charge,\" as well as the INA itself, which adopted this interpretation upon its passage in \n1952.  (Id.  at 21-22.)  According to Plaintiffs, federal agencies have also  onsistently viewed \n\"public charge\" to  mean someone who  is \"primarily dependent on the g .v ernment for  cash \nI \nassistance or on long-term institutionalization,\" as evidenced by (1) INS's 1 .99 Field Guidance, \nI \nwhich formally codified this definition; (2) INS' s \"extensive[]\" consultatio  with other agencies \nprior to issuing the guidance; and (3) the Department of Justice's use of the\" rimarily dependent\" \nstandard in the deportation context.  (Id at 22-23.) \nIn opposition, Defendants assert that the definition of ''public cha ge\" in the Rule \"is \nconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory text, which 'is to be dete  ined at the time that \nit became law.\"'  (Defs.' Opp'n at 13 (quoting One West Bank v. Melina, 8  F.3d 214, 220 (2d \n12 \nApp. 17\nSA 12\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page15 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 13 of 24\nCir. 2016)).)  They direct this Court to dictionaries used in the 1880s, when  he Immigration Act \nof 1882 was passed, which allegedly \"make clear\" that a noncitizen becom s a \"public charge\" \n. \n\"when his inability to achieve self-sufficiency imposes an 'obligation' or 'li 'bility' on 'the body \nof the citizens' to provide for his basic necessities.\"  (Id. at 13-14.) \nUpon review of the plain language of the INA, the history and com  on-law meaning of \n\"public charge,\" agency interpretation, and Congress's repeated reenactmen  oqhe INA's public \ncharge provision without material change, one thing is abundantly clear  1public charge\" has \nnever  been  understood  to  mean  receipt  of  12  months  of  benefits  ithin  a  36-month \nperiod.  Defendants admit that this is a \"new definition\" under the Rule. (L : at 5.)  And at oral \n' \nargument, they did not dispute that this definition has never been referenced i  the history of U.S. \nimmigration law or that there is zero precedent supporting this particular defi  tion.  (See, e.g., Tr. \nof Oral Arg. dated Oct. 7, 2019 at 51:8-11, 52:1-3.) No ordinary or legal die ·onary definition of \n' \n\"public charge\" references Defendants' proposed meaning of that term.  As  uch, Plaintiffs raise \n' \na compelling argument that Defendants lack the authority to redefine \"public  ge\" as they have. \n2.  Congress's Intent. \nNor is there any evidence that Congress intended for a redefinition of' public charge,\" and \nI \ncertainly not in the manner set forth in the Rule.  No legislative intent or  ·i storical precedent \nalludes to this new definition.  Defendants have made no showing that Congr ss ~as anything but \ncontent with the current definition set forth in the Field Guidance, which defi  es public charge as \nsomeone who has become or is likely to become primarily dependent on the  overnment for cash \nassistance.  Indeed, Congress has repeatedly endorsed this definition and rejec ed efforts to expand \nit.  For example, during the 1996 debate over IIRIRA, several members o  Congress tried and \nfailed to extend the meaning of public charge to include the use of non-cas 'benefits.  See 142 \n13 \nApp. 18\nSA 13\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page16 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 14 of 24\nCong. Rec. S 11612, at S 11712 (d  aily ed. Sept. 16, 1996). Congress rejected s milar efforts in 2013 \nbecause of its \"strict benefit restrictions and requirements.\"  S. Rep. 113-40,  t 42 (2013). \nIn addition, if Congress wanted to deny immigrants any of the public ·e nefits enumerated \nin the Rule, it could have done so, as it similarly has in the past.  The Wel  e Reform Act, for \nexample, restricted certain noncitizens' eligibility for certain benefits.  Spe ifically, it provided \nthat only \"qualified\" noncitizens-which, in most cases, meant those who  ·ad remained in the \nUnited States for five years-could have access to most federal means-teste  public benefits.  8 \nU.S.C §§  1612, 1613.  Therefore, the absence of any Congressional inten  to redefine public \ncharge also counsels in favor of a preliminary injunction. \nC.  Plaintiffs Sufficiently Demonstrate That the Rule Is Arbitrary an \nPlaintiffs additionally argue that the Rule is arbitrary and capricio  s.  See  5 U.S.C.  § \n706(2)(A). \"The scope ofreview under the 'arbitrary and capricious' standard s narrow[.]\" Motor \n' \nVehicle Mfrs.  Ass'n of U.S.,  Inc.  v.  State Farm Mut.  Auto.  Ins.  Co., 463  ,.S. 29, 43  (1983). \nNevertheless, the APA requires an agency to \"engage in 'reasoned decisionm  ing,\"' Michigan v. \nEPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2706 (2015) (citation omitted), and to \"articulate a sati factory explanation \nfor its action,\" State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citation omitted).  An agency  .le is.arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency: \nrelied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entir ly failed to \nconsider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation fo  its decision \nthat runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could \nnot be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expert se. \nId.

Defendants' Justification of Rule. \nHere, Defendants fail to provide any reasonable explanation for chan ing the definition of \n\"public charge\" or the framework for evaluating whether a noncitizen is likel  .t o become a public \ncharge.  As noted above, \"public charge\" has never been interpreted as so  one \"who receives \none or more public benefits ... for more than 12 months in the aggregate  ithin any 36-month \nperiod.\"  84 Fed.  Reg.  at 41,501.  This new definition essentially change . the public charge \nassessment into  a benefits issue, rather than an inquiry about self-subsist nee,  such that any \nindividual who is deemed likely to accept a benefit is considered a public c  arge.  Receipt of a \nbenefit, however, does not necessarily indicate that the individual is unable to  pport herself. One \ncould envision, for example, a scenario where an individual is fully capable  supporting herself \nwithout government assistance but elects to accept a benefit, such as pub ic housing, simply \nbecause she is entitled to it.  Under the Rule, although this individual is legal y entitled to public \nhousing, if she takes advantage of this right, she may be penalized with den al of adjustment of \nstatus.  There is no  logic to this framework.  Moreover, considering that  e federal welfare \nprogram was not established in the United States until the 1930s, whereas  e concept of public \ncharge existed at least as early as 1882, there must be some definition of pu lie charge separate \nand apart from mere receipt of benefits. \nAt oral argument, Defendants were afforded numerous opportunities to articulate a rational \nbasis for equating public charge with receipt of benefits for 12 months within a 36-month period, \nparticularly when this has never been the rule.  Defendants failed each and every time.  When \n15 \nApp. 20\nSA 15\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page18 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 16 of 24\nasked, for example, why the standard was 12 months and 36 months as o posed to any other \nnumber of months, Defendants merely responded that they do not need to \"s ?W a case from 100 \nyears ago that also adopted this precise 12[/]36 standard.\"  (Tr. of Oral Arg.  ~ted Oct. 7, 2019 at \n53:14-20.)  Defendants were asked to explain how the new framework w  uld operate and to \nprovide an example of the \"typical person\" that Defendants could predict is going to receive 12 \nmonths of benefits in a 36-month period.  (Id.  68:11-80:123.)  Defendants a  run stumbled along \nand were unable to adequately explain what the determinative factor is  ~er the Rule, what \nindividual would fall across the line and be considered a public charge, and w  at evaluation of the \nfactors enumerated in the Rule would make the DHS officer confident that she could make an \nappropriate prediction.  (Id.)  And yet, according to Defendants, the Rule is in ended to \"provide[] \na number of concrete guidelines to assist in making [t he public charge] de ermination\" and is \n\"designed ... to make it more predictable for people on both sides of the ad'udi<;atory process.\" \n(Id. at 80:20-23.)  Quite the opposite appears to be the case. \nDefendants suggest that the totality-of-circumstances test remains  nd that receipt of \nbenefits for 12 months out of a 36-month period is only one of several facto s to be considered. \n(Id.  at 52:17-22.)  This characterization of the Rule is plainly incorrect.  Un er the Rule, receipt \nof such benefits is not one of the factors considered; it is the factor.  That ·s, if a DHS officer \nbelieves that an individual is likely to have benefits for 12 months out of a 3  -month period, the \ninquiry ends there, and the individual is automatically considered a publi  :charg~.  As such, \nDefendants are not simply expanding or elaborating on the list of factors to co  sider in the totality \nof the circumstances.  Rather, they are entirely reworking the framework, a d with no rational \nbasis. \n16 \nApp. 21\nSA 16\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page19 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 17 of 24\nDefendants also fail to demonstrate rational relationships between rn  y 6f the additional \n\\  ' \nfactors enumerated in the Rule and a finding of benefits use.  One illustr  ive example is the \nI \n! \naddition of English-language proficiency as a factor.  Defendants do not di 'pute that there has \ni \nnever been an English-language requirement in the public charge analysis.  T  ey prgue, however, \nthat it was \"entirely reasonable\" to add English proficiency as a factor, give  the requirement in \n,  I \n' \nthe INA to consider an applicant's \"education and skills,\" and the \"correlatio  between a lack of \nI \nEnglish language skills and public benefit usage, lower incomes, and lower ra es ~f employment.\" \n(Defs.' Opp'n at 27.) Defendants' suggestion that an individual is likely to bee  rn~ a.public charge \nI \nsimply by virtue of her limited English proficiency is baseless, as one can cert ·n ly be a productive \nand self-sufficient citizen without knowing any English.  The United States of ~erica has no \nofficial language. Many, if not most, immigrants who arrived at these shores di  not speak English. \nI \nIt is simply offensive to contend that English proficiency is a valid predictor  f seif-·sufficiency.3 \n: \nIn short, Defendants do not articulate why they are changing the pubr · c~arge definition, \nI \nwhy this new definition is needed now, or why the definition set forth in t  Rule-which has \n' \nabsolutely no support in the history of U.S. immigration law-is reasonable.  J'he Rule is simply \n' \nI \na new agency policy of exclusion in search of a justification.  It is repugn  t tb the American \nDream of the opportunity for prosperity and success through hard work an  upward mobility. \n'  I \nImmigrants have always come to this country seeking a better life for  th rn~elves and their \nI \n' \nposterity.  With or without help, most succeed. \nI \nI \n3 Similarly, it is unclear how the credit score of a new immigrant-who, for exa  pie'~ may have only \nrecently opened her first credit account and therefore has a short credit history, wh ch would negatively \nimpact her credit score-is indicative of her likelihood to receive 12 months of public ben,::fits.  Defendants \nblithely argue that a low credit score \"is an indication that someone has made finan  ial dec!sions that are \nnot necessarily entirely responsible\" and that \"those irresponsible financial decision . m4y be the product \nof someone who doesn't have very much money to work with.\"  (Tr. of Oral Arg.  atei:l Oct 7, 20 l 9 at \n86:16-20). \n17 \nApp. 22\nSA 17\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page20 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 18 of 24\n2.  Rehabilitation Act. \nPlaintiffs further argue that the Rule discriminates against individuals with disabilities, in \ncontravention of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Pub. L. No. 93-112,  7 Stat. 394 (1973) \n(codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794).  Section 504 provides that no individual wit  a disability \"shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participatio  in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination ... under any program or activit  conducted by any \nExecutive agency.\"  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  DHS, in particular, is prohibited fro  denying access to \nbenefits  and  services  on  the  basis  of disability,  6  C.F.R.  §  15.30(b)(l ,  and  from  using \ndiscriminatory criteria or methods of administration,  id.  § 15.30(b)(4).  Se, als~ ,id.  § 15.49. \n\"Exclusion or discrimination  [u nder Section 504]  may take the form  of  isparate treatment, \ndisparate impact, or failure to make reasonable accommodation.\" B. C. v. Mou  t Vernon Sch. Dist., \n837 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2016). \nThe Rule clearly considers disability as a negative factor in the public charge assessment. \nDefendants acknowledge that disability is \"one factor ... that may be consi  ered\" and that it is \n\"relevant ... to the extent that an alien's particular disability tends to show th the is 'more likely \nthan not to become a public charge' at any time.\"  (Defs.' Opp'n at 30 (quot ng 84 Fed. Reg. at \n41,368).)  Defendants do not explain how disability alone is itself a negative  actor indicative of \nbeing more likely to become a public charge.  In fact, it is inconsistent with t  e reality that many \nindividuals with disabilities live independent and productive lives.  As such, P aintiffs have raised \nat least a colorable argument that the Rule as to be applied may violate the Re  bilitation Act, and \nfurther discovery and development of the record is warranted prior to its impl mentation. \n18 \nApp. 23\nSA 18\n\nCase 19-3591, Document 130, 12/13/2019, 2729588, Page21 of 73\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 110   Filed 10/11/19   Page 19 of 24\nIV.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY  LL SUFFER \nIRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT A PRELIMINARY IN UNCTION \n\"A showing of irreparable harm is 'the single most important prerequi ite for the issuance \nof a preliminary injunction.\"'  Faiveley Transp.  Malmo AB v.  Wabtec Corp.  559 F.3d 110, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \"To satisfy the irreparable harm require  ~mt, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate that absent a preliminary injunction they will suffer 'an injury t  at is neither remote \nnor speculative, but actual and imminent,' and one that cannot be remedied 'i  a court waits until \nthe end of trial to resolve the harm.\"' Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd v.  ryor, 481 F.3d 60, \n66 (2d Cir. 2007) (c itation omitted).  However, Plaintiffs need only show \"a  reat of irreparable \nharm, not that irreparable harm already ha[s] occurred.\"  Mullins v. City ofM  York, 626 F.3d 47, \n55 (2d Cir. 2010). \nThe irreparable injury to Plaintiffs by shifting the burden of provid'  g services to those \nwho can no longer obtain federal benefits without jeopardizing their status i  the ~nited States, \nand the immediate response that is necessary by this shift of burden to Plain iffs, is a direct and \ninevitable consequence  of the  impending implementation of the Rule.  A  discussed above, \nPlaintiffs allege that their injuries will include proprietary and economic harm,  swell as increased \nhealthcare  and programmatic costs,  and that they  will  suffer  substantial  ardshi'p  without a \npreliminary injunction.  See supra Parts III.A.1-2.  Plaintiffs provide decl  ations extensively \ndescribing and calculating such injuries.  (See Deel. of Elena Goldstein, EC  No. ~4 (attaching \nadditional declarations and comment letters on proposed rule).) \nNo less important is the immediate and significant impact that the im  lemeµtation of the \nRule will have on law-abiding residents who have come to this country to se  a better life.  The \nconsequences that Plaintiffs must address, and America must endure, will be  ersonal and public \ndisruption, much of which cannot be undone.

It is a \nrule that will punish individuals for their receipt of benefits provided by o '.r government, and \ndiscourages them from lawfully receiving available assistance intended to ai : them in becoming \ncontributing members of our society.  It is impossible to argue that there is no  rreparable harm for \nthese individuals, Plaintiffs, and the public at large. \nV.  THE BALANCE OF HARDSHIPS AND PUBLIC INT  RESl' \nTIP IN PLAINTIFFS' FAVOR \nFinally, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \"the balance of equities tips·  [their] favor\" and \nthat \"an injunction is in the public interest.\"  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  \"These  actors,merge when \nthe Government is the opposing party.\"  Nken v.

Section 1746, declare under penalty of \nperjury as follows:   \n1.  I am the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental \nHygiene (“DOHMH”).  I am familiar with the matters set forth herein, either from professional \nknowledge, personal knowledge, conversations with DOHMH staff, or on the basis of documents \nprovided to and reviewed by me.  I respectfully submit this Declaration in support of the \nRespondents’ applications in the above-captioned matter.  \n2.  I have over 25 years of experience as a health care provider and public health \npractitioner.  I received a bachelor’s degree from Yale University, earned a medical degree from \nthe University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and completed my pediatric residency \nat George Washington University’s Children’s National Medical Center.  From 2014 to 2018, I \nwas First Deputy Commissioner of DOHMH and I oversaw the development and implementation \nof Take Care New York 2020, New York City’s data-driven health agenda focused on \n1 \n  App. 33\n\naddressing the social determinants of health and engaging communities on issues of health \nequity.  I served as Commissioner of Health for Baltimore City from 2010 to 2014 where I led \nthe development of Healthy Baltimore 2015, a health policy agenda focused on improving health \noutcomes by focusing on areas where the largest impact could be made to raise quality of life.  \nFrom 2003 to 2010, I served as medical director of the Office of School Health at the New York \nCity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the New York City Department of \nEducation.  I practiced primary care pediatrics at Unity Health Care, Inc., a federally qualified \nhealth center in Washington, DC, from 1994 to 2003.   \n3.  DOHMH is one of the largest public health agencies in the world.  It is \nresponsible for protecting and promoting the health of everyone who lives in, works in or visits \nNew York City.   \n4.  Currently, DOHMH is on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19 in the City \nof New York.  DOHMH is performing enhanced surveillance to track disease spread; providing \nguidance to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare and congregate facilities \nregarding pandemic planning, testing, infection control, personal protective equipment (PPE), \nand other matters; testing for COVID-19 in its Public Health Laboratory; distributing PPE, \nventilators, and other medical equipment to hospitals, nursing homes, and other high priority \nhealthcare sites; and assisting in creating increased healthcare capacity, including by assisting in \ntransforming external sites such as the Jacob Javits Center.  In addition, DOHMH is educating \nNew Yorkers about how to protect themselves from the virus by publicizing accurate \ninformation about COVID-19 through a variety of means including posters, flyers, letters, and \nother written communications available in over 20 languages; a detailed website; advertising, \n2 \n  App. 34\n\nvideos, and social media campaigns; virtual town halls; webinars and other presentation; and \ntargeted outreach to communities. \n5.  I submitted a declaration in support of Respondents’ motion for preliminary relief \nin the Southern District of New York, expressing my deep concerns about the chilling effect the \nnew public charge rule—the “Final Rule”—would have on residents of the City of New York \nand in turn, the impact it would have on health in the City of New York as a whole.  Since then, \nmy concerns have only intensified.   \n6.  The Final Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020, just days before New York \nCity’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed.  The Final Rule is especially destructive at a time \nlike this, when all New Yorkers, including those in immigrant communities, urgently need access \nto health care and health insurance, and when trust between public health authorities and the \ncommunity is especially crucial. \n7.  Studies show that low income, minority, and immigrant populations have greater \nrates of uninsurance and generally have disproportionately adverse impacts during public health \ncrises.  Available data suggest that an increased risk of adverse health outcomes is likely among \nuninsured and minority populations during a pandemic.  These populations experience \ndisproportionately poor health outcomes and greater barriers to care during pandemics and \nduring increases in pneumonia and influenza-like illnesses.  These poorer health outcomes \ninclude increased mortality, more complications, limited access to health care, lower vaccination \nrates, and greater socioeconomic, cultural, educational, and linguistic obstacles to adoption of \npandemic interventions.1    \n \n1  See e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4809795/pdf/nihms721441.pdf; \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827316300532; \nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2009.161125; \nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.2009.161505.   \n3 \n  App. 35\n\n8.  Improving the public health infrastructure and community health safety-net, \nincluding improving access to health care and health insurance, is important to ensure that people \nin immigrant communities participate in the healthful behaviors needed during a public health \ncrisis.  DOHMH is doing this by promoting understanding of COVID-19, sharing critical \ninformation with New Yorkers about minimizing the likelihood of transmission by staying home \nand practicing physical distancing and good hand hygiene.  DOHMH is also providing \ninformation to all New Yorkers about how and when they should seek health care services.  And \nDOHMH continues to perform outreach to immigrant communities to encourage enrollment in \nappropriate insurance coverage, including Medicaid, the Essential Plan, or commercial plans.  \nNew York State has created a special enrollment period for the New York State of Health \n(NYSOH) exchange, created through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), to allow the uninsured to \naccess coverage during the COVID-19 state of emergency.  DOHMH has worked to support the \nstate’s efforts by having certified application counselors assist New Yorkers with the enrollment \nprocess over the phone.  The Final Rule is antithetical to all of these efforts because it \ndisincentives participation in health insurance programs like Medicaid and encourages non-\ncitizens and their families to avoid contact with health providers and government benefit \nprograms.2  \n9.  In the early stages of the pandemic, in February and early March, when there was \nstill the possibility that COVID-19 could be contained and broader community transmission \naverted, DOHMH conducted extensive community outreach to encourage people with possible \n \n2 Concerns in immigrant communities over seeking health care related to COVID-19 have been \ndocumented by many media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and NBC News.  See e.g. \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/rule-barring-immigrants-from-social-programs-risks-worsening-\ncoronavirus-spread-11585137602?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1; \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/amid-coronavirus-spread-health-advocates-worry-trump-\ns-immigration-policies-n1150241.  \n4 \n  App. 36\n\nsymptoms of COVID-19 to promptly seek medical care so that they could be tested, isolated if \npositive, and so that DOHMH could conduct contact investigations to help stop the chain of \ntransmission.  In outreach meetings with community-based organizations serving immigrant \ncommunities conducted between February 27 and March 11, 2020, DOHMH fielded questions \nand heard confusion about how seeking care related to COVID-19 would impact a public charge \ndetermination under the Final Rule.  Although the United States Customs and Immigration \nServices has announced that treatment and preventive services “will not negatively affect any \n[person] as part of a future Public Charge analysis,” media reports suggest that these concerns \nand confusion may persist, and this concerns me greatly.3  \n10.  If people in immigrant communities forego testing or care due to fears about how \nreceipt of such services may affect their immigration status, this could have devastating effects \nfor the individuals themselves and for the larger community.  All of New York City benefits \nwhen people who are severely ill with COVID-19 disease access the health care services they \nneed.  Conversely, if communities avoid testing and care due to fear or confusion, New York \nCity’s efforts to mitigate the virus may be negatively impacted.  Several vaccines and treatments \nare under development, with some treatments are already being piloted.  If a vaccine or treatment \nbecomes available, unhindered access to care will be all the more critical to ending this \npandemic. \n11.  Concern and anxiety about having contact with health care providers and \ngovernmental authorities may also lead non-citizens and their families to avoid participating in \npublic health initiatives and investigations related to COVID-19 disease.  It is extremely \nimportant that all New York City residents cooperate with DOHMH when it issues advisories \n \n3 See e.g. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-immigrants.html. \n5 \n  App. 37\n\nand investigates outbreaks of communicable disease.  Contact investigations will likely become \nan important part of reducing the spread of COVID-19 in New York City once there is no longer \nwidespread community transmission and contact investigations can be used to identify and \ncontain cases of illness.  Contact investigations require the community to trust DOHMH so that \npeople are willing to speak to DOHMH staff and provide the names and contact information of \ntheir family members and friends.  If non-citizens and their families are deterred from \nparticipating in these investigations due to fear of the Final Rule, this could greatly reduce the \neffectiveness of DOHMH COVID-19 contact investigations.    \n12.  For the reasons described above, and in my prior declaration, DOHMH opposes \nimplementation of the Final Rule, particularly while New York City and the United States as a \nwhole, addresses the threat of COVID-19.   \n   \n6 \n  App. 38\n\nI declare under penalty that the foregoing is true and correct and of my own personal knowledge. \n \nDATED this 9th day of April 2020 at Queens, New York. \n \n   \nOXIRIS BARBOT, M.D.  \nCommissioner \nNew York City Department of Health and \nMental Hygiene \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n  App. 39\n\n \nBob Ferguson \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \nPO Box 40100    Olympia WA  98504-0100    (360) 753-6200 \n \nMarch 6, 2020 \n \n \nChad Wolf \nActing Secretary \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security \n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE \nWashington, DC 20528  \n \nKenneth T. Cuccinelli \nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Director \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n20 Massachusetts Ave. NW \nWashington, DC 20001 \n \nDear Acting Secretary Wolf and Senior Official Cuccinelli: \n \nWe urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to immediately stop implementation of \nthe Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Rule (“Public Charge Rule”), see 84 Fed. Reg. \n41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019), in the wake of the COVID-19 coronavirus. During the notice-and-\ncomment period for the Rule, DHS received warnings of the potentially devastating effects of the \nRule if its implementation were to coincide with the outbreak of a highly communicable disease \n– a scenario exactly like the one confronting our communities with the COVID-19 public health \nemergency. Your agency failed to consider such legitimate concerns.  \n \nCommunities across America are undertaking extensive efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19. \nYour agency’s Public Charge Rule undermines those efforts by deterring individuals from \naccessing critical health benefits to which they are legally entitled. Failure to immediately stay \nimplementation of the Rule so that we can take the steps necessary to contain and mitigate the \noutbreak of the disease puts the public health and safety of our communities at increased risk. \n \nThe overwhelming evidence – including from the World Health Organization (WHO), \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) –  \nshows COVID-19 is highly communicable and likely to spread in increasing numbers. On \nFebruary 26, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the Director of the CDC’s National Center for \nImmunization and Respiratory Diseases, explained “it’s not so much a question of if [community \nspread] will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and \nhow many people in this country will have severe illness.”1 Analysis by Trevor Bedford, an \ninvestigator and expert in vaccines and infectious diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nResearch Center in Seattle, suggests that new coronavirus cases in Western Washington are  \n                                                 \n1 See https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html \nApp. 40\n\nAttorney General of Washington \n \nMarch 6, 2020 \nPage 2 \n \n \n \nlikely doubling every six days.2  Dr. Messonnier also warned the necessary public health \nresponses may result in “disruption to everyday life [that] may be severe,” including \ninterruptions to work and school closures.3 Despite these warnings, there is still hope the disease \nmay be contained, provided governments at all levels take appropriate and comprehensive steps \nto limit its transmission. As the Director General of the WHO recently explained, “[w]ith early, \naggressive measures, countries can stop transmission and save lives.”4  \n \nCDC’s data and public statements underscore the urgent importance of such measures. As of \nFebruary 26 – just two days after DHS began implementation of the Public Charge Rule – CDC \nhad already documented multiple cases of COVID-19 spreading person-to-person within the \nUnited States.5 CDC further acknowledges “person-to-person spread will [likely] continue to \noccur, including in the United States.”6 If an individual gets sick with suspected COVID-19 \nsymptoms, CDC urges that they consult with their medical and healthcare professionals, \nincluding by “seek[ing] prompt medical attention if [their] illness is worsening.”7 CDC’s \nemphasis on coordination with healthcare professionals closely aligns with similar guidance \nfrom WHO, which warns that a successful response will require “all countries to educate their \npopulations, to expand surveillance, to find, isolate, and care for every case, to trace every \ncontact, and to take an all-of-government and all-of-society approach.”8 Inexplicably, DHS \ncontravenes this guidance by implementing a public charge rule punishing certain lawful \nimmigrants for seeking effective medical treatment that might mitigate COVID-19’s harmful \nscope and effect. \n \nDHS’s implementation of the Public Charge Rule during this public health crisis is irresponsible \nand reckless. As noted by Plaintiff States in ongoing litigation challenging the Rule,9 DHS \nopenly concedes the Rule could lead to “increased prevalence of communicable diseases,” 10 \ndisenrollment from public programs,11 and increased use of emergency rooms as a primary \nmethod of health care.12 Washington State has already had eleven deaths attributable to COVID-\n19. The State is doing everything in its power to limit the spread of the disease and prevent \n                                                 \n2 See https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/ \n3 See https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0225-cdc-telebriefing-covid-19.html \n4 https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-\non-covid-19---2-march-2020 \n5 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html   \n6 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/summary.html \n7 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html. \n8 https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-\non-covid-19---28-february-2020 \n9 See Washington v.

Such treatment or \npreventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge analysis. \nThe Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds final rule is critical to defending and protecting Americans' health and its \nhealth care resources. The Public Charge rule does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, including COVID-19. In addition, the rule does not restrict access to vaccines for children or \nadults to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. Importantly, for purposes of a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination, USCIS considers the receipt of public benefits as only one consideration among a number of factors and \nconsiderations in the totality of the alien's circumstances over a period of time with no single factor being outcome \ndeterminative. To address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary \nmedical treatment or preventive services, USCIS will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care \n(including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination, nor as related to the public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension \nof stay or change of status, even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or more public benefits, as defined in \nthe rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid). \nThe rule requires USCIS to consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, including those that may \nbe used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination, and for purposes \nof a public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension of stay or change of status. The \nlist of public benefits considered for this purpose includes most forms of federally funded Medicaid (for those over 21), \nbut does not include CHIP, or State, local, or tribal public health care services/assistance that are not funded by federal \nMedicaid. In addition, if an alien subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility lives and works in a jurisdiction \nwhere disease prevention methods such as social distancing or quarantine are in place, or where the alien's employer, \nschool, or university voluntarily shuts down operations to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the alien may submit a \nstatement with his or her application for adjustment of status to explain how such methods or policies have affected the \nalien as relevant to the factors USCIS must consider in a public charge inadmissibility determination. For example, if the \nalien is prevented from working or attending school, and must rely on public benefits for the duration of the COVID-19 \noutbreak and recovery phase, the alien can provide an explanation and relevant supporting documentation. To the \nextent relevant and credible, USCIS will take all such evidence into consideration in the totality of the alien's \ncircumstances. \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Final Rule \nOn Feb. 24, 2020, USCIS implemented the Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds final rule nationwide, including in \nIllinois.

For applications and petitions sent by commercial courier (for example, UPS, FedEx, or \nDHL), the postmark date is the date reflected on the courier receipt.

 (II) health; \n(Ill) family status; (IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills ....\"   \nSection 213 of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1183): \"An alien inadmissible under [section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)] may, \nif otherwise admissible, be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General (subject to the affidavit of support \nrequirement and attribution of sponsor's income and resources under section 1183a of this title) upon the giving of a \nsuitable and proper bond ....\"  \nSection 214(a)(l) of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1184(a)(l)): \"The admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall \nbe for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when he deems \nnecessary the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the Attorney General \nshall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such time or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was \nadmitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the \nUnited States.\" \nSection 248(a) of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1258(a)): \"The Secretary of Homeland Security may, under such conditions as he may \nprescribe, authorize a change from any nonimmigrant classification to any other nonimmigrant classification in the case of \nany alien lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant who is continuing to maintain that status and who is \nnot inadmissible under section 1182(a)(9)(B)(i) of this title (or whose inadmissibility under such section is waived \nunder section 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) of this title) ....\"  \n8 U.S.C. § 1601 (PDF){l): \"Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country's \nearliest immigration statutes.\"  \n8 U.S.C. § 1601 (PDFH2)(A): \"It continues to be the immigration  policy  of the United States that  - aliens within the Nation's \nborders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of \ntheir families, their sponsors, and private organizations.\"  \n8 U.S.C. § 1601 (PDF)  (2)(B): It is also the  immigration  policy of the United States that \"the  availability  of public  benefits  not \nconstitute an incentive  for immigration to the United States.\"   \nThe DHS Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Final Rule  \nTimeline of the Rule's Implementation \nOn  Aug.  14, 2019,  the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  published  the  Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds  final rule  that  codifies regulations  governing  the  application of the  public charge  inadmissibility  grounds. \nSee section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.1182(a)(4).  \nOn Oct. 2, 2019, DHS issued a corresponding  correction document, which contains provisions that are effective as if they \nhad been included in the final rule published on Aug. 14, 2019. \nApp. 45\n2 of 4 3/24/2020, 12:54 PM\n\nPublic Charge | USCIS https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge\nOn Oct. 10,  2018,  DHS issued  a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  which was published in the Federal Register for a 60-day \ncomment period. DHS  received  and  considered  over 266,000  public  comments  before issuing the final rule. The final rule \nprovides summaries and responses to all significant  public  comments. \nThe Purpose of the Rule \nThe final  rule  enables  the federal government to better carry out provisions of U.S. immigration law related to the public \ncharge ground of inadmissibility.  \nThe final  rule  clarifies  the  factors considered  when determining whether  someone  is likely at any time in the future to \nbecome a public charge,  is  inadmissible (under section 212(a)(4) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4))  and,  therefore,  ineligible \nfor  admission or  adjustment of status.  \nThe final rule also requires aliens in the United States who have a  nonimmigrant  visa and seek to extend their stay in the \nsame nonimmigrant classification or to change their status to a different nonimmigrant classification to demonstrate, as a \ncondition of approval, that they have not received, since obtaining the status they seek to extend or change, public benefits \nfor more than 12 months, in total, within any 36-month period. \nThe final rule does not create any penalty or disincentive for past, current or future receipt of public benefits by U.S. citizens \nor  aliens  whom Congress has exempted from the public charge ground of inadmissibility. \nApplicability and Exemptions \nThe final rule applies  to  applicants for admission and  aliens seeking to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent \nresidents from within the United States. The final rule also applies to applicants for extension of stay and change of status. \nThe final rule does not apply to: \n•  U.S. citizens, even if the U.S. citizen is related to a noncitizen who is subject to the public charge ground of \ninadmissibility; or \n•  Aliens  whom Congress exempted from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, such as: \n•  Refugees; \n•  Asylees; \n•  Afghans and Iraqis with special immigrant visas; \n•  Certain   nonimmigrant trafficking and crime victims; \n•  Individuals applying under the Violence Against Women Act; \n•  Special immigrant juveniles; and \n•  Those to whom DHS  has granted  a waiver of public charge inadmissibility. \nPublic Benefits that DHS Will Not Consider \nBenefits received by U.S. service members. Under the final rule, DHS will not consider the receipt of public benefits (as \ndefined in the final rule) by an alien who (at the time of receipt, or at the time of filing or adjudication of the application for \nadmission, adjustment of status, extension of stay, or change of status) is enlisted in the U.S.  armed forces, or is serving in \nactive duty or in any of the Ready Reserve components of the U.S.  armed forces \nBenefits received by spouse and children of U.S. service members. DHS also will not consider the receipt of public benefits \nby the spouse and children of such service members (described above).  \nBenefits received by children born to, or adopted by, U.S. citizens living outside the United States. The rule further provides \nthat DHS will not consider public benefits received by children, including adopted children, who will acquire U.S. citizenship \nunder  section  320 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1431, or children, residing outside the United States, of U.S. citizens who are entering \nthe United States for the purpose of attending an interview under section 322 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1433.  \nCertain Medicaid benefits.

Cuccinelli \nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Director \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n20 Massachusetts Ave., NW \nWashington, DC  20001 \n \nDear Acting Secretary Wolf and Senior Official Cuccinelli: \n \nOn March 6, 2020, a coalition of 18 State Attorneys General and over 50 elected officials from \nthe State of Washington, wrote to you urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to \nimmediately halt implementation of the Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Rule (“Public \nCharge Rule”) in the wake of the COVID-19 coronavirus. We have not received a response, but \non March 13 you posted an “Alert” on the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) \nwebsite that confirmed DHS would not consider any form of testing or care related to COVID-19 \nin immigrants’ public charge assessment, “even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one \nor more public benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid).”1 Nevertheless, \nthe Alert fails to mitigate the overall harm of the Public Charge Rule, as it emphasizes that DHS \nwill still consider receipt of Medicaid benefits “including those that may be used to obtain testing \nor treatment for COVID-19” in the public charge determination. \n \nIf DHS is attempting to ensure noncitizens in our communities remain enrolled in Medicaid so \nthey can use Medicaid services should they have symptoms of COVID-19, the Alert fails to \nachieve this. And likewise, if DHS is attempting to ensure that noncitizens seek testing and \ntreatment for COVID-19 without fear of public charge consequences, the Alert also utterly fails \nto achieve this. \n \nIt is not enough to exempt the use of certain Medicaid-paid services from the public charge \nanalysis if enrollment in Medicaid still is considered. While professing to encourage everyone to \nseek the testing and treatment they need, the Alert provides that Medicaid coverage used to \naccess those services may be counted against noncitizens in the public charge analysis. The Alert \nfails to recognize that in order to receive adequate health services, our residents need adequate \n                                                 \n1 https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge. \nApp. 48\n\nAttorney General of Washington \n \nChad Wolf, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli \nMarch 19, 2020 \nPage 2 \n \nhealth insurance benefits. To achieve DHS’s stated goal of encouraging noncitizens to seek \ntesting and treatment for COVID-19, noncitizens must be encouraged to enroll or remain \nenrolled in health insurance programs, including Medicaid, and they must be assured that such \nenrollment during this dire national health emergency will not be considered in any future public \ncharge determination. \n \nSince we wrote you 13 days ago, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Washington has \nincreased dramatically—from 11 to 66. Likewise, the number of reported cases has increased \nnearly twelvefold—from approximately 100 to 1187.2 In Massachusetts, the number of \nconfirmed cases has increased from 1 to 328.3 Testing in the United States still lags far behind \nother countries, however, and the total number of cases likely far eclipses the current numbers of \nconfirmed positives. For example, scientists currently estimate there are likely 5 to 10 undetected \ncases for every confirmed one.4 The World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic, \nand the President has declared a national emergency. Every day, tighter restrictions are placed on \ntravel, schools, restaurants, and bars, with the CDC now formally advising against gatherings of \n10 or more people.  \n \nGiven the grave danger facing our nation’s health and economy, it is imperative that DHS not \nchill immigrants from enrolling in Medicaid or using Medicaid benefits for any purpose until the \nCOVID-19 crisis is over. Under the Alert, however, noncitizens who remain enrolled in \nMedicaid continue to risk their green cards and visas. As DHS previously conceded, this will \nprompt immigrants to disenroll from Medicaid and lead to an “increased prevalence of \ncommunicable diseases,”5 as the nation is now experiencing at a horrifying rate. \n \nTo protect the residents of our states and the rest of the country, we ask that DHS immediately \nannounce that the Rule is stayed pending successful containment of COVID-19. Short of that, \nhowever, it is imperative that DHS at least make clear that enrollment in Medicaid and the use of \nMedicaid benefits for any reason will not be considered in the public charge assessment. Given \nthat these benefits were not considered in the public charge assessment for many years prior to \nDHS’s recent change of policy, it is inexplicably harmful for the agency to begin counting them \nnow, during the outbreak of a lethal global pandemic.    \n \nSincerely, \n \n   \nBob Ferguson  Xavier Becerra \nWashington State Attorney General  California Attorney General \n                                                 \n2 https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus. \n3 https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring \n4 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/live-coronavirus-news-updates.html#link-71630faa (citing \nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221). \n5 83 Fed.

I have attached my Curriculum Vitae as Exhibit A to this \nDeclaration. \n3.  I am a health policy researcher with over 25 years of experience.  I have \nconducted substantial research about immigrant health, and health care and costs.  I have \nauthored or co-authored more than a dozen articles and reports about immigrant health issues, \nincluding articles in peer-reviewed journals such as Health Affairs and American Journal of \nPublic Health, as well as scholarly reports published by diverse non-profit organizations \nincluding the Social Science Research Network, the Migration Policy Institute, the Cato Institute, \n1 \n  App. 52\n\nand the Commonwealth Fund, as well as many more articles and reports on other subjects.  I \nhave testified before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee about immigrant health issues and \nprovided analyses and advice to state governments and non-governmental organizations in many \nstates about immigrant health.   \n4.  I have expertise in quantitative data analysis and have conducted quantitative \nanalyses for most of my career, including analyses for a federal agency and two think tanks and \nnow at a university.  I have taught statistical analysis and research methods at the graduate \nschool level for over 25 years, training hundreds of graduate students, as well as dozens of \nfederal and state budget and policy analysts.  I have authored or co-authored more than 90 papers \nin peer-reviewed journals and hundreds of other reports, most of which were quantitative \nanalyses.  As a quantitative health data analyst, I have consulted with the Congressional Budget \nOffice and numerous federal and state agencies. \n5.

This includes oversight of health insurance for small \nbusinesses as well as individual health insurance in the District of Columbia. \n7.  I have a Ph.D. in Health Policy from Boston University (1990) and Master of \nPublic Health and Master of Science degrees from the University of California at Berkeley \n(1979).  Prior to becoming a faculty member at George Washington University, I was on the staff \nof the Urban Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  \n8.

The alarming onset of the global pandemic of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, \nhas created serious public health risks for the United States and other nations.  As a contagious \nvirus, COVID-19 is spreading broadly and threatens citizens and immigrants alike.  Along with \npublic health measures, such as social distancing and self-quarantines to reduce the risk of \ninfection, medical measures such as testing for COVID-19 and prompt treatment are critical.  But \n \n4   Declaration of Leighton Ku in State of New York, et al. v Donald Trump, et al. in the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York, Nov. 22, 2017.  \n5   Declaration of Leighton Ku in State of Texas v.

The Department of Homeland Security’s 2019 “public charge” rule makes it \nextremely difficult for lawful immigrants to gain permanent residency or to adjust their status if \nthey have received federal Medicaid, thereby creating additional risks that they will be uninsured \nor avoid medical care.8  (Receipt of federal Medicaid is a highly weighted negative factor in a \ndetermination of inadmissibility.)  As documented in my declaration dated September 9, 2019, \nthere is strong evidence that the public charge rule creates fear and a “chilling effect” that would \nlead many members of immigrant families—even family members who are citizens—to avoid \nfederal Medicaid coverage and similar forms of state insurance9 and to reduce their use of health \ncare services.10     \n11.

There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection, although there \nare efforts to develop a vaccine.  If and when a vaccine becomes available, then lack of insurance could pose a \nfinancial barrier to vaccination as well, or otherwise deter noncitizens from accessing a vaccine.    \n7 Abrams A.

Final Regulations: Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds.  Federal \nRegister. Federal Register.  Vol. 84, No. 157, pg.: 41290-508.  Aug. 14, 2019. \n9 A number of states, such as New York, California the District of Columbia, Illinois and Oregon, offer state-funded \nMedicaid without federal matching funds (or health insurance akin to Medicaid) to certain low-income immigrants \nwho are not eligible for federally-funded Medicaid, such as children, pregnant women and other adults.  The public \ncharge determinations apply only to federally funded Medicaid, but immigrants are likely deterred from these state \nfunded benefits too, since they may not be able to distinguish them from federally funded Medicaid.  See L Ku \n2019, footnote 1 for more detail about these non-federally funded insurance programs. \n10 Op cit, L Ku 2019, footnote 1. \n4 \n  App. 55\n\nconsequences of the chilling effect on accessing health care caused by public charge that I \nobserved in September 2019 even more significant.  It has been reported that immigrants are \n“petrified” about seeking testing and treatment because they worry that the public charge rule \ncould penalize them if they seek care.11  For example, Rebecca Sanin, president and CEO of the \nHealth and Welfare Council of Long Island, reported recently that nonprofits under her \norganization’s umbrella were “seeing people choosing not to recertify or get services because of \nthe climate of fear and change in policies targeting immigrants.”12  Similarly David Nemiroff, \nwho directs the Long Island Federally Qualified Health Center, said that “[o]ur biggest fear is \nthat people will choose their immigration status over their health care, and where does that leave \nus regarding COVID-19?”13  Even if these fears result only in delays in accessing care, not \ncomplete avoidance, the public health consequences could be grim if infected persons go \nundetected and are at increased risk of spreading the disease, or if untreated infections become \neven more severe. \n12.  These concerns are consistent with earlier evidence about the adverse \nconsequences of the public charge rule.  It is important to remember that immigrant families may \ninclude both citizen and non-citizen members; U.S. born children of immigrants are native-born \ncitizens, and many members of immigrant families may also be naturalized citizens or those who \nhave already attained permanent residency.  Thus, restrictions under the public charge rule may \nhave serious repercussions for other family members and may affect their behaviors as well.  If \none member of the family (whether an immigrant or not) goes undetected because of fears about \n \n11 Jordan M. ‘We’re Petrified’: Immigrants Afraid to Seek Medical Care for Coronavirus.

Evidence from the late 1990s, when harsh public charge rules and related \nimmigrant restrictions were applied, showed that Medicaid participation fell sharply and U.S.-\nborn citizen children who lived in immigrant families lost benefits, even though these children \nwere eligible and ought not have been affected by these policies; they were harmed by the \n“chilling effect” that spread through immigrant communities.14  These fears have arisen again in \nlight of the renewal of harsh public charge policies under the new public charge rules.  More \nrecently, even before the current public charge rule went into effect, one in seven members of \nimmigrant families reported avoiding public benefits like Medicaid because they were worried \nthat the public charge rule could lead to adverse immigration consequences against themselves or \nmembers of their families.15  Large numbers of adults in immigrant families reported that they \navoided seeking medical care from a doctor, or even talking with teachers or school officials, \nbecause of worries that they might be asked about immigration status.16  Now that the final rule \nhas gone into effect, the repercussions are likely to worsen.

Because of  \nevidence that being uninsured leads to a higher risk of death, the public charge rule could cause \nabout 1,300 to 4,000 additional deaths per year.  Given the new evidence about COVID-19, \nupdated estimates of the effects could be even higher.17 \n14.  Concerns about immigrants being deterred from accessing appropriate medical \ncare due to the public charge rule have been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Wendy \nParmet, Professor of Law at Northeastern University, has written that the public charge rule \nexacerbates the coronavirus pandemic because it discourages members of immigrant families \nfrom seeking medical care.  She concluded “the Department of Homeland Security should stay \nimplementation of the public charge rule as a whole—or at least suspend the adverse \nconsequences attached to using Medicaid until after the outbreak passes.  There simply is no \njustification for rushing to implement a rule that may worsen a pandemic. . . . With a pandemic \nupon us, it doesn’t require compassion to ensure that our immigration policies don’t threaten \npublic health.  It just requires common sense.”18 \n15.  Because COVID-19 is so recent, we lack authoritative data about the extent to \nwhich members of immigrant families and those who are uninsured are deterred from obtaining \ntesting or treatment for COVID-19.  But we can draw conclusions about the avoidance of care \nbased on research that immigration status and the lack of insurance coverage are related to health \nrisks during pandemics, using research about the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic.   \n16.

About a decade ago, the nation experienced the H1N1 influenza pandemic. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were about 60.8 \nmillion cases in the United States, 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths due to H1N1 flu \nbetween April 2009 and April 2010.19  Shortly before the onset of the H1N1 pandemic, CDC \nconvened an expert panel in May 2008 to consider the special challenges of pandemic \npreparedness of and response for immigrants, who were recognized as a group with special \nhealth risks.  The panel found that many immigrants are at elevated risk during pandemics \nbecause of factors like their limited health insurance coverage, lower vaccination rates, low-\nincomes, and linguistic and cultural barriers.20  The panel recommended adopting additional \nefforts to reduce barriers for immigrants to the receipt of medical care, including efforts to reach \nout to and communicate with immigrant communities during pandemics. \n17.  While we lack data about the extent to which immigrants were or have been tested \nfor or treated for H1N1 flu, or for COVID-19, there is evidence that examines the extent to \nwhich immigrants obtained medical care through vaccinations.  (H1N1 vaccinations became \navailable in late 2009 and early 2010.)  Vaccine utilization helps measure the extent to which \nadults receive medical care to address pandemic infections.  A study by researchers at Utah State \nUniversity highlighted the significance of health insurance coverage for immigrants as a \nprotective factor during pandemics.21  The study analyzed rates of vaccination for H1N1 \ninfluenza in 2010.  It found that non-Hispanic white adults were more likely to be vaccinated \n \n19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  2009 H1N1 Pandemic.

That \nis, immigrants were less likely to get care than non-immigrants.  The study also showed the \nprotective effect of health insurance coverage: those with insurance were twice as likely to be \nvaccinated as those without insurance.  A challenge for immigrants was that immigrant \nHispanics were over four times more likely to be uninsured than non-Hispanic whites, creating \nbarriers to getting vaccinated.  When the researchers statistically controlled for insurance \ncoverage, Hispanic immigrants were actually slightly more likely to be vaccinated than non-\nHispanic white adults.  When immigrants have insurance, they are better able to protect \nthemselves through vaccinations; the problem was that so many immigrants are uninsured.  This \nstudy is consistent with other research that showed how low socioeconomic status was associated \nwith lower H1N1 vaccination rates, while insurance coverage improved vaccination levels.22 \n18.  In some cases, uninsured people may be able to receive medical care free through \nsafety net facilities, such as community health centers or government clinics; evidence suggests \nthat the chilling effect leads to reductions in use of services like these, even though the public \ncharge determinations do not apply to such programs.  For example, although the public charge \nrule does not apply to benefits from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition assistance \nprogram, many immigrants have avoided enrolling in WIC because of public charge fears.23  \n19.  The evidence about immigrants’ reduced ability to get vaccines, and the \nimprovements that occur when they are able to get insurance, demonstrates (a) that immigrants \nface greater barriers in getting medical care to protect themselves during pandemics, and (b) \n \n22 Maurer J.

By discouraging \nimmigrants and other members of their families from using federal Medicaid, the public charge \nrule creates unnecessary barriers to getting care, such as testing, treatment, or eventually \nvaccinations that could protect against COVID-19.  \n20.  There could be broader public health repercussions.  Since COVID-19 is a \ncommunicable disease, higher risk for members of immigrant families creates higher risks of \ncontagion for other members of their communities.  Low- and moderate-income immigrants are a \nlarge share of the workforce that is essential during pandemics.  For example, data from the U.S. \nCensus indicates that immigrants form more than one-third of home health aides and one-quarter \nof personal care aides, who provide home health care to frail seniors, and constitute one-sixth to \none-fifth of the grocery store and food delivery workforce.24  During the current public health \ncrisis, we are more reliant than ever on workers like these.  But if low-wage workers in essential \njobs like these—which frequently lack private health insurance coverage—cannot get \nappropriate medical care and become infected, they could inadvertently increase risks of \ncontagion to their patients and customers, elevating the pandemic risk to others in their \ncommunities.  That is, protecting immigrants is also in the best interests of non-immigrant \nmembers of our communities. \n21.  Immigrants who are uninsured, due to their concerns about the consequences of \nthe public charge rule and use of Medicaid, place further pressure on the already strained safety \nnet of public and nonprofit hospitals, clinics and emergency rooms, which provide a \n \n24 New American Economy Research Fund.

These effects are evenly \nmore strongly felt in areas with larger immigrant populations such as parts of New York, \nCalifornia, Texas, Florida, Illinois, or New Jersey.  This was a problem even before COVID-19.  \nIn November 2018, prior to final issuance of the public charge regulation, Mitchell Katz, MD, \nMPH, the executive director of New York City’s Health and Hospitals system, who previously \nled the health departments in Los Angeles County and San Francisco and is one of the nation’s \nforemost authorities on public health care systems stated: “If enacted as proposed, this public \ncharge provision could decrease access to medical care and worsen the health of individuals, \nthreaten public health, and undercut the viability of the health care system.”25  The pressures \nupon the safety net health care system due to the public charge rule are magnified when the \nenormous challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic are added. I can illustrate this point using the \nexample of Elmhurst Hospital in the Bronx.  Dr. Mitchell Katz  recently commented that \nElmhurst is most stressed hospital in the New York Health and Hospitals system during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic26, with a high burden of COVID-19 patients and the related pressure this \nplaces on staff, facilities and protective equipment.  Elmhurst is a lower-income neighborhood in \nNew York City with a high immigrant population: about 36% of residents are non-citizen \nimmigrants and 32% are naturalized citizens,27 so public charge rule compounds the problems \nfaced by its public hospital.   \n22.  In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public charge rule makes it harder \nfor members of immigrant families to seek care because they are more uninsured, which forces \n \n25 Katz M, Chokshi D.

Problems related to the pubic charge rule not only increases stress and crowding in these \nfacilities, it also increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients and health care \nstaff.  While there has been increase in the use of telehealth services, i.e., digital health care visits \nin lieu of in-person visits,  in recent weeks as a social distancing precaution to reduce the risk of \ncontagion, low-income and immigrant populations have less access to the internet, whether \nthrough broadband connections or smartphones.29  Moreover, while there have been efforts to \nupgrade the extent to which health insurance can pay for telehealth visits30, no such mechanism \nexists for those who are uninsured.  As a result, uninsured immigrant patients are likely to be \nmore reliant on in-person care seeking, exacerbating the pressure on safety net health care \nproviders and increasing the risk of patient-health care staff disease transmission. \n23.  In addition to the health risks of COVID-19 infection, the pandemic is causing \nunprecedented economic losses that are also placing immigrants at risk as businesses close or \nscale down during the pandemic.  The latest data indicate that more than 10 million Americans \nfiled for unemployment benefits in March, and it seems likely that these numbers will continue \nto grow.31  (Because only some are eligible for unemployment benefits, the actual number who \n \n28 Stone W.

As an Executive Board member of the District of Columbia’s Health Benefits \nExchange Authority, I have been informed that Medicaid applications surged in March; national \ndata are not yet reported.  Immigrant workers are disproportionately vulnerable to job and \nincome loss during this economic downturn because they are often employed in industries like \nhotels, restaurants, construction, and service industries.32  Millions of Americans, including both \nimmigrants and non-immigrants, who have worked hard are now finding themselves desperately \nin need of economic and health assistance.  While Medicaid serves as a health insurance safety \nnet for most Americans in times of need, those who are non-citizen immigrants are at risk of \nbeing determined to be public charges if they enroll in Medicaid because of the policy of U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).  The newly unemployed immigrants—who could \nnumber in the millions—may have been employed for years, but they will be placed in jeopardy \nif they use Medicaid when they lose their jobs and private insurance because of the economic \ndisaster.  (Many of those whose incomes fall may be eligible for subsidized insurance using \nadvance premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplaces, but \nthose with incomes below the poverty line are not eligible for the tax-subsidized insurance and \ncould only get coverage from Medicaid or similar state-funded programs.)   \n24.  New data confirm that job loss has been more severe among immigrants and that \nthe demand for Medicaid coverage will rise greatly, although immigrants face barriers accessing \nMedicaid benefits because of the public charge rule.  New data from the federal Bureau of Labor \nStatistics shows that immigrants are losing employment faster than the native-born.  Between \nFebruary 2020 and March 2020, the government estimates that the number of immigrant adults \n \n32 Gelatt J., op cit. \n13 \n  App. 64\n\nwho are unemployed rose by 26% in one month alone, while the number of native-born adults \nunemployed grew by 19%.33  Unemployment is rising rapidly and immigrants are \ndisproportionately at risk.  Preliminary analyses by Health Management Associates project how \nhealth insurance coverage will change because of rising unemployment; they estimate that, \ndepending on how high U.S. unemployment levels rise, the number of Americans with \nemployer-sponsored coverage could fall from 163 million (pre-COVID) to between 129 and 151 \nmillion, the number on Medicaid could rise from 71 million (pre-COVID) to 82 to 94 million, \nand the number of uninsured could rise from 29 million (pre-COVID) to as high as 30 to 40 \nmillion.34  In the face of rising unemployment and poverty, Medicaid will prevent millions from \nbecoming uninsured and help maintain their access to medical care.  Unfortunately, the public \ncharge rule sharply reduces the ability of immigrants (and their family members) to get Medicaid \ncoverage, lest its use threatens their immigration status, and thereby lowers their access to \nmedical care. \n25.  In late March 2020, the USCIS posted new guidance about public charge and \nCOVID-19 on its website.35  The new guidance states:  “USCIS encourages all those, including \naliens, with symptoms that resemble Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (fever, cough, \nshortness of breath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services.  Such treatment \nor preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge \nanalysis.”  However, the guidance then continues to state that the receipt of Medicaid benefits \n \n33 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

A key deficiency in the USCIS policy is that health insurance is the primary \nmethod used to pay for medical care, such as testing and treatment.  Access to Medicaid creates \naccess to medical care, including testing, treatment, and prevention services.  Studies have \nconsistently shown, for example, how the recent expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the \nAffordable Care Act led to greater use of medical care, including vaccinations and HIV testing.36  \nWhen people are uninsured, they are less able to use medical care because they have financial \nbarriers that deter them from care; they may avoid or delay care, or health care providers might \nrefuse to provide care if they cannot pay.  Thus, even though USCIS says that COVID-19 testing \nand treatment will not count in public charge determinations, it has created a Catch-22, since the \nMedicaid coverage that would make such services affordable could trigger a public charge \ndetermination of inadmissibility which jeopardizes immigrants’ ability to remain in the United \nStates.  Thus, immigrants are still going to encounter barriers getting COVID-19 care because of \nthe core public charge rule, despite the new statement.  Moreover, since much of the medical \nharm of COVID-19 is related to other medical problems, such as heart disease, asthma, or \ndiabetes, effective treatment may involve care for other medical problems for which insurance is \nnecessary.   \n27.  A second deficiency is that the major response to the public charge rule has been \nfear and confusion in immigrant communities; it is hard to believe that this new administrative \n \n36 Tummalapalli S.L., Keyhani S.

As described above, \nfears about public charge have deterred many from enrolling in programs like WIC, even though \npublic charge does not apply to that benefit, and have also caused members of immigrant \nfamilies who are citizens to withdraw from benefits even though they are also not supposed to be \naffected.  Even if some COVID-19 services are free, the shadow of the public charge rule will \nkeep many from using the services. \n28.  As noted earlier, a number of states, including New York, California, Illinois, \nOregon and the District of Columbia, offer state-funded Medicaid or similar insurance benefits to \ncertain immigrants without federal matching funds.  The public charge rule does not apply to \nthese non-federally funded benefits, but the chilling effect of the public charge rules can deter \neligible immigrants from using these benefits as well and continue to reduce access to medical \ncare.  USCIS has failed to ensure that immigrants and members of their families are aware that \nthese non-federally funded benefits remain safe.   \n29.  Cancelling or suspending the public charge rule is the more effective way to \nensure access to appropriate medical services in order reduce the risks of the COVID-19 \npandemic for immigrants, members of their families, and the communities in which they live, \nand to ensure that everyone has access to appropriate medical care.  Such an approach is more \nconsistent with sound public health policy. \n30.  This is a public health emergency of national scope, which merits prompt national \npolicy responses.  Cases of COVID-19 infection, which exceeded 427,000 as of April 9, 2020, \nhave been identified in every state in the Union.

I am currently a second-year resident physician in psychiatry at the Yale School of \nMedicine (“Yale”).  I graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 2018.   \n2.  In the two years since becoming a resident physician in psychiatry at Yale, I have \nworked in numerous medical facilities in and around New Haven, including the Yale New Haven \nHospital, the Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC), Yale Health (a medical and mental \nhealth clinic servicing the Yale University community), the Yale Psychiatric Hospital (YPH) (an \ninpatient facility specializing in the rapid assessment and treatment of acute and severe psychiatric \nsymptoms), and the West Haven VA Medical Center.  I currently treat patients at CMHC, a \ncommunity health center that provides mental health services for 5,000 people in the Greater New \nHaven area each year, including many immigrants.  In the course of my work as a resident \nphysician, I regularly consult with my colleagues, including doctors, medical students, social \nworkers, and other healthcare professionals. \n1 \n  App. 112\n\n \n3.  During this public health crisis, many of my patients are understandably anxious \nand fearful, and many of my clients have lost their jobs.  Myself and other clinicians regularly \ndiscuss these issues with our clients as part of our therapeutic process. \n4.  In recent weeks, two patients receiving outpatient treatment reported concerns \nabout going to the hospital for COVID-19 care because they worried that any benefits that they \nmight use to access that care—including even the Yale Freecare Program, which I understand is \nnot subject to the Public Charge Rule—might negatively impact their immigration status.   \n5.  As part of my work, I have received reports of multiple patients who had symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19 but were afraid to go to the hospital or even obtain COVID-19 testing \nbecause they were concerned about the public charge consequences of testing and treatment and \nfeared that a huge hospital bill would leave their families destitute.  Immigrants’ concerns and \nfears are ongoing during this crisis.  \n6.  Recently, one of my clients described how they had lost their income and were \nfacing food insecurity.  However, they did not want to seek food stamp benefits because they \nworried that it looked “bad” on an immigration application to get such benefits.  \n7.  I am also a member of the New Haven Medic Collective, a mutual aid medical \ncollective in New Haven comprised of working clinicians.  The Medic Collective provides public \nhealth and information to callers over the telephone.  During the COVID-19 public health crisis, \nour collective regularly advises patients whether and when they should go to a hospital to obtain \nmedical treatment.  \n8.  As part of my work at the Medic Collective, I am aware of at least three individuals \nwho were afraid to get tested for COVID-19 because, among other things, they worried that getting \ntested or being admitted to the hospital would count against them for immigration purposes.  These \ncalls took place during the last few weeks, since the COVID-19 pandemic became of acute concern \n2 \n  App. 113\n\n \nin Connecticut.  Clinicians such as myself and other doctors on the front lines of this crisis are ill-\nequipped to advise patients as to the immigration consequences of their decisions to seek testing \nand treatment.  \n9.  When immigrants or their family members are fearful of obtaining the testing and \ntreatment that they need, they are at a higher risk of complications for COVID-19.  In addition, \nwithout timely and appropriate testing and treatment, their households and other contacts are also \nmuch more likely to spread the illness.  As a medical professional, the Public Charge Rule is a \ncritical barrier to care and is contributing to the spread of illness in our communities.  \n \nDATED this ______day of April, 2020 at PLACE \n \n            ______________________________ \n            DR. EDEN ALMASUDE \n \n3 \n  App. 114\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Bitta Mostofi, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am the Commissioner of the City of New York (the “City”)’s Mayor’s Office of \nImmigrant  Affairs  (“MOIA”).  I  have  worked  at  MOIA  since  2014,  becoming  Acting \nCommissioner in 2017 and appointed Commissioner in 2018. As Commissioner, I provide advice \nand guidance to the Mayor, his staff in other divisions of the Mayor’s Office, and to other City \nagencies, on a range of issues related to immigration. I also guide and oversee the work of \napproximately 70 City employees assigned to work on fulfilling MOIA’s mission. \n2.  MOIA, established in the Charter of the City of New York in 2001 by referendum, \ndevelops and implements policies designed to assist immigrants across the city by enhancing their \neconomic, civic, and social integration into the community. In order to achieve that mission, MOIA \nconducts research and analysis, provides guidance to other City agencies, develops partnerships \nwith community-based organizations, and advocates at all levels of government. \n1 \n  App. 115\n\n3.  I  swear  this  declaration  to  describe  the  way  in  which  the  rule  entitled \n“Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,” (the “Rule”), which the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) began implementing on February 24, 2020, has fostered widespread confusion, \nuncertainty, and fear among members of New York City’s immigrant community in the midst of \na public health crisis, when we can least afford the potential devastating consequences of that \nconfusion, uncertainty and fear on the food security and health of immigrant communities in the \ncity, and on the public health of the city as a whole. I base my declaration on my own personal \nknowledge and observations, on regular briefings that I receive from MOIA’s staff, and on my \nreview of the business records of the City and its agencies. \n4.   Given  MOIA’s  mission,  and  its  strong  relationships  with  the  immigrant \ncommunity,  ethnic  media,  as  well  as  with  non-governmental  organizations  that  serve  the \nimmigrant community, we have taken the lead on and coordinated much of the City’s response to \nthe  expanded  scope  of  the  Rule.  Through  this  work,  we  have  engaged  a  wide  range  of \nstakeholders—from health care leaders to social service organizations to legal service providers \nand other local government leaders—to raise awareness about the Rule and to mitigate its impact \non New York City’s immigrant communities. \nActionNYC Immigration Hotline \n5.  Among the many steps that the City has taken to empower immigrants in New York \nCity to make informed decisions about their lives, including their benefit utilization in the face of \nthe  expanded  Rule,  is  the  expansion  of  ActionNYC,  the  City’s  central  immigration-related \ntelephone hotline. ActionNYC, overseen and funded by the City through MOIA in partnership \nwith the City University of New York, is the City’s program to connect immigrant New Yorkers \nto free, safe, and high-quality immigration legal services in their community and their language. It \n2 \n  App. 116\n\noperates through a citywide hotline, a centralized appointment-making system, and accessible \nservice locations at 21 community-based organizations, rotating public school locations, and \npublic hospitals.  \n6.  The City, through MOIA, has expanded the staffing and capacity of the citywide \nActionNYC hotline, operated by Catholic Charities, in response to significant developments in \nimmigration law such as the expansion of public charge. In the months leading up to and following \npublication of the final Rule in August 2019, MOIA worked closely with Catholic Charities to \nprepare the ActionNYC hotline for an anticipated surge in demand, tasking it with, among other \nthings, (1) expanding its scope to address immigrant New Yorkers’ questions about the categories \nof people to whom public charge applies; (2) connecting immigrants in need of legal assistance \nwith a City-funded ActionNYC navigation team qualified to provide legal screening, advice, and \nassistance, including assistance in the process  of preparing and filing public charge-related \nimmigration forms; and if necessary, (3) referring immigrants with more complex public charge-\nrelated legal needs to specialists at the Legal Aid Society.  \n7.  In January and February 2020, with the announcements and attendant media \ncoverage about the fact that the Supreme Court had stayed the nationwide preliminary injunction \nthat had been holding in abeyance the final Rule, and that USCIS would begin implementation of \nthe Rule in late February, the ActionNYC hotline saw considerable spikes in activity. Average \nmonthly call volume to the hotline in 2019 was 1,888, however, the volume of calls to the hotline \nincreased in January and February 2020. Notably, on January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court stayed \nthe nationwide preliminary injunction, and on January 30, 2020, USCIS announced that the Rule \nwould take effect on February 24th. Following those events in late January, there was a spike in \ncalls to the hotline: prior to January 27th, the average daily call volume in FY2020 was 99; on \n3 \n  App. 117\n\nJanuary 27th and 28th, daily call volume jumped by 35% and 77%, respectively, to 134 and 175 \ncalls. Similarly, on January 30th, the hotline received 137 calls, a 38% increase from the FY2020 \ndaily average.  \n8.  During February 2020, calls to the ActionNYC hotline increased to 2,973, a 57% \nincrease from the monthly average in 2019. In addition, there was another substantial spike in calls \nbeginning when the Rule took effect: 201 calls were received on February 24th, and 263 on \nFebruary 25th, increases of 103% and 166%, respectively, over the FY2020 average daily call \nvolume. In addition to an increase in total calls to the hotline, the number of those calls that related \nto the Rule also increased: at least 544 calls to ActionNYC in February and March 2020 concerned \npublic charge. Alarmingly, in February 2020, nine callers to the hotline were so insistent on \ndisenrolling from public benefits—even though they were entitled to the benefits and not subject \nto a public charge test—that hotline operators had to refer them to specialists at the Legal Aid \nSociety for more in-depth counseling on the public charge rule. \n9.  This past month, as the COVID-19 pandemic became an increased threat to the \nhealth, safety and well-being of New Yorkers, calls to the ActionNYC continued at rates 15% \nhigher than the 2019 average. For example, in March 2020, the ActionNYC hotline received 2,166 \ncalls, and 7% of those calls related to public charge. In addition, in the second half of March as \nNYC began to implement stay at home policies,  the ActionNYC hotline received 12 calls related \nto the implications of the Rule for COVID-19. These calls were from immigrants with legal \npermanent resident status who had lost their jobs, and were concerned about whether having \napplied for or received unemployment benefits would be held against them if they sought to adjust \ntheir immigration status in the future. These calls demonstrate the continued confusion about and \nchilling effect of the Rule, even amongst those to whom it does not apply. \n4 \n  App. 118\n\nCommunity Outreach in Light of COVID-19 \n10.  Over the past two years, as changes to public charge inadmissibility were rumored, \nproposed, and then enacted, the City became aware of a high likelihood of chilling effect on use \nof benefits within immigrant communities. First, a survey that MOIA commissioned in 2018 found \nthat 76% of non-citizens surveyed would consider withdrawing from, or not applying for, public \nbenefits, as a result of the public charge rule. Monitoring of calls to the ActionNYC hotline has \nconfirmed that benefit disenrollment is a real concern: just since October 2019, hotline operators \nhave referred 23 callers for a more in-depth public charge-related benefits screening when they \ninsisted on disenrolling from public benefits despite being exempt from a public charge test.  \n11.  As a result, MOIA has focused substantial resources on community outreach, \nundertaken in coordination with our community partners, in an effort to counteract that chilling \neffect. MOIA’s outreach efforts have continued since the expanded Public Charge Rule came into \neffect on February 24, 2020, and they continue now during the public health crisis that has engulfed \nthe city. As part of this outreach, MOIA’s staff has listened to community concerns about the \nchanges to public charge, and has sought to correct misinformation and misunderstandings about \nthis  very  complex  topic,  and  to  urge  immigrants  to  make  use  of  the  substantial  legal  and \ninformational resources that the City has made available before making any decisions about \nforgoing medical care, and about enrollment in or disenrollment from benefits. MOIA has also \nfocused its efforts on assessing community needs in light of the COVID-19 crisis. \n12.  During MOIA’s recent outreach engagements, immigrants—directly or through \ncommunity organizations working on their behalf—have shared the agonizing decisions they face \nof whether or not to seek out desperately needed SNAP, Medicaid, and other benefits because of \nfears that it may result in them being separated from their loved ones, or may put at risk their \n5 \n  App. 119\n\ndreams of obtaining or extending a visa or obtaining a green card, in hopes of eventually becoming \nAmerican citizens.  \n13.  As troubling as the chilling effect of Public Charge has always been to the City, we \nare even more concerned that during the COVID-19 pandemic that chilling effect can and will \nhave deadly consequences. Specifically, it has become apparent that certain immigrants are \nmaking the decision to forego medical screening and treatment due to fear about the public charge \nimplications of seeking that treatment. While USCIS apparently recognized this potential chilling \neffect of public charge, and issued guidance aimed at counteracting it, our observations suggest \nthat it has not been successful in achieving that goal. \n14.  On or around March 13, 2020, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS) posted an alert (in English only). This alert explained that while the Public Charge rule \n“does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including \nCOVID-19,” USCIS was nonetheless required to “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-\ncash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination,” including most forms of federally funded \nMedicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge. \n15.  Since that time, and despite that guidance, we have heard from our community \npartners that immigrants continue to be hesitant to seek out medical care, even when they are \nmanifesting symptoms of illness. For example, on March 24, 2020, a community partner who \nprovides services to food service workers in the City reported that members of its constituency, \ndespite  feeling  ill,  are  afraid  to  seek  treatment  in  public  hospitals  for  fear  of immigration \nconsequences. Similarly, another community partner who works on behalf of youth and their \nfamilies, described fear within the community about seeking medical care because of immigration \n6 \n  App. 120\n\nstatus. Finally, yet another community partner, this one a neighborhood-based family and social \nservices organization serving immigrant communities in Brooklyn, reported that immigrants it \nserved were afraid to seek out and obtain COVID-19 testing due to fear about how that might \nimpact their status.  \n16.  Through our recent community outreach, we have also learned that New York \nCity’s immigrant communities have been drastically and negatively impacted by the slowdown \nand shutdown of so many industries that make up the City’s economic engines due to COVID-19, \nresulting in a desperate need for assistance with rent, food, and medication. Community partners \nhave reported that the city’s restaurant and domestic workers have been incredibly hard hit, and \nwith little to no savings, these workers are facing a need to go out and perform jobs that no one \nelse wants to do, despite the fact that doing so would expose themselves to risk. We have also \nlearned that many in the immigrant community are struggling due to a lack of access to paid \nmedical leave, and ineligibility to receive federal aid or unemployment benefits due to either the \nnature of the work they perform, or their immigration status.  \n17.  On the other hand, other community partners report that even those immigrant New \nYorkers who may be eligible for federal disaster aid or other public benefits are hesitant to apply \nfor or accept such benefits, and have expressed a fear that accepting any public benefits might \nresult in a public charge determination that would carry negative immigration consequences. For \nexample, during a conversation among over 400 members of an online chat group operated by a \ncommunity partner serving a defined immigrant community, at least 10 participants—most of \nwhom had applied for or been granted asylum—asked whether applying for SNAP or cash benefits \nfrom the City would adversely affect their applications for green cards and/or citizenship. Another \nexample is a construction worker from Brooklyn who is unemployed due to COVID-19 and has a \n7 \n  App. 121\n\npending green card application, including a scheduled interview. This worker asked whether an \napplication for unemployment benefits could negatively impact his green card application, and our \nstaff was able to direct him to the ActionNYC hotline for further guidance.  \n18.  Based on MOIA’s information and outreach, it appears likely that USCIS’ March \n13, 2020 statement that it would “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, \nincluding those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge \ninadmissibility determination,” contributes significantly to the fear and confusion we are seeing in \nthe immigrant community, despite our efforts to encourage community members to seek and \naccept public benefits where they are eligible for them. \n19.  Based on what we have learned in the course of our community outreach efforts, \nwe have serious concerns that the chilling effect of the public charge rule is interfering with the \nCity’s ability to effectively respond to the medical, and economic needs of immigrant communities \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct and of my own personal \nknowledge. \nDATED this __9th__ day of April, 2020 at New York, New York \n   \n  ______________________ \nBITTA MOSTOFI \nCommissioner \nMayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs \nCity of New York \n253 Broadway, 14th Floor \nNew York, NY 10007 \n8 \n  App. 122\n\n \n       \n \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \nI, Sabrina Fong, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am Deputy Director of Research and Policy Advisor at the City of New York (the \n“City”)’s Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (“MOIA”). MOIA, established in the Charter of \nthe City of New York in 2001 by referendum, develops and implements policies designed to assist \nimmigrants across the City by enhancing their economic, civic, and social integration into the \ncommunity. In order to achieve that mission, MOIA conducts research and analysis, provides \nguidance to other City agencies, develops partnerships with community-based organizations, and \nadvocates at all levels of government. \n2.  I have been employed by MOIA since May 2015, and have held my current role \nsince November 2018. In my capacity as Deputy Director of Research and Policy Advisor, I am \nresponsible for developing MOIA’s strategic research initiatives, including by conducting data \nanalysis, working with data experts on their research, data analysis, planning, coordination and \nApp. 123\n \n\n \ndata forecasting, and by translating research and analysis into reports and presentations. As such, \nI am familiar with research and data analysis undertaken by MOIA. \n3.  I swear this declaration to describe an analysis that I undertook in April 2020 to \nquantify  the  representation  of  immigrant  and  non-citizen  New  Yorkers  in  certain  frontline \noccupations, namely those occupations requiring in-person interaction with the public, that were \namong those occupations deemed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to be essential to New \nYork during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, to summarize (1) the data that was \nanalyzed, and (2) the analysis that was undertaken, and (3) the results of the analysis. I base my \ndeclaration on my own personal knowledge, work performed, and data analysis. \n4.  On  or  about  March  18,  2020,  New  York  Governor  Andrew  Cuomo  issued \nExecutive Order 202.6 (“Order 202.6”), directing that businesses in New York utilize to the \nmaximum extent possible any telecommuting or work from home procedures and reduce their in-\nperson workforce by at least 50%.  Order 202.6 exempted certain essential businesses from the \n“work from home” directive. Following the issuance of the Order 202.6, the Empire State \nDevelopment  Corporation  (“Empire  State  Development”)  was  to  provide  a  detailed  list  of \n“essential  businesses”  by  March  19,  2020.  See  Executive  Order  202.6,  found  at \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-2026-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-\nmodification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency. \n5.  On or about March 19, 2020, Empire State Development announced a list of 12 \ncategories of businesses that were designated as essential during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) \nessential health care operations; (2) essential infrastructure; (3) essential manufacturing; (4) \nessential retail, (5) essential services, (6) news media; (7) financial institutions, (8) providers of \nbasic necessities to economically disadvantaged populations; (9) construction; (10) defense; (11) \n  2    \nApp. 124\n \n\n \nessential services necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation and essential operations of residences \nor  other  essential  businesses;  and  (12)  vendors  that  provide  essential  services  or  products, \nincluding logistics and technology support, child care and services. See “Governor Cuomo Issues \nGuidance on Essential Services Under the ‘New York State on Pause’ Executive Order,” found at \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-issues-guidance-essential-services-under-\nnew-york-state-pause-executive-order.  Within each category of essential businesses, Empire State \nDevelopment  list  several  sub-categories  of  essential  occupations.  For  example,  essential \noccupations in the category of essential healthcare operations include doctors, home healthcare \nworkers, hospital staff, medical billing support personnel, and individuals working in research and \nlaboratory services.   \n6.  On March 20, 2020, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.8 (“Order \n202.8” or “New York State of Pause” Order), which expanded the reduction of the in-person \nworkforce in non-essential businesses to 100%.  Order 202.8 retained the same exemptions for \nessential businesses as Order 202.6.   \n7.  It was in this context that I undertook, on behalf of MOIA, an analysis of the \ndesignated  essential  businesses  and  their  component  industries  and  occupations,  and  the \ndemographic makeup in New York City of those industries and occupations, to better understand \nthe demographics of the New York City population that would be exempted from the Governor’s \n“work from home” directive, and thereby be placed at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 during \nthe course of performing their essential functions for the benefit of the city and state.  \n8.  The source data for my analysis was the 2018 American Community Survey \n(“ACS”), an annual survey administered by the United States Census Bureau to a random sample \nof American households every year, with an estimated response rate of 95%. In particular, I \n  3    \nApp. 125\n \n\n \nanalyzed the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample at the Community District Level, focusing on the \n55 Public Use Microdata Areas that roughly correlate to the Community Districts that make up \nNew York City. \n9.  Within the 55 Public Use Microdata Areas of New York City, I filtered the ACS \nmicrodata by place of birth and citizenship status of respondents, and by those industries and \noccupations that most closely approximated the businesses deemed to be essential by Empire State \nDevelopment that could not be done remotely.  \n10.  In conducting the analysis, I matched as closely as possible the Census industry and \noccupational categories to those identified as “essential businesses” by Empire State Development, \nerring on the side of under-inclusiveness by omitting categories of industries and occupations \nwhere there was not a clear match to those categories identified by New York State as essential.1 \nIn addition, for some of the industries and occupations falling into the “essential business” \ncategories and sub-categories, working from home may be feasible, allowing in-person interaction \nwith customers to be avoided. Those occupations were also excluded from the analysis. \n11.  Based on the ACS data, non-citizens make up approximately 16% of the New York \nCity population, and 19% of the New York City workforce. Immigrants make up 44% of the New \nYork City workforce.2 \n12.  The top-line findings of my analysis were that non-citizens and immigrants are \ndisproportionately represented in the occupations and industries that have been deemed by the \n                                                 \n1 For example, under the essential businesses guidance provided by Empire State Development, \nconstruction workers would only be considered essential where construction was being undertaken \nfor essential structural or emergency repair, and thus I did not include construction workers as \nfalling within essential occupations generally in my analysis. \n2 The term immigrants refers to naturalized U.S. citizens and non-citizens, combined together.  \n  4    \nApp. 126\n \n\n \nGovernor to be essential businesses exempted from the ‘New York State on Pause’ “work from \nhome” directive. For example, while non-citizens are approximately 19% of the New York City \nworkforce, they are approximately 24% of the workforce in the essential industries—that is the \nU.S. Census-categorized industries that correspond to Governor’s “essential businesses,” and \napproximately  26%  of  the  workforce  in  essential  occupations—that  is,  the  U.S.  Census-\ncategorized  occupations  within  the  essential  industries.3  Similarly,  while  immigrants  are \napproximately 44% of the New York City workforce, they represent approximately 56% of the \nworkforce in the essential industries, and 58% of the workforce in essential occupations. \n13.  The numbers are even more stark when particular occupations are considered—for \nexample in New York City, non-citizens make up 42.4% and immigrants 81.5% of home health \naides; non-citizens make up 29.1% and immigrants 68.3% of personal care aides; non-citizens \nmake up 42.3% of cooks and 44.4% of chefs and head cooks, and immigrants 65.5% of cooks, and \n71.7% of chefs and head cooks; non-citizens make up 26.9% and immigrants 53.4% of janitors \nand building cleaners; non-citizens make up 37.1% and immigrants 59.2% of food preparation \nworkers; non-citizens make up 37.3% and immigrants 84.8% of taxi drivers; and non-citizens \nmake up 56.3% and immigrants 87.0% of laundry and dry-cleaning workers. \n14.  I prepared a spreadsheet of the findings of my analysis, for use by MOIA to help \nidentify, and guide outreach to and protection of non-citizen and immigrant populations in New \nYork City who are particularly at risk for exposure to COVID-19. Attached as Exhibits A, B, and \nC  to  this  declaration  are  spreadsheets  documenting  the  main  findings  with  regard  to  the \n                                                 \n3 As the U.S. Census uses them, an “industry” describes the kind of business conducted by a \nperson's employing organization; an “occupation” is the kind of work a person does to earn a \nliving. For example, two people can be in the same industry (medical) but have two very different \noccupations, such as a nurse in the medical industry or an accountant for that industry.   \n  5    \nApp. 127\n \n\nDocuSign Envelope ID: B86B9BB5-9BFB-4BE8-9400-98339736C1E2\n \ndemographic makeup of the New York City workforce in the industries and occupations that exist \nwithin the designated “essential businesses.” \n15.

I am over the age of eighteen. I am an attorney licensed to practice law before the State of \nNew York. I am also admjtted to appear before the District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York. \n2.  I am the Director of the Public Benefits Unit (\"PBU\") at Bronx Legal Services (\"BxLS\"). \n3.  BxLS is a constituent corporation of Legal Services NYC (\"LSNYC\"), which is the largest \nprovider of free civil legal services in the nation. \n4.  The public charge rule changes have made us all more vulnerable to this new global health \ncrisis. In the recent weeks and months, COVID-19 has created new emergencies, new \nproblems, and new inequities among and for noncitizen New Yorkers. This virus has created \nnew ways in which the new public charge rules are irreparably harming noncitizens, their \nfamilies, and the communities in which we live. \nThe Public Benefits Unit at Bronx Legal Services \n5.  The PBU of BxLS is the largest single team of public advocates in the State of New York, \nApp. 136\n\nwith 21 advocates, including attorneys, paralegals, and masters-level social workers. Our \nPBU works to obtain, retain, or increase a wide spectrum of vital public benefits \nadministered by the New York City Department of Social Services (\"DSS\"), the New York \nState of Health (\"NYSOH\"), the New York State Department of Health (\"SDOH\"), and other \nrelated city and state agencies. \n6.  From January 1, 2019, through March 25, 2020, we handled almost 3,500 individual public \nbenefits cases, helping over 6,800 Bronx residents. More than one-quarter of our clients are \nnoncitizens, and more than one-third of client households contain at least one noncitizen. \n7.  Our PBU provides representation, advocacy, advice, and assistance on a number of different \npublic benefits, including: \na.  Cash public assistance benefits, including those funded by federal Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (\"TA  NF\") monies I and those funded by New York;2 \nb.  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\") benefits,3 formerly known as \nFood Stamps; \nc.  Child care benefits for recipients of public assistance with work requirements;4 \nd.  Women, Infants, & Children (\"WIC\") benefits,5 which is a voucher program that \ncovers certain nutritious foods for children under age 5, pregnant women, and new \nmothers; \ne.  Public health insurance such as Medicaid,6 Medicare,7 and Essential Plans \n1 See, e.g., N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. § 349. \n2 See, e.g., N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. § 159. \n3 See 7 U.S.C. § 201 I, et seq. \n4 See N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. § 410-w. \n5 See 42 U.S.C. § 1786. \n6See generally42 U.S.C. § 1396, etseq.;N.Y. Soc. Serv.

Personal care/home care services9 for disabled, infirm, and elderly clients who want \nto age in place as an alternative to institutionalization; \ng.  Veteran's benefits; and, \nh.  HIV/AIDS Services Administration (\"HASA\")10 benefits. \n8.  In addition to our direct legal services, which are the heart of our practice, we also maintain \ndeep roots in the communities we serve by running clinics and conducting outreach, \ncommunity trainings, and other events. Since January 2019, our PBU conducted over 42 \ndifferent trainings or clinics, reaching over 1,800 people. \n9.  After the announcement of the proposed public charge changes in October 2017, our PBU \nimmediately saw a spike in requests for advice and information about how the receipt of \npublic benefits will affect people's immigration status. Within the fust few days after the \nproposed public charge rules were initially reported in the press, we received calls from \ndozens of social services agencies and individual clients who were concerned about the \nchanges. Many of the individuals had closed their public benefits cases, and those of their \ncitizen children, as a precautionary measure even before receiving any advice. \n10. Those first two weeks highlighted the fear among noncitizen clients and communities, as \nwell as in the social service agencies helping these communities, and the need for us to \nprovide accurate information expeditiously. We created a flyer with our hotline number and \ninvited people to call our hotline for a consultation on public charge issues. \n11. As of late March 2020 and excluding the flood of inquiries we initially received in October \n8 42 U.S.C. § 18001, et seq. \n9 See, e.g., N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. § 365-a. \n10 See, e.g., N.Y.C. Admin. Code§§ 26-126, -127, & -128; 18 N.Y.C.R.R. § 352.3(k). \n3 \nApp. 138\n\n2017, our PBU has conducted almost 600 individual consultations for noncitizens about the \npublic charge rule. Around 75% of our consultations include concerns or questions \nnoncitizens have about the receipt of SNAP and/or Medicaid. \n12. PBU has conducted several different public charge-related events, including community-\nfacing trainings, clinics for people with questions about how public charge will affect them, \nand different trainings on the public charge doctrine for advocates. The community events \nthat we have held were flooded with attendees. We could not possibly meet individually with \nevery person who attended our public charge community clinics and trainings. \n13. Attendance at our community trainings markedly increased in winter 2019-2020, drawing in \naudiences of approximately double the size we had been experiencing in summer 2019. \n14. Thus, our perspective about what the changes to the public charge doctrine have done, will \ndo, and are doing to our noncitizen clients is based on our on-the-ground experience \nproviding direct services to thousands of individuals. \nCOVID-19 Has Accelerated & Amplified the Harm of the Public Charge Rule Changes \n15. In a matter of days, our country's economic, public henefitc;, and public health systems \nchanged due to COVID-19. As employment collapsed practically overnight, we were \nreminded of the central role that access to health care, nutrition, and subsistence benefits has \nnot only in the well-being of individuals but also in the health and vibrancy of communities, \nneighborhoods, and cities. Unfortunately, the changes to the public charge rule - and the fear \nsurrounding it- gravely threaten the ability of noncitizens, their families, and our \ncommunities to remain healthy. \n16. Because SNAP and Medicaid were added to public charge consideration for essentially the \nfirst time in history, these benefits quickly became the focus for noncitizens' growing fears \n4 \nApp. 139\n\nsurrounding the consequences of obtaining assistance. In recent months, we have seen \nnoncitizens disenrolling themselves (and, at times, their citizen children or other family \nmembers) from Medicaid and nutritional support programs, like SNAP and WIC. \n17. As a result, the most frequent questions we receive from noncitizens and their advocates are, \n\"Will using Medicaid cause my children or me to be deported? Is it safe for us to use \nMedicaid?\" \n18. Many New Yorkers mistakenly believe they are receiving Medicaid as defmed in the public \ncharge rule, due to misunderstanding of the program in general. As a result, thousands of \npeople think they receive Medicaid when, in fact, they are in receipt of other low-cost health \ninsurance programs. Unfortunately, the misinformation and fear has taken on a life of its \nown, and we have seen hundreds of clients close their \"Medicaid\" cases for themselves, their \ncitizen children, and other family members. \n19. Particularly in Queens and the Bronx, we have encountered many noncitizens who are afraid \nto get COVID-19 testing. First and foremost, the reason we have heard time and again behind \nthe reluctance to get tested is simple: people are afraid that testing requires Medicaid, which \nwould get them depo1ted. Rather than promoting the public good, the public charge doctrine \nis endangering our communities by deterring people from obtaining COVID-19 testing and \nassistance that is critical to flattening the curve and reducing transmission. \n20. The \"guidance\" issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") \nin recent weeks about public charge and accessing care for COV  ID-19 has not offered any \ncomfort or clarity for both advocates and noncitizen community members. If anything, it \nonly introduced more fear among noncitizen communities, since the alert seems to \nequivocate on how, whether, when or if seeking COVID-19 treatment would trigger public \ncharge issues. \n5 \nApp. 140\n\nWithout Medicaid, Noncitizens Stop Treating Chronic Conditions \n21. Disenrollment from Medicaid has a very real consequence: people stop attending primary \ncare appointments and stop seeking medical help, until there are life-threatening \nemergencies. While this result is dire in any circumstance - from diabetes management to \nearly breast cancer screenings - the COVID-19 pandemic has potentially made early access \nto care a life-or-death decision for individuals, their families, and their communities. Primary \ncare is critical in treating asthma and hypertension, which, along with diabetes, are \nunderlying conditions that have been associated with more severe COVID-19 complications. \n22. In the span of a few weeks, we have begun to see first-hand what delayed primary care has \ndone to noncitizens who were afraid to use Medicaid, though I fear the suffering will \ncontinue to grow as the COVID-19 pandemic peaks in New York City. Our clients have left \nconditions untreated because they closed Medicaid cases to be \"safe\" and because \"it wasn't \nworth the risk to treat asthma\" only to fall extremely ill with shortness of breath, high fevers, \nheadaches, body aches, and chills. One of our clients is now hospitalized. \n23. We also have HIV-positive clients who closed out their HASA benefits when the public \ncharge rules went into effect. HASA benefits include health and nutrition support benefits for \npeople living with HIV/AIDS. Lack of consistent HIV care causes viral loads to skyrocket \nand immune systems to crash. With COVID-19 now a global pandemic, we are terrified what \nwill happen to HIV-positive noncitizens who have foregone public health insurance, like \nMedicaid, and other benefits out of fear that they will be deported. \nSignificant increases in requests for public benefits assistance since COVID-19 \n24. Comparing the weeks before COVID-19 with the most recent two weeks, we have seen an \n850% increase in requests for assistance with public benefits issues. \n6 \nApp. 141\n\n25. A substantial part of that increase includes requests for assistance from noncitizens who are \ntrying to access health care without insurance. Although almost all of the people seeking our \nassistance were otherwise eligible for low-or no-cost insurance programs, they had \ndisenrolled from, or wanted to avoid enrolling in, health insurance plans out of fear that they \nor their families would be deported. \n26. Since the public charge changes went into effect in late February 2020, we have seen an \nincrease in noncitizen clients seeking emergency food assistance, including food pantries. \nEven in families in which only citizen children are eligible for SNAP, we have seen a \nreluctance to use or receive the benefit out of fear of deportation and family separation. The \nhunger we have seen in our noncitizen clients has become so severe that we now bring Food \nBank NYC booklets to our intake meetings in anticipation of the need for pantry assistance. \n27. The advent of COVID-19 has turned unreliable access to nutrition into a public health crisis, \nrendering noncitizens and their neighbors more vulnerable to the ravages ofCOVID-19. We \nalso saw a wave of unemployment crash down on low-income New Yorkers - particularly \nthose most vulnerable to job loss, including noncitizens who are home health aides, \ncaregivers, cleaners, and janitors- which has immeasurably exacerbated and increased the \nneed for SNAP and nutrition supports generally. Right now in the Bronx, virtually all of the \nfood pantries have closed or sharply reduced hours due to COVID-19, which eliminates a \nvital lifeline for noncitizens who are hungry. The few pantries that remain open during this \ncrisis are running out of food at alarming rates, with a significant portion of people seeking \ntheir help being noncitizens. \n28. The public charge rule changes drove and are driving noncitizens and their families off of \ncritical benefits, including low-cost health insurance and SNAP, and have rendered low-\n7 \nApp. 142\n\nincome noncitizens even more susceptible to this vims, and in doing so have made all of us \nless safe. \nDATED this 7th day of April, 2020, at New York, NY \nDirecto , \nBronx Legal Services \n349 E. 1491h Street, 10th Floor \nBronx, NY 10451 \njnewton@lsnyc.org \n(718) 928-3691 \n8 \nApp. 143\n\n \nDeclaration of the New York Legal Assistance Group \n \nI, Sarah Nolan, under penalty of perjury, hereby declare: \n1.  My name is Sarah Nolan. I am a Supervising Attorney in the LegalHealth division \nof the New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG).  I have nine years of \nexperience providing immigration legal services and developing legal services \nprograms in New York City. \n2.  NYLAG is a not-for-profit legal services organization located in New York City. \nNYLAG uses the power of the law to help New Yorkers in need combat social \nand economic injustice. We address emerging and urgent legal needs with \ncomprehensive, free civil legal services, impact litigation, policy advocacy, and \ncommunity education. NYLAG serves immigrants, veterans, seniors, the \nhomebound, families facing foreclosure, renters facing eviction, low-income \nconsumers, those in need of government assistance, children in need of special \neducation, domestic violence victims, people with disabilities, patients with \nchronic illness or disease, low-wage workers, low-income members of the \nLGBTQ community, Holocaust survivors, as well as others in need of free legal \nservices.  \n3.  NYLAG’s LegalHealth Unit is the nation’s largest medical-legal partnership, with \nclinics at 36 hospitals and community health organizations in New York City, \nWestchester County and Long Island. LegalHealth complements health care with \nlegal care by providing free legal services onsite at medical facilities and training \nhealth care professionals to understand the legal issues their patients face as well \nas their role in addressing these issues. The majority of LegalHealth’s clients are \nindividuals with chronic and serious illnesses, including cancer, end-stage renal \ndisease, high blood pressure, diabetes, HIV, asthma and heart disease.   \nLegalHealth’s immigration practice provides comprehensive legal services on a \nwide range of issues, including naturalization, adjustment of status, relative \npetitions, asylum, U & T Visas and VAWA self-petitions, medical deferred \naction, visa extensions and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). \n4.  NYLAG’s attorneys, especially in LegalHealth’s medical-legal partnership \nsetting, have a unique perspective about how the public charge inadmissibility  \nrule has profoundly impacted immigrants as they grapple with difficult decisions \nabout their health care and immigration status.  In December 2018, NYLAG \nsubmitted public comments objecting to the proposed changes to the rule.  Our \ncomments detailed the myriad ways in which our clients’ fear of the public charge \nrule has led to serious health consequences for themselves and their families.  \nSince the proposed rule was first leaked, and through the present, our attorneys \nhave advised many clients who express profound fear that receiving medical care \n1 \n  App. 144\n\nfor themselves or their families will cause them to be denied their green cards on \npublic charge grounds. We have had to explain to doctors and social workers why \npatients they were treating successfully may have suddenly disappeared or \nrefused to continue their care. We have seen that immigrants across the \nspectrum—from lawful permanent residents seeking to naturalize, to those \napplying for humanitarian relief or family-based adjustment of status to the \nundocumented—are all worried about the implications of the rule changes on \ntheir immigration status.   Our public comments provided numerous case \nexamples of how this fear has lead immigrants to forego life-saving treatment, \ndiscontinue chronic care disease management, and decline preventive care for \nthemselves and their family members.  \n5.  LegalHealth also has a unique perspective on the devastating impact of the public \ncharge rule because of our close relationships with medical professionals, who \nhave continually sought our advice on how to combat the widespread chilling \neffect  on  immigrant  families’  willingness  to  apply  for  Medicaid  and  seek \nhealthcare.  In response, LegalHealth has conducted or participated in over 30 \ntrainings and community events related to public charge in partnership with New \nYork  City  Health  +  Hospitals,  the  Greater  New  York  Hospital  Association \n(GNYHA),  Mt.  Sinai  Hospital,  Weill  Cornell  Hospital,  National  Center  for \nMedical Legal Partnership, and others. LegalHealth trains medical professionals \nabout the rule, how to communicate with patients and how to refer concerned \npatients for legal advice. To supplement our training program, LegalHealth set up \na specialized hotline to provide information about the public charge rule to our \npartner health care professionals and patients. \n6.  Even  with  the  extensive  efforts  by  NYLAG’s  LegalHealth  unit  and  other \nadvocates to train and provide information and advice to health professionals and \nimmigrant  communities,  we  continue  to  observe  a  high  level  of  ongoing \nconfusion and fear about the public charge rule.  \n7.  Now, with New York as the epicenter of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, \nwith a staggering 159,937 cases to date, including 7,067 deaths, we are facing an \nunprecedented public health crisis.  The impact of pandemic among immigrant \ncommunities will be even more catastrophic as a result of the continued fear in \nimmigrant communities related to public charge.  \n8.  NYLAG revised its materials after March 14, 2020 to reflect the USCIS \nannouncement that COVID-19 related treatment would not be considered in the \npublic charge analysis. With our extensive experience over two years trying to \nallay fear and confusion among immigrants related to public charge, we believe \nthis announcement on it own is not nearly sufficient to overcome the newly-\nemerging fears around public charge in the current COVID-19 crisis. \n9.  Since March 2020, NYLAG’s LegalHealth unit has observed that community \n2 \n  App. 145\n\nmembers are already declining or delaying seeking health treatment and applying \nfor benefits  that are  needed because of the COVID-19 pandemic because of \npublic charge concerns as demonstrated by the following examples. \n10. A LegalHealth client with a pending U visa who is residing in a shelter had \nCOVID-19 like symptoms and was seriously ill, but did not want to go to a \nhospital  for  testing  and  treatment  out  of  fear  it  would  impact  her  pending \napplication.  \n11. A lawful permanent resident who lost his job recently called the LegalHealth \npublic charge hotline with concerns that receiving Medicaid and applying for \nunemployment would impact his permanent residency. \n12. NYLAG has received requests for assistance from temporary non-immigrants in \nNew York, such as those on B2 visas, who intended to return to their home \ncountries  but  are  now  unable  to  because  of  travel  restrictions  and  cancelled \nflights.  Most urgently, these immigrants who were not planning to remain in the \nU.S., are now scrambling to figure out how to continue to support themselves \nhere.  Some now require medical care that they were not intending to receive in \nthe U.S., such as emergency labor and delivery services, treatment for cancer, or \ntreatment for COVID-19.  Several clients have expressed concern about how they \nwill  support  themselves  now  without  causing  public  charge  problems  in  the \nfuture. \n13. NYLAG has also received questions from immigrants who are concerned about \napplying for unemployment benefits, emergency benefits, or cash assistance after \nlosing a job due to the closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Clients have \nexpressed fear that applying for or receiving these benefits will have a negative \nimpact on their current immigration status or on a pending application for \nbenefits.   \n14. As with health-related benefits, this fear of applying for benefits needed because \nof COVID-19 related job losses exists among those not subject to public charge \ninadmissibility.  For example, a NYLAG client who is a lawful permanent \nresident and wishes to eventually apply for citizenship expressed concerns about \napplying for public assistance after recently losing a job due to the COVID-19 \ncrisis.    \n15. The above examples provide clear evidence that immigrants, regardless of their \nlegal status, remain extremely fearful of accessing healthcare and benefits as a \nresult of the public charge rule.  These fears are now causing immigrant clients to \ndelay seeking urgently needed medical and financial help related to COVID-19, \ncompounding the harms already caused by this public health crisis of  \nunprecedented scale and scope.   \n \n3 \n  App. 146\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the \nforegoing is true and correct. \n \nDated:   New York, New York \n    April 10, 2020 \n \n \n        Sarah Nolan \n        Supervising Attorney, LegalHealth   \n        New York Legal Assistance Group \n7 Hanover Square, 18th Floor \n            New York, NY 10004 \n            212-613-5059 \n \n \n4 \n  App. 147\n\n \n \n \n \nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  I, C.

CCCS-NY’s mission is to provide high quality human services to New Yorkers of \nall nationalities and religions who are in need, especially the most vulnerable: the newcomer, the \nfamily in danger of becoming homeless, the hungry child, developing youth, and persons \nstruggling with mental health issues.  CCCS-NY’s mission is grounded in the belief in the \ndignity of each person and the building of a just and compassionate society. \n4.  CCCS-NY has been pursuing this mission since 1949 through a network of \nprograms and services that enable participants to access eviction/homelessness prevention; tenant \neducation and financial literacy training; case management services to help people resolve \nfinancial, emotional and family issues; long-term disaster case management services to help \nhurricane survivors rebuild their homes and lives; emergency food and access to benefits and \nother resources; immigration legal services; refugee resettlement; English as a second language \nservices; specialized assistance for the blind; after-school and recreational programs for children \nand youth; dropout prevention and youth employment programs; and supportive housing \nprograms for adults with severe mental illness. \n2 \n  App. 149\n\nImpact on Clients Using CCCS-NY’s Immigration Hotlines \n5.  CCCS-NY’s Immigrant and Refugee Services Division operates two hotlines that \nare fundamental to the provision of legal services and legal information to immigrants in both \nNew York City and New York State.  The ActionNYC hotline partners with the New York City \nMayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (“MOIA”).  The hotline serves as the primary number New \nYork City residents can call when they have immigration law questions. Depending on the issue \nthey present they are referred to one of 21 legal services providers contracted with MOIA to \nhandle cases.  The New Americans Hotline partners with the New York Department of State \nOffice of New Americans (“ONA”).  The hotline is toll-free; it refers immigrants from around \nthe state to immigration services and provides callers with accurate information regarding issues \nof concern in the immigrant community.  In 2019 Catholic Charities operators staffing these two \nlines answered a combined total of 43,000 calls in 18 languages and made referrals to legal \nservice providers throughout New York State.  Before the Rule took effect, CCCS-NY saw \nspikes in call volume to these hotlines when the proposed and final versions of the Rule were \npublished in the Federal Register in October 2018 and August 2019, respectively. \n6.  Over the past couple of weeks, CCCS-NY has fielded calls through these two \nhotlines related to the intersection of COVID-19 and the Rule.  Of the approximately 60 calls \nrelated to public charge, approximately 40% involved specific mention of COVID-19 as the \nspecific reason for seeking supportive benefits.  Many of these callers expressed fear of seeking \nmedical treatment for COVID-19 and enrolling in SNAP for their children. Others asked \nquestions about whether they will be able to access unemployment benefits in the wake of a job \nloss.  Given the pervasiveness of infection in the areas we serve and the extraordinary rise in \nunemployment, we believe the vast majority of inquiries during this recent period were triggered \n3 \n  App. 150\n\nby fear of the public charge consequences of seeking benefits (e.g., medical insurance, SNAP, \nhousing assistance) needed because of COVID-19.  \n7.  Overall, these calls demonstrate a high level of confusion, panic, and \nmisinformation concerning the Rule, particularly as it relates to individuals’ ability to access \nbenefits during this crisis. \nImpact on Clients Obtaining Legal Services from CCCS-NY \n8.  The Immigrant and Refugee Services Division also provides legal services \ndirectly to immigrant clients.  These services include assistance with immigration applications \n(including adjustment applications), removal defense, and work authorization, integration, and \ncase management support, support to unaccompanied minors, job development, English and \ncivics, and citizenship preparation.  During 2019, the Immigrant and Refugee Services \nprogramming directly assisted over 20,000 individuals—children, families, workers—in New \nYork.  Because our ability to contact individuals is limited by New York’s lockdown order and \nthe CDC’s social distancing guidance, we are hindered in getting information to individuals who \nmay be affected by the Rule.   \n9.  In the last couple of weeks, the questions that our clients have presented during \nthese sessions have been similar to those we have seen through our hotline operations.  These \nrevolved around capacity to care for their families during a uniquely difficult economic period \nand how to navigate the legal and practical issues they face as a result.  Individuals who are in \nneed of supplemental benefits to get through this difficult period are reluctant to accept any aid \nfor fear of being deemed public charges.  For example, even clients who are not subject to public \ncharge – such as when adjustment of status will be based on humanitarian status (e.g., Asylum, \n4 \n  App. 151\n\nSpecial lmcnigrant Juveni1e status)-havc c.xpressed feaf or colk·cting unemployment after \nlosing their job due to COVID-19. \nNeed to Suspeml tlte Ruk \n10.  Suspending the Rule during lhis period of national crisis would allow our clien1s \nand the communities we serve to meet their immediate needs for health care and suppJemental \nbenefits for which the}' are eligible and need to get through this crisis without risking their \nimmigratior1 s(alt.ls. Thjs wouJd alleviate some of the confusion and fear that we have obseived, \nand would fue1her the goals aniculated by government actors of providing relief to those \nimpacted by COVJD-l9.

New York. \n- ~  \nario Russell, Esq. \n5 \nApp. 152\n\n \nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Theo Oshiro, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am a Deputy Director for Make the Road New York (“MRNY”), where I am \nresponsible for overseeing our services teams, which include our legal, health, and adult \neducation departments.  I submit this declaration in support of Respondents’ application to \nmodify the Court’s January 27, 2020 stay of the district court’s October 11, 2019 order \npreliminarily enjoining the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) public charge rule, \n(the “Rule”) in the above-captioned case, and the related case Make the Road New York, et al. v. \nCuccinelli, et al., (“MRNY v. Cuccinelli”), which is currently the subject of a pending appeal \nbefore the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I submitted a declaration dated September 9, 2019 \nin support of Plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin the Rule on a preliminary basis in MRNY v. Cuccinelli.  \nFollowing the Court’s issuance of a stay, the Rule became effective on February 24, 2020.  \n \n \n1 \n  App. 153\n\n \nMake the Road New York \n2.  MRNY is a non-profit community-based membership organization, which has \nbeen in existence for over 20 years, and is dedicated to building the power of immigrant and \nworking-class communities to achieve dignity and justice through organizing, policy innovation, \ntransformative education, and survival services. MRNY currently has over 200 staff members, \nwho provide services to thousands of individuals a year, including both members, students and \nclients from the community. Our membership comprises more than 24,000 low-income New \nYorkers, many of them from immigrant communities. We operate five community centers in the \nstate of New York: in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Long Island and Westchester County, \neach of which are areas of the State widely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n3.  Over the past several weeks, we have seen how the COVID-19 pandemic has \nrapidly caused a pervasive health crisis in the New York City metropolitan area and a massive \nincrease in food instability and unemployment, especially acute in the communities MRNY \nserves. During this time, MRNY has been at the front lines of working with, supporting, and \neducating immigrant communities on their rights in the COVID-19 crisis. We are providing food \nassistance, including distribution of food, to hundreds of families through our food pantries in \nQueens and Brooklyn, and are raising and disseminating a million dollars to meet immediate \nneeds, including emergency food visa cards, and funds to cover expenses for individuals who \nhave lost immediate relatives due to COVID-19. We are also holding regular information and \nKnow Your Rights (KYR) sessions on Facebook Live and other online platforms; conducting a \nhigh volume of health insurance and services screenings; and handling a similarly high volume \nof questions through our workers’ rights, housing and immigration legal teams. We have also \nbeen helping hundreds of community members connect by phone to medical providers who can \n2 \n  App. 154\n\n \nadvise the individual if they should go to the hospital for treatment, or if it is safe for them to \nstay home. We continue to follow up with these individuals to ensure they are safe and have all \nthe support they need.  \nThe Public Charge Rule and COVID-19 \n4.  Since it was announced, the public charge Rule has placed our clients’ and \nmembers’ health and security in jeopardy. Even before the Rule became effective on February \n24, 2020, we saw the Rule cause enormous fear in the immigrant communities MRNY serves, \ndriving people to consider withdrawing from life-saving health and nutritional benefits due to \nconcerns that receipt would endanger their immigration status. This included many people who \nare not subject to public charge but were nonetheless reluctant to keep or apply for benefits, \nincluding benefits that are explicitly not considered under the Rule.  \n5.  When the Court granted the stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction on \nJanuary 27, 2020 and the Rule became effective on February 24, 2020, the impact of the Rule on \nour members and clients became even greater. We are especially concerned that the COVID-19 \ncrisis has accelerated the deleterious effects of the Rule on our clients and their communities at \nan alarming rate and actively undermines MRNY’s efforts and those of other organizations and \nstate agencies to assist families in need access health care, food, and other assistance.  \n6.  The stakes for families reluctant to access government assistance because of the \nRule have become even greater with the unfolding of the COVID-19 crisis. MRNY’s \ncommunities have been devastated by the current crisis. The organization has lost over ten \nmembers or immediate family of staff, many of them from communities or groups (such as trans \nwomen of color) that have historically lacked access to healthcare. These consequences show \nthat fear of accessing health care, including COVID-19 testing and treatment, because of public \n3 \n  App. 155\n\n \ncharge implications can have life-altering health consequences for our clients; other members of \ntheir households, including U.S. citizens; and their neighbors and communities. Fear of accessing \nfood assistance and other benefits because of public charge consequences can also result in \npeople staying in unsafe work situations, and for those who are unemployed, simply going \nhungry.  \n7.  Since the first stay-at-home order was issued for New York City on March 22, \n2020, we have seen clients reluctant to access health and other benefits in three main areas of our \nwork: (a) screening clients for health insurance and SNAP eligibility and helping individuals \naccess medical care; (b) providing food assistance to clients and members and advising them on \nhow to access other vital social support services; and (c) advising workers about benefits and \nprotections available to them, including unemployment insurance, food assistance, and health \ninsurance. In each area, clients and members express fear that public charge will result in them or \ntheir family members being penalized for using such assistance or benefits, including from \nMRNY’s own food pantries and crisis-support funds.  \n8.  MRNY's health team conducts hundreds of individual health consultations per \nmonth in order to assist people in accessing healthcare. In the course of these consultations, a \nlarge number of people express fear of accessing health benefits due to concerns about public \ncharge.  \n9.   MRNY’s immigration and workers practices have also fielded a large volume of \nquestions and concerns from members and clients about accessing unemployment insurance, \nhealthcare, food assistance, and even school resources based on public charge consequences. For \ninstance, many individuals have expressed concerns over whether accepting food through food \npantries, MRNY’s own emergency food program, or the NYC meal program will negatively \n4 \n  App. 156\n\n \nimpact their immigration cases. Similarly, MRNY’s workers team has fielded questions from \nseveral clients who qualify for unemployment insurance but are fearful of accessing it given \npublic charge concerns. The workers team has also referred individuals concerned with accessing \nhealthcare due to public charge concerns to MRNY’s health team. Some clients have even \nexpressed fear that accessing resources from their children’s schools for purposes of remote \nlearning and food support will have negative immigration consequences.  \n10.  The clients expressing these fears include people to whom public charge is not \napplicable because they are LPRs or hold other status not affected. For example, parents have \nexpressed concern about applying for SNAP benefits for their U.S.-citizen children and how \ntheir immigration cases will be impacted if they were to apply, as have individuals who are not \nbe impacted by the public charge rule at all based on their available immigration relief such as U \nnonimmigrant visa. \n11.  Although our counseling and consultations often result in clients resolving their \nconfusion about the public charge rule, the fear that our members and clients express \ndemonstrates that many individuals in New York’s immigrant communities are currently actively \ndeterred from accessing benefits. In addition, the need to screen, counsel and reassure people \ncauses delay in obtaining necessary benefits. And we know based on our work that there are \nmany more New Yorkers for whom the issue is not delay, but downright refusal to access \nbenefits they need because of the public charge consequences.  \n12.  On March 13, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted \nan English-only alert explaining that while the Public Charge rule “does not restrict access to \ntesting, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including COVID-19,” USCIS was \nnonetheless required to “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, \n5 \n  App. 157\n\n \nincluding those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge \ninadmissibility determination,” including most forms of federally funded Medicaid. See \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge.  The apparent internal contradiction of the \nstatement has not helped us to alleviate client concerns about benefits use during the COVID-19 \npandemic and public charge inadmissibility.  In fact, it has only created more confusion for our \nclients and required us to expend additional resources to adequately provide counsel. \n13.  First, for those clients who are subject to public charge, specifying that the \nnegatively-weighed circumstances related to COVID-19 – which could include the use of \nbenefits that do count in the public charge analysis, reduced income and resources due to \nunemployment, an interruption in school, and chronic health conditions resulting from the virus \n– will be considered in the totality of the circumstances is too vague and open to broad \ninterpretation to be helpful. As a result, it provides little clarity or comfort to clients trying to \nbalance their urgent need for assistance during the pandemic with their long-term dreams of \npermanent residence in the U.S.    \n14.  Second, the alert is not being broadly distributed and, as a single website posting \nin English, is not reaching the communities who need this reassurance. Most of our clients would \nnever see the USCIS alert unless we showed it to them. The alert is difficult to locate on the \nagency’s website. It is only posted in connection with information on public charge, and does not \nappear in connection with the information posted about COVID-19. None of the clients we \ndiscussed with were familiar with it.  \n15.  Absent the Court lifting the stay of the injunction, which would send a clear \nmessage to immigrants that access to health and other supplemental benefits is of paramount \nimportance during this public health crisis, we will continue to see immigrants in the \n6 \n  App. 158\n\n \ncommunities we serve delaying, deferring or avoiding access to life-saving health and food \nresources.   \n16.  We know that not everyone seeks out our services. While we try our best to reach \nas many individuals as possible, and even if we are provided with additional resources, there will \ncontinue to be frightened and vulnerable members of the immigrant communities that we are \nunable to reach and who are at risk of getting infected with COVID-19, and who lack access to \nkey information and resources to access healthcare, benefits and support services. \n \nDATED this 10th day of April, 2020  \nCroton-on-Hudson, NY  \n                                                                                  \n            _________________________ \n            Theo Oshiro \n \n             \n \n7 \n  App. 159\n\nAPR/06/2020/MON 12:23 PM  FAX  No.  P. 002 \nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \nApplicants, \nV. \nNEW YORK, et al., \nRespondents. \nI,  Pedro Moreno, pursuant to 28.U.S.C.1746, hereby declare as follows \n1; I am an Assistant Professor of Family Medicine at the University of California San \nFrancisco. I am a member of the COVID-19 Leadership Team in the Monterey \nCounty Health Department Clinics.  On the Leadership Team my role is to lead other \nphysicians at the Health Department clinics in providing medical and social services \nto patients affected by COVID-19, \n2.  For the last 22 years 1h ave provided medical care to immigrant families in the \nAlisa] Health Center, a Federally Qualified Community Health Center in Salinas, \nCalifornia. Many of my patients work in the fields harvesting vegetables and berries, \nand in processing plants that package salads and other agricultural products. In my \nclinic I work closely with a multidisciplinary team of social workers, public health \nnurses, physicians, and mental health professionals to provide medical and social \nservices to primarily immigrant farmworker families. \n3.  Our region, the Salinas Valley in California, is also known as the \"Salad Bowl of \nthe United States.\"  Our immigrant farmworkers feed America and are considered \n''essential workers,\" exempt from the California Shelter in Place Order.  Every day \nthey ride crowded buses to work in the fields to harvest our nation's vegetables, \nrisking being infected with COVID-19. \n4.  In Monterey County, we are in the early stages of the pandemic. So far, I have \nseen an increasing number of patients each week with symptoms of possible COVID-\n19.  Some of these patients have told me that they are afraid to seek medical care in \nour hospital. They don't have health insurance and are fearful to receive expensive \n1 \nApp. 160\n04/06/2020  3:28PM  (GMT-04:00) \n\nAPR/06/2020/MON  12:23  PM  FAX  No.  P. 003 \nbills if they visit the emergency room. They are also fearful of negative immigration \nconsequences if they use publicly subsidized medical services due to the public \ncharge rule. I am deeply afraid that these farmworkers who don't receive medical \nattention with early COVID-19 will spread the infection in our community. \n5.  I understand that state-funded services, emergency health services, and COVID-\n19 testing and treatment are supposed to be exempt from consideration under the \npublic charge rule. My patients' fears and concerns about the risks associated with \nuse of public benefits, however, apply even to services exempted by the rule. \n6,  I have patients with symptoms of COVID-19, and I have advised them to stay at \nhome. However, some have told me they cannot stop working because they have no \nother income or resources, and their families will otherwise go hungry. They are \nafraid to apply for nutrition assistance programs, such as CalFresh, the California \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, due to fear that if they receive those \nbenefits, the public charge rule will negatively affect their immigration status in the \nfuture. \n7.  I have also witnessed many farmworkers who are suffering with extreme anxiety \nand depression since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic. Unfortunately, they \nreport to me that they are afraid to receive behavioral health services due to \nfea'rs that receipt of those services will negatively affect their immigration status. \n8.  I am aware of USCIS's March 13th announcement concerning COVID-19 and public \ncharge. Fear and confusion has persisted in my patient population in regards to the \npublic charge and access to COVID-19 related care and other benefits, even after this \nguidance was issued. Many of my patients appear unaware of the guidance. I am \nnot able to advise my patients about particular immigration consequences that they \nor their family members could likely face given their particular circumstances and \nbenefits utilization. \n9.  I believe some of my farmworker patients have already been infected with \nCOVID-19 by other farmworkers in the fields. Unfortunately, many of them a.re \nafraid to seek medical care due to the public charge rule, and are already spreading \nthe infection in our community. This interferes with my and my colleagues' work to \nmitigate the risks of COVID-19 to our farmworking community. \nDated this 6th day of April, 2020 at Salinas, California \nDR.

I am over the age of eighteen. I am an attorney licensed to practice law before the State of \nCalifornia. \n2.  I am the Managing Attorney of the Monterey County Medical-Legal Partnership at California \nRural Legal Assistance, Inc. (“CRLA”).  \n3.  CRLA is a Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which provides free legal services to more \nthan 40,000 rural, low-income Californians every year. \n4.  The Monterey County Medical-Legal Partnership provides free legal services to hundreds of \npatients every year at the Monterey County Health Department’s nine Federally Qualified \nHealth Centers, which serve more than 40,000 low-income primary care patients every year.  \nA team of three full-time CRLA attorneys is on site at the County’s safety net healthcare \nclinics every week working alongside healthcare providers to assist patients with health-\nharming legal needs.   \n5.  Since the beginning of 2018, the Monterey County Medical-Legal Partnership has provided \n1 \n  App. 162\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \nservices to more than 145 patients with legal needs related to public benefits.  Since the \nbeginning of 2018, the Medical-Legal Partnership has also provided training to over 750 \ndoctors, physician’s assistants, nurse practitioners, medical assistants, social workers, and \nsocial services providers regarding public benefits. \n6.  Monterey County declared a COVID-19 State of Emergency on March 6, 2020, and issued a \nShelter in Place order on March 17, 2020.  I am part of the Monterey County Health \nDepartment’s COVID-19 Social Determinants of Health Team.  \n7.  In Monterey County, many low-income residents are reluctant to access emergency \nhealthcare and social services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic because they fear how \nthe new public charge rules will impact them.  The new public charge rules took effect on \nFebruary 24, 2020, only weeks before Monterey County issued its COVID-19 Shelter-In-\nPlace Order.  COVID-19 has prevented planned public charge community education \ncampaigns from moving forward, and there remains a significant chilling effect in the \ncommunity that is preventing many residents from accessing needed healthcare and social \nservices to cope with COVID-19.  \nMonterey County residents are vulnerable to forgoing needed healthcare and social \nservices because of lack of information regarding the new public charge rules.  \n8.  Thirty percent of Monterey County residents are foreign-born.1  \n9.  Nearly 1 in 4 households in Monterey County relies on income related to agriculture.  While \nestimates vary from year to year, Monterey County is home to as many as 90,000 \nfarmworkers every year.  Crops grown in Monterey County supply large percentages of total \nnational pounds produced each year:  61% of leaf lettuce, 57% of celery, 48% of broccoli, \n                                                             \n1 U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, American Community Survey (ACS) and Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), 5-Year \nEstimates, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/montereycountycalifornia. \n2 \n  App. 163\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \n38% of spinach, and 28% of strawberries.2 \n10. The agricultural workers that CRLA serves are predominantly immigrants, mostly from \nMexico.  \n11. Most of the farmworkers in this area do not speak English, and some only speak indigenous \nlanguages. Language barriers deter access to guidance on public charge currently being \ndisseminated – only 33% of farmworkers report being able to speak English well and nearly \nas many (27%) report they cannot speak English at all.3  Most are Spanish speakers, but \nmany only speak indigenous languages, such as Mixtec, Zapotec, or Triqui.  Many of the \nMexican indigenous languages are only oral, meaning there is not commonly understood \nwritten language. \n12. Only 39% of farmworkers have schooling beyond the ninth grade. In contrast, 96.5% of all U.S. \nadults 24 years or older, have completed the eighth grade.4  Many farmworkers cannot read or \nwrite in English or Spanish.  Many do not know how to operate a computer. \n13. Many farmworkers in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties live and work in remote, rural \nareas that are severely underserved by medical and social services providers.  \n14. There are significant barriers to disseminating information in farmworker communities that \nCRLA serves.  The rural nature of farmwork means that residents are spread out over wide \ngeographic areas.  Many farmworkers cannot read and cannot access written informational \nmaterials, even if the materials are also in Spanish.  Other farmworkers are able to read, but \nhave never used a computer and do not have an email address.  \n15. Due to these barriers, effective community education in farmworker communities typically \n                                                             \n2 MONTEREY COUNTY FARM BUREAU, Facts Figures, and FAQs, http://montereycfb.com/index.php?page=facts-\nfigures-faqs. \n3 U.S. DEP’T OF LABOR, EMP’T & TRAINING ADMIN., NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS \nSURVEY (NAWS), PUBLIC DATA SETS, http://www.doleta.gov/agworker/naws.cfm. \n4 U.S. DEP’T OF LABOR, EMP’T & TRAINING ADMIN., NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS \nSURVEY (NAWS), PUBLIC DATA SETS, http://www.doleta.gov/agworker/naws.cfm. \n3 \n  App. 164\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \nrequires face-to-face meetings and outreach at large events where agencies can work with \ntrusted community leaders to help disseminate information in-person. \nThe roll-out of the new public charge rules created significant confusion about when they \ntook effect, whom they applied to, and which public benefits they included. \n16. On October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed a change to the \nlong-standing public charge policy by excluding anyone who is likely to use certain health \ncare, nutrition or housing programs in the future.  The publication of this proposed rule \ncreated significant anxiety and confusion about whom the public charge test applied to, and \nwhat public benefits were included in the test.  \n17. The Final Rule, published on August 8, 2019, included some changes from the proposed rule \npublished the year prior.  These changes created further confusion about the new public \ncharge rules. \n18. DHS issued a correction of the final rule on October 2, 2019, contributing to still more \nconfusion about the contents of the new public charge rules. \n19. Following publication of the final rule, states, counties and non-profit organizations filed a \ntotal of nine legal challenges to the rule and multiple federal courts issued preliminary \ninjunctions blocking implementation of the rule.   \n20. On January 27, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction from New \nYork that prevented the DHS public charge rule from taking effect. The DHS rule went into \neffect nationwide on February 24, 2020. \n21. The ever changing status and contents of the new public charge rules, including expansive \nlanguage in the February 5, 2020 USCIS policy alert, created an urgent need for community \n4 \n  App. 165\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \neducation to clarify when the new rules went into effect, to whom they applied, and what \npublic benefits they considered. \nCOVID-19 has prevented necessary community education efforts about the new public \ncharge rules.  \n22. On February 24, 2020, when the new public charge rules went into effect, there remained \nsignificant confusion among Monterey and Santa Cruz County residents about when the rule \nwould go into effect, and what the new rules entailed.  In the following days and weeks, \nCRLA fielded questions nearly every day from patients and healthcare providers about the \nnew public charge rules. \n23. On February 6, 2020, in anticipation of the new public charge rules going into effect, the \nCRLA began planning a public charge community education campaign.  This community \neducation campaign involved nearly every civil legal services non-profit in Monterey and \nSanta Cruz Counties—more than ten different organizations.    \n24. On February 25, 2020, representatives from civil legal services providers in Monterey and \nSanta Cruz Counties met in Salinas, California to plan the public charge community \neducation campaign.  The plans entailed in-person community education through town hall \nevents in as many as ten different locations in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.  The plans \nfor in-person town hall events featured participation from more than ten agencies and \nincluded transportation assistance for participants, simultaneous interpretation into \nindigenous languages, and a community participatory theater performance. \n25. On March 6, 2020, Monterey County declared a COVID-19 State of Emergency.  On March \n17, 2020, Monterey County issued a Shelter in Place order.  With the prohibition on public \ngatherings and orders regarding social distancing and sheltering in place, it is no longer \n5 \n  App. 166\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \nfeasible to move forward with the public charge community education campaign. \n26. Due to COVID-19, all of CRLA’s 18 offices across the state are closed to walk-ins and \nmembers of the public cannot come to us in-person for a legal consultation.  Ordinarily, the \nvast majority of our consultations with the public usually take place in-person.  While rural \nCalifornians always face increased challenges in accessing civil legal aid, it is now more \ndifficult than ever for them to get assistance for urgent legal needs.  \nCOVID-19 has stymied public charge community education efforts, and there is still \nsignificant confusion about the new public charge rules that is causing Monterey County \nresidents to forgo medically necessary COVID-19 related healthcare. \n27. Since Monterey County declared a COVID-19 State of Emergency, the Monterey County \nMedical-Legal Partnership has been inundated with questions related to public charge.  I \nhave personally spoken with multiple patients that have refused to seek COVID-19 related \ntreatment because they fear the new public charge rules.  I spoke with a patient that said they \nwould refuse COVID-19 related treatment even after I counseled them on the contents of the \nMarch 13, 2020 USCIS Policy Alert regarding public charge and COVID-19.   \n28. I have also received inquiries from several Monterey County Health Department doctors that \nreport some of their patients have refused needed COVID-19 related services due fear about \nthe new public charge rules. \n29. Since Monterey County declared a COVID-19 State of Emergency, I have not spoken with \nany patients that were familiar with the recent USCIS alert that COVID-19 treatment or \npreventative services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge \nanalysis.   \n30. Given the confusion created in the roll-out of the new public charge rules and the current \n6 \n  App. 167\n\n,7190436Ā-6:25782Ā/,(Ā+$\".\"#\"!Ȁ\"% %Ȁ$%,&Ȁ*'+)Ȁ.,#*$&&+!&,.\n \nlimitations on community education due to COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, the USCIS \nalert is not sufficient to inform residents and advocates on how, whether, when or if seeking \nCOVID-19 treatment would trigger public charge issues.  As a result, the new public charge \nrules are presently causing Monterey County residents to forgo medically necessary COVID-\n19 related care. \nDATED this 9th day of April, 2020 at Salinas, CA \nIn \n  DocuSigned by: \n~ ~~~Aa~:La-----\n  Signed: [s]________________________   \nAaron Voit  \nMonterey County Medical-Legal Partnership, \nManaging Attorney  \nCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance, Inc. \n3 Williams Rd. \nSalinas, CA 93955 \navoit@crla.org \n(831) 757-5221 ext. 1411   \n     \n7 \n  App. 168\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Alejandra Aguilar, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am the Lead Health Educator in the HIV Navigation Services unit of the East \nLos Angeles Women’s Center (“ELAWC”). In this role, I provide health education, support \nservices, and links to HIV testing and treatment to clients throughout East Los Angeles. I also \nprovide support to ELAWC’s Rape Crisis Center by connecting people who have experienced \ndomestic abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking to support services and counseling. During \nmy fifteen years of employment and consulting as a health educator at ELAWC, I have provided \nhealthcare navigation and other services to hundreds of predominantly immigrant clients and \nhave personally observed their efforts to secure essential healthcare. I submit this declaration in \nsupport of Respondents’ application in the above-captioned matter. \n2.  The  mission  of  the  East  Los  Angeles  Women’s  Center  is  to  ensure  that  all \nwomen, girls and their families live in a place of safety, health, and personal well-being, free \nfrom violence and abuse, with equal access to necessary health services and social support, with \n1 \n  App. 169\n\nan emphasis on Latino communities. The vast majority of clients ELAWC serves are immigrant \nwomen — most of whom are monolingual Spanish speakers — and their families living below \nthe federal poverty line. Most of our clients are also uninsured or underinsured. These clients \nrepresent extremely underserved segments of the population with needs that stem from their \ntransition out of dangerous situations, including people who have experienced sexual assault, \nsurvivors of domestic abuse, and individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. \nELAWC plays a critical role in connecting clients who have immediate healthcare, housing, and \nnutritional needs with partners who provide these services or who can enroll them in benefits \nprograms. Additionally, ELAWC provides two forms of shelter for survivors of sexual assault, \ndomestic abuse, human trafficking, and/or other trauma: a hospital-based shelter and separate \ntransitional housing for women and families who are moving out of dangerous situations. \n3.   Prior  to  government-mandated  quarantine,  I  provided  frequent  in-person \ncommunity presentations on several health-related topics, including linkage to health services; \nHIV navigation; HIV prevention; general wellness; and crisis support.  I prepared for these \npresentations by consulting with healthcare providers and enrollment specialists to better inform \nclients of the agencies and organizations who can enroll clients in appropriate medical coverage \nor provide free or low-cost medical care. I also provided one-on-one navigation— typically \nserving between three and five clients a day — in person and by phone. \n4.  Since California’s mandatory quarantine went into effect on March 13, 2020, I \nhave moved to taking calls from clients and providing health navigation services over the phone, \nas well as connecting people with crisis counseling and connecting them to other resources.  \n \n \n2 \n  App. 170\n\nThe Rule has Led to Fear and Confusion \n5.   Since approximately two years ago, when reports about changes to public charge \npolicies in immigration began reaching the communities I work in, I have continuously answered \nquestions from clients who are afraid to use services for fear of impacting their eligibility for \nfuture adjustments to their immigration status. In the last two months — after the Supreme \nCourt’s  order  staying  injunctions  blocking  the  DHS  public  charge  rule’s  implementation \nthroughout the country — I have received more questions about public charge than I ever have \npreviously.  \n6.  To help resolve fear and confusion about public charge in our client communities, \nELWAC has invited immigration attorneys and partner organizations to speak to our clients \nabout changes to the immigration system. This information has been helpful to those who we are \nalready assisting, but I am concerned that others in the community whom we have not yet \nreached remain misinformed and confused about how the public charge framework operates. \nRecent contact with new clients has confirmed this apprehension, as clients who come into initial \ncontact with our organization misunderstand the public charge rule and how it impacts them. \n7.  Unless clients actively reach out to us or we are able to locate them through \noutreach services, they are extremely unlikely to receive accurate information about who public \ncharge applies to and how. In many initial meeting with my clients, they have expressed a \nmistaken belief that  receiving  any state or local  healthcare assistance, such as state health \ninsurance through Medi-Cal or My Health LA, a low-cost healthcare plan for people in Los \nAngeles county without health insurance, would result in future immigration consequences and \nthat they should therefore avoid them.  Although I am able to correct these misunderstandings \n3 \n  App. 171\n\nwhen I meet with clients, I am sure that countless others who I do not reach will continue to \nmake choices that impact their health and wellbeing based on misinformation. \n8.  In particular, these concerns have been particularly acute for clients who are at \nrisk of contracting HIV.   At present, I estimate that one out of every ten calls I receive for HIV \nprevention services are questions about immigration consequences for HIV testing and treatment \nbecause of the public charge rule.  \nClients have Avoided or Withdrawn from Benefits Since the Rule Took Effect \n9.  In the past two months, several clients have told me that they will forgo or \nwithdraw from medical and nutritional benefits due to fear over the public charge Rule. It is \nespecially troubling that clients who are at risk of having contracted HIV have decided to avoid \ntesting and free treatment because they fear that getting tested or the fact of having HIV will \nhave immigration consequences.  \n10.  Similarly, clients we serve with children — where many of those children are \nU.S. citizens — who are eligible for coverage and services are frightened that they will be unable \nto pursue immigration relief like adjustment to permanent residence if their children receive this \nsupport. Some clients have discontinued vital services for their children like medical coverage \nthrough Medi-Cal, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children \n(“WIC”), and other programs out of fear of public charge consequences. \n11.  One of my sessions from late February 2020 with a client who works in food \nservice with several other immigrants provides an example of the level of misinformation in the \ncommunity and its broad impact. This client had previously withdrawn from Medi-Cal after \nhearing about public charge. At the time she came in to ELAWC, she was spending more of her \npay on out-of-pocket medical costs for herself and for her citizen children. After withdrawing \n4 \n  App. 172\n\nfrom Medi-Cal, she told several coworkers that she had withdrawn and why, and many of those \ncoworkers  (who  also  had  citizen  children)  also  withdrew.  These  families  were  especially \nfrightened of seeking care after the public charge rule went into effect and continued to avoid \nmedical care through various illnesses — only visiting the doctor and paying out of pocket when \nthey were desperate —as of early March 2020.  \n12.  On March 20, 2020, I counseled a client’s daughter. My client’s daughter is a \ncollege student in the DACA program who is five months pregnant. My client requested that I \nspeak to her daughter because she was avoiding prenatal care. The daughter had visited the \ndoctor only once for a pregnancy test, when she was seen her based on presumptive eligibility \nfor Medi-Cal. When my client’s daughter learned that she would need to visit a county office to \nbe fully enrolled in Medi-Cal to receive future coverage, she avoided doing so because she was \nafraid that the public charge rule would impact her ability to adjust her immigration status in the \nfuture. At that time, she used the internet to research whether public charge would apply in her \nsituation,  but  she  was  confused  by  the  information  she  found.  Because  she  was  afraid  of \njeopardizing her future in the United States and could not afford to pay for care without health \ncoverage, she stopped visiting the doctor for prenatal visits. \n13.  I  am  also  aware  of  a  woman  who  is  avoiding  medical  care  while  awaiting \nadjudication of a U-visa application. She has an eight-year-old daughter who is a U.S. citizen. \nAfter learning about the public charge rule, she withdrew her family from Medi-Cal out of fear \nthat receipt of state medical benefits would make her ineligible for the visa. She has since \nstopped taking her daughter to physicals or dental examinations because she cannot afford them \nand will only take her to the doctor when she is very sick. For her family’s illnesses, she uses \nover-the-counter medications. I have explained to her that the public charge rule would not apply \n5 \n  App. 173\n\nto her family if her daughter continued to receive benefits that she is eligible for, but she will not \nre-enroll due to serious fears about potential separation from her daughter.   \n14.  The client stories above are representative of many others that my colleagues have \ndescribed to me since the public charge rule took effect. Before our offices closed due to \nCOVID-19, clients were so afraid of immigration consequences under public charge that they \nwhere reluctant to share their name and demographic information on sign-in sheets that we use \nfor documentation purposes.  \n15.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  dramatically  changed  our  operations  and  has \nprovoked serious fear in our client communities. As part of my health education with clients, I \nam now providing basic information about COVID-19, sharing available resources related to the \nvirus, offering hygiene education, and offering sanitizers when we have access to those items. \nELAWC’s hospital-based and transitional shelters are still open and operational as emergency \nresources and each is at full capacity. The health vulnerabilities of people with HIV and at risk of \ncontracting HIV and the dangers of COVID-19 infection are of special concern due to the acute \ndanger infection poses to people with compromised immune systems. \n16.  Since  the  COVID-19  global  health  emergency  began,  I  have  experienced  an \nincrease in the volume of calls to our HIV information line. The majority of this increase has \nbeen sparked by COVID-19. Clients are anxious about the pandemic’s impact on their health. \nFear is especially acute among HIV-positive patients. During the week of March 22 to March 28, \n2020, alone, I received more calls than I typically receive in a whole month.  \n17.  On or around March 13, 2020, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS) posted an alert (in English only).  This alert explained that while the public charge rule \n“does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including \n6 \n  App. 174\n\nCOVID-19,” USCIS was nonetheless required to “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-\ncash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination,” including most forms of federally funded \nMedicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge. My clients have not indicated to \nme that they have seen or heard about this notice. ELAWC health navigators are still receiving \nquestions from clients who are confused about how and when the public charge rule applies to \nthem.  \nCOVID-19 Has Amplified Clients’ Fear of Using Benefits \n18.  The effects of COVID-19 on my clients are even greater because of the economic \nshocks the pandemic has created in the community. Financial uncertainty among my clients who \nhave lost jobs and income because of the pandemic is particularly troubling because many can no \nlonger afford to pay out of pocket for medical costs when they need healthcare if they are not \ninsured. Public charge makes this challenge more complicated because clients are also unwilling \nto seek out health coverage that they may be eligible for. This combination of factors means that \nmany  of  our  clients  will  avoid  medical  treatment  altogether,  even  though  the  COVID-19 \npandemic makes that treatment more important than ever.  \n19.  I believe our clients and other community members are more likely to avoid \nhealthcare because they do not have the money to pay for it and are fearful of the immigration \nconsequences of receiving government healthcare benefits because of the public charge rule. \nStudies show that survivors of abuse and survivors of sexual assault are more likely to be \nimpacted by chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension.1  I believe that these conditions \nmay mean that COVID-19 is more dangerous to our clients. \n                                                 \n1 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1286 \n7 \n  App. 175\n\n \nDATED this _n_i_nt_h__day of April, 2020 at Los Angeles, California \n \n            ______________________________ \n            Alejandra Aguilar \n \n \n \n8 \n  App. 176\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \nDEPARTMENTOFHOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \nApplicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \nRespondents. \nI, Janel Heinrich, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  As the Director of Public Health Madison and Dane County (PHMDC), I lead our \nCity and County Health Department's efforts to ensure healthy people and places throughout Dane \nCounty, Wisconsin. PHMDC supports and improves health and wellbeing by delivering programs \nand services related to individual, community, and environmental health to residents. We do this \nthrough the observation, monitoring, education, enforcement, and policy advancement of public \nhealth best practices in our community. We work with a wide range of community partners to help \nconnect community members with valuable local, state and federal resources such as nutrition \nprograms, Medicaid-eligible health programs, and other community benefits. \n2.  At PHMDC, we believe that all residents of Dane County deserve healthy places to \nlive, work, and play. We also believe that the health of all people is interconnected. I submit this \ndeclaration in support of the Respondents' application in the above-captioned matter. \n1 \nApp. 177\n\n3.  Beginning with the first proposed changes to the public charge rule in 2017 and \nespecially once the rule was allowed to go into effect, our department has been hearing numerous \nreports of immigrant residents of Dane County who have disenrolled themselves and family \nmembers from public benefit programs to avoid potential complications with their long-term goals \nof adjusting their immigration status and later pursuing citizenship. \n4.  PHMDC operates the Dane County.office for the Special Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC is a vital resource for low-income families \nand promotes long-term positive health outcomes for children and families. In 2019, our project \nserved over 7,000 pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children under the age of 5. \nAlth~ugh WIC was not included in the final public charge rule, since the beginning of 2020, our \nWIC staff has consistently received calls from participants asking to remove themselves from WIC \nand other federal programs they are on. Immigrant callers frequently cited \"public charge\" as their \nreason for seeking to disenroll and expressed that they now fear using public benefits because it \ncould  threaten  pending  or  future  efforts  to  adjust  their  immigration  status.  The  rule's \nimplementation  has  clearly  increased  anxiety  and  confusion  in  Dane  County's  immigrant \ncommunity. Because of the complex and confusing nature of the public charge rule, Dane County \nresidents believe that they must weigh the important health benefits of participating in WIC and \nother nutrition and housing programs against the fear of destabilizing their longer-term goals of \nsecuring a future in the United States. \n5.  Many families  who  receive  WIC  in Dane  County  also  use  the  Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and public housing resources. In fact, 74.9% of \nWIC families also participate in SNAP, Medicaid, or both. Since implementation of the public \ncharge rule began in February 2020, we expect that the long-term impact of reducing access to \n2 \nApp. 178\n\nSNAP will be to increase food and housing insecurity as well as to reduce access to healthcare in \nDane County. These concerns are heightened during the current pandemic as families are being \ntold to stay at home, so long as they have access to food and shelter, to reduce the transmission of \nCOVID-19. \n6.  Dane County emergency food providers like food banks and pantries have reported \nseeing significant increases in participation by vulnerable groups since March. Additionally, food \ncosts are increasing and there are new challenges for accepting donated food and school-age \nchildren remain out of school where many often get free and reduced breakfast and lunch. We are \nconcerned for our emergency food partners' ability to sustain these high levels of emergency \nfeeding indefinitely throughout this crisis. In short, this is a perfect storm for an increase in hunger \nin  our  community.  Historically,  when  the  economy worsens  and  hunger  increases,  hunger \nincreases the most for racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, families with children, and other \nvulnerable groups. For this reason, PHMDC believes that our immigrant community will acutely \nexperience the negative public health effects of the pandemic-related economic downturn, and that \nthis harm will be exacerbated by fear and confusion around the public charge rule. Supporting \neligible community members' access to food through WIC and SNAP would help ensure that the \nemergency food safety net remains available and sustainable. The public charge rule has made \ndoing so significantly more difficult. \n7.  Since the COVID-19 global health emergency began, our community partners have \nexpressed elevated difficulties in supporting the immigrant community in Dane County. The public \ncharge rule has eroded the trust of many of our immigrant households in the institutions of \ngovernment and healthcare because they are concerned that choosing to access public benefits is \nnecessarily tied to immigration processing and enforcement. That loss of trust has resulted in these \n3 \nApp. 179\n\nfamilies avoiding contact with supportive services and has increased the difficulty in reaching \nthese communities with important messaging and infor~ation about the COVID-19 pandemic such \nas where households can access resources and what to do in the event that they are exposed to the \nvirus. \n8.  PHMDC is aware that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued \nan alert in March explaining that the public charge rule \"does not restrict access to testing, \nscreening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\" That notice, however, \nwas only posted only in English and states that USCIS will still \"consider the receipt of certain \ncash and non-cash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment \nfor  COVID-19  in  a  public  charge  inadmissibility  determination,\"  including  most  types  of \nMedicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge (emphasis added).  Some Dane \nCounty immigrant communities do not appear to be aware of this notice while other immigrant \npopulations we speak to remain concerned about accessing healthcare that would provide access \nto COVID-19 testing and treatment because of public charge concerns. \n9.  We believe that in order to ensure all members of our community are able to safely \nshelter in place and social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic, access to healthcare, food, \nand housing are paramount. Restricting access to these fundamental, life-sustaining necessities \nwill only worsen the spread of COVID-19. Losing access to such programs will force families to \nchoose between their access to healthcare during this epidemic and how often they eat or whether \nthey can access safe and affordable living conditions. The health of Dane County requires everyone \nto have access to the necessities they need to be well. The public charge rule has complicated \nPHDMC's work to advance toward this goal, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n4 \nApp. 180\n\nDATED this~d ay of April, 2020 at Dane County, WI \n5 \nApp. 181\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Rachel Pryor pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I serve as the Deputy Director for Administration for the  Virginia Department of  \nMedical Services (“DMAS”) since October 2018.  Prior to my appointment, I served as the Senior \nHealth Policy Advisor on the Democratic Staff of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, managing a broad legislative portfolio that included Medicaid & \nCHIP, Medicare, and Long-Term Care issues.  I have a Masters in Social Work from the University \nof Maryland with a dual Clinical/Policy focus, and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University \nLaw Center. \n \n2.  I submit this declaration in support of Plaintiffs’ application in the above-captioned \nmatter.  I have compiled the information in the statements set forth below either through personal \nknowledge, through the DMAS personnel who have assisted me in gathering this information, or \nApp. 183\n\non the basis of documents that I have reviewed. I have also familiarized myself with the Public \nCharge Final Rule (“Rule”) in order to understand its immediate impact upon DMAS. \n3.  As Deputy Director, I work directly with the DMAS Director and the Virginia \nSecretary for Health and Human Resources on high-level policy and strategic issues.  I directly \nsupervise a team of more than 150 staff members, overseeing all eligibility and enrollment \noperations, appeals operations, legislation and all regulatory and policy functions for the Agency.  \nDMAS incudes more than 700 full-time, wage and contract individuals, and a wide range of \nprograms and projects.  The Agency oversees a broad portfolio of services and works extensively \nwith state, local, tribal and community partners to improve the health and well-being of Virginians \nthrough access to high quality health care coverage.  The biennial budget for DMAS is roughly \n$27 billion, approximately 60% of which is federal funding. \n4.  DMAS  administers  Virginia’s  Medicaid  and  Children’s  Health  Insurance \n(“FAMIS”) programs. Through the Medallion 4.0 and Commonwealth Coordinated Care (“CCC”) \nPlus managed care programs, more than 1.5 million Virginians access primary and specialty health \nservices, inpatient care, behavioral health, and addiction and recovery treatment services. In \naddition, Medicaid long-term services and supports enable thousands of Virginians to remain in \ntheir homes or to access residential and nursing home care.  Medicaid members historically have \nincluded children, pregnant women, parents and caretakers, older adults, and individuals with \ndisabilities.  In 2019, Virginia expanded the Medicaid eligibility rules to make health care coverage \navailable to over 400,000 newly eligible, low-income adults. \n5.  DMAS  works  with  a  multitude  of  community  partners  throughout  the \nCommonwealth of Virginia who represent Medicaid/FAMIS beneficiaries in issues to DMAS, \n2 \n  App. 184\n\nincluding the Virginia Health Care Foundation (“VHCF”) and the Virginia Poverty Law Center \n(“VPLC”). \n6.  The VHCF is a non-profit public/private partnership established by Virginia’s \nGeneral Assembly in 1992 with the mission of increasing access to primary health care for \nuninsured and medically underserved Virginians.  VHCF operates a number of programs and \nprovides grants throughout the state to fulfill its mission.  A number of these grants fund a cadre \nof 23 Outreach Workers who provide 1:1 application assistance to those eligible for Virginia’s \nMedicaid and FAMIS health insurance programs.  \n7.  The DMAS contracts with VHCF to fund and oversee nine of these outreach \nworkers and to provide “SignUpNow” workshops to train individuals who help their clients or \npatients apply for Medicaid.  DMAS and VHCF have worked hand-in-hand for 20 years to \nmaximize enrollment in state-sponsored health insurance and address policy and system issues that \ncreate barriers to achieving this mutual objective. \n8.  The VPLC is a statewide non-profit organization that provides training to local \nlegal aid program staff, private attorneys, and low-income clients relating to the legal rights of \nlow-income Virginians.  The VPLC is a community partner that brings forward Medicaid issues \non behalf of DMAS recipients.  \n9.   The DMAS has received reports from the Virginia Department of Social Services \n(“DSS”), our community partners, and health care advocates, prior to the release of the February \n24, 2020 new U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) guidance and since the \nrelease of the guidance, that individuals have requested the closure of their Medicaid benefits \nbecause of the Rule.  \nApp. 185\n\n10.  DMAS has also received information from community partners both before and \nafter USCIS issued guidance relating to the rule and COVID-19 treatment in mid-March reflecting \nthat immigrant families are still very confused about their rights to benefits and the possible impact \nof the Rule. DMAS has been informed by a community partner that the fear even keeps immigrant \nfamilies from coming to assisters or asking additional questions. \n11.  VHCF outreach workers have experienced the chilling effect of the Rule, prior to \nthe release of the March USCIS guidance and since the release of the guidance, on individuals \nseeking health care and applying for Medicaid/FAMIS since the start of the pandemic. Even when \noutreach workers try to assure families that it is ok to apply for Medicaid/FAMIS, outreach workers \nare seeing an increasing number of families who ultimately decide not to apply and in some cases, \nwithdraw from coverage.  \n12.  One outreach worker reported to DMAS she has heard from families and local \nhuman services providers that the immigrant community is very concerned about medical bills due \nto the lack of health insurance, so they are not going to the doctor if they present symptoms of \nCOVID-19. They will wait to go to the emergency room when the condition gets serious. \n13.  During various outreach events occurring in February and March 2020 at Northern \nVirginia free clinics, five families did not want to apply for Medicaid for their children due to the \nfear of the Rule. All family members were green card holders and were looking into applying for \ncitizenship.   \n14.  The VHCF outreach workers have had some clients withdraw new applications and \nclients who were already covered cancel because of the public charge. New clients calling for \ninformation about the programs are hesitant to apply. \n4 \n  App. 186\n\n15.  During the week of March 9, 2020 one VHCF outreach worker met with a family \nfrom Venezuela that did not apply for health insurance benefits because they fear this would affect \ntheir ability to adjust their immigration status. The mother works for a Richmond area human \nservices organization. She did come to the appointment and said that she felt very hesitant to \nsubmit an application for her two children because of the public charge rule. Based on the \ninformation provided by the worker, she decided to not apply. \n16.  Over the past eight weeks, staff at several health safety net organizations has shared \nwith a VHCF outreach worker that prospective patients have refused to go through the clinic’s \nfinancial  screening  process,  because  it  includes  submitting  a  Medicaid  application  prior  to \ndetermining their eligibility for clinic services. \n17.  One family with a child who has autism and many medical needs in the Richmond \narea withdrew their Medicaid application due to fear of the Rule. \n18.  On or around March 13, 2020, USCIS posted an alert (in English only).  This alert \nexplained that while the Rule “does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of \ncommunicable diseases, including COVID-19,” USCIS was nonetheless required to “consider the \nreceipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain \ntesting or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination,” including \nmost forms of federally funded Medicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge.  \n19.   Despite this guidance, outreach workers continue to report that immigrants are \nconfused and are deterred from accessing medical treatment or testing for COVID-19. \n20.  Prior to the release of the March 13 USCIS guidance and since the release of the \nguidance, navigators  and community partners (food banks, free clinics, and hospitals) have \n5 \n  App. 187\n\nreported  immigrants  throughout  Virginia  expressing  concerns  with  the  Rule  and \nterminating/avoiding enrollment in public benefits.  \n21.  For example, a client who entered the United States with an approved asylum \napplied for FAMIS only for her three children, all under the age of five years-old, at the end of \nMarch 2020. On April 3, 2020, the parent called and requested that the applications for all three \nchildren be withdrawn due to concern with the Rule. \n \nDATED this 7th day of April, 2020  \n \n          ______________________________ \n          Rachel Pryor, Deputy Director \n          Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services \n \n \n6 \n  App. 188\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \nApplicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \nRespondents. \nApp. 189\n\nI, Lisa M. Newstrom, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n1.  I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration, and, if called as a \nwitness, could and would testify competently to the matters set forth below. \n2.  I am Managing Attorney of the Santa Clara County Regional Office of Bay Area Legal \nAid (\"Bay Legal\"), the largest provider oflegal services to the poor in the San Francisco Bay Area and \none of the largest in California.  BayL  egal and its predecessor organizations have practiced poverty law \nin this region for over 50 years. In the Bay Area, approximately 1.5 million people live in poor or low-\nincome households (under 200% of the federal poverty measure). \n3.  I submit this declaration in support of Respondents' application in the above-captioned \nmatter. \n4.  In this declaration, I explain how the public charge rule-- the Final Rule on \nInadmissability on Grounds of Public Charge (84 Fed. Reg. 41292)-has impacted the clients of Bay \nArea Legal Aid (\"BayL  egal\"), particularly during the COVID-19 crisis.  The rule has a chilling effect \nthat prevents families from getting needed health care or food assistance even when the assistance is \ncritical in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and even when getting the assistance would not actually \nharm the family's immigration status under the new public charge rule.  Based on my experience, I \nbelieve there is a significant risk that the public charge rule will cause some people to avoid testing and \ntreatment for COVID-19, which would endanger their own lives and place entire communities at risk. \nBackground \n5.  Bay Area Legal Aid has regional offices serving the counties of Santa Clara, San \nFrancisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Marin, and Napa. Our staff protects and advances the \nrights of low-income families, immigrants, and language minorities in domestic violence, public \nbenefits, hea1thcare, consumer protection, and housing matters before the courts, administrative \nagencies, and legislative bodies.  We have 147 staff members, including 100 attorneys and 10 legal \nadvocates, providing free legal services across these seven counties. \n6.  BayLegal's primary client intake.mechanism is through our Legal Advice Line  and \nHealth Consumer Center hotlines.  These hotlines are staffed by attorneys. and trained legal advocates \nApp. 190\n1 \n\nworking under the close supervision of attorneys, and perform eligibility screening, including gathering \nclient demographic data, as well as providing advice and counsel to eligible individuals on a wide range \nof practice areas, including matters related to immigration, domestic violence, Section 8, public housing, \nMedi-Cal (California's Medicaid program), Supplemental Security Income C'SSI\"), CalWORKs \n(California's TANF program), and CalFresh (California's SNAP, or \"food stamps\" program). Nearly all \nthe immigrant clients BayL  egal serves are lawful permanent residents or humanitarian immigrants such \nas domestic violence survivors who qualify for U non-immigrant status (\"U visa'') or human trafficking \nsurvivors who qualify for T nonimmigrant status (\"T visa\"), and all our immigrant clients are eligible for \nlegal services per 45 C.F.R. § 1626.4-5. \n7.  BayLegal handles over 12,000 cases annually, and our intake units at the Legal Advice \nLine and Health Consumer Center handle over 26,000 calls per year.  We also provide legal services to \nthousands of individuals each year through pro per clinics. \n8.  I have served as Managing Attorney in Santa Clara County since 2013.  Over the last six \nyears, I have supervised attorneys and advocates who provide free legal services to Santa Clara residents \nin a number of areas, including eligibility for public benefits, immigration law, rights of survivors of \ndomestic violence and human trafficking, housing law, and others. \n9.  To demonstrate the way that the public charge rule has impacted BayLegal, I provide \ninformation known to me as a longtime legal aid attorney and as a manager at Bay Area Legal Aid, as \nwell as limited information about some people who are suffering harm as a result of the chilling effect \ncaused by the public charge rule.  By making this declaration I do not waive any attorney-client \nprivilege or client confidentiality. \nSystemic Barriers Complicating Application of the Public Charge Rule \n10.  It is very difficult for recipients of aid to obtain the information necessary to determine \nwhether the public charge mle applies to them, including: documentation in plain language that explains \nwhat benefits they have received, what funding streams were implicated in the provision of that aid, \nApp. 191\n2 \n\nwhich members of a household received aid, and in which months the aid was received ( especially if \nthat receipt was several years in the past). \n11.  In my experience, local welfare agencies often provide documentation of aid that is \nunclear, contains errors, and is rife with abbreviations and terms of art that are unfamiliar to the general \npublic. When an agency has made an error and later corrects it-for example, by granting aid to a \nhousehold member who is ineligible for benefits, and then rescinding that aid-it is often impossible to \nget accurate documentation or timelines showing all the relevant facts. \n12.  USCIS officials regularly display a lack of understanding about public benefits programs. \nusers \nFor example, BayLegal often asks  to waive filing fees for indigent clients. In connection with \nusers \nour fee waiver petitions, we regularly provide  with documentation that our clients receive \nmeans-tested public benefits.  We regularly receive incorrect rejections from USCIS decision-makers \nwho are confused by state-specific names for programs (e.g. in California, Medicaid is called Medi-Cal), \nor by similar-sounding programs (e.g. confusing Supplemental Security Income (SSI) with State \nDisability Insurance (SDI)).  BayL  egal attorneys are usually able to correct the mistakes made by \nUSCIS.  However, given our limited resources we are able to help only a small fraction of the people \nwho need assistance. \n13.  Based on my experience, I believe that immigrants subject to the public charge rule \nwould need the help of skilled legal experts if they are to successfully obtain all relevant information \nfrom the benefit-granting agencies needed to show whether they have received benefits that triggered the \nproposed public charge rule, and to explain and negotiate with USCIS to ensure that the information is \nreviewed correctly. However, there are not enough lawyers available and with the expertise to provide \nsuch help; further, even with legal representation it may at times be impossible to obtain documentation \nusers \nfrom the benefits programs that  can understand. As a result, I believe many eligible immigrants \nwill be too afraid to seek the aid they need - including testing and care during the COVID 19 pandemic. \nPublic Charge Rule Has a Dangerous Chilling Effect \n14.  In my experience as both a public benefits practitioner and a manager of other attorneys \npracticing in this area, I have observed that the recently enacted public charge rule has caused a chilling \nApp. 192\n3 \n\neffect, preventing needy immigrants- including those fleeing human trafficking, and asylees-from \ngetting the food and medical care that are essential to survival.  It has this effect even for families that \nare eligible for aid and who are exempt from the public charge rule, and for whom immigration status \nwould be unaffected by receiving aid.  And it has this effect even during the current public health \nemergency.  This is because the public charge rule is extremely confusing-both for advocates and for \nimmigrants who are less familiar with our legal system and may have limited English proficiency. \n15.  As explained above, there are multiple iterations of multiple categories of public benefit \nprograms, and it requires extreme technical proficiency to parse which versions of which aid programs \nmight trigger a presumption that a person is a \"public charge,\" and which do not.  There are also a wide \nvariety of different categories of immigration status, some of which are categorically exempted from the \npublic charge exclusion rule, and others of which are at risk of being deemed a public charge if they \nreceive aid.  To complicate things further, many families have members each of which has different \nimmigration status, different eligibility for benefits, and different risk of being deemed a public charge if \nthey receive aid.  As a result, most immigrants-and most immigration advocates--do not know \nwhether they will put their immigration status at risk if they apply for food aid or medical care that their \nfamilies need. \n16.  For our humanitarian immigrant clients who are fleeing abuse or exploitation, being \ndenied the ability to adjust their immigration status, and therefore having to return to their country of \norigin would be devastating. Clients who are asylees and refugees may face persecution, war, and deadly \nthreats iftbey return, while survivors of domestic violence or human trafficking may face recurrent \nabuse, loss of the legal protections from their abuser or trafficker, and retaliation for having cooperated \nwith American law enforcement. In short, for many of these immigrants, risking their ability to stay in \nthe United States is risking death. \n17.  USCIS can take years to process and approve applications for humanitarian immigration \nstatus, and this prolongs the period of uncertainty during which immigrants must make decisions about \naccessing needed services. For example, anticipated wait time for USCIS to adjudicate a U visa \napplication for a noncitizen survivor of domestic violence is more than 7 years, and it can take another 6 \nApp. 193\n4 \n\nor more years after receiving the U visa before that same immigrant is eligible to apply for lawful \npermanent residency and have their adjustment of status adjudicated. \n18.  Even for lawful permanent residents who may have been in the United States for decades, \nand who are not usually subject to the public charge rule, a decision to apply for benefits can pose risk. \nAs the immigrant or family members abroad get older, I have observed several times how a short trip to \nvisit family can be complicated by a sudden health crisis that requires a lengthier stay, and after 180 \ndays outside the United States, the lawful pennanent resident may need to seek readmission-triggering \nthe public charge grounds of exclusion. Predicting whether such a situation may arise in the next 36 \nmonths (the look-back period for considering receipt of benefits as a heavily negative factor) can feel \nlike an impossible gamble. \n19.  I and those under my supervision in the local offices who handle immigration, housing, \nand public benefits cases have also seen an increase in inquiries from clients, the general public, and \ncommunity-based organizations concerned that the new public charge rule is causing people to drop \nessential health or food programs out of fear for their immigration status. Specifically, over the past few \nweeks our Legal Advice Line and Health Consumer Center hotlines have seen an increase in calls from \npeople who need financial assistance, public benefits, or health care due to the public health crisis. For \nthose callers who are immigrants or in mixed-status households, we are frequently getting questions \nabout whether it is safe for them to get the health care and economic supports they need, and for which \nthey legally qualify, or whether doing so will endanger their immigration status. \n20.  Most of the fears we have heard in our local offices are from lawful permanent residents \nand survivors of domestic violence, who are contemplating dropping healthcare and nutrition programs, \nas well as employment support programs. Many of these clients have U.S. citizen children who will also \nlose access to public benefits programs ift heir parents simply drop out or refuse to apply for the \nprograms they need. \n21.  The aid programs that our clients and potential clients are dropping (o  r considering \ndropping) most frequently are those that provide basic essentials:  food (CalFresh and the Women \nInfants and Children nutrition program); health care-particularly for children-under Medi-Cal (the \nstate version of Medicaid); and services for pregnant women. \nApp. 194\n5 \n\n22.  Among the sorts of public charge concerns our staff attorneys have handled are:  a crime \nvictim with a U visa dropping health coverage during treatment for cancer due to fear of triggering \npublic charge; multiple calls from people afraid to access work supports and food assistance, such as a U \nvisa holder afraid to get CalWORKs for herself or her U.S. citizen children; immigrants avoiding public \nfood programs and going to food banks; and lawful permanent residents afraid that getting health \ninsurance for their U.S. citizen children will keep them from naturalizing. \n23.  I and the staff attorneys working under my supervision regularly reassure many of these \nexempt clients that they should not be subject to the new public charge rule, and can receive the aid they \nneed without fear of immigration consequences; but we are regularly told by our clients that they are \nstill afraid or unwilling to access the public benefits for which they and their children might otherwise \nqualify. \n24.  The public health crisis caused by COVID-19 has forced BayLegal to adapt its services to \naddress the most pressing of our clients' legal needs, while keeping up with ever-changing operating \nrules of courts and administrative agencies, yet we have still had to expend significant resources \naddressing fears about public charge.  Even in the face of this crisis, I have received inquiries from \nimmigration attorneys outside our organization who are afraid that their clients cannot access essential \nservices because of the public charge rule.  For example, I have learned of clients who are survivors of \nhuman trafficking, and who were laid off when their employers closed down because of COVID-19, but \nwho are too scared to apply for Unemployment Insurance Benefits. \n25.  In my capacity as Managing Attorney, I am aware that BayL  egal attorneys have also \nspoken with numerous immigrant crime victims in the past few weeks who have lost jobs or income due \nto COVID-19 and are too worried to get the help they need, including state-funded Medi-Cal and \nnutrition assistance, for fear it will prevent them from getting U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent \nresidence. Examples iriclude: \na.  a low-income crime victim with a U visa recently gave birth to a U.S. citizen \nchild, but even as the public health crisis was developing, she was afraid to seek \npublic health insurance for herself and her newborn due to public charge; \nApp. 195\n6 \n\nb.  a crime victim with a U visa whose work hours were cut, and who could no \nlonger afford to feed her family, but is too afraid to get food benefits for herself \nand her children; \nc.  another crime victim with a U visa whose employer closed due to COVID-19 \npublic health restrictions, and although the individual has the right to seek \nUnemployment Insurance Benefits- and needs those benefits for the economic \nsurvival of their family-they are too afraid to apply for aid; \nd.  A fourth crime victim with a U visa who cancelled nutrition assistance for herself \nand her child in the midst of economic hardship because she was worried about \npublic charge; and \ne.  another crime victim with a U visa who lost her job due to the pandemic, but was \nafraid to apply for Unemployment Insurance Benefits-and was even considering \nwhether she should cancel basic nutrition assistance for herself and her U.S. \ncitizen children because of public charge. \n26.  In my capacity as Managing Attorney, the attorneys staffing our Legal Advice Line and \nHealth Consumer Center hotlines also report numerous calls in the past few weeks from lawful \npennanent residents or U.S. citizens in mixed-status families suffering under the current pandemic and \nafraid to get nutrition or health programs they or their families need because of public charge. Examples \ninclude: \na  a single parent with lawful pennanent residency who was planning to cancel \nMedi-Cal coverage for herself and her U.S. citizen children in the midst of the \npandemic because she was afraid she would lose her immigration status and be \nseparated from her family; \nb.  a mother who is a U.S. citizen with U.S. citizen children, and who needs \nsubsidized healthcare, nutrition assistance, and housing, who was afraid to apply \nfor these benefits because she was afraid it would hurt the immigration status of \nher husband, a lawful permanent resident; \nApp. 196\n7 \n\nc.  a young lawful permanent resident who lost her job and was afraid to apply for \nMedi-Cal health coverage for fear of public charge; \nd.  a U.S. citizen who lost his job and needed to make sure his family could get \nhealth care, but was worried about getting Medi-Cal for himself and his family \nbecause his wife and one child were lawful permanent residents; \ne.  a developmentally-disabled U.S. citizen child whose parents, here on employment \nvisas, were afraid to get the Medi-Cal-funded developmental services their child \nneeded;and \nf.  a young father who was working despite the pandemic, but was worried he \nneeded to drop necessary Medi-Cal coverage for himself, his spouse, and their \nchildren due to public charge. \nConclusion \n27.  In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, BayL  egal is regularly responding to inquiries \nfrom people who should not be directly impacted by the rule-including citizens, lawful permanent \nresidents, and hwnanitarian immigrants-but who are nonetheless afraid.  My direct impressions based \non the nature and type oflegal inquiries we are receiving from the general public, from community \nbased organizations providing services to immigrants, and from other legal service providers, is that the \nnwnbers of people who will disenroll from benefits or forego benefits for which they or their children \nare eligible is much higher than the 2.5% estimate USCIS anticipates as the number of eligible \nimmigrants and mixed-status households who will forego needed aid due to the rule. \n28.  I believe this chilling effect will cause lawful permanent residents, domestic violence \nsurvivors, survivors of human trafficking, and U.S. citizen children wi~ immigrant parents to go \nwithout healthcare, nutrition assistance, and housing assistance they need to survive during the COVID-\n19 pandemic.  Without access to essential programs, individuals may become sick with the virus and \nsuffer irreparable harm to their physical and economic wellbeing - and also increase the risk of infection \nin the communities where they live. \nApp. 197\n8 \n\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct and that this declaration \nwas executed on April 3, 2020, in Fremont, Alameda County, California. \nLisa M. Newstrom \nApp. 198\n9 \n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Lawrence L. Benito, Executive Director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and \nRefugee Rights (ICIRR), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am over the age of 18, competent to testify as to the matters herein and make this \ndeclaration based on my personal knowledge. I submit this declaration in support of Respondents’ \napplication in the above-captioned matter. In my role as the Executive Director of ICIRR, I am \nresponsible for running all facets of the organization including the leadership of our membership \nand coalitions. \n2.  ICIRR is a non-profit organization located in Chicago, Illinois. ICIRR is dedicated \nto promoting the rights of immigrants and refugees to full and equal participation in the civic, \ncultural, social, and political life of our diverse society in Illinois and beyond. ICIRR is a \nmembership-based organization, representing nearly 100 nonprofit organizations and social and \nhealth service providers throughout Illinois, many of which provide health care, nutrition, housing, \nand other services for immigrants, including immigrants of color, regardless of their immigration \nstatus or financial means. A core mission of ICCIR and its member organizations is to provide \n1 \n  App. 199\n\nhealth  and  social  services  to  immigrant  Illinoisans.  ICIRR  member  organizations  include \ncommunity health centers, health and nutrition programs, social service providers and other \norganizations that work to ensure immigrants receive the supports they need to be successful. \nCreated in 1986, ICIRR has been at the forefront of helping immigrants realize and contribute to \nthe dream that is America. In that time, ICIRR won establishment of an Office of New Americans \nwithin the Governor’s office (2005) and the Office of the Mayor of the City of Chicago (2011); \ncreated the New Americans Initiative (2005), which has helped 534,000 people gain access to \ncitizenship and assisted 105,394 immigrants prepare applications for citizenship; created the \nImmigrant Family Resource Project (“IFRP”) (1999), which has connected more than 500,000 \nindividuals and families to safety net services; and led efforts to create the Cook County Direct \nAccess Program, which has expanded healthcare services to over 25,000 individuals. ICIRR also \noperates the Immigrant Healthcare Access Initiative (“IHAI”), which works to increase access to \ncare and improve health literacy for tens of thousands of low-income uninsured immigrants in \nIllinois, in order to reduce their reliance on emergency room care and to improve the overall public \nhealth of the community. As a part of IHAI, ICIRR leads the Illinois Alliance for Welcoming \nHealthcare, an alliance comprised of 25 healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, and \n20 community-based organizations that convene to create and share best practices in the provision \nof healthcare services to immigrants and their families. ICIRR also leads the Healthy Communities \nCook County (“HC3”) coalition, which seeks to address and mitigate barriers to accessing \nhealthcare for the uninsured, regardless of immigration status, through policy and systems change.  \n3.  In spring 2018, in direct response to the Proposed and Final Rule and the growing \nfear and confusion within immigrant communities, ICIRR co-founded the Protecting Immigrant \nFamilies-Illinois coalition (“PIF-IL”). PIF-IL  was created  specifically to (1)  respond to the \n2 \n  App. 200\n\nproposed changes to the public charge rule; and (2) provide assistance to and accurate information \nto immigrant communities seeking to safely make use of public benefits for which they are eligible.   \n4.  Since the news leaked about a proposed change to the public charge rule that \npenalize immigrants who used safety net programs, ICIRR and its member organizations have seen \na decrease in immigrants enrolling in public benefit programs and increase in immigrants seeking \nto disenroll from public benefit programs. In June 2019, ICIRR conducted a survey of its member \norganizations to document the impact of the Proposed Final Rule on its organizations and the \nindividuals they serve. From responses to that survey, ICIRR ascertained that there was a reduction \nin enrollment in public benefits programs, even those benefits not subject to the public charge rule, \nsuch as unemployment benefits and WIC.  The survey also confirmed that immigrants, even those \nwho are not subject to the public charge rule, were attempting to disenroll from SNAP, Medicaid, \nTANF, and WIC for themselves and even their U.S. citizen children out of fear that the rule will \nharm their immigration status and options.  \n5.  Since  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  decision  lifting  the  Illinois  injunction,  some \norganizations who are part of ICIRR’s Immigrant Family Resource Program (“IFRP”) report \nreceiving an increased number of calls from individuals expressing fears about how the use of \npublic benefits could subject them to the public charge rule. They are either afraid to enroll in \npublic benefits they are eligible for or are seeking to disenroll from public benefits they already \nreceive. In an effort to alleviate those fears and slow declining enrollment, one IFRP organization \nis planning to record a public charge informational video for the community. \nIncreased confusion due to the USCIS Public Charge COVID-19 guidance    \n6.  On or around March 13, 2020, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS) posted an alert (in English only).  This alert explained that while the Public Charge rule \n3 \n  App. 201\n\n“does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including \nCOVID-19,” USCIS was nonetheless required to “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-\ncash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination,” including most forms of federally funded \nMedicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge. \n7.  Due to confusion around this USCIS guidance, ICIRR member organizations and \nIFRP partners report that some immigrants fear that they cannot access medical treatment or testing \nfor COVID-19 due to the public charge rule. \nIncreased need for food, housing, and medical assistance in light of COVID-19 \n8.  Since the global health emergency began and Illinois residents became subject to a \nshelter in place order on March 21, 2020, ICIRR and  its member and IFRP partner organizations \nhave received an increase in calls from immigrants seeking assistance with food, housing, and \nmedical care, as well as an increased concern that using public benefits will subject them to the \npublic charge rule.   \n9.  Immigrants in Illinois, including individuals subject to the public charge rule, are \npredominately  employed  in  fields  or  industries  that  are  disproportionately  impacted  by  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, in that they are now either unemployed or considered essential workers. It \nis predicted that nearly 1.5 million Illinois workers will lose employment or hours due to COVID-\n19.  \n10.  Out of concern for the public health, Illinois has joined other states in closing all \nnon-essential businesses, including bars, restaurants, and most manufacturing businesses where \nimmigrants are disproportionately employed. Many have now lost their jobs as a result. Immigrants \nare also disproportionately employed as domestic workers, such as cleaning staff, personal care \n4 \n  App. 202\n\naides, or nannies, and many have lost their employment due to their employers’ losing their own \njob or experiencing a decline of income. All these individuals and their families are thus more \nlikely than ever to need public assistance, including SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance.  \n11.  At the same time, immigrants also are disproportionately  employed in fields \ndeemed essential, including home health care aides and grocery store employees. This essential \nstatus and the inability to work from home increases their exposure to COVID-19 and their need \nfor quality treatment and preventative care for themselves and the health of everyone they contact. \n12.  Organizations  that  are  part  of  ICIRR’s  IFRP  network  and  public  benefit \ncoordinators employed at organizations who are a part of PIF-Illinois report an increased volume \nof calls from immigrants, especially mixed-status households, who have lost employment as a \nresult  of  COVID-19.  These  callers  report  needing  cash  assistance,  free  health  care,  rental \nassistance, and help feeding their children, including U.S. citizen children. They are seeking \ninformation about enrolling in Section 8 or public housing, SNAP, and Medicaid, but they are \nconcerned that such enrollment, including for their U.S. citizen children, will subject them to the \npublic charge rule. They are also afraid to apply for unemployment benefits out of fear of becoming \na  public  charge,  even  though  they  will  not  be  subject  to  the  public charge  rule  for  using \nunemployment benefits. Callers afraid to apply for SNAP are referred to food pantries. Because \nmany food pantries in Latinx neighborhoods in Chicago have either closed or are seeing a marked \nincrease in requests for food assistance, fewer residents will have their food security needs met \nthrough local pantries.     \n13.  Since the COVID-19 crisis, fear remains rampant among immigrants calling these \norganizations for advice regarding medical testing and treatment. Callers are expressing concern \nthat receiving Covid-19 related medical testing or treatment for themselves, their families or their \n5 \n  App. 203\n\nfamily members will subject them to public charge. This concern is primarily coming from seniors \nor individuals with underlying health conditions, even though they are at greater risk of serious \nhealth complications or even death due to COVID-19. Many callers are concerned that seeking \nCOVID-19 related medical testing or treatment may risk their ability to stay in the country. \n \n \nI, Lawrence L.

NWIRP provides direct legal services to immigrants \nwith  low  income  in  Washington  State,  and  engages  in  systemic  advocacy  and  community \neducation around policies and practices impacting immigrant rights. As an organization, we have \nover three decades of experience with family-based adjustment of status and consular process, and \nwe have helped thousands apply for this important immigration benefit.   \n3.  In my role as Deputy Director, I provide supervision and oversight of legal services \nacross the organization, serve as an ambassador for NWIRP internally and externally, provide \n1 \n  App. 205\n\nstrategic leadership for the organization, and I provide direct representation and other forms of \nlegal assistance to NWIRP clients. \n4.  On February 24, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented \nits new public charge rule.  As expected, this change created a sense of fear and urgency in both \nthe impacted community members and legal practitioners, including NWIRP's legal advocates. \n5.  The  implementation  of the  new public  charge  rule  has  caused  an  uptick  in \navoidance of benefits by immigrants and their family members, including U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents as well as other immigrants who are otherwise not subject to a public charge \nanalysis. Immigrants are aware that applying for benefits will be considered either a negative factor \nor have a negative impact in a public charge determination as the rule lists as a factor to be \nconsidered whether the applicant for adjustment of status \"has applied for, been certified to receive, \nor received public benefits (as defined in the rule) on or after October 15, 2019\" (now February \n24, 2020). \n6.  Since the global health COVID-19 crisis began, immigrant communities have a \nheightened fear in accessing public benefits, even related to benefits not considered in the new \npublic charge rule analysis, like accessing a COVID-19 hotline service, food banks, or emergency \nhealth-related services. NWIRP has observed an increase in calls across our four offices related to \naccessing benefits and the impact this may have on a client's case or their family member's case. \nDespite clarification and the new rule's explicit mention that only an applicant's receipt of benefits \nwould be considered, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other immigrants who would \nnot be subject to a public charge analysis continue to be confused or hesitant to accessing much \nneeded benefits. For example, a community member who lacks health insurance asked whether \nthis would impact his ability to receive treatment for COVID-19. \n2 \nApp. 206\n\n7.  Since our communities became subject to a \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" emergency \norder, NWIRP has seen a rise in calls related to unemployment and financial insecurity and how \naccessing certain benefits could impact a person's case. See llttps://www.go  ernor.wa.tov/ne, s-\nmedia/inslee-extends-stav-home-stav-healthv-thr  mdi-may-4.  Our  offices  have  received \nquestions from asylum seekers, U visa applicants, and self-petitioners in need of food stamps for \ntheir children or food bank assistance, concerned that these benefits could subject them to a public \ncharge determination. We have also received calls from people with employment authorization \nwondering whether applying for unemployment would affect their asylum case due to public \ncharge. NWIRP' s social services coordinator has connected with three pregnant women who fear \naccessing care because of the public charge rule even though they are exempt to receive Medicaid \nin their situation. One woman was unwilling to enroll even after we explained her eligibility. \nAccess to testing and treatment in light o(CQT, TD-19 \n8.  While  local  efforts have  emerged to  compile resources  and provide frequently \nasked questions related to medical testing or treatment of COVID-19 and how this access does not \nhave public charge implications on a person's immigration case, immigrants continue to avoid \nseeking any assistance that in their minds could be considered in a public charge analysis. Instead, \ncommunity members who may be in need of medical care are reluctant to seek care because their \nfear of a future case denial based on a public charge determination overcomes any current need. \n9.  On or around March 13, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) \nposted an alert (in English only). This alert explained that while the Public Charge rule \"does not \nrestrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including COVID-\n19,\" USCIS was nonetheless required to \"consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public \nbenefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public \n,., \nJ \nApp. 207\n\ncharge inadmissibility determination,\" including most forms of federally funded Medicaid. See \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/12:reencard/public- harge. While USCIS encourages people to seek services \nin this situation, any receipt of this important service could be considered a negative factor in the \napplicant's totality of circumstances test even if they could submit a statement explaining the \nimpact. This does not in fact reduce fear in communities and confusion related to accessing medical \ntreatment or testing for COVID-19. We recently received a call from a community member asking \nwhether getting assistance for COVID-19 treatment would affect them later as a public charge. \nIncrease in food insec:uri()  ;n lighL o(  OVID-19 \n10.  During this COVID-19 crisis, NWIRP has limited our direct legal services as our \nfour offices are closed to the public and are conducting most of our services remotely. This past \nmonth, however, NWIRP has seen an increase in acting as a resource to community members who \nhave  questions  about  available  services  and  resources  due  to  loss  of employment,  potential \neviction, becoming homeless, and food insecurity. We have heard from a community advocate that \non a region of Washington's peninsula there are about 150 families (mix-status families) without \nwork until July as their work is seasonal and they are unable to afford moving to areas where there \nmay have access to more resources. On April 6, 2020, Washington's Governor announced school \nclosures for grades K-12 through the end of the school year. Many community members have had \ndifficulty choosing to care for their children or working, making their family's financial situation \neven more dire. We have heard from people who are being laid off from their jobs and are lawful \npermanent residents who are worried about applying for unemployment benefits. They are afraid \nthat  this  would  impact  their  future  application  for  naturalization  or  their  family  member's \napplication for adjustment of status due to a potential finding of public charge. We have been asked \nby service providers what the impact would be on a youth who is under 21 years of age receiving \n4 \nApp. 208\n\nmental health services under Medicaid and how that might impact their family-based immigration \ncase in the future, related to public charge. \n11.  Since the new DHS public charge rule went into effect, NWIRP has yet to file a \nfamily-based application for adjustment of status subject to the new rule. Clients are afraid and \nadvocates have found their work has more than doubled. The current COVID-19 crisis has added \nan extra layer of fear  and uncertainty in our community members'  lives and has negatively \nimpacted their pursuit for lawful immigration status. \nDATED this 7th day of April, 2020 at Seattle, Washington. \nMaria Lucia Chavez \nDeputy Director \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project \n5 \nApp. 209\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n_____________________________________________ \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \n \n                Applicants, \nv. \nNEW YORK, et al., \n \n                Respondents. \n \n \n \n \n  I, Lawrence L. Benito, Executive Director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and \nRefugee Rights (ICIRR), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \n \n1.  I am over the age of 18, competent to testify as to the matters herein and make this \ndeclaration based on my personal knowledge. I submit this declaration in support of Respondents’ \napplication in the above-captioned matter. In my role as the Executive Director of ICIRR, I am \nresponsible for running all facets of the organization including the leadership of our membership \nand coalitions. \n2.  ICIRR is a non-profit organization located in Chicago, Illinois. ICIRR is dedicated \nto promoting the rights of immigrants and refugees to full and equal participation in the civic, \ncultural, social, and political life of our diverse society in Illinois and beyond. ICIRR is a \nmembership-based organization, representing nearly 100 nonprofit organizations and social and \nhealth service providers throughout Illinois, many of which provide health care, nutrition, housing, \nand other services for immigrants, including immigrants of color, regardless of their immigration \nstatus or financial means. A core mission of ICCIR and its member organizations is to provide \n1 \n  App. 210\n\nhealth  and  social  services  to  immigrant  Illinoisans.  ICIRR  member  organizations  include \ncommunity health centers, health and nutrition programs, social service providers and other \norganizations that work to ensure immigrants receive the supports they need to be successful. \nCreated in 1986, ICIRR has been at the forefront of helping immigrants realize and contribute to \nthe dream that is America. In that time, ICIRR won establishment of an Office of New Americans \nwithin the Governor’s office (2005) and the Office of the Mayor of the City of Chicago (2011); \ncreated the New Americans Initiative (2005), which has helped 534,000 people gain access to \ncitizenship and assisted 105,394 immigrants prepare applications for citizenship; created the \nImmigrant Family Resource Project (“IFRP”) (1999), which has connected more than 500,000 \nindividuals and families to safety net services; and led efforts to create the Cook County Direct \nAccess Program, which has expanded healthcare services to over 25,000 individuals. ICIRR also \noperates the Immigrant Healthcare Access Initiative (“IHAI”), which works to increase access to \ncare and improve health literacy for tens of thousands of low-income uninsured immigrants in \nIllinois, in order to reduce their reliance on emergency room care and to improve the overall public \nhealth of the community. As a part of IHAI, ICIRR leads the Illinois Alliance for Welcoming \nHealthcare, an alliance comprised of 25 healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals, and \n20 community-based organizations that convene to create and share best practices in the provision \nof healthcare services to immigrants and their families. ICIRR also leads the Healthy Communities \nCook County (“HC3”) coalition, which seeks to address and mitigate barriers to accessing \nhealthcare for the uninsured, regardless of immigration status, through policy and systems change.  \n3.  In spring 2018, in direct response to the Proposed and Final Rule and the growing \nfear and confusion within immigrant communities, ICIRR co-founded the Protecting Immigrant \nFamilies-Illinois coalition (“PIF-IL”). PIF-IL  was created  specifically to (1)  respond to the \n2 \n  App. 211\n\nproposed changes to the public charge rule; and (2) provide assistance to and accurate information \nto immigrant communities seeking to safely make use of public benefits for which they are eligible.   \n4.  Since the news leaked about a proposed change to the public charge rule that \npenalize immigrants who used safety net programs, ICIRR and its member organizations have seen \na decrease in immigrants enrolling in public benefit programs and increase in immigrants seeking \nto disenroll from public benefit programs. In June 2019, ICIRR conducted a survey of its member \norganizations to document the impact of the Proposed Final Rule on its organizations and the \nindividuals they serve. From responses to that survey, ICIRR ascertained that there was a reduction \nin enrollment in public benefits programs, even those benefits not subject to the public charge rule, \nsuch as unemployment benefits and WIC.  The survey also confirmed that immigrants, even those \nwho are not subject to the public charge rule, were attempting to disenroll from SNAP, Medicaid, \nTANF, and WIC for themselves and even their U.S. citizen children out of fear that the rule will \nharm their immigration status and options.  \n5.  Since  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  decision  lifting  the  Illinois  injunction,  some \norganizations who are part of ICIRR’s Immigrant Family Resource Program (“IFRP”) report \nreceiving an increased number of calls from individuals expressing fears about how the use of \npublic benefits could subject them to the public charge rule. They are either afraid to enroll in \npublic benefits they are eligible for or are seeking to disenroll from public benefits they already \nreceive. In an effort to alleviate those fears and slow declining enrollment, one IFRP organization \nis planning to record a public charge informational video for the community. \nIncreased confusion due to the USCIS Public Charge COVID-19 guidance    \n6.  On or around March 13, 2020, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS) posted an alert (in English only).  This alert explained that while the Public Charge rule \n3 \n  App. 212\n\n“does not restrict access to testing, screening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including \nCOVID-19,” USCIS was nonetheless required to “consider the receipt of certain cash and non-\ncash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination,” including most forms of federally funded \nMedicaid.  See https://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge. \n7.  Due to confusion around this USCIS guidance, ICIRR member organizations and \nIFRP partners report that some immigrants fear that they cannot access medical treatment or testing \nfor COVID-19 due to the public charge rule. \nIncreased need for food, housing, and medical assistance in light of COVID-19 \n8.  Since the global health emergency began and Illinois residents became subject to a \nshelter in place order on March 21, 2020, ICIRR and  its member and IFRP partner organizations \nhave received an increase in calls from immigrants seeking assistance with food, housing, and \nmedical care, as well as an increased concern that using public benefits will subject them to the \npublic charge rule.   \n9.  Immigrants in Illinois, including individuals subject to the public charge rule, are \npredominately  employed  in  fields  or  industries  that  are  disproportionately  impacted  by  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, in that they are now either unemployed or considered essential workers. It \nis predicted that nearly 1.5 million Illinois workers will lose employment or hours due to COVID-\n19.  \n10.  Out of concern for the public health, Illinois has joined other states in closing all \nnon-essential businesses, including bars, restaurants, and most manufacturing businesses where \nimmigrants are disproportionately employed. Many have now lost their jobs as a result. Immigrants \nare also disproportionately employed as domestic workers, such as cleaning staff, personal care \n4 \n  App. 213\n\naides, or nannies, and many have lost their employment due to their employers’ losing their own \njob or experiencing a decline of income. All these individuals and their families are thus more \nlikely than ever to need public assistance, including SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance.  \n11.  At the same time, immigrants also are disproportionately  employed in fields \ndeemed essential, including home health care aides and grocery store employees. This essential \nstatus and the inability to work from home increases their exposure to COVID-19 and their need \nfor quality treatment and preventative care for themselves and the health of everyone they contact. \n12.  Organizations  that  are  part  of  ICIRR’s  IFRP  network  and  public  benefit \ncoordinators employed at organizations who are a part of PIF-Illinois report an increased volume \nof calls from immigrants, especially mixed-status households, who have lost employment as a \nresult  of  COVID-19.  These  callers  report  needing  cash  assistance,  free  health  care,  rental \nassistance, and help feeding their children, including U.S. citizen children. They are seeking \ninformation about enrolling in Section 8 or public housing, SNAP, and Medicaid, but they are \nconcerned that such enrollment, including for their U.S. citizen children, will subject them to the \npublic charge rule. They are also afraid to apply for unemployment benefits out of fear of becoming \na  public  charge,  even  though  they  will  not  be  subject  to  the  public charge  rule  for  using \nunemployment benefits. Callers afraid to apply for SNAP are referred to food pantries. Because \nmany food pantries in Latinx neighborhoods in Chicago have either closed or are seeing a marked \nincrease in requests for food assistance, fewer residents will have their food security needs met \nthrough local pantries.     \n13.  Since the COVID-19 crisis, fear remains rampant among immigrants calling these \norganizations for advice regarding medical testing and treatment. Callers are expressing concern \nthat receiving Covid-19 related medical testing or treatment for themselves, their families or their \n5 \n  App. 214\n\nfamily members will subject them to public charge. This concern is primarily coming from seniors \nor individuals with underlying health conditions, even though they are at greater risk of serious \nhealth complications or even death due to COVID-19. Many callers are concerned that seeking \nCOVID-19 related medical testing or treatment may risk their ability to stay in the country. \n \n \nI, Lawrence L.

I am a case manager at Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (“IRIS”).  IRIS, \nwhich primarily serves as a refugee resettlement program based in Connecticut, provides refugees \nwith a variety of services designed to help them on the road to self-sufficiency by providing \nlifesaving support during their transition to life in the United States.  IRIS also works with asylees, \nindividuals seeking asylum in the United States, undocumented immigrants, as well as other non-\nrefugee immigration status.  I work as a case manager for immigrants seeking asylum.  As a case \nmanager, I help my clients enroll their children in school, assist them in obtaining immigration \nassistance, and connect my clients with a variety of social services, including services provided by \nIRIS or the State of Connecticut.  I have worked for IRIS for the last year and graduated from the \nUniversity of Connecticut in 2013.  I have personal knowledge of all of the facts set forth in this \ndeclaration.  \n1 \n  App. 216\n\n+608/325Ā,5914671Ā.+(Ā,+)'#!%*Ȁ*'-,Ȁ# \"-Ȁ)-&\"Ȁ)+!'#$!$)!- \n2.  Since the Public Charge Rule went into effect at the end of February, I have \nobserved that many of my clients who are eligible for social services have refused to apply for \nthose necessary social services. \n3.  For example, at the end of February 2020, one of the families that I work with \ndisenrolled from HUSKY, the State of Connecticut’s public health coverage program for eligible \nchildren, parents, relative caregivers, elders, individuals with disabilities, adults without dependent \nchildren, and pregnant women, because they feared that there could be immigration consequences \nto their continued enrollment.  The parents worried that if they enrolled in health insurance, they \nwould risk negative immigration consequences and feared being separated from their child for \nimmigration reasons.  \n4.  The COVID-19 crisis has caused many of my clients to lose their employment, and \nmany face serious food insecurity.  However, some of my clients have refused to sign up for food \nbenefits because they fear the immigration consequences of accessing those services.  For example, \nin March of 2020, one family that I work with told me that it was better for them to be without \nfood than to apply for SNAP because they feared adverse immigration consequences.  Another \nclient recently refused to sign up to use IRIS’s own food pantry because of the Public Charge Rule.  \nI  could  not  convince  this  client—who  is  currently  unemployed  because  of  the  COVID-19 \nepidemic—to access this necessary food resource, even though use of the food pantry is totally \noutside of the scope of the Rule.  \n \n(cid:5)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:2)\nDATED this ______day of April, 2020 at New Haven, CT \n \n            ______________________________ \n            CAMILLE KRITZMAN \n2 \n  App. 217\n\nNo. 19A785 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \nDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, et al., \nApplicants, \nV. \nNEW YORK, et al., \nRespondents. \nI, Dana Kennedy, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby declare as follows: \nL  I am the Director of Community Partnerships at the Center for Health Progress \n(\"CHP\") in Denver, Colorado. In that role, I work to build the capacity of Colorado's healthcare \nsystems to better serve patients, especially focused on healthcare providers providing care to \nimmigrant communities. In partnership with several organizational partners, I offer trainings and \ndirect support to  healthcare providers  and  communities  on issues  related  to  the  impact of \nimmigration status on the availability of healthcare. As the Director of Community Partnerships, r \nalso collaborate closely with several colleagues at CHP who are in constant, direct communication \nwith immigrant communities concerning their healthcare needs and associated policies that impact \ntheir access to healthcare and related resources. I have worked with CHP for three and a half years \nand for more than fifteen years in the field of community health. I submit this declaration in support \nof Respondents' application in the above-captioned matter. \n2.  At the Center for Health Progress, our mission  is  to create opportunities and \neliminate barriers to  health  equity for  Coloradans. Our work with  communities throughout \nApp. 218\n\nColorado stems from the belief that all Coloradans should have the opportunity to live a healthy \nlife. As part of this work, we center the leadership of people most impacted systemic inequities in \nthe healthcare system to work with healthcare providers and policymakers to ensure that all \nindividuals and families can get the care they need. CHP partners with and serves communities \nfrom diverse backgrounds, including Latino, East African, and Somali immigrants. \n3.  In my work with CHP,  I  concentrate on building capacity among healthcare \nproviders, especially those serving large immigrant populations, to better provide service to their \npatients. To do this most effectively, I regularly solicit feedback from hospitals, clinics, and other \nhealthcare  providers as  to  the  issues  causing the greatest difficulty in reaching underserved \npopulations and promoting community health. I also regularly interact with benefits enrollment \nworkers based in healthcare clinics to assess their needs and maximize enrollment among eligible \nmembers of immigrant populations in benefits programs, including enrollment of U.S. citizen \nchildren from immigrant households. \n4.  State organizers at CHP play a  critical  role  in  advancing our m1ss10n,  each \nproviding one-on-one support to between five and ten immigrant clients who are facing difficulties \naccessing healthcare every day. Prior to the COVID-19 quarantine, CHP organizers also regularly \ndelivered trainings to larger groups. As part of their work, organizers empower leaders from the \ncommunity  to  educate  their  peers  and  policymakers  concerning  the  realities  of accessing \nhealthcare in the United States. CHP organizers have deep knowledge of the communities they \npartner with because of their personal experiences as immigrants themselves and/or because they \nspent decades growing up in the communities they serve. In some cases, CHP organizers have \npersonally navigated healthcare systems as immigrants or have done so for family members. This \npersonal  expertise  is  extremely  beneficial  in  identifying the  most pressing  challenges  that \n2 \nApp. 219\n\nimmigrant communities in Colorado face in obtaining necessary healthcare, such as language \nbarriers, affordability, and fears associated with immigration status. Their personal experiences \nallow them to better assist Colorado's immigrant communities by providing culturally competent \nsupport. I regularly speak with CHP organizers and have personal knowledge of their observations \nand information they gather from communjties they work with. \nThe Public Charge Rule Has Created Fear and C01~fusion Among CHP Clients \n5_  Over the past two years - and especially since the Supreme Court stayed lower \ncourt orders preventing the DHS public charge rule from being implemented in January - CHP \norganizers report that addressing healthcare  needs  in  the  immigrant community has  become \nsignificantly  more  difficult.  For example,  some  families  that  organizers  speak  with  have \nwithdrawn their U.S. citizen children from healthcare coverage out of a mistaken fear that their \nchildren's coverage will trigger immigration consequences related to public charge. Families are \nalso generally frightened and confused about who the rule applies to and how, and are forgoing \nservices they are eligible for because of this fear. These community members believe that they \nmust make an extremely painful choice between accessing assistance they need and are eligible \nfor and keeping their families together. \n6_  Confusion  and  fear  among  immigrants  as  to  how  public  charge  applies  is \nwidespread  across  a  variety  of programs.  Since  the  mid-January,  2020,  CHP  staff have \nencountered many families who withdrew from healthcare, nutrition, and other support systems, \noften dis,eorolling or refraining from enrolling eligible citizen chiJdren into those programs. For \nexample, CHP staff counseled a single mother of an autistic U.S. citizen child. The client was \nafraid to enroll her son in necessary healthcare and educational services because of fear that it \nwould complicate her pending application for adjustment to permanent residency in the United \n3 \nApp. 220\n\nStates, despite the rule's exclusion of benefits received by the eligible citizen children from the \npublic charge test. Similarly, classes of immigrants to whom the public charge rule does not apply, \nsuch as Lawful Permanent Residents, have also disenrolled from services out of the mistaken fear \nthat they could face immigration consequences for receiving benefits. In other cases, community \nmembers have received the incorrect impression that receiving assistance not covered by the public \ncharge rule, such as accepting donations from food banks or allowing their children to access free \nschool lunch, will have immigration consequences associated with public charge. One particularly \ntroubling example involved a pregnant woman in her third trimester who told CHP staff that she \nwas foregoing prenatal care because she believed that any hospital bills she might accrue would \ncomplicate her ability to adjust her immigration status in the future even though medical assistance \nreceived while pregnant is not considered during the test. Although CHP organizers spend many \nhours trying to explain how the complex public charge rule operates and connecting clients to \nservices they are eligible for, it is extremely difficult to combat the fear that the individual has \nwithout certainty that they will not be affected by the rule. For this reason, many families continue \nto disenroll or refrain from enrolling despite our efforts. \n7..  On April  2, 2020, a CHP organizer spoke with an immigrant mother from  El \nSalvador with questions about healthcare options for her U.S. citizen daughter. The caller is in the \nprocess of applying for permanent residence and is fearful of accepting any benefits for her \ndaughter at this ti.me. She informed the CHP organizer that she plans to let her daughter's Medicaid \ncoverage lapse, because she fears that her continued enrollment in the program will count against \nher as she tries to adjust her status. \n4 \nApp. 221\n\nThe Rule Has Erected Barriers to Healthcare Access \n8.  Like CHP organizers, healthcare providers have similarly expressed deep concern \nabout their ability to provide services to patients in need because of community fears associated \nwith public charge. Since the beginning of the year, each training I have presented to providers \nrelated to healthcare access among immigrants has prompted questions from attendees about the \nimpacts of the public charge rule, even where the training was otherwise unrelated to public charge. \nInterest among hospital and clinic personnel in providing accurate information and learning ways \nto overcome fear of public charge in the immigrant community has necessitated additional learning \nby CHP and demonstrates the scope of the rule's impact on healthcare systems in Colorado. I have \nwitnessed first hand a marked increase in questions about public charge from healthcare cbnics \nand other providers, as well as from human and social services organizations since January 2020. \n9.  Healthcare clinics, which provide low-cost medical services on a sliding scale for \npeople who do not have health coverage, frequently offer to assist eligible immigrants and their \nchildren  with  enrollment  in  healthcare  services  like  Medicaid,  or  for  other coverage  like \nColorado's Child Health Plan Plus. As recently as early April, clinics report that many eligible \nimmigrants have refused enrollment in these programs because of mistaken beliefs about potential \nimmigration consequences for receipt of healthcare benefits under public charge and associated \nfears. Each clinic that I have spoken to this year about their work with immigrant communities has \ndescribed this problem. \nCHP Clients Remain Fea,ful ofA  ccepting Healthcare Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic \nI 0.  The current national crisis has furthered the need for CHP to assist immigrant \nfamilies. Due to Colorado's state-wide stay-at-home order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nCHP closed its offices and stopped providing in-person services to communities. CHP's staff has \n5 \nApp. 222\n\nshifted to providing services over the phone wherever possible. CaJI volume since CHP staffb egan \nworking remotely has  been extremely  high.  During this time,  CHP  has heard from  several \nimmigrant clients who are uninsured or at risk oflosing their insurance and has assisted them with \naccess to coverage and/or medical services. \n11.  Since Monday, March 23, 2020, the majority of calls to CHP have been from clients \nfrom immigrant communities who are confused or frightened about how their families will be \nimpacted  by COVID-19.  Clients  have  asked  for  information  about  symptoms,  for  simple, \nunderstandable descriptions of the meaning of shelter-in-place, as well as questions about how to \naccess needed items like school supplies, and who qualifies as an \"essential worker.\" CHP staff \nhave also received calls from immigrant clients expressing interest in federal support programs \navailable to them due to economic hardship they have experienced because of the pandemic, but \nwho fear accepting assistance because of immigration consequences related to public charge. Some \nhave chosen not to seek out nutritional and health benefits due to public charge related fears. \n12.  Since closing its offices, CHP bas focused on ensuring that individuals without \ninsurance can still access healthcare. As part of this effort, CHP is in frequent contact with \nhealthcare clinics that provide low-cost services and is gathering information about any challenges \nthat healthcare facilities are experiencing in serving immigrant communities, including where \ncommunity members show symptoms of COVID-19. On Friday, March 27, 2020, I spoke with a \ncommunity partner concerned with whether and how immigrant clients can access testing for \nCOVID-19 given various barriers to healthcare access they experience. Since then, CHP has \nincreasingly heard from immigrants about their fears related to accessing any COVID-19-related \nservices, other healthcare, or basic support services. While this has always been true to a degree, \n6 \nApp. 223\n\nwe have observed greater anxiety in the community because of the degree of economic uncertainty \nthe country is facing and fears ofj ob loss. \n13.  On March 20, 2020 ata Pueblo food bank, two CHP organizers spoke with a woman \nseeking services. She sought out CHP staff to ask whether it was possible to get COVID-] 9 testing \nanonymously. Although she and her husband were fearful of flu-like of symptoms, she refused a \nreferral to a clinic because she was afraid that it would impact her immigration status. An executive \ndirector of a community development non-profit in Commerce City, Colorado has also reported to \nme directly that several clients with mixed status families - where some family members have \npermanent immigration status and others do not - have described flu-like symptoms in their \nhouseholds. These families are afraid to seek medical care at local clinics because they believe that \ntesting and related services could someday count against them under the public charge rule. \nAccording to the director, \"this puts the rest of their family and the entire community at risk for \ncontracting COVID-19.\" \n14.  We are aware that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted an \nalert in English only in March explaining that public charge rule \"does not restrict access to testing, \nscreening, or treatment of communicable diseases, including COVlD-19 .\" This notice also stated \nthat USCIS would still \"consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, including \nthose  that  may be  used  to  obtain  testing  or treatment for  COVID-19  in a  public  charge \ninadmissibility  determination,\"  including  most  forms  of federally  funded  Medicaid.  See \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-cbarge. While we have emphasized the notice in sharing \ninformation with our clients, communities that CHP works are typically unaware of this notice \nuntil we reach them. Despite this notice, the immigrant populations we speak to remain concerned \nabout accessing healthcare coverage or low-cost care and organizations who work with our \n7 \nApp. 224\n\ncommunities continue to ask questions about whether immigrant clients can access COVID-19 \ntesting. \n15.  The dangers of COVID-19 to the immigrant communities that CHP partners with \nand serves are extremely worrisome to me and to my colleagues. A significant portion of our client \npopulation works in rural towns, such as Fort Morgan, Colorado, where many are employed as \nessential  workers in meatpacking plants, dairies, or sugar beet factories. Our clients in those \nindustries will remain exposed to crowds of their coworkers and will therefore be at greater risk \nfor COVID-19 infections than people who are s.heltering-in-place. However, most of our clients \nwho work in Fort Morgan are immigrants - many of whom are uninsured - and would avoid \nhealthcare if they were to show signs of COVID-19 infection either because they cannot afford to \npay out-of-pocket costs or because they are afraid that receiving free services would subject them \nto immigration consequences under the public charge mle. The likelihood that they would avoid \ncare because of economic and immigration concerns risks not only their health, but the health of \nother people in their workplace. Other clients we serve throughout Colorado in various essential \nindustries face similar risks. They are terrified of being separated from their families. This fear is \nlikely to prompt them to not only refuse to seek care - even in times of serious need - for \nthemselves and also for children who may be exposed to COVID-19, as other clients have prior to \nthe pandemic. \n9th \nDATED this  day of April, 2020 at Denver, Colorado \nDana Kennedy \n8 \nApp. 225\n\n \n \nMarch 18, 2020 \n \nChad Wolf  \nActing Secretary  \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security  \n2707 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE  \nWashington, DC 20528  \n \nMatthew Albence \nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Director \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n500 12th Street, S.W.  \nWashington, D.C. 20536 \n \nKenneth T. Cuccinelli  \nSenior Official Performing the Duties of the Director  \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  \n20 Massachusetts Ave. NW  \nWashington, DC 20001 \n \nDear Acting Secretary Wolf, Acting Directors Albence and Cuccinelli: \n \nAs the leadership of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, NYC Health + \nHospitals, NYC Department of Social Services and NYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, \nwe write to urge the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and its component \nagencies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”), to immediately take critical actions as a part of the nationwide \nCOVID-19 pandemic response. \n \nOur city is in the midst of a national effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to ensure that \nthose who become severely ill and in need of health services are able to access them without \nbarriers.  Through a multilingual messaging campaign and in coordination with elected officials, \ncommunity partners, and health care providers, we are disseminating guidance to New Yorkers, \nincluding urging all New Yorkers to practice good hand hygiene and to stay home if they are \nfeeling sick. We are also advising New Yorkers who are ill that if their symptoms worsen, they \nshould consult with their health care provider.        \n \nTo minimize the consequences of this pandemic as much as possible, it is critical that all \nresidents of our city are able to follow the guidance issued by public health authorities and that \n1 \n  App. 226\n\nthey seek care when they need it – without fear, and regardless of immigration status or ability to \npay.  \n \nUnfortunately, we know that many families in our immigrant communities are already fearful \ndue to changes in immigration policy, such as the recently implemented new public charge rule, \nas well as due to a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement in New York City.  Even prior \nto the current COVID-19 crisis, there was tremendous confusion and fear about the use of health \nservices and other supportive services and possible negative impacts on immigrant families’ \nability to remain together now or in the future.  Thus, for months, our agencies have worked with \npartners to promote a welcoming message to all New Yorkers to “seek care without fear.”   \n \nWith this pandemic upon us, we are deeply concerned as we reinforce this message and address \nany fears that will deter immigrants from seeking the care they need.  As leaders charged with a \nduty to protect the health and well-being of the City of New York as a whole, we know that now \nmore than ever, these kinds of barriers to care will only cause harm to public health – and in this \ncase, may lead to increased transmission of disease and adverse health outcomes for individuals.  \nLives will be lost if action is not taken to address these barriers. \n \nAccordingly, we ask that during this public health crisis, USCIS suspend implementation \nof the final rule on Public Charge Inadmissibility to facilitate public health efforts to fight \nthe pandemic.  The continued implementation of this rule undermines our efforts to mitigate the \nharm of COVID-19.  For well over a year, we have invested tremendous time and resources as a \nCity to combat widespread confusion and fear around the rule.  We have engaged extensively \nwith a wide array of stakeholders – medical professionals, patients, staff and clients of City \nagencies and services, communities and community-based organizations, journalists, and elected \nofficials.  Across the board, we have heard confusion and fear about many aspects of the rule, \nincluding how a person’s use of healthcare could affect their immigration status, even for \npermanent residents and others not subject to public charge.  We continue to undertake robust \noutreach and education efforts in an attempt to stop misinformation, but the need for this work \npersists.  Against the backdrop of this rapidly spreading virus, our work to protect the health of \nNew Yorkers is hindered by the ongoing implementation of the Public Charge rule.  \n \nWhile we recognize and appreciate the public message USCIS shared on March 13 urging \nindividuals to get necessary medical treatment related to COVID-19 and clarifying, among other \nthings, that care received related to COVID-19 will not be considered in public charge \ndeterminations, we remain concerned about the level of public misunderstanding and confusion \nregarding public charge, especially among those who are not subject to the rule. At this time, \nfrom a public health perspective, the strongest possible message we can share to address \nconfusion about public charge and COVID-19 is to affirm that the new rule has been suspended \nfor the duration of this crisis.   \n \nIn addition, we also urge DHS to take into account the efforts of local and state public \nhealth officials during the COVID-19 crisis in its immigration enforcement activities and \nadjust those activities appropriately by suspending planned escalations in immigration \nenforcement and accounting for at-risk individuals in making detention determinations. \nWe appreciate the recent public reinforcement of ICE’s sensitive locations guidance. However \n2 \n  App. 227\n\nmore can and should be done. In light of significant barriers to care already experienced by \nimmigrant communities, the planned escalations in civil immigration enforcement in New York \nCity and other cities this spring will almost certainly be counterproductive to public health \nefforts. The arrest and detention of individuals who are most at risk for severe illness (including \nthose with chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or weakened immune systems) \nand the prospective spread of COVID-19 in immigration detention facilities is also of significant \nconcern. We need individuals and families to work with our teams to better understand the \nspread of the disease and its characteristics. Thus, ICE should suspend escalations in \nimmigration enforcement and any detention determinations must be made with consideration of \nthe current crisis and the risk of diminishing the willingness of individuals to engage with \nmedical providers and public health authorities.  \n \nThis pandemic requires a coordinated response that sets aside politicized rhetoric and the \nongoing immigration debate to lean into what public health experts widely and confidently agree \non: the way to mitigate harm from the COVID-19 crisis with the least possible damage is to take \nevery measure available to ensure that every member of our society is equally capable of \naccessing the health services they need, when recommended by public health officials. We urge \nyou to take these steps without delay.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nDr. Oxiris Barbot \nCommissioner \nNYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  \n \n \nDr. Mitchell Katz \nPresident and CEO \nNYC Health + Hospitals  \n \n \n \nBitta Mostofi \nCommissioner \nNYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs  \n \n \n3 \n  App. 228\n\n \nSteven Banks \nCommissioner \nNYC Department of Social Services  \n \n \n4 \n  App. 229",

App. 6-32).   \nSTATEMENT \n1.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 \net seq., provides that an alien is “inadmissible” if, “in the \nopinion of the [Secretary of Homeland Security] at the time of \napplication for admission or adjustment of status, [the alien] is \nlikely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge.”    8  U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4)(A);  see  Stay  Appl.  5-8.    In  August  2019,  following \nnotice and comment rulemaking, DHS promulgated a rule regarding \npublic-charge inadmissibility determinations under the INA.  84 \nFed. Reg. 41,292, 41,501 (Aug. 14, 2019) (Rule).  The Rule defines \n\n2 \n“public charge” -- which the statute itself does not define -- to \nmean  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more  [designated]  public \nbenefits  * * *  for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \nany  36-month  period  (such  that,  for  instance,  receipt  of  two \nbenefits  in  one  month  counts  as  two  months).”    Ibid.    The \ndesignated  public  benefits  include  cash  assistance  for  income \nmaintenance and certain federally funded or administered non-cash \nbenefits, including most Medicaid benefits, Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance  Program  benefits,  and  federal  housing  assistance.  \nIbid.  They do not, however, include emergency medical services \nunder Medicaid.  Id. at 41,363, 41,483-41,484, 41,501.  Nor do \nthey include non-cash benefits that are not federally funded or \nadministered, such as state and local public benefits.  Id. at \n41,312.  Receipt of those benefits therefore will not be considered \nin making a public-charge inadmissibility determination under the \nRule.   \nIn August 2019, movants -- a group of three States and the \nCity  of  New  York  --  challenged  the  Rule  in  the  United  States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York.  Movants \nargued that the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is not a \npermissible construction of the INA, that the Rule is arbitrary \nand capricious, and that the Rule violates the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.  On October 11, 2019, the district \ncourt  granted  movants’  request  for  a  nationwide  preliminary \n\n3 \ninjunction  and  stay  under  5  U.S.C.  705  barring  DHS  from \nimplementing the Rule.  See Mot. App. 6-29.  The district court \nalso granted identical relief in another case filed by private \nplaintiffs.  See Stay Appl. 9. \nOn  January  27,  2020,  this  Court  stayed  the  nationwide \ninjunctions  issued  by  the  district  court  in  their  entirety, \n“pending  disposition  of  the  Government’s  appeal  in  the  United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and disposition of \nthe Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ \nis timely sought.”  140 S. Ct. 599, 599.  In a concurring opinion, \nJustice  Gorsuch,  joined  by  Justice  Thomas,  expressed  concerns \nabout  “the  underlying  equitable  and  constitutional  questions \nraised  by  the  rise  of  nationwide  injunctions.”    Id.  at  601.  \nJustices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan would have denied \nthe application for a stay.  Id. at 599. \n2.  The government also has been litigating challenges to \nthe Rule in four other district courts.  See Stay Appl. 12-13 \n(describing other litigation).  Two of those district courts issued \nnationwide injunctions against implementation of the Rule, while \nthe remaining two issued more limited injunctions.  See ibid.   \nThe  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit \ngranted the government’s motions for stays pending appeal in the \ncases  filed  in  that  circuit,  including  one  case  in  which  the \ndistrict court had entered a nationwide injunction.  City & County \n\n4 \nof San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773 (2019).  In a lengthy \npublished opinion that canvassed the history of the public-charge \nprovision and related immigration laws, the Ninth Circuit held \nthat “DHS has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits, \nthat it will suffer irreparable harm, and that the balance of the \nequities and public interest favor a stay.”  Id. at 781.  The \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit also granted \na stay pending appeal of the nationwide injunction entered by a \ndistrict court in Maryland.  Order, Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. \nTrump, No. 19-2222 (Dec. 9, 2019).   \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \ndid not grant the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal of \nan  injunction  against  the  Rule  issued  by  a  district  court  in \nIllinois, and denied the government’s renewed motion for a stay \nfollowing  this  Court’s  issuance  of  a  stay  in  this  case.    See \n2/10/2020  Order,  Cook  County  v.  Wolf,  No.  19-3169.    In  its \nsubsequent application to this Court for a stay of the Illinois \ninjunction,  the  government  explained  that  by  staying  the \nnationwide injunctions here, the Court had “necessarily determined \nthat the government had a fair prospect of success  * * *  on the \nmerits of its defense of the challenged Rule.”  Stay Appl. at 15, \nWolf  v.  Cook  County,  No.  19A905  (Feb.  13,  2020).    This  Court \ngranted a stay of the Illinois injunction “pending disposition of \nthe Government’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for \n\n5 \nthe Seventh Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition \nfor a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.”  Wolf v. \nCook County, 140 S. Ct. 681, 681 (2020) (No. 19A905).   \n3.  On March 13, 2020, President Trump issued a proclamation \nstating  “that  the  COVID-19  outbreak  in  the  United  States \nconstitutes a national emergency.”  Proclamation No. 9994, 85 Fed. \nReg. 15,337 (Mar. 18, 2020).  That same day, U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance explaining that it \n“encourages  all  those,  including  aliens,  with  symptoms  that \nresemble  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  (fever,  cough, \nshortness  of  breath)  to  seek  necessary  medical  treatment  or \npreventive services.  Such treatment or preventive services will \nnot negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge \nanalysis.”    Mot.  App.  44  (emphasis  added).    The  guidance \nspecifically states that “[t]o address the possibility that some \naliens  impacted  by  COVID-19  may  be  hesitant  to  seek  necessary \nmedical  treatment  or  preventive  services,  USCIS  will  neither \nconsider  testing,  treatment,  nor  preventative  care  (including \nvaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as \npart of a public charge inadmissibility determination.”  Ibid.   \nARGUMENT  \nThis  Court  has  twice  stayed  the  effect  of  preliminary \ninjunctions preventing implementation of the Rule.  Both times, \nthe Court’s entry of a stay reflected its assessment of whether \n\n6 \nchallenges to the Rule are likely to succeed.  Movants do not argue \nthat  the  current  public-health  crisis  has  any  bearing  on  that \nassessment,  and  they  do  not  ask  this  Court  to  revisit  it.  \nRemarkably, movants nevertheless ask the Court to enter relief \nthat would require DHS to modify the status quo nationwide by \nhalting its ongoing implementation of the Rule.  In other words, \neven though movants’ suit is likely to fail as a legal matter, \nthey want this Court to block the Rule in the interim by evaluating \nnew  declarations  and  making  a  factual  assessment  of  how  the \nExecutive Branch should best respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \nMovants identify no case in which this Court has ever granted \nthat sort of relief.  The Executive Branch has moved aggressively \nto address the current public-health emergency.  As relevant here, \nit has made clear that aliens’ use of publicly funded prevention \nand treatment services related to COVID-19 will not be considered \nin making predictions about whether aliens are likely to become \npublic charges in the future.  Movants’ attempt to discount that \nguidance  is  more  than  incorrect;  it  is  unhelpful  by  creating \nconfusion about the Rule and the government’s COVID-19 response in \nan effort to advance this litigation.  In any event, movants’ \ndeclarations -- submitted for the first time in this Court -- \nprovide no basis for this Court to second-guess the Executive’s \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n\n7 \n1.  To  the  government’s  knowledge,  this  Court  has  never \narticulated the standard applicable to a motion to vacate a stay \npreviously issued by the full Court.  That is unsurprising, given \nthat movants have not identified any instance in which the Court \nhas granted a contested motion to vacate or even temporarily lift \na stay that the full Court had previously granted.  Cf. Cities \nServ. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 487 U.S. 1245, 1245 (1988) (partially \ngranting a “[j]oint application to vacate the stay”); Stephen M. \nShapiro, et al., Supreme Court Practice § 17.12, at 897 (10th ed. \n2013)  (explaining  that  even  stay  orders  entered  by  individual \nJustices are reviewed and reversed by the Court “only in the most \nextraordinary circumstances”).   \nWhen, as here, a motion asks this Court to vacate or lift a \nstay in a manner that would materially change the status quo, the \ncorrect legal standard should be similar to the one that the Court \nwould apply if it were vacating or lifting a lower court’s order, \nor enjoining an administrative rule in the first instance.  See \nMot. 14 (invoking the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, and Section \n705 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 705).  The status \nquo secured by a prior order of this Court should not be entitled \nto less respect than the status quo secured by an order of a lower \ncourt.  Cf. Supreme Court Practice § 15.6, at 837-840 (describing \nthe  heightened  standard  this  Court  applies  to  petitions  for \nrehearing).   \n\n8 \nBut  even  assuming  that  movants  in  effect  seek \nreconsideration, at a minimum they bear the burden of showing that \nthe  Court’s  previous  determination  that  the  government  had \nsatisfied  the  factors  for  obtaining  a  stay  --  a  reasonable \nprobability  of  certiorari,  a  fair  prospect  of  success  on  the \nmerits, and a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a stay -- is \nnow incorrect in light of the current public-health crisis.  See \nConkright v. Frommert, 556 U.S. 1401, 1402 (2009) (Ginsburg, J., \nin chambers) (setting forth the factors to obtain a stay).  Movants \nhave not attempted to make that showing; their motion does not \neven  cite  those  factors,  much  less  explain  how  the  COVID-19 \npandemic renders incorrect the Court’s legal judgment as to those \nfactors.  That is reason enough to deny the motion.   \n2.  In  particular,  as  the  government  has  explained (Stay \nAppl. 18-31), and as the Ninth Circuit has recognized in a lengthy \npublished opinion addressing materially identical challenges to \nthe Rule, see City & County of San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F. 3d \n773 (2019), the government is likely to succeed on the merits of \nits defense of the Rule because the Rule “easily” qualifies as a \npermissible  interpretation  of  the  INA,  id.  at  799.    Movants’ \nchallenge  to  the  Rule  is  inconsistent  with  the  INA’s  broader \nstructure, express statutory statements of national immigration \npolicy, and DHS’s careful and considered judgment about how best \n\n9 \nto implement its responsibilities under the INA.  See Stay Appl. \n18-31; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 3-10.   \nThis Court has twice granted relief to the government based \non those arguments about the likelihood that challenges to the \nRule would fail -- first in its January 27 order in this case, and \nlater in its order staying the Illinois-specific injunction in \nWolf v. Cook County, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020) (No. 19A905).  Yet \nmovants make no attempt to show that the intervening COVID-19-\nrelated events on which their motion relies have any bearing on \nthe legal merit of their challenge.  Nor could they:  all of those \nevents post-date the finalization of the Rule and are thus legally \nirrelevant in their underlying challenge.  Movants’ attempts to \nset aside the Rule are thus just as unlikely to succeed now as \nthey were three months ago.  And because the Rule is lawful, the \nCourt should not lift its January 27 stay simply because movants \nbelieve the Rule reflects bad policy.   \nMovants’ reliance (Mot. 17) on Orloff v. Willoughby, 72 S. Ct. \n998 (1952) (Douglas, J., in chambers), and King v. Smith, 88 S. Ct. \n842 (1968) (Black, J., in chambers), is misplaced.  In Orloff, \nJustice  Douglas  did  not  lift  the  stay  that  he  had  previously \nentered (as movants request here); rather, he simply clarified \nthat  the  stay  --  which  he  had  issued  solely  to  preserve  this \nCourt’s jurisdiction over a service member’s habeas petition -- \nwould  not  prevent  the  government  from  reassigning  the  service \n\n10 \nmember to another military base.  See 72 S. Ct. at 998-989.  In \nKing, Justice Black vacated his own previously issued stay in light \nof “[a] recent congressional amendment to the” relevant federal \nstatute that altered his earlier assessment of the stay factors, \nsee 88 S. Ct. at 842, and the full Court eventually ruled in favor \nof the parties that had sought the stay modification, see King v. \nSmith, 392 U.S. 309, 333 (1968).  The motion in King was thus \nunlike  the  motion  here  in  at  least  three  important  respects:  \n(i) it  concerned  a  single  Justice’s  modification  of  his  own \npreviously  issued  stay;  (ii)  the  movants  had  a  likelihood  of \nsuccess  on  the  merits;  and  (iii)  the  motion  depended  on  an \nintervening legal change, rather than contested arguments about \nthe effect of intervening factual developments.   \n3.  Rather than explain how the Court erred in its evaluation \nof any of the traditional stay factors when issuing its January 27 \norder,  movants  argue  (Mot.  14)  that  the  current  public-health \ncrisis has “shifted the balance of equities.”  When evaluating an \napplication for a stay, such considerations are relevant only “in \na close case.”  Conkright, 556 U.S. at 1402 (Ginsburg, J., in \nchambers) (citation omitted); see ibid. (“[I]n a close case it may \nbe appropriate to ‘balance the equities’ -- to explore the relative \nharms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the \npublic at large.”) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, to the extent \nthe Court granted the January 27 stay because the government had \n\n11 \nmade a strong showing on the traditional stay factors set forth \nabove, it would not have had occasion to engage in that balancing \n-- and nothing in the present motion would even be relevant to the \npropriety of the existing stay.   \nTo the extent that the balance of equities factored into the \nCourt’s prior order, movants have not met their burden to show \nthat  those  equities  have  shifted  in  a  way  that  would  warrant \nrevisiting the Court’s earlier decision.  Movants assert (Mot. 14) \nthat  the  Rule  is  “impeding  efforts  to  stop  the  spread  of  the \ncoronavirus,  preserve  scarce  hospital  capacity  and  medical \nsupplies, and protect the lives of everyone in our communities.”  \nThey therefore contend (Mot. 22) that it would be in “the public \ninterest”  to  lift  the  stay,  which  would  have  the  effect  of \nsuspending the Rule, in its entirety, nationwide.  But the public \nhas  an  interest  in  both  addressing  the  COVID-19  crisis  and \nenforcing lawful immigration policy -- and it is the Executive \nBranch that is charged with determining how best to do both.  See \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435-436 (2009).  The Executive Branch \nhas considered the arguments movants advance, and has concluded \nthat movants’ preferred outcome -- a wholesale suspension of the \nRule, just as they sought before the COVID-19 crisis -- is not \nwarranted.  Movants provide no basis for this Court to overrule \nthat judgment about how the Nation’s lawful immigration policies \nshould be implemented during the COVID-19 crisis.   \n\n12 \nRather than a wholesale suspension, the Executive Branch has \ninstead opted to take more targeted steps to ensure that the Rule \nis being administered in an appropriate way in light of current \nconditions.  Specifically, USCIS’s March 13 guidance makes clear \nthat the government will exclude from consideration the receipt of \nany public benefits related to COVID-19 care -- including testing, \ntreatment,  preventive  care,  and  vaccinations  --  when  making \npublic-charge inadmissibility determinations under the Rule.  Mot. \nApp. 44.  The guidance also reiterates that the Rule, by its own \nterms, does not consider the receipt of emergency medical services \nunder Medicaid; “CHIP, or State, local, or tribal public health \ncare services/assistance that are not funded by federal Medicaid”; \nor  various  other  non-federal  benefits  in  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  Ibid.  And it makes clear that in \nall events, “USCIS considers the receipt of public benefits as \nonly one consideration among a number of factors and considerations \nin the totality of the alien’s circumstances over a period of time \nwith no single factor being outcome determinative.”  Ibid.   \nMovants seek to undermine that guidance, claiming that an \nalien “who obtains or maintains Medicaid coverage that helps him \naccess  COVID-19  testing  or  treatment  will  still  receive  an \nautomatic negative factor in the public-charge analysis based on \nhis Medicaid coverage, even if his COVID-19 test or treatment will \nnot itself be considered.”  Mot. 13; see Mot. 24-25.  But movants \n\n13 \nare incorrect:  under USCIS’s guidance (as DHS has reaffirmed to \nthis Office), if an alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive COVID-\n19-related care, that enrollment will not be a negative factor in \na  public-charge  inadmissibility  determination,  so  long  as  the \nalien disenrolls from Medicaid once he or she no longer needs \nCOVID-19-related  care,  or  provides  evidence  of  a  request  to \ndisenroll.  That is why USCIS explicitly advised the public that \nCOVID-19-related  “treatment  or  preventive  services  will  not \nnegatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge \nanalysis.”  Mot. App. 44 (emphasis added). \nMovants also assert that “an applicant who applies for SNAP \nbenefits because a COVID-19 public-health order forced him out of \nhis job will continue to receive a negative factor in a public-\ncharge inquiry.”  Mot. 13;  see  Mot. 23-24.   But as  the  USCIS \nguidance explains, if an alien “must rely on public benefits for \nthe duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and recovery phase” as a \nresult of extrinsic factors -- such as enforced social distancing \nor  an  employer’s  shutting  down  --  “the  alien  can  provide  an \nexplanation and relevant supporting documentation” and “[t]o the \nextent [those materials are] relevant and credible, USCIS will \ntake all such evidence into consideration” when making public-\ncharge inadmissibility determinations.  Mot. App. 44.   \nEven if USCIS had not undertaken those discretionary steps, \nthe Rule’s effects on current benefits usage during the COVID-19 \n\n14 \ncrisis still would have been modest.  That is because most aliens \nto whom the Rule could potentially apply are not presently eligible \nfor federal means-tested benefits like Medicaid.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1613(a), 1641(b), and 1642(a).  The Rule cannot possibly prevent \nor  deter  aliens  from  using  benefits  for  which  they  are  not \neligible.  Conversely, many aliens who are eligible for means-\ntested federal benefits (such as refugees and asylees) are not \nsubject to the Rule in the first place.  See Mot. App. 46.  And \nwhile certain lawfully present aliens who are pregnant or under \nage  21  may  be  both  subject  to  the  public-charge  ground  of \ninadmissibility and also eligible for Medicaid, the Rule itself \nexempts  their  receipt  of  Medicaid  benefits  from  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297.   \nMovants assert (Mot. 14) that notwithstanding USCIS’s COVID-\n19-related guidance and the limited relevance of the Rule to aliens \nwho are actually eligible for benefits, “the Rule is deterring \nmany immigrants and their family members, including those who are \nU.S. citizens, from seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19.”  \nBut their accompanying declarations make clear that this asserted \neffect  is  not  the  result  of  the  Rule  itself,  but  rather  of \n“mistaken  belief[s]”  about  the Rule’s  application  and  content.  \nMot. App. 171 (emphasis added).*  In fact, nearly every example \n                     \n*  See also, e.g., Mot. App. 60 (“[U]ninsured people may be \nable to receive medical care free through safety net facilities, \nsuch as community health centers or government clinics; evidence \n\n15 \nmovants cite (Mot. 19-20) involves aliens who wrongly believe that \nobtaining  COVID-19-related  care  will  affect  a  public-charge \ninadmissibility determination in the future, contrary to the USCIS \nguidance.  Plaintiffs identify no case holding that the “balance \nof  the  equities”  favors  suspending  a  lawful  Rule  because  some \nsubset of people misunderstands its legal effects.   \nThat is not to say that movants are without recourse.  If, as \nthey  say,  members  of  their  communities  are  avoiding  COVID-19-\nrelated care and treatment because of mistaken beliefs about the \nRule,  then  movants  should  address  that  problem  by  helping  to \ncorrect those misunderstandings -- not by filing motions that, if \nanything, only reinforce them.   \n                     \nsuggests that the chilling effect leads to reductions in use of \nservices like these, even though the public charge determinations \ndo not apply to such programs.”); ibid. (“[A]lthough the public \ncharge rule does not apply to benefits from the Women, Infants and \nChildren (WIC) nutrition assistance program, many immigrants have \navoided enrolling in WIC because of public charge fears.”); id. at \n140  (“Many  New  Yorkers  mistakenly  believe  they  are  receiving \nMedicaid  as  defined  in  the  public  charge  rule,  due  to \nmisunderstanding  the  program  in  general.    *  *  *    [W]e  have \nencountered  many  noncitizens  who  are  afraid  to  get  COVID-19 \ntesting”  because  “people  are  afraid  that  testing  requires \nMedicaid, which would get them deported.”); id. at 220 (“[S]ome \nfamilies  that  organizers  speak  with  have  withdrawn  their  U.S. \ncitizen children from healthcare coverage out of a mistaken fear \nthat  their  children’s  coverage  will  trigger  immigration \nconsequences related to public charge.”); id. at 221 (“[C]lasses \nof immigrants to whom the public charge rule does not apply, such \nas Lawful Permanent Residents, have also disenrolled from services \nout  of  the  mistaken  fear  that  they  could  face  immigration \nconsequences for receiving benefits.”).   \n\n16 \n4.  In all events, movants are not entitled to reinstatement \nof the nationwide injunctions.  As the government has explained \n(Stay Appl. 32-39; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 10-12), the nationwide \naspect of the preliminary injunctions here is an independent issue \nwarranting  this  Court’s  attention.    This  Court  stayed  the \ninjunctions in their entirety, making it unnecessary to address \nthe issue at that time.  See 140 S. Ct. at 599-601 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring).  But if the Court were inclined to grant this motion \nnow, it would have to confront that issue, which was squarely \nraised and presented.  If the district court lacked authority under \nArticle  III  and  traditional  principles  of  equity  to  enter \ninjunctions that applied outside movants’ jurisdictions, see Stay \nAppl. 32-39; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 10-12, there would be no basis \nto lift or modify the Court’s January 27 stay, even on a temporary \nbasis,  to  the  extent  the  stay  precludes  the  injunctions  from \noperating in that universal fashion.   \n5.  Finally,  the  Court  also  should  reject  movants’ \nalternative request (Mot. 16) that the Court “clarify” that its \nJanuary 27 stay order “does not preclude the district court from \nconsidering  whether  the  current  COVID-19  crisis  warrants \ntemporary,  tailored  relief  from  the  Public  Charge  Rule.”    As \nmovants recognize (ibid.), the district court probably lacks the \nauthority to modify the nationwide injunctions it issued, now that \nthe Court has stayed those injunctions.  See Heckler v. Turner, \n\n17 \n468 U.S. 1305, 1308-1309 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).  Even \nif it has that authority, movants do not explain why the district \njudge should in effect be permitted to second-guess and modify a \nstay issued by this Court.  Judicial economy alone counsels against \nthat course, for the losing party would, as movants recognize (Mot. \n16), inevitably seek “appellate review” of any adverse decision.   \nTo the extent movants seek to obtain a new injunction, the \ndistrict court probably lacks authority to issue one.  Such a “new” \ninjunction would for all intents and purposes be identical to the \ninjunctions that the Court already has stayed -- but simply issued \nbased on the district judge’s “new” evaluation of the applicable \nequitable factors.  If the district court lacks the authority to \nmodify the existing injunctions, it also must lack the authority \nto  end  run  that  rule  by  issuing  a  materially  identical  “new” \ninjunction.  And even setting aside the question of the court’s \nauthority, movants would be precluded by ordinary law-of-the-case \nprinciples from re-litigating in district court the issues that \nthis Court necessarily decided in granting the January 27 stay, \nincluding that the government has a fair prospect of success on \nthe merits of its defense of the Rule’s lawfulness, and that the \ngovernment -- and thus the public -- would suffer irreparable harm \nwere the Rule enjoined.  Movants thus could not demonstrate the \nlikelihood of success and irreparable harm required to secure new \n\n18 \ninjunctive relief against the Rule’s enforcement.  See Winter v. \nNRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   \n*   *  *   *   * \nMovants identify no prior case in which the Court has granted \nthe kind of relief they request here -- and this case should not \nbe the first.  The Executive Branch has taken aggressive actions \nto address the current public-health crisis.  Those actions include \nissuing guidance about the Rule that clearly assures the public \nthat USCIS will exclude from consideration the receipt of public \nbenefits  for  COVID-19-related  care  when  making  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  In light of that guidance, the \nExecutive Branch has determined that a wholesale suspension of the \nRule is unwarranted.  Nothing in the motion or in the accompanying \nnew declarations provides any basis for this Court to second-guess \nthat policy judgment.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe motion should be denied.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n  NOEL J.

The virus has already killed over 53,000 people \nin the United States, including almost 20,000 in the three Plaintiff states alone. The rapid and \nongoing spread of COVID-19 is causing a nationwide public-health crisis and wreaking havoc \non the economy. The President has declared a state of national emergency. And state and local \nauthorities—including Governmental Plaintiffs here, the States of New York, Connecticut, and \nVermont, and the City of New York—have also declared states of emergency and are \nundertaking extraordinary efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and \nwell-being of our residents.  \nExtensive recent evidence presented with this motion—evidence developed during and \npertaining to the period following this Court’s October 2019 preliminary injunctions and the \nSupreme Court’s January 2020 stay order—shows that the Public Charge Rule (the “Rule”) is \ngravely hindering those efforts. By deterring immigrants from accessing publicly funded \nhealthcare, including programs that would enable immigrants to obtain testing and treatment for \nCOVID-19, the Rule makes it more likely that immigrants will suffer serious illness if infected. \nIn turn, those infected are likely to spread the virus inadvertently to others—a risk that is \nheightened because the essential workers who interact daily with the public are \ndisproportionately immigrants. The Rule also deters access to public benefits, including nutrition \nbenefits, that are critical for both immigrants and the country as a whole to weather the economic \ncrisis triggered by COVID-19. The Rule thereby impedes efforts to protect the public at large \nfrom further spread of the virus and to promote our nation’s recovery from the economic crisis \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 6 of 32\nthat the virus has caused.   \nIn light of the dire risks the Rule poses to the public, on April 13, 2020, the \nGovernmental Plaintiffs filed a motion in the Supreme Court to temporarily lift or modify the \nSupreme Court’s stay on this Court’s injunction for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. In \nthe alternative, the Governmental Plaintiffs requested that the Supreme Court clarify that the stay \npending appeal did not preclude Plaintiffs from seeking emergency relief from this Court on the \nsame grounds. On April 24, 2020, the Supreme Court denied the Governmental Plaintiffs’ \nrequest to modify or lift the stay, but ruled that “[t]his order does not preclude a filing in the \nDistrict Court as counsel considers appropriate.”1  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court make factual findings \nrecognizing the harmful effects of the Rule during this time of crisis, and issue a new injunction \nor a Section 705 stay temporarily halting implementation of the Rule during the national \nCOVID-19 emergency declared by the President. Plaintiffs also request that the Court issue an \nindicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, indicating that \nthe court would issue the preliminary injunction if the Second Circuit were to remand the case \nfor that purpose. In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a temporary \nrestraining order until Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction or stay can be adjudicated.   \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nIn August 2019, DHS issued its Public Charge Rule, which modified its criteria for \ndetermining inadmissibility on public charge grounds. 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019). \nUnder the Rule, DHS officials must now deem an immigrant to be a “public charge” if the \nimmigrant is likely to receive any amount of certain “public benefits,” including supplemental \n                                                            \n1 Exhibit 2 to Declaration of Elena Goldstein dated April 28, 2020 (hereinafter “Ex. __”) (Supreme Court April 24, \n2020 Order)  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 7 of 32\nbenefits such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and \nSection 8 housing assistance during “more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \nperiod” during the immigrant’s life. Id. at 41,501.  \nOn October 11, 2019, the Court issued two orders that preliminarily enjoined the \nenforcement of the Rule on a nationwide basis, and postponed the Rule’s effective date pursuant \nto 5 U.S.C. § 705. On December 2, 2019, the Court denied Defendants’ request to stay the \ninjunction pending appeal. See Dkt. No. 122. On January 7, 2020, the Second Circuit also denied \nDefendants’ stay request. See Dkt. No.132. On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court issued a \nstay of this Court’s orders of preliminary relief, thereby allowing the Rule to take effect.2 On \nFebruary 21, 2020, the Supreme Court issued a stay of a preliminary injunction issued by the \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that had prevented enforcement \nof the Rule in Illinois alone. Wolf v. Cook Cty., Ill., 140 S. Ct. 681, 681 (2019) (Justices \nGinsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissenting). In reliance on the Supreme Court’s stay \norders, Defendants began enforcing the Rule nationwide on February 24, 2020.  \nOn April 24, 2020, in response to the Governmental Plaintiffs’ motion, the Supreme \nCourt denied the Governmental Plaintiffs’ request to modify or lift the stay but ruled that “[t]his \norder does not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel considers appropriate.”3 Pursuant \nto the Supreme Court’s order, Plaintiffs now seek new preliminary relief to halt implementation \nof the Rule during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nCHANGES IN FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE THE COURT’S PRIOR ORDERS  \nSince October 11, 2019, when this Court entered preliminary injunctions in these matters, \nand January 27, 2020, when those injunctions were stayed by the Supreme Court, the nationwide \n                                                            \n2 Ex. 1 (Supreme Court January 27, 2020 Order) (Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissenting). \n3 Ex. 2 (Supreme Court April 24, 2020 Order).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 8 of 32\nCOVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the public harm caused by the Rule, and thus \nsubstantially altered the balance of hardships from allowing it to take effect. We summarize here \nthe extensive recent evidence submitted with this motion demonstrating how the Rule is severely \nimpeding efforts to mitigate the dire health and economic harms done by the pandemic. \nA.  The Nationwide COVID-19 Pandemic  \nAfter the Supreme Court issued its stays, COVID-19 began sweeping across the United \nStates. COVID-19 has already exacted a tremendous toll on the nation, and the pace of its spread \ncontinues to increase rapidly. In the United States, 957,875 individuals have confirmed cases of \nCOVID-19, and at least 53,000 people have died from the disease.4  \nPlaintiffs and Governmental Plaintiffs’ residents have been particularly hard hit. In New \nYork, which has become the current epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, 291,996 \npeople have confirmed cases of COVID-19, and at least 17,300 people have died from the \ndisease.5 In New York City alone, there are currently more than 156,000 confirmed positive \ncases and more than 11,000 confirmed deaths.6 The New York communities where Plaintiff \nMake the Road New York has community centers in Queens, Brooklyn, Westchester, and Long \nIsland have been particularly devastated by the pandemic.7 And other jurisdictions across the \ncountry have likewise seen rising numbers of infections and fatalities.8 These figures likely \nvastly underrepresent the number of actual infections and related deaths for many reasons, \n                                                            \n4 Center for Disease Control & Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases in U.S., \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html (last updated Apr. 28, 2020). \n5 See New York Dep’t of Health, NYSDOH COVID-19 Tracker, https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-\nbreakdown-positive-cases (last updated Apr. 28, 2020); New York Dep’t Health, Fatalities by County, \nhttps://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/ NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-\nFatalities?%3Aembed=yes&%3Atoolbar=no&%3Atabs=n (last updated Apr. 28, 2020).   \n6 See New York City Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, COVID-19: Data: Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths, \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page (last updated Apr. 28, 2020). \n7 Ex. 24 (Oshiro Decl.) ¶ 6. \n8 See, e.g., Corona Virus: Michigan Data, https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---\n,00.html (last updated Apr. 28, 2020) (38,210 confirmed infections and 3,407 confirmed deaths in Michigan). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 9 of 32\nincluding that many people who likely have the virus have not been tested for it.9 \nOn March 13, 2020, the President declared a state of national emergency concerning the \nCOVID-19 outbreak, invoking his authority under the National Emergencies Act. Proclamation \nNo. 9994, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 13, 2020); see generally 50 U.S.C. § 1601, et seq. The \nPresident declared that “[t]he spread of COVID-19 within our Nation’s communities threatens to \nstrain our Nation’s healthcare systems.” 85 Fed. Reg. at 15,337. He also declared that because \nadditional measures “are needed to successfully contain and combat the virus in the United \nStates,” he was authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services and the Social \nSecurity Administration to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements of various public-\nhealth and medical-insurance related statutes “throughout the duration of the public health \nemergency declared in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.” Id. The governors of each of the \nGovernmental Plaintiff States, as well as the mayor of Plaintiff New York City, have each \ndeclared public-health emergencies in their respective jurisdictions based on the COVID-19 \npandemic.10 In each of the Governmental Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, state officials and agencies \nhave also been taking increasingly drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and provide \ntesting and treatment for residents who are already infected. For example, state officials have \nrequired all nonessential employees to work from home, closed schools, and issued orders to \nincrease hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients.11 \n                                                            \n9 See Jacqueline Howard, US coronavirus death count likely an underestimate.

The Importance of Public Benefits in Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis \nExperts in infectious disease control and public health have warned that everyone should \nbe minimizing the spread of the virus to the greatest extent possible.12 Testing and medical \ntreatment for COVID-19 are critically important to slowing infection rates, preserving hospital \ncapacity and medical equipment, and saving lives.13 If individuals are deterred from testing and \nthus do not know they are infected, they are more likely to inadvertently spread the virus to \nothers—who will then spread the virus to still more people.14 And if individuals suffering from \nCOVID-19 delay obtaining medical care, they are more likely to spread the virus, experience \nserious illness and need intensive care in a hospital, and potentially die from the disease.15  \nIndividuals who lack health insurance are much less likely to obtain necessary treatment \nfor COVID-19 because of the prohibitive costs of medical care and hospital stays.16 A recent \nreport from a nonprofit organization that analyzes healthcare costs estimated that a six-day \nhospital stay for COVID-19 treatment will cost approximately $73,300.17 This burden will fall \n                                                            \nto increase hospital capacity); Connecticut Exec.

For example, executive \norders in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont that direct residents to work from home do not \napply to workers in essential sectors such as healthcare, grocery stores, food and retail delivery, \nbuilding maintenance, farms and agriculture, and sanitation.19 Because immigrants are a \nsignificant proportion of the workers in these front-line industries, they must interact with others \nor spend time in high-risk environments—such as caring for the aging in nursing homes, \ncleaning public spaces, and preparing or delivering food and supplies to other residents who \nmust stay at home.20 These workers are thus more likely to be exposed to the virus. Without \nadequate testing and treatment, these workers, if infected, are more likely to suffer worse health \noutcomes and to spread the virus to others inadvertently.21  \n  In addition to the public-health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a severe \neconomic crisis, with millions of workers losing significant income or employment, and needing \nto turn to supplemental benefit programs like Medicaid and SNAP.22 An unprecedented 26 \nmillion individuals applied for the first time for unemployment benefits in the five-week period \n                                                            \n18 Kaiser Family Foundation, Health Coverage of Immigrants (March 18, 2020), available at: \nhttps://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-sheet/health-coverage-of-immigrants/. \n19 See New York Exec.

In New York, for example, the number \nof new unemployment claims last week was 394,701, over 380,000 more than the same week \none year ago.24 Immigrant workers, particularly in the hospitality and service industries, have \nbeen disproportionately impacted by layoffs and furloughs.25  \nWorkers who lose their jobs because of the pandemic are likely temporarily to need \nsupplemental benefit programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, until they can get back on their \nfeet.26 For example, many workers who lose their jobs and employer-sponsored health insurance \nbecause of the pandemic are likely to need Medicaid coverage until they can find another job.27 \nAnd programs like SNAP are particularly important to immigrants and their family members, \nmany of whom are ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits or certain COVID-19 related \nbenefits recently enacted by Congress.28  \nC.  The Harms Imposed by the Rule and the COVID-19-Related Guidance Issued \nby the Department of Homeland Security \n \nAs DHS has acknowledged, e.g., 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,270 (Oct. 10, 2018), and the \nrecord evidence here confirms, the Rule’s expansion of the grounds for deeming immigrants \ninadmissible as public charges has already deterred many immigrants from using supplemental \npublic benefits, including Medicaid and SNAP benefits, or led them to disenroll from programs \n                                                            \n23 Patricia Cohen, ‘Jobless Numbers Are ‘Eye-Watering’ but Understate the Crisis, N.Y.

Since the Rule came into effect following the Supreme Court’s stay \norders, increasing numbers of immigrants have begun forbearing from Medicaid coverage and \nother publicly funded healthcare benefits based on concerns that using such benefits will render \nthem a “public charge” and thus jeopardize their ability to obtain legal permanent resident (LPR) \nstatus and, eventually, citizenship.29 Across the country, immigrants have been deterred from \nseeking COVID-19 testing and treatment and the health benefits that cover these critical services. \nFor example: \n  A physician in Connecticut has spoken with patients who had symptoms \nconsistent with COVID-19, but were afraid to obtain COVID-19 testing or \nseek treatment due to concerns about the Rule and fears that they could \nnot afford to pay for treatment.30  \n  As the pandemic took hold of New York City in March, Plaintiff Make the \nRoad New York has seen members and clients reluctant to access health \nand nutrition assistance such as SNAP and food pantries for fear that \npublic charge will result in them or their family members being penalized \nfor using such assistance or benefits.31 \n  Telephone hotlines operated by Plaintiff Catholic Charities Community \nServices, Archdiocese of New York, in partnership with state or city \nagencies, have been receiving public-charge-related inquiries from callers \nwho are fearful of seeking medical treatment for COVID-19.32  \n  The New York Legal Assistance Group has observed immigrants and their \nfamily members declining or delaying medical treatment they needed \nbecause of COVID-19, due to concerns about the Rule.33 \n  Staff at Bronx Legal Services in New York have spoken with noncitizen \nclients who are afraid to obtain COVID-19 testing or treatment because \nthey fear that doing so will require them to obtain Medicaid coverage.34  \n  Multiple other community organizations in New York City have reported \nthat immigrant clients are afraid to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-\n19, even if they are feeling ill, based on concerns that doing so will \n                                                            \n29 Ex. 19 (Newstrom Decl.) ¶¶ 19-25; Ex. 14 (Kennedy Decl.) ¶¶ 5-9. \n30 Ex. 8 (Almasude Decl.) ¶¶ 4-8. \n31 Ex. 24 (Oshiro Decl.) ¶ 7. \n32 Ex. 25 (Russell Decl.) ¶ 6. \n33 Ex. 23 (Nolan Decl.) ¶¶ 9-10.  \n34 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 19. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 14 of 32\njeopardize their immigration status.35  \n  Physicians in Monterey County, California, are working with an \nincreasing number of immigrant patients who have symptoms of COVID-\n19, but are refusing to seek medical care for these symptoms based on \nconcerns about the Rule and the costs of treatment.36  \n  Nonprofit organizations in Chicago, Illinois, have received calls from \nimmigrants who are afraid to seek virus-related testing and treatment \nbecause of the Rule. Many of these immigrants are seniors or individuals \nwith underlying health conditions, who are at greater risk of suffering \nsevere illness or death from COVID-19.37  \n  In February and March 2020, even as the COVID-19 crisis became \nincreasingly severe, health clinics in Virginia have continued to see an \nincreasing number of immigrant families declining to seek Medicaid \ncoverage (or withdrawing from existing coverage) because of the Rule.38 \n  In the past two months, a health educator in California has worked with \nmultiple clients who have forgone publicly funded health insurance for \nthemselves or their citizen children based on fears about the Rule.39  \n \nThe Rule’s deterrent effects have not been limited to the LPR applicants or public-benefit \nprograms that are directly subject to the Rule. Rather, substantial fear and confusion, along with \nthe complicated nature of benefits programs, have led immigrants and their families to avoid \nstate-funded health insurance programs, reduce their use of medical services, and forbear from \nusing other public benefits not covered by the Rule.40 Immigrants have also increasingly been \ndeclining to use SNAP benefits, which are included in the public charge analysis, as well as other \nnutrition programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren (WIC), that are not implicated in the public-charge analysis.41   \n                                                            \n35 Ex. 18 (Mostofi Decl.) ¶¶ 13, 15. \n36 Ex. 17 (Moreno Decl.) ¶¶ 4-5; Ex. 22 (Voit Decl.) ¶¶ 27-30. \n37 Ex. 10 (Benito Decl.) ¶ 13. \n38 Ex. 21 (Pryor Decl.) ¶¶ 11-17. \n39 Ex. 27 (Aguilar Decl.) ¶¶ 9-13.  \n40 Ex. 23 (Nolan Decl.) ¶¶ 9-14; Ex. 19 (Newstrom Decl.) ¶¶ 20-22, 25; Ex. 14 (Kennedy Decl.) ¶¶ 5-9; Ex. 24 \n(Oshiro Decl.) ¶10; Ex. 26 (Yoo Decl.) ¶¶ 4-5. \n41 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 16; Ex. 13 (Heinrich Decl.) ¶¶ 4-5; Ex. 19 (Newstrom Decl.) ¶¶ 20-22, 25-26.

As a result, on March 6, the Attorneys General of the Governmental Plaintiff \nStates, fifteen other state Attorneys General, and over fifty other elected officials sent a letter to \nDHS requesting that the agency temporarily halt implementation of the Rule given the harms to \npublic health from its implementation during the COVID-19 crisis.42 DHS did not respond.  \nOn March 13, DHS posted an “alert” on the website of the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”). The alert, issued only in English, stated that DHS officials \nconducting public-charge determinations would not “consider testing, treatment, nor preventative \ncare (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public \ncharge inadmissibility determination . . . even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or \nmore public benefits” targeted by the Rule, such as federally funded Medicaid.43 However, the \nalert also stated that the Rule will still require DHS officials to treat as a negative factor an \napplicant’s receipt of public benefits, including federally funded Medicaid, even when such \nbenefits “may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19.”44 Thus, under the alert, an \nLPR applicant who obtains or maintains Medicaid coverage that helps him access COVID-19 \ntesting or treatment will still receive an automatic negative factor in the public-charge analysis \nbased on his Medicaid coverage, even if his COVID-19 test or treatment will not itself be \nconsidered. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422 (DHS will consider “any application, approval, or \ncertification for, or receipt of, public benefits as a negative factor”).45  \n                                                            \nafter the Rule took effect in February 2020. Ex. 18 (Mostofi Decl.) ¶ 8; Ex 27 (Aguilar Decl.) ¶ 5 (health educator \nreceived “more questions about public charge” during February and March than she had ever previously received). \n42 Ex. 5 (Ltr. from State Attorneys General to Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security \net al., dated Mar. 6, 2020); see also Ex. 6, (Barbot Ltr.). \n43 Ex. 4 (Printout of USCIS Public Charge Alert, dated Mar. 13, 2020). \n44 Id.  \n45 In its brief opposing Plaintiffs’ request to the Supreme Court to temporarily modify its stay, Defendants claimed \nfor the first time that obtaining Medicaid coverage specifically for COVID-19 testing or treatment will not count \nunder the public-charge inquiry—despite the alert’s language to the contrary. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 16 of 32\nDHS’s alert appears to leave in place other aspects of the Rule during the COVID-19 \ncrisis, even though these aspects of the Rule deter immigrants from using supplemental benefits \nthat will help Plaintiffs’ residents and the country recover from the current economic crisis. \nThus, an applicant who applies for SNAP benefits because a COVID-19 public-health order \nforced him out of his job will continue to receive a negative factor in the public-charge inquiry. \nSee 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422. At most, the alert states that an applicant may inform DHS if \n“disease prevention methods” prevent him from working or attending school, and DHS officials \nwill consider such information to the extent it is “relevant and credible.”46   \nARGUMENT \nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its ramifications on public health and the economy present \nsudden and stark new circumstances not previously considered by the Court. The exigencies of \nthis pandemic warrant entry of a new injunction temporarily halting implementation of the Rule \nduring the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the President, or a time-\nlimited stay of the Rule pursuant to Section 705 of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \nIn the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court issue a temporary restraining order \nuntil Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction and stay can be adjudicated. See Fed. R. Civ. P 65.   \n“The standard for granting a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction \npursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Procedure are identical.” Andino v. Fischer, 555 F. \nSupp. 2d 418, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Spencer Trask Software & Info. Servs., LLC v. \nRPost Int’l, Ltd., 190 F. Supp. 2d 577, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2002)). The standard for a stay under § 705 \n                                                            \n46 Ex. 4 (Printout of USCIS Public Charge Alert, dated Mar. 13, 2020). After DHS posted the alert, the Attorneys \nGeneral of the Plaintiff States and fifteen other state Attorneys General sent DHS another letter explaining that the \nalert did not address the harms imposed by the Rule during the pandemic. Ex. 7 (Ltr. From State Attorneys General \nto Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., dated Mar. 19, 2020). DHS did not \nrespond to this letter. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 17 of 32\nis the same as the standard for a preliminary injunction. See Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 \n(5th Cir. 2016). All require a showing of “a likelihood of success on the merits, a likelihood of \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in the \nparty’s favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” Coronel v. Decker, No. 20 Civ. \n2472 (AJN), 2020 WL 1487274, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020) (citing Am. Civil Liberties \nUnion v. Clapper, 804 F.3d 617, 622 (2d Cir. 2015)). The irreparable harm factor is “the single \nmost important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.” Reuters Ltd. v. United \nPress Int’l, Inc., 903 F.2d 904, 907 (2d Cir. 1990). Given the catastrophic harms that the Rule \ncauses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiffs have shown that injunctive relief is necessary.  \nA.  The Court has authority to issue new temporary relief to address the drastic \nchanged circumstances engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court has authority to issue new injunctive relief to address \nthe new public health and economic harms that the Rule is causing during the COVID-19 crisis. \nWhile the preliminary injunction that the Court issued on October 11, 2019 is pending before the \nCircuit, the Court retains authority to issue a new injunction based on changed circumstances. An \ninterlocutory appeal of a preliminary injunction “only divests the district court of jurisdiction \nrespecting the questions raised and decided in the order that is on appeal.” New York State Nat. \nOrg. for Women v. Terry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1350 (2d Cir. 1989) (citing Griggs v. Provident \nConsumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)); see also, e.g., Gortat v. Capala Bros., No. 07-CV-\n3629(ILG), 2008 WL 5273960, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2008) (“[A] district court retains \njurisdiction over those matters not involved in the appeal.”).   \nAccordingly, where, as here, the Circuit is considering an interlocutory appeal from an \norder granting a preliminary injunction, the matter otherwise “proceeds” in the district court. \nTerry, 886 F.2d at 1350; see also Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. E. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 18 of 32\nAir Lines, Inc., 847 F.2d 1014, 1018 (2d Cir. 1988) (affirming issuance of new injunction in \ndistrict court based on new development while district court’s previous grant of preliminary \ninjunction was pending appeal); Webb v. GAF Corp., 78 F.3d 53, 56 (2d Cir. 1996) (district court \nretains jurisdiction to rule on issues—including requests for injunctive relief—that are not \npresent in the interlocutory appeal); Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal \nPractice and Procedure (“Wright & Miller”) § 3949.1 (3d ed. Aug. 2019 update) (interlocutory \nappeal “does not oust district-court jurisdiction to continue with proceedings that do not threaten \neither the appeal’s orderly disposition or its raison d’etre”). During this unprecedented and \nrapidly escalating COVID-19-related crisis, this Court is the best-placed to consider and make \nfindings on new factual issues that are not part of the appellate record. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ motion does “not threaten [] the appeal’s orderly disposition,” \nWright & Miller § 3949, but instead seeks new relief based upon new facts and circumstances \nthat were not—and could not have been—before the Court when it issued its prior order. The \nrelief that Plaintiffs seek does not undermine or interfere with the pending appeal; to the \ncontrary, the Court’s issuance of a new, narrowly tailored injunction to address the COVID-19 \npandemic would not alter the questions presented to the Second Circuit or change the scope of its \nreview.47 Plaintiffs do not seek a second bite at the apple to obtain a more favorable result on an \nissue up on appeal; to the contrary, Plaintiffs have already received a favorable ruling from this \n                                                            \n47 As Plaintiffs detail above, they seek new relief based upon new facts. However, the Court also has inherent \nauthority to modify its previous injunction and “‘may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.’” \nTrump v. International Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (citing Wright & Miller § 2947). \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d), “an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting an injunction \nduring the pendency of an appeal must ordinarily be made in the first instance in the district court.” A district court \nmay modify an existing injunction pending appeal if such modification would “neither chang[e] the status quo at the \ntime of the first appeal nor materially alte[r] the status of the appeal.” Mayweathers v. Newland, 258 F.3d 930 (9th \nCir. 2001); see Ideal Toy Corp. v. Sayco Doll Corp., 302 F.2d 623 (1962). Because the Rule was enjoined at the \ntime of appeal, issuance of a subsequent injunction would properly preserve that status quo without undermining the \nCircuit’s ability to review the prior preliminary injunction based on the previous record. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 19 of 32\nCourt on their prior request for injunctive relief and do not seek to disturb or alter that injunction.   \nIndeed, Plaintiffs’ request for relief is particularly appropriate in light of the unusual \nprocedural posture of this case. Absent the Supreme Court’s stay of this Court’s orders of \npreliminary relief, there would be no need for additional preliminary relief to address the \ndrastically changed circumstances caused by COVID-19. And after Plaintiffs requested that the \nSupreme Court lift or modify its stay, the Supreme Court allowed Plaintiffs to return to the \ndistrict court to address the new circumstances.48 The Supreme Court’s order thus further \nclarifies that this Court is the proper forum to address in the first instance the new and urgent \nharms caused by the Rule during this time of crisis. \nMoreover, in addition to the entry of a new preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs also \nrespectfully request that the Court enter an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, indicating that the court would issue the preliminary injunction and \nfactual findings supporting that injunction if the Second Circuit were to remand the case for that \npurpose. Rule 62.1 is designed to ameliorate potential concerns about the scope of the district \ncourt’s jurisdiction pending an appeal by authorizing the district court to indicate its decision on \nan issue if the Second Circuit were to determine that the district court lacked jurisdiction and \nremand the matter to the district court to issue its decision. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1(a)(3) (where \na district court has been divested of authority because of a pending appeal, authorizing the \ndistrict court to nonetheless “state either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals \nremands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue”); Flatiron Health, Inc. v. \nCarson, No. 19-CV-8999 (VM), 2020 WL 257505, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 17, 2020), order \nsuperseded on other grounds, 2020 WL 416423 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2020) (concluding that court \n                                                            \n48 See Ex. 2 (Supreme Court April 24, 2020 Order) (explaining that order “does not preclude a filing” in this Court).   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 20 of 32\nhad jurisdiction to modify an injunction, but stating that if the Circuit were to conclude that the \ndistrict court “lack[ed] authority to grant” the modification, the opinion “shall also serve as an \nindicative ruling under Rule 62.1”). Given the ongoing and irreparable harms alleged here, an \nalternative indicative ruling will ensure more timely relief in the event that the Second Circuit \ndetermines that it retains jurisdiction over this matter. See Wright & Miller § 3921.2. \nB.  The Court should issue a targeted and limited preliminary injunction for the \nduration of the national emergency. \n \nPlaintiffs have met the standard governing issuance of a preliminary injunction. The \npandemic has drastically altered the nature and magnitude of the irreparable harms faced by \nPlaintiffs, their residents, and the nation due to the Rule and tipped the balance of the equities \ndecisively in favor of granting injunctive relief while the COVID-19 emergency continues. And \nPlaintiffs have already demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \nthat the Rule is contrary to law and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA—issues \nthat the Second Circuit is currently considering and that Plaintiffs do not seek to relitigate here.  \n1.  The Rule causes irreparable harms not previously before the Court. \nThe Rule is irreparably harming public health in the Governmental Plaintiffs’ \njurisdictions and throughout the country during the public-health disaster caused by the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The Rule deters immigrants from seeking testing and treatment for the virus and \nfrom accessing other benefits like food assistance when they have suffered temporary job loss. \nWhile DHS recognizes these disastrous consequences, its efforts to alleviate the chilling effect \nhave been ineffectual and only affirm the message that use of Medicaid or SNAP during the \npandemic can give rise to a public charge finding.   \ni.  The Rule is impeding efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus.  \n  By penalizing immigrants and their families from obtaining publicly funded health \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 21 of 32\ninsurance and medical care, the Rule is undermining efforts to slow the spread of the virus—\nputting everyone at higher risk of infection. As DHS itself has acknowledged, the Rule’s \nexpanded criteria for inadmissibility will deter immigrants from enrolling (or maintaining \nenrollment for) themselves and their family members in Medicaid, due to the understandable fear \nthat simply applying will be deemed a negative factor in any future public-charge analysis. See \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422. Indeed, DHS admitted in its notice of proposed rulemaking that the Rule \n“could lead to . . . [i]ncreased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among members \nof the U.S. citizen population.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,270. \nEven in light of the pandemic, fear and confusion about the Rule are now driving many \nimmigrants to forgo any publicly funded health coverage for fear that using such supplemental \npublic benefits will jeopardize their ability to obtain LPR status and, eventually, citizenship.49 \nIndeed, since the Rule took effect, medical personnel, state and local officials, and staff at \nnonprofit organizations have encountered many immigrants refusing to enroll in Medicaid or \nother publicly funded healthcare coverage based on concerns that receiving such coverage will \nincrease the risk of being deemed a “public charge” under the Rule.50  \nSuch avoidance of Medicaid and other publicly funded healthcare programs will prevent \nimmigrants from receiving testing or treatment for COVID-19, materially impeding public-\nhealth officials’ efforts to stem the current crisis. Without Medicaid or other health insurance, the \ncosts of COVID-19 treatment are prohibitively high for most patients—particularly if they \ndevelop severe symptoms necessitating hospitalization. And since the pandemic began, doctors \nand other front-line workers have seen many immigrants avoid COVID-19 testing and treatment \n                                                            \n49 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶ 18; Ex. 27 (Aguilar Decl.) ¶¶ 7-13; Ex. 15 (Kritzman Decl.) ¶¶ 3-4; Ex. 14 (Kennedy Decl.) \n¶¶ 5-9. \n50 See, e.g., Ex. 21 (Pryor Decl.) ¶¶ 13-17; Ex. 14 (Kennedy Decl.) ¶¶ 5-7.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 22 of 32\naltogether, even if they might be able to obtain publicly funded care, due to the fear generated by \nthe Rule.51 These effects of the Rule on COVID-19 testing and treatment are not speculative.  \nImmigrants’ inability or unwillingness to obtain testing and treatment for COVID-19 due \nto concerns about the Rule jeopardizes the health and safety of not only immigrants and their \nfamilies but also the public. Without proper testing and treatment, immigrants and their family \nmembers who become infected are more likely to suffer severe illness or death from the virus.52 \nImmigrants who lack testing and treatment are also more likely to spread the virus to other \npeople inadvertently, contributing to the exponential growth of infection and fatalities.53  \nThis risk of virus spread is further increased by the high number of immigrants who work \nin essential industries and who thus must continue to work outside of their homes and interact \nwith others. See supra, at 9-10. Indeed, in New York City, the current epicenter of the COVID-\n19 crisis, noncitizens make up approximately 42.4% of home health aides, 42.3% of cooks, \n37.1% of food preparation workers, and 26.9% of janitors and building cleaners.54 By deterring \nthese essential workers from obtaining health insurance and medical care for COVID-19, the \nRule is increasing the risk of infection for the public.  \nThe Rule further impedes current attempts to stem the COVID-19 crisis by deterring \nimmigrants and their family members from obtaining treatment for preexisting conditions that \neither make individuals more vulnerable to the virus, or make their COVID-19 symptoms worse. \nImmigrants who decline Medicaid or other health insurance coverage because of the Rule often \n                                                            \n51 Ex. 8 (Almasude Decl.) ¶¶ 4-8; Ex. 18 (Mostofi Decl.) ¶¶ 13, 15; Ex. 17 (Moreno Decl. ¶ 4); Ex. 22 (Voit Decl.) \n¶¶ 27-28, 30; Ex. 21 (Pryor Decl.) ¶ 19; Ex. 14 (Kennedy Decl.) ¶ 13. \n52 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶ 11; Ex. 8 (Almasude Decl.) ¶ 9. \n53 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶¶ 11, 20, 22; Ex. 8 (Almasude Decl.) ¶ 9; Ex. 17 (Moreno Decl.) ¶¶ 4, 9; Ex. 14 (Kennedy \nDecl.) ¶ 15. \n54 Ex. 12 (Fong Decl.) ¶ 13. And in other areas of the country, large numbers of noncitizens continue to work in \nessential industries such as agriculture or food packing and distribution.

The Rule deters access to public benefits that are necessary to \nrespond to the severe economic crisis caused by COVID-19.  \nThe Rule is further injuring Plaintiffs and the public interest by undermining efforts to \nmitigate the vast economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rates \nin the Governmental Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions and across the country are already reaching \nunprecedented levels due to the virus outbreak. See supra, at 7-8. And the economic downturn is \nlikely to grow worse as the virus continues to spread.60 Supplemental benefits are crucial to \nhelping employable individuals through a sudden emergency like losing a job or incurring \nsubstantial medical bills for COVID-19 treatment.61 By providing short-term help to individuals \n                                                            \n55 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶¶ 21-23. \n56 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶ 26; Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶¶ 21-23. \n57 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 22; see also Ex. 23 (Nolan Decl.) ¶¶ 9-10 (staff at New York Legal Assistance Group \nhave seen clients declining or delaying medical treatment based on concerns about the Rule). \n58 See Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.)  ¶¶ 11, 26; Ex. 21 (Pryor Decl.) ¶ 12. \n59 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶ 22. \n60 Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶¶ 23-24. \n61 See Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶¶ 23-24; Ex. 18 (Mostofi Decl.) ¶ 16; Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 27; Ex. 10 (Benito Decl.) \n¶¶ 10-11. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 24 of 32\nuntil they can get back on their feet, supplemental benefits promote economic stability and \nrecovery for all of Plaintiffs’ residents, the clients they serve, and the nation.   \nMany hard-working immigrants, who are not “public charges” under any reasonable \ninterpretation of that term, have begun to face sudden financial strains as their employers cut jobs \ndue to the current economic crisis and government mandates ordering “nonessential” businesses \nto limit their services or have their employees work from home.62 But the Rule deters immigrants \nand their family members from using such benefits to maintain health and nutrition during the \ncrisis.63 These irreparable harms further warrant an injunction during the current national \nemergency. For example, since the Rule went into effect and since the pandemic began, \nimmigrants have increasingly been declining to participate in SNAP or other publicly funded \nnutrition programs due to fear that doing so will jeopardize their immigration status.64 Indeed, \nunder the Rule, using SNAP for just a few months during the current economic crisis places an \nLPR applicant at risk of being deemed a public charge. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422 (mere \napplication for SNAP is negative factor); id. at 41,506 (using SNAP and another public benefit \nduring a single month counts as two months of benefits use for calculating heavily weighted \nnegative factor of 12 out of 36 months of benefits use).    \nImmigrants’ avoidance of the public benefits covered by the Rule has already resulted in \nworse harms to both immigrants and Plaintiffs during this difficult economic period. For \nexample, immigrants who decline SNAP for fear of being deemed a “public charge” are turning \nto emergency food assistance programs, such as food pantries.65 But many food pantries have \n                                                            \n62 See Ex. 16 (Ku Decl.) ¶¶ 23-24; Ex. 18 (Mostofi Decl.) ¶16. \n63 See Ex. 8 (Almasude Decl.) ¶ 6; Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 11, Ex. 17 (Moreno Decl.) ¶ 6. \n64  Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶¶ 11; 26-27, Ex. 17 (Moreno Decl.) ¶ 6, Ex. 15 (Kritzman Decl.) ¶ 4. \n65 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶¶ 26-27; Ex. 10 (Benito Decl.) ¶ 12; see also Ex. 24 (Oshiro Decl.) ¶ 7 (nothing that some \ninstances immigrants are afraid to access food pantries due to public charge concerns). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 25 of 32\nclosed or reduced their hours due to COVID-19. And many of the emergency food programs that \nare still operating “are running out of food at alarming rates.”66 The Court should grant a \nnarrowly tailored injunction to avoid such irreparable public-health and economic harms.    \niii.  USCIS’s alert does not remedy these substantial harms. \nBy revising its application of the Rule during the current COVID-19 crisis, USCIS has \neffectively acknowledged the Rule’s deterrent effect on immigrants’ willingness to obtain \nnecessary medical care. On March 13, USCIS issued an alert that purports to limit this deterrent \neffect, but this alert does not fully address the grave harms that the Rule is causing during the \nongoing pandemic, and is thus no substitute for the relief requested here. \nFirst, although the alert excludes “testing, treatment, [and] preventative care . . . related to \nCOVID-19” from future public-charge determinations,67it continues to treat as an automatic \nnegative factor an LPR applicant’s application for or receipt of public benefits “that may be used \nto obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19,” including federally funded Medicaid.68 In other \nwords, an LPR applicant who applies for federally funded Medicaid will have that application \ncount against him in the public-charge inquiry, even if subsequently obtained COVID-19 \ntreatment paid for by federally funded Medicaid does not itself count in the public-charge \ninquiry. See supra, at 11-12. But deterring immigrants from accessing the benefits that they need \nto get healthcare prevents them from getting necessary testing and treatment for COVID-19. This \naspect of the alert thus preserves the very problem USCIS has purported to address.  \nSecond, the alert does not provide sufficiently clear direction to assure immigrants that \n                                                            \n66 Ex. 20 (Newton Decl.) ¶ 27; see Ex. 13 (Heinrich Decl.) ¶ 6 (food banks and pantries are facing increased food \ncosts and “new challenges for accepting donated food”); Ex. 10 (Benito Decl.) ¶ 12 (many food pantries in Chicago, \nIllinois have “either closed or are seeing a marked increase in requests for food assistance”). \n67 Ex. 4 (Printout of USCIS Public Charge Alert, dated Mar. 13, 2020).  \n68 Id.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 26 of 32\nthey will not be penalized in a future public-charge determination for accessing critical \nhealthcare now. Even setting aside that the alert was published only in English and only on a \nsingle federal website, the alert is replete with ambiguity. It is unclear how the alert would apply \nto an individual who receives medical treatment for COVID-19-like symptoms but is never \ntested, perhaps because of a shortage of testing kits. Furthermore, although the alert clarifies that \nthe Rule will not apply to state or local benefits, it is unclear how an immigrant is supposed to \ndiscern or control whether federal, state, or local benefits apply—especially if she may require \nemergency care. And under the alert, an LPR applicant will continue to be penalized for having \nMedicaid coverage to obtain treatment for medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart \ndisease, even though these conditions place patients at high risk of suffering more severe \nsymptoms or death if they contract COVID-19. And an LPR applicant who does not need \nCOVID-19 testing or treatment now will be penalized for seeking Medicaid as a precaution to \nprotect the applicant and his family in the event that they become infected with the virus.  \nDefendants have effectively conceded that that the USCIS alert does not adequately \naddress the Rule’s chilling effects. Defendants’ principal response to the objections Plaintiffs \nraised to the alert in their motion before the Supreme Court was to further modify the Rule’s \napplication by stating for the first time that “if an alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive COVID-\n19-related care, that enrollment will not be a negative factor in a public-charge inadmissibility \ndetermination.”69 Although Defendants purport to base this position on the text of the alert they \nissued, the alert actually appears to say the opposite; it admonishes that Defendants will continue \n“to consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, including those that may be \n                                                            \n69 Department of Homeland Security, et al. v. New York, et al., No. 19A785 (S. Ct. Apr. 20, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A785/142052/20200420132042768_IRLI%20Pub%20Charge%20\nStay%20Amicus%202d.pdf .  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 27 of 32\nused to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination.”70 Defendants’ attempt to engage in rulemaking through opposition brief not only \nhighlights the defects in the original alert, but will also likely cause more confusion about the \nRule’s applicability during these tumultuous times—thus further demonstrating the need for the \nCourt to issue a clear ruling that stays the Rule until the national emergency ends.  \nFurthermore, after DHS posted the alert on its website, the Rule has in fact continued to \ndeter immigrants from accessing needed medical care during the pandemic. In the weeks \nfollowing DHS’s alert, physicians and others working on the front lines of the current emergency \nhave continued to see many immigrants and their families expressing fear about and declining to \nobtain COVID-19 testing and treatment based on their persistent concerns about the Rule.71 \nFinally, the alert is limited to testing and treatment for COVID-19, but the Rule will also \ndeter immigrants from accessing public benefits that are especially critical for their well-being in \nlight of the dire public-health and economic crisis that COVID-19 has triggered. Placing \nimmigrants in a situation where they must choose between forgoing essential aid for healthcare, \nfood, or housing, or risking their future chances of obtaining LPR status is particularly \ninequitable during this unprecedented moment in our history, and will inhibit the country’s \nability to recover from the current economic crisis.  \n2.  Balance of equities and public interest favor issuance of an injunction.  \nGiven the Rule’s substantial harms to public health, the balance of the equities and the \npublic interest weigh heavily in favor of issuing an injunction.72 The purpose of interim equitable \n                                                            \n70 Id.  \n71 See, e.g., Ex. 22 (Voit Decl.) ¶¶ 27-28; Ex. 21 (Pryor Decl.) ¶¶ 18-19; Ex. 11 (Chavez Decl.) ¶ 9; Ex. 14 (Kennedy \nDecl.) ¶ 14; Ex. 24 (Oshiro Decl.) ¶¶ 7, 15. \n72 Where the government is a party, “the final two factors in the [preliminary injunction] analysis—the balance of \nthe equities and the public interest—merge.” Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *7.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 28 of 32\nrelief is “but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward,” bearing in mind “‘the \noverall public interest.’” Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) \n(quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 26 (2008)). As detailed above, \nPlaintiffs and the nation are struggling to contain the public health and economic threats posed \nby COVID-19, efforts that are materially hindered by the continued implementation of the Rule. \nThe public’s interest in mitigating disease spread and saving lives weighs strongly and \ninexorably in favor of new, targeted injunctive relief. In contrast, the harm to DHS of \ntemporarily halting implementation of the Rule, particularly while USCIS offices are closed and \ngreen card processing has been suspended, is “far outweighed by the public interest” in \nmitigating the spread of disease and other harms “in light of the rapidly-evolving public health \ncrisis engendered by the spread of COVID-19.” Coronel, 2020 WL 1487274, at *8.  \n3.  Plaintiffs have demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their \nclaims.  \n \nThe Court has twice ruled that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims \nthat the Rule exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority, is contrary to law, and is arbitrary and \ncapricious. New York v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 408 F. Supp. 3d at 334, 345-350 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2019); New York v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec, No. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD), \n2019 WL 6498250, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2019). These holdings are dispositive under the law \nof the case doctrine. See United States v. Carr, 557 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir. 2009). And because the \nSecond Circuit is currently reviewing this Court’s determination that Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on the merits, Plaintiffs do not seek to relitigate that issue here. Accordingly, and for the \nreasons stated in Plaintiffs’ initial motion for preliminary relief, Dkt. 35, opposition to \nDefendants’ motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction, Dkt. 117, and opposition to \nDefendants’ motion for a stay pending appeal, Dkt. 128, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 29 of 32\nmerits.      \nC.  Nationwide relief is warranted and essential.  \nDuring this crisis, the Court should enjoin Defendants from continuing to implement the \nRule without geographic restriction or, in the alternative, postpone the effective date of the Rule \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705. See Dkt. No. 35 at 39-40 (detailing applicable legal framework). \nNationwide relief during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential in light of the nationwide harms, \ninterconnected nature of the risks between and within states, and the realities attendant to the \nspread of this disease. As essential workers travel between states for work, and travelers come \ninto the Governmental Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions as other states lift their stay at home restrictions, it \nis vital that this Court ensure that the Public Charge Rule does not contribute to the spread of the \nepidemic. Far from a case where “the record is not sufficiently developed on the nationwide \nimpact of the [agency action],” City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1245 (9th \nCir. 2018), Plaintiffs have adduced evidence of irreparable harms across the nation. Nationwide \nrelief is not only warranted, but necessary.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court make factual \nfindings recognizing the harmful effects of the Rule during this time of crisis, issue a new \npreliminary injunction forbidding implementation of the Rule during the national emergency \ndeclared on March 13, 2020, or a stay of the effective date of the Rule pursuant to Section 705 of \nthe APA, and issue an indicative ruling pursuant to Rule 62.1 confirming that that the Court \nwould grant Plaintiffs’ motion. In the alternative, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court \nissue a temporary restraining order until the motion for preliminary injunction may be heard.   \nDATED:  April 28, 2020    Respectfully submitted, \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 30 of 32\n  LETITIA JAMES \n  Attorney General of the State of New York  \n   \n  By: /s/ Elena Goldstein \n  Elena Goldstein,  \n    Deputy Bureau Chief, Civil Rights Bureau \n  Matthew Colangelo \n   Chief Counsel for Federal Initiatives \nMing-Qi Chu, Section Chief, Labor Bureau \nAmanda Meyer, Assistant Attorney General \nAbigail Rosner, Assistant Attorney General \nOffice of the New York State Attorney \nGeneral \nNew York, New York 10005 \nPhone: (212) 416-6201 \nelena.goldstein@ag.ny.gov \n \nAttorneys for the State of New York \n \n   \nJAMES JOHNSON  WILLIAM TONG \nCorporation Counsel of the City of New York  Attorney General of Connecticut  \n     \nBy: /s/ Tonya Jenerette  By: /s/ Joshua Perry \nTonya Jenerette  Joshua Perry*  \n   Deputy Chief for Strategic Litigation     Special Counsel for Civil Rights \nCynthia Weaver, Senior Counsel  165 Capitol Avenue  \nDoris Bernhardt, Senior Counsel  Hartford, CT 06106-0120 \nMelanie Ash, Senior Counsel  (860) 808-5318 \n100 Church Street, 20th Floor  Joshua.perry@ct.gov \nNew York, NY 10007   \nPhone: (212) 356-4055  Attorneys for the State of Connecticut  \ntjeneret@law.nyc.gov   \n \nAttorneys for the City of New York  \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 169   Filed 04/28/20   Page 31 of 32\nTHOMAS J.

Reg. \n41292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“Rule”).  First, on January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court stayed, over \nPlaintiffs’ objections, this Court’s October 11, 2019 orders preliminarily enjoining the Rule.  See \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020).  Then, in April, Plaintiffs asked the \nSupreme Court to temporarily lift or modify its stay because of the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing, \nas they do in the instant motion, that “the Rule is now causing additional irreparable harms to the \npublic—citizens and noncitizens alike—that were not present when the Court initially considered \ndefendants’ motion for a stay.”  See Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, No. 19A785, Mot. by \nGov’t Pls. to Temporarily Lift or Modify the Ct.’s Stay of the Orders Issued by the U.S. Dist. Ct. \nfor S.D.N.Y. (“Mot. to Lift Stay”), at 2.1  The Supreme Court denied that motion.  Plaintiffs now \nturn to this Court to seek a new preliminary injunction.  But their motion – which merely replicates \ntheir most recent unsuccessful Supreme Court filing – fails to establish a basis for a different \noutcome in this Court. \nAccordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion.  First and foremost, as Plaintiffs \nthemselves recognized in their Supreme Court motion, there is “substantial doubt as to whether \nthe lower courts could provide any meaningful relief given the [Supreme] Court’s stay.”  Mot. to \nLift Stay, at 16.  Indeed, that was an understatement.  According to well-settled principles, this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction over issues that are currently under review by the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals.  Plaintiffs’ request here – which asks the Court to either issue a duplicative injunction or \n                                                 \n1 Available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A785/141515/2020041315301 \n4307_19A785%20Motion%20to%20Temporarily%20Lift%20or%20Modify%20Stay.pdf.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 7 of 30\nsimply “modify” the injunction that was already issued (and stayed) – clearly comes within that \nrule.   \nEven if this Court determines that it has the authority to issue a new injunction, it should \nfind that the prerequisites for such relief are not met here.  On the merits, the Supreme Court, in \nstaying the injunctions, has already necessarily decided that Defendants have a fair prospect of \nsuccess.  Plaintiffs also fail to show that any irreparable harm would result in the absence of a \npreliminary injunction where (1) Defendants have already issued guidance to address concerns \nthat individuals may not seek medical services for COVID-19 and (2) a preliminary injunction \nwould not likely remedy Plaintiffs’ alleged harms.  The balance of equities, too, weighs against \nentry of another injunction.  For these reasons, as discussed further below, the Court should reach \nthe same result as the Supreme Court did when it reviewed the same evidence that is now before \nthis Court, and deny Plaintiffs’ requested relief. \nBACKGROUND \nOn August 14, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) published the Rule \nin the Federal Register.  84 Fed. Reg. 41292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  This final rule is the culmination of \nan extensive, multi-year process to adopt regulations that prescribe how DHS will determine \nwhether an alien applying for admission or adjustment of status is inadmissible under section \n212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) because he or she is “likely at any time \nto become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4). \nThe Rule defines “public charge” – which the statute itself does not define – to mean “an \nalien who receives one or more [designated] public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the \naggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month \ncounts as two months).”  Rule at 41501.  The designated public benefits include federal, state, \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 8 of 30\nlocal, and tribal cash assistance for income maintenance (excluding tax credits) and certain \nfederally  funded  or  administered  non-cash  benefits,  including  most  Medicaid  benefits, \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and federal housing assistance.  Id.  They do \nnot, however, include emergency medical services under Medicaid.  Id. at 41363, 41482-83.  Nor \ndo they include non-cash benefits that are not federally funded or administered, such as state and \nlocal non-cash benefits.  Id. at 41312.  Receipt of those benefits therefore will not be considered \nin making a public-charge inadmissibility determination under the Rule.   \nOn October 11, 2019, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motions for a nationwide preliminary \ninjunction and stay under 5 U.S.C. 705 barring DHS from implementing the Rule.  See New York, \nECF Nos. 109, 110; Make the Road New York, ECF Nos. 146, 147.  On January 27, 2020, the \nSupreme Court stayed the nationwide injunctions in their entirety, “pending disposition of the \nGovernment’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and disposition \nof the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.”  New York, 140 \nS. Ct. at 599. \nFour other district courts also issued injunctions against the Rule.  The U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s motions for stays pending appeal in the \ncases pending in that circuit.  See City & County of San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773 (2019).  \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit also granted a stay pending appeal of the \nnationwide injunction entered by a district court in Maryland.  See Order, Casa de Maryland, Inc. \nv. Trump, No. 19-2222 (4th Cir. Dec. 9, 2019).  After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit denied the government’s renewed motion for a stay pending appeal of an injunction against \nthe Rule issued by a district court in Illinois, the Supreme Court stayed that injunction.  See Wolf \nv. Cook County, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 9 of 30\nOn March 13, 2020, the President issued a proclamation stating “that the COVID-19 \noutbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency.”  Proclamation No. 9994, 85 Fed. \nReg. 15,337 (Mar. 18, 2020).  That same day, Defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”) issued guidance explaining that it “encourages all those, including aliens, with \nsymptoms that resemble Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (fever, cough, shortness of \nbreath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services.  Such treatment or preventive \nservices will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge analysis.”  Pls’ Ex. \n4.  The guidance specifically states that “[t]o address the possibility that some aliens impacted by \nCOVID-19 may be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services, USCIS \nwill neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care (including vaccines, if a vaccine \nbecomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge inadmissibility determination, \nnor as related to the public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an \nextension of stay or change of status, even if such treatment is provided or paid for by one or more \npublic benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. federally funded Medicaid).”  Id.   \n  On April 13, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a motion in the Supreme Court to temporarily lift or \nmodify its stay of this Court’s injunctions.  See Mot. to Lift Stay.  Plaintiffs argued that “the Rule \nis now causing additional irreparable harms to the public” by “deterring immigrants from accessing \npublicly funded healthcare, including programs that would enable immigrants to obtain testing and \ntreatment for COVID-19” and by deterring access to public benefits “that are critical for both \nimmigrants and the country as a whole to weather the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19.”  \nId. at 2.  According to Plaintiffs, “[t]hese irreparable harms have tipped the balance of the equities \ndecidedly against maintaining the stay during the national emergency concerning COVID-19.”  Id.  \nAs evidentiary support, Plaintiffs offered nineteen declarations, all of which it has filed in support \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 10 of 30\nof its motion in this Court as well.  On April 24, 2020, the Supreme Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion \nand stated that the Court’s “order does not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel \nconsiders appropriate.”  See Pls’ Ex. 2.2 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \nPreliminary injunctions are “extraordinary and drastic remed[ies]” that are “never awarded \nas of right.” Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008). A party seeking to enjoin “government \naction taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme” in a way that would \n“alter, rather than maintain, the status quo . . . must demonstrate irreparable harm and a clear or \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits,” VIP of Berlin v. Town of Berlin, 593 F.3d 179, \n185-86 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), and must also show that the balance of \nequities tips in their favor and that an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. NRDC, 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Where, as here, there are serious questions as to the Court’s jurisdiction, it is \n“more unlikely” that the plaintiff can establish a “likelihood of success on the merits.” Munaf, 553 \nU.S. at 690.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs seek a stay of the effective date of the Rule under Section \n705 of the APA.  As they correctly observe, “[t]he standard for a stay under § 705 is the same as \nthe standard for a preliminary injunction.”  Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \nand Stay or TRO Pending National Emergency at 12-13, ECF No. 169 (“Mot.”) (citing Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 435 (5th Cir. 2016)). \n                                                 \n2 The Court also denied a similar motion by the plaintiffs in litigation pending in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois.  Pls’ Ex. 3.  To date, those plaintiffs have not filed a \nnew motion for a preliminary injunction. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 11 of 30\nARGUMENT \n \nI.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Issue the Preliminary Relief Requested by \nPlaintiffs \n  Plaintiffs contend that the district court retains jurisdiction to issue a second preliminary \ninjunction based on legal issues identical to those that are currently before the Second Circuit on \nappeal and despite the Supreme Court’s stay of the Court’s first preliminary injunction.  But just \nweeks ago, Plaintiffs conceded in their Supreme Court filing that there is “substantial doubt as to \nwhether the lower courts could provide any meaningful relief given the [Supreme] Court’s stay.”  \nMot. to Lift Stay at 16.  That is why Plaintiffs sought relief initially in the Supreme Court rather \nthan in this Court.  Because this Court lacks authority to modify its first injunction, it follows that \nthe Court also may not issue a new injunction that would effectively undo the Supreme Court’s \nstay of that injunction.  Such a “new” injunction would for all intents and purposes be identical to \nthe injunctions that the Supreme Court already has stayed – but simply issued based on this Court’s \n“new” evaluation of the applicable factors.   \nIt is well-settled that an interlocutory appeal “divests the district court of jurisdiction \nrespecting the questions raised and decided in the order that is on appeal.”  New York NOW v. \nTerry, 886 F.2d 1339, 1350 (2nd Cir. 1989); see also Garcia v. Bloomberg, No. 11 civ. 6597, 2012 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 108311, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 2012) (“An interlocutory appeal, unless \nfrivolous, generally divests the district court of jurisdiction respecting the issues raised and decided \nin the order on appeal; but the district court retains jurisdiction over ‘collateral’ matters not \ninvolved in the appeal.”).  It is true, as Plaintiffs note, see Mot. at 13-14, that a notice of \ninterlocutory appeal does not entirely divest a district court of jurisdiction “to proceed with other \nphases of the case,” but that narrow exception does not apply here.  Plaintiffs cannot plausibly \ncontend that the substance of their successive motion for preliminary relief is independent of the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 12 of 30\nquestions of law and fact raised and decided in the previous preliminary injunction motion and \nwhich are now under consideration by the Second Circuit.  Indeed, Plaintiffs expressly admit that \nthe instant injunction request is premised, at least in part, on the same considerations as the prior \ninjunction that is on appeal.  Mot. at 16 (“Plaintiffs have already demonstrated that they are likely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims and that the Rule is contrary to law and arbitrary and \ncapricious in violation of the APA – issues that the Second Circuit is currently considering and \nthat the Plaintiffs do not seek to relitigate here.”).  In other words, Plaintiffs ask the Court to rely \non the Court’s prior legal and factual determinations in order to satisfy the standard, Mot. at 24, \neven though those determinations are currently under review by the Second Circuit.  See Broker \nGenius Inc. v. Seat Scouts LLC, No. 17-8627, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18447, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. \n5, 2019) (court lacked jurisdiction to change the amount of a bond because the amount of the bond \nwas set in the order granting a preliminary injunction, which was still on appeal).  Plaintiffs have \nnot withdrawn their first motion for preliminary injunction, but instead they are continuing to \npursue that motion in the Second Circuit while simultaneously seeking a new injunction in this \nCourt.3 \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish their instant motion from their earlier motion by insisting \nthat the new motion “seeks new relief based upon new facts and circumstances that were not—and \ncould not have been—before the Court when it issued its prior order.”  Mot. at 14.  Even if \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs are not asking the Court to proceed to the merits or take any other action collateral to \nthe issues on appeal.  Instead, contrary to their assertions, they are transparently seeking “a second \nbite at the apple” in the form of a preliminary nationwide injunction of the Rule as a whole. Cf., \ne.g., Satcom Int’l Group PLC v. Orbcomm Int’l Partners, L.C., 55 F. Supp. 2d 231, 234 (S.D.N.Y. \n1999) (“[T]he district court may proceed with those matters not involved in the appeal.”); Huszar \nv. Zeleny, 269 F. Supp. 2d 98, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“Here the interlocutory appeal involves the \nCourt’s denial of a preliminary injunction and is unrelated to the merits of the case . . . Therefore \nthe Court has jurisdiction over . . . the defendants’ motion to dismiss.”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 13 of 30\nPlaintiffs could show that one issue presented by their current motion was not tied up with the \nissues already pending on appeal, that would not change the fact that their current motion \nnecessarily implicates other, distinct issues that are indisputably wrapped up in the appeal.  See \nsupra at 6-7.  That by itself means that this Court lacks jurisdiction to grant their present motion.  \nAnd in any event, the types of harms that Plaintiffs describe in the instant motion were indeed \nraised in their earlier motion – the COVID-19 situation simply presents a new example of those \npreviously identified harms.  Plaintiffs argued at length in their first motion that the Rule would \ncause individuals to disenroll from Medicaid and other public benefits and thereby harm public \nhealth.  See New York, No. 19-7777, Mem. of Law in Supp. of Pls’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. And Stay \nPending Judicial Review, ECF No. 35, at 6-17.  For example, Plaintiffs claimed that the Rule “will \nimpair Plaintiffs’ ability to safeguard public health in their jurisdictions,” “will cause irreparable \nharm to public health,” and that the Rule “jeopardizes Plaintiffs’ ability to reduce the spread of \ncommunicable  diseases”  because  “uninsured  adults  and  children  are  more  likely  to  skip \nimmunizations and vaccinations, increasing the likelihood that communicable diseases will spread \nthroughout Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions.”  Id. at 9, 13, 14.  The Court agreed with those arguments when \nit enjoined the Rule, see, e.g., New York, No. 19-7777, ECF No. 110, at 20 (discussing “economic \nand public health harms” including “[i]ncreased prevalence of communicable diseases”), and the \nSecond Circuit is now considering those same arguments on appeal, see New York v. DHS, No. \n19-3591, Brief for Appellees, at 29-31 (2d Cir.).  Moreover, Plaintiffs raised those arguments, \nunsuccessfully, before the Supreme Court when they opposed Defendants’ application for a stay.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 14 of 30\nSee DHS v. New York, No. 19A785, Opp’n of Gov’t Pls to Defs’ Application for a Stay of the \nOrders Issued by the U.S. District Ct. for S.D.N.Y., at 19-20 (Jan. 22, 2020).4   \nThe divestiture of jurisdiction rule is “designed to ‘avoid confusion or waste of time \nresulting from having the same issues before two courts at the same time’” – the exact problem \nthat Plaintiffs’ instant motion creates.  United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) \n(quoting United States v. Salerno, 868 F.2d 524, 540 (2d Cir. 1989)).  The Court has been divested \nof jurisdiction to make decisions based on elements that are on appeal.  See, e.g., Webb v. GAF \nCorp., 78 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir. 1996); Drywall Tapers & Pointers of Greater N.Y. v. Bovis Lend \nLease Interiors, Inc., No. 05 CV 274, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5014, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Feb 10, 2006) \n(“Whether [the court] has jurisdiction to decide [party’s motion] essentially depends on whether \nthe issues raised by that motion overlap with the issues ‘involved in’ the [interlocutory] appeal[.]”). \nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ successive motion for preliminary injunction should be denied for lack of \njurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs’ secondary argument, that the Court is empowered to take action to maintain the \nstatus quo at the time of the injunction, is also unavailing.  Mot. at 14 n.47.  Rule 62(c) “has been \nnarrowly interpreted to allow the district court to grant only such relief as may be necessary to \npreserve the status quo pending an appeal.”  Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. \nEastern Airlines, Inc., 847 F.2d 1014, 1018 (2d Cir. 1988).  The circumstances that would have \npertained under the preliminary injunction cannot be the status quo for purposes of this rule \nbecause the Supreme Court’s stay of the injunction prevents the injunction from having any effect. \nIndeed, given that the Supreme Court has stayed that existing injunction, modifying that injunction \n                                                 \n4 Available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A785/129483/2020012213472 \n4605_No.19A785%20StayOpposition.pdf.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 15 of 30\nwould have no effect while the Supreme Court’s stay remains in place – further highlighting the \nfact that what Plaintiffs are effectively doing is asking this Court to overrule the Supreme Court’s \nstay decision. \nPlaintiffs seek to avoid the effect of the well-settled precedent described above by pointing \nto the Supreme Court’s statement that “[t]his order” – i.e., the order denying Plaintiffs’ request to \nlift the stay of injunction – “does not preclude a filing in the District Court as counsel considers \nappropriate.”  Pls’ Ex. 2.   But that statement merely clarified that the Supreme Court’s order on \ntheir motion to modify the stay did not purport to predetermine the effect of the underlying stay \nitself (and the pending appeal) on this Court’s jurisdiction over a yet-to-be-filed motion that \nPlaintiffs themselves had suggested this Court would likely not be able to consider.  The limited \nscope of the Court’s statement about the “preclu[sive]” effect of its “order” on a “filing” by \ncounsel, Pls’ Ex. 2, moreover, is especially notable because it differs in important ways from the \nalternative relief Plaintiffs had asked for – that “the Court should clarify that its stay does not \npreclude the district court from considering whether changed circumstances from the COVID-19 \noutbreak warrant temporary relief from implementation of the Public Charge Rule.”  Mot. to Lift \nStay at 27 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs simply ignore the limited language of the Court’s order, \nsuggesting – incorrectly – that the Court gave them exactly what they had requested.  See, e.g., \nMot. at 15.   \nII.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims \nEven  if  the  Court  determines  it  has  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiffs’  second  motion  for \npreliminary injunction, it should deny that motion.  Plaintiffs argue that this Court’s prior rulings \non the merits in connection with Plaintiffs’ first preliminary injunction motion “are dispositive \nunder the law of the case doctrine.”  Mot. at 24.  But that argument ignores the Supreme Court’s \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 16 of 30\nstay.  In staying this Court’s preliminary injunction, the Supreme Court necessarily concluded that \nthe government had a fair prospect of success on the merits.  Conkright v. Frommert, 556 U.S. \n1401, 1402 (2009) (Ginsburg, J., in chambers); see Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) \n(explaining that a stay applicant must “ma[k]e a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits”).  And Plaintiffs identify nothing in their present motion – which deals exclusively with \nevents that occurred after the finalization of the Rule – that would undermine the Supreme Court’s \nassessment of the merits.  Accordingly, they have failed to demonstrate the “ ‘clear’ or ‘substantial’ \nlikelihood of success on the merits” that their application for a preliminary injunction requires.  \nVIP of Berlin, 593 F.3d at 185-86 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, the law of the case doctrine \nfavors Defendants, not Plaintiffs.   \n  Even if the Court could reconsider the merits question that was necessarily decided in \nDefendants’ favor by the Supreme Court, the authority in support of Defendants’ position is even \nstronger now than it was at the time of the first preliminary injunction motion.  In particular, in \nstaying materially similar preliminary injunctions against the Rule’s enforcement, the Ninth \nCircuit has issued a detailed opinion concluding that Defendants are likely to succeed on their \nclaim that the Rule falls well within the Executive Branch’s discretion to interpret and implement \nthe public charge inadmissibility provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act.  San Francisco, \n944 F.3d at 773.  Particularly in light of that decision, Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success \non the merits.  See New York, No. 19-7777, Mem. of Law in Supp. of Defs’ Mot. to Dismiss, ECF \nNo. 141; Make the Road New York, No. 19-7993, Mem. of Law in Supp. of Defs’ Mot. to Dismiss, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 17 of 30\nECF No. 177.  If this Court determines that it has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ motion at all, \nit can deny the motion on this basis alone.5 \nIII.  Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate That They Will Suffer Irreparable Harm in the \nAbsence of a Preliminary Injunction, or that the Balance of Equities Favors an \nInjunction \n \nA.  USCIS Has Already Issued an Alert That Adequately Addresses Plaintiffs’ \nConcerns \n \nPlaintiffs also cannot satisfy the irreparable harm and balance of equities requirements for \npreliminary injunctive relief.  On March 13, 2020—the same day that President Trump declared \nthat the COVID-19 outbreak constitutes a national emergency—USCIS issued an alert to ensure \nthat the Rule would not deter aliens from seeking medical treatment or preventive services related \nto COVID-19. See USCIS, Public Charge Alert, https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-\nprocesses-and-procedures/public-charge  (last visited May 12, 2020) (hereinafter, “Alert”). The \nAlert  categorically  states  that  “treatment  or  preventive  services”  for  COVID-19  “will  not \nnegatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis.”  Id.  The alert further clarifies: \nTo address the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 \nmay be hesitant to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive \nservices,  USCIS  will  neither  consider  testing,  treatment,  nor \npreventative  care  (including  vaccines,  if  a  vaccine  becomes \navailable)  related  to  COVID-19  as  part  of  a  public  charge \ninadmissibility determination, nor as related to the public benefit \ncondition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension \nof stay or change of status, even if such treatment is provided or paid \nfor by one or more public benefits, as defined in the rule (e.g. \nfederally funded Medicaid). \n \n                                                 \n5 Although the Second Circuit has suggested that a moving party may make a lesser showing of \n“sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them a fair ground for \nlitigation,” to obtain a preliminary injunction, that alternative standard is unavailable to a party \nchallenging “governmental action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory \nscheme.” Monserrate v. New York State Senate, 599 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir. 2010). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 18 of 30\nId. (emphasis added). Thus, if an alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive COVID-19-related care, that \nenrollment will not be a negative factor in a public-charge inadmissibility determination, so long \nas the alien disenrolls from Medicaid once he or she no longer needs COVID-19-related care, or \nprovides evidence of a request to disenroll. See Declaration of Joseph P. Edlow ¶ 12.  Thus, the \nAlert adequately addresses Plaintiffs’ concerns about disenrollment from public benefits used for \ntesting or treatment of COVID-19. \n  Plaintiffs argue that the Alert sows confusion since although it states that COVID-19 \nrelated treatment and preventive services will not be considered, it states that Medicaid enrollment \nis generally considered a factor in the public charge analysis.6  But the Alert clearly states that \nCOVID-19-related medical services, “even if . . . provided or paid by” public benefits covered by \nthe Rule including Medicaid, will not be considered for the purpose of the Rule.  To the extent that \nthis  unequivocal  language  left  any  uncertainty,  moreover,  the  government  eliminated  it  by \nconfirming before the Supreme Court that “if any alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive COVID-19-\nrelated care, that enrollment will not be a negative factor in a public-charge inadmissibility \ndetermination, so long as the alien disenrolls from Medicaid once he or she no longer needs \nCOVID-19-related care, or provides evidence of a request to disenroll.”  See DHS v. New York, \nResp. in Opp’n to Respondents’ Mot. to Temp. Lift or Modify the Ct’s Stay, at 13, No. 19A785 \n(April 20, 2020).7 \n                                                 \n6 Plaintiffs refer to the segment of the Alert which states: “The rule requires USCIS to consider \nthe receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, including those that may be used to obtain \ntesting or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge inadmissibility determination, and for \npurposes of a public benefit condition applicable to certain nonimmigrants seeking an extension \nof stay or change of status.” See Alert. \n7  Available  at  https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19A785/142030/2020042011211 \n2348_19A785%20Govt%20oppn%20to%20NY%20motion%20FILE.pdf \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 19 of 30\n  In  an  attempt  to  obtain  broader  relief  from  this  Court,  Plaintiffs  suggest  that  the \ngovernment’s interpretation is inconsistent with “the text of the alert.”  Mot. 22.  But outside of \nthe litigation context, other entities have had no issue interpreting USCIS’s Alert. For example, \nthe District of Columbia government notes on its website that “for the purposes of COVID-19 \ntesting, diagnosis, and treatment, Medicaid enrollment will not be considered a negative factor in \na  public  charge  analysis,  according  to  USCIS  guidance  issued  on  March  19,  2020.”    See \nGovernment of the District of Columbia, Public Notice: Public Charge Rule FAQs with COVID-\n19 Information, (Mar. 26, 2020), https://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/public-notice-public-charge-\nrule-faqs-covid-19-information (emphasis added). The New York City Mayor’s Office website \nsimilarly states that “USCIS posted an alert clarifying that seeking or using medical treatment or \npreventive healthcare services related to COVID-19 will NOT be considered under the public \ncharge rule, even if the services are Medicaid-funded.”  NYC Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, \nPublic  Charge  Rule,  Mar.  16,  2020,  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/immigrants/help/legal-\nservices/public-charge.page (emphasis added). \n  Thus, the USCIS Alert assures aliens that they may access COVID-19-related treatment \nand preventive services, even if financed through Medicaid or other public benefit as defined in \nthe Rule, without risking an adverse determination based on that receipt.  To the extent a discrete \nset of aliens still find the Alert ambiguous, Plaintiffs could use their resources to properly inform \nthem of its content and scope, rather than pursuing a preliminary injunction which, if anything, \ncreates ambiguity by suggesting that the Alert should be read to impose the very sorts of effects \nPlaintiffs are ostensibly seeking to avoid.8 \n                                                 \n8 Contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Alert was published “only in English,” Mot. at 22, a \nSpanish language version is available by clicking “Version en espanol” on the USCIS website.  \nSee https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/public-charge.   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 20 of 30\nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claimed Harms Are Not Caused by the Rule and Would Not Be \nRemedied by a Preliminary Injunction \nPutting aside that USCIS has issued guidance to clarify that the very harms that Plaintiffs \nfear will not materialize, Plaintiffs’ theory of irreparable harm (and their related argument on the \nbalance of the equities) suffers from more fundamental problems.  As their own evidence makes \nclear, the harms Plaintiffs allege stem not from the Rule itself, but rather from misunderstandings \nabout how the Rule works.  Plaintiffs’ argument is that, because of the Rule, some individuals will \navoid using public benefits, such as Medicaid, and thereby fail to obtain testing or treatment for \nCOVID-19, which will cause Plaintiffs harm.  Mot. at 16-21.  But the Rule does not prohibit \nanyone from accessing public benefits, and aliens who voluntarily choose to disenroll from public \nbenefits because of the Rule will typically have done so because they mistakenly believe they are \nsubject to the Rule when, in fact, they are not.  This is because most aliens to whom the Rule could \npotentially apply are not presently eligible for federal means-tested benefits like Medicaid.  See \nRule at 41313 (explaining that classes of aliens who are eligible for the noncash benefits covered \nby the Rule are, except in rare circumstances, not subject to a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1642(b) (limiting receipt of federal public benefits to eligible \nqualified aliens); id. § 1641(b) (“qualified alien” includes, inter alia, lawful permanent residents, \nasylum recipients, and refugees).  The Rule cannot possibly prevent or deter aliens from using \npublic benefits for which they are not eligible. \n  Plaintiffs assert that notwithstanding USCIS’s COVID-19-related guidance and the limited \nrelevance of the Rule to aliens who are actually eligible for benefits, the Rule is “deterring \nimmigrants from accessing publicly funded healthcare, including programs that would enable \nimmigrants to obtain testing and treatment for COVID-19[.]”  Mot. at 1.  But their accompanying \ndeclarations make clear that this asserted effect is not the result of the Rule itself, but rather of \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 21 of 30\n“mistaken beliefs” about the Rule’s application and content.  Pls’ Ex. 14 ¶ 9; Pls’ Ex. 27 ¶ 7.  \nPlaintiffs’ declarations repeatedly describe aliens who incorrectly believe that they are subject to \nthe Rule, or who express concerns about using public benefits that are not considered by the Rule.  \nSee, e.g., Pls’ Ex. 8 ¶ 4 (“two patients receiving outpatient treatment reported concerns about going \nto the hospital for COVID-19 care because they worried that any benefits that they might use to \naccess that care—including even the Yale Freecare Program, which I understand is not subject to \nthe Public Charge Rule—might negatively impact their immigration status”); Pls’ Ex. 10 ¶ 12 \n(describing concerns that enrollment in public benefits “including for their U.S. citizen children, \nwill subject them to the public charge rule”); Pls’ Ex. 14 ¶ 5 (“some families that organizers speak \nwith have withdrawn their U.S. citizen children from healthcare coverage out of a mistaken fear \nthat their children’s coverage will trigger immigration consequences related to public charge”); id. \n¶ 6 (“classes of immigrants to whom the public charge rule does not apply, such as Lawful \nPermanent Residents, have also disenrolled from services out of the mistaken fear that they could \nface immigration consequences for receiving benefits); Pls’ Ex. 17 ¶ 5 (“My patients’ fears and \nconcerns about the risks associated with use of public benefits, however, apply even to services \nexempted by the rule.”); Pls’ Ex. 18 ¶ 8 (“nine callers to the hotline were so insistent on \ndisenrolling from public benefits—even though they were entitled to the benefits and not subject \nto a public charge test”); id. ¶ 9 (discussing “calls . . . from immigrants with legal permanent \nresident status” which “demonstrate the continued confusion about and chilling effect of the Rule, \neven amongst those to whom it does not apply”); Pls’ Ex. 21 ¶ 13 (discussing “five families [that] \ndid not want to apply for Medicaid for their children due to the fear of the Rule” where “[a]ll \nfamily members were green card holders and were looking into applying for citizenship”); id. ¶ 21 \n(asylee parent “called and requested that the [benefits] applications for all three children be \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 22 of 30\nwithdrawn due to concern with the Rule”); Pls’ Ex. 23 ¶ 11 (“A lawful permanent resident who \nlost his job recently called the LegalHealth public charge hotline with concerns that receiving \nMedicaid and applying for unemployment would impact his permanent residency.”); Pls’ Ex. 24 \n¶ 10 (“The clients expressing these fears include people to whom public charge is not applicable \nbecause they are LPRs or hold other status not affected.”); see also Mot. at 10 (“The Rule’s \ndeterrent effects have not been limited to the LPR applicants or public-benefit programs that are \ndirectly subject to the Rule.”). \nPlaintiffs cite no authority holding that a federal policy may be enjoined because some \nsubset of the public misunderstands its legal effects.  But even if harms that may result from \nmisunderstandings of the Rule were somehow relevant to the irreparable harm analysis, those \nharms still would be insufficient to justify a preliminary injunction here.  Preliminary injunctive \nrelief “inherently requires a causal connection between the injunction and harm.”  I.M. Wilson, \nInc. v. Otvetstvennostyou “Grichko”, No. 18-5194, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182350, at *9 (E.D. \nPa. Oct. 18, 2019).  In other words, to obtain a preliminary injunction, “plaintiffs must show that, \non the facts of their case, the failure to issue an injunction would actually cause irreparable harm.”  \nAppalseed Prods., Inc. v. Medianet Dig., Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93946, at *29 (S.D.N.Y. \nJuly 6, 2012) (quoting Salinger v. Colting, 607 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2010)); see also Faulkner v. Jones, \n10 F.3d 226, 235-36 (4th Cir. 1993) (Hamilton, J., dissenting; emphasis in original) (“[A]ny \ninquiry into the irreparable harm resulting from the denial of interim relief must necessarily begin \nwith an analysis of the degree to which that particular relief remedies the alleged injuries.”); Sierra \nClub v. United States DOE, 825 F. Supp. 2d 142, 153 (D.D.C. 2011) (“A plaintiff may be \nirreparably harmed by all sorts of things, but the irreparable harm considered by the court must be \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 23 of 30\ncaused by the conduct in dispute and remedied by the relief sought.”) (emphasis added; citing \ncases). \nHere,  Plaintiffs  have  not  shown  that  their  alleged  harms  would  be  remedied  by  a \npreliminary injunction.  On the contrary, as discussed above, Plaintiffs’ Motion is premised on the \nidea that various individuals misunderstand the Rule, including basic questions such as to whom \nit applies and which public benefits are relevant, and that this confusion persists even after the \nimplementing agency issued guidance specifically clarifying that COVID-19-related testing and \ntreatment will not be treated as a negative factor in public charge determinations.  Against that \nbackdrop, it is utter speculation to conclude that these same individuals – who mistakenly believe \nthemselves to be subject to the Rule when they are not, or who for some reason cannot be informed \nabout the government’s policy with respect to COVID-19-related testing and treatment – will (1) \nlearn about a preliminary injunction that may be issued by this Court, (2) understand what it means \nfor a court to preliminarily enjoin a rule, and (3) change their behavior and begin using public \nbenefits based on that understanding.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ irreparable harm argument requires \nspeculative assumptions about the future behavior of third parties, though it is widely recognized \nthat “predicting . . . the behavior of third parties is usually suspect.”  Sea Shore Corp. v. Sullivan, \n158 F.3d 51, 56 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Walker, 7 F.3d 26, 30 (2d Cir. 1993) (“future \nactions of third parties are not easily predicted.”).  “The Supreme Court itself has noted the \nimprobability of establishing the necessary likelihood of some result when that result depends on \npredicting the acts of even a single ‘interest group’ who is unrepresented in the instant litigation, \nespecially when that group . . . is actually composed of dozens of individual actors[.]”  Fla. \nAudubon Soc'y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare \nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 42-46 (1976)).   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 24 of 30\nMoreover,  Plaintiffs’  own  declarations  undermine  the  inference  that  a  preliminary \ninjunction would remedy Plaintiffs’ alleged harms.  Those declarations suggest that aliens who are \navoiding public benefits based on mistaken beliefs about the Rule would not adjust their behavior \non the basis of an interim court ruling.  The declarations describe individuals’ refusals to utilize \npublic benefits even after they are assured that the benefits are outside the scope of the Rule.  See, \ne.g., Pls’ Ex. 15 ¶ 4 (“Another client recently refused to sign up to use IRIS’s own food pantry \nbecause of the Public Charge Rule. I could not convince this client—who is currently unemployed \nbecause of the COVID-19 epidemic—to access this necessary food resource, even though use of \nthe food pantry is totally outside of the scope of the Rule.”); Pls’ Ex. 21 ¶ 11 (“Even when outreach \nworkers try to assure families that it is ok to apply for Medicaid/FAMIS, outreach workers are \nseeing an increasing number of families who ultimately decide not to apply and in some cases, \nwithdraw from coverage.”).  The declarations also describe “widespread” “[c]onfusion . . . among \nimmigrants as to how public charge applies,” Pls’ Ex. 14 ¶ 6, and explain that immigrants “are \nextremely unlikely to receive accurate information about who public charge applies to and how” \nunless they “actively reach out” or are located “through outreach services,” Pls’ Ex. 27 ¶ 7, \nsuggesting that these individuals are unlikely to learn about and understand the legal significance \nof a preliminary injunction in this case.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to show that their \nrequested preliminary injunction would dispel the alleged confusion about the Rule, much less that \nit would remedy Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries from that confusion.  See Faulkner, 10 F.3d at 236 \n(“If the relief requested does little, if anything, to alleviate the alleged injuries, it is difficult to \ncomprehend how the refusal to grant that relief could cause irreparable harm.”). \nC.  The Remaining Equitable Factors Require Denial of Plaintiffs’ Motion \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 25 of 30\nLastly, the Court should find that the equitable balance favors Defendants.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that it would be in “the public interest” to enjoin the Rule, in its entirety, nationwide.  Mot. \nat 23.  But the public has an interest in both addressing the COVID-19 crisis and enforcing lawful \nimmigration policy – and it is the Executive Branch that is charged with determining how best to \ndo both.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 435-36. The Executive Branch has considered the arguments \nPlaintiffs advance, and has concluded that Plaintiffs’ preferred outcome – a wholesale suspension \nof the Rule, just as they sought before the COVID-19 crisis – is not warranted.  Plaintiffs provide \nno basis for this Court to overrule that judgment about how the nation’s lawful immigration \npolicies should be implemented during the COVID-19 crisis. \n  Furthermore,  there  is  no  serious  question  that  Defendants  and  the  public  would  be \nirreparably harmed by an injunction.  The federal government sustains irreparable injury whenever \nit “is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people.” \nMaryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers).  That injury is particularly \nacute here because an injunction would require DHS, on a nationwide basis, to grant lawful \npermanent resident status to aliens who are likely at any time to become public charges under the \nRule.  DHS currently has no practical means of revisiting these determinations if the injunction \nwere later stayed or vacated.  See Declaration of Daniel Renaud, ECF No. 113, ¶ 4.  In granting a \nstay  of  the  first  preliminary  injunction,  the  Supreme  Court  necessarily  concluded  that  the \ngovernment would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay, and that no other equitable \nconsiderations rendered a stay inappropriate.  And the Ninth Circuit expressly did so.  See San \nFrancisco, 944 F.3d at 805-06.9  \n                                                 \n9 Plaintiffs incorrectly claim that “green card processing has been suspended[.]”  Mot. at 24.  In \nfact, processing has not been suspended to the extent that processing does not require face-to-face \ncontact.  See https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-response-covid-19.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 26 of 30\nIV.  If the Court Chooses to Grant Injunctive Relief, the Injunction Should Not Have \nNationwide Effect \n  Although Plaintiffs contend that the relief they seek is substantively different from the \npreviously stayed preliminary injunction, it is in fact identical in geographic scope and merely \nlimited to an unspecified future point in time.  When the first injunction was stayed, Justice \nGorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas, issued a concurring opinion specifically to highlight the \nimpropriety of nationwide injunctions. See New York, 140 S. Ct. at 600 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) \n(“[T]he  routine  issuance  of  universal  injunctions  is  patently  unworkable,  sowing  chaos  for \nlitigants,  the  government,  courts,  and  all  those  affected  by  these  conflicting  decisions.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ motion provides no response to any of the concerns raised by this opinion.  Moreover, \nPlaintiffs provide only self-serving, speculative, and conclusory statements in support of their \nargument that the injunction they now seek must have nationwide effect. Mot. at 25.  \n  Plaintiffs seek relief that is not necessary to redress any allegedly cognizable, irreparable \ninjuries to the parties in the case, and they therefore lack standing to obtain such relief.  See Madsen \nv. Women’s Health Ctr. Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (holding that injunctive relief must “be no \nmore burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”).  \nThe remedy sought “must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact \nthat the plaintiff has established.” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1921 (2018) (quoting Lewis v. \nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1996)).  Furthermore, a plaintiff does not retain standing to challenge a \nregulation in the abstract when its application to that plaintiff has been resolved.  See Summers v. \nEarth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 494-97 (2009).   \nConsequently, in order to justify an injunction of broader application, Plaintiffs would have \nto have made a satisfactory showing that they would face harms sufficient to satisfy the preliminary \ninjunction standard even if a geographically limited injunction were in place, a showing they have \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 27 of 30\nnot meaningfully attempted to make.  Instead, Plaintiffs simply note that individuals travelling \nfrom other states may spread COVID-19 into the government Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions.  Mot. at 25.  \nBut that is true regardless of whether a preliminary injunction is issued.  Not even Plaintiffs \ncontend that a preliminary injunction would end the pandemic or stop infected persons from \ntravelling into the plaintiff jurisdictions.10 \nV.  The Court Should Decline to Issue an Indicative Ruling on Plaintiffs’ Request \nfor Preliminary Relief \n \n  “[I]n addition to” a new preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs are also seeking an indicative \nruling pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1.  Mot. at 15.  Plaintiffs are correct that, in \ngeneral, when a district court has been divested of jurisdiction by an appeal, Rule 62.1 allows the \ncourt to notify the Court of Appeals “either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals \nremands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1(a)(3).  \nHowever, the purpose of an indicative ruling is to allow for “the timely resolution of motions \nwhich may further the appeal or obviate its necessity,” and not for the district court to “reconsider[] \nthe same question being reviewed by the court of appeals.”  Ret. Bd. of the Policemen’s Annuity \nand Ben. Fund of Chi. v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 297 F.R.D. 218, 221 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  \n  As discussed above, Plaintiffs’ second motion for preliminary injunction requests the \nidentical relief, but with a time limitation, on primarily identical legal and factual questions.  “[A]n \nindicative ruling on the very issue on appeal,” however, “only interrupts the appellate process.”  \n                                                 \n10 Plaintiffs have also moved again for an order postponing the effective date of the Rule pursuant \nto 5 U.S.C. § 705.  That request is governed by the same legal standard as the motion for \npreliminary injunction, and it therefore fails for the same reasons as discussed above.  Indeed, \nSection 705 authorizes courts to postpone an agency’s action only “to the extent necessary to \nprevent irreparable injury.”  The Court should also deny Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary \nrestraining order for the same reasons and because the Court’s hearing on the preliminary \ninjunction will be held in a matter of days. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 176   Filed 05/12/20   Page 28 of 30\nId.  If Plaintiffs are correct that their two motions for preliminary injunction are sufficiently \nunrelated to allow the Court jurisdiction, which they are not, see supra, a ruling on the instant \nmotion would not obviate the need to resolve the appeal on the first.  Because Plaintiffs’ current \nrequest seeks to limit their otherwise identical proposed nationwide injunction to the duration of \nthe national emergency, and the previous injunction was not so limited, it would still be necessary \nto resolve the appeal. \n  It is also clear that “[a]n indicative ruling would do little to aid the Second Circuit’s \nconsideration of the appeal.” Id. at 222. The Court of Appeals’ review of the legal issues in a \npreliminary injunction is de novo and its consideration of the district court’s analysis of the \napplicable standard is based on the information that was available to the court at the time of the \ndecision.  See, e.g., Chevron Corp. v. Naranjo, 667 F. 3d 232, 239 (2d Cir. 2012).  In any event, \nPlaintiffs submitted their evidence concerning the COVID-19 pandemic to the Second Circuit \nthrough a letter pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), so that Court is already \naware of Plaintiffs’ position.  See New York v. DHS, No. 2019-3591, No. 534 (2d Cir.). \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \nDated:  May 12, 2020                      Respectfully submitted, \n \nGEOFFREY S.

FRANCISCO \n    Solicitor General \n      Counsel of Record \n    Department of Justice \n    Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 \n    SupremeCtBriefs@usdoj.gov \n    (202) 514-2217 \n \n  \n________________________________________________________________ \n________________________________________________________________ \n \n\n \nCongress has declared that under the United States’ “national \npolicy  with  respect  to  welfare  and  immigration,”  there  is  a \n“compelling governmental interest” in “assur[ing] that aliens be \nself-reliant”  and  in  “remov[ing]  the  incentive  for  illegal \nimmigration provided by the availability of public benefits.”  8 \nU.S.C. 1601.  Consistent with that objective, Congress has long \nempowered  specified  Executive  Branch  officials,  including  the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to declare \n“inadmissible” “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of [the relevant \nExecutive Branch official], is likely at any time to become a \npublic charge,” 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(A).  See Appl. 5-6. \nThat statutory policy refutes respondents’ arguments.  First, \non  the  merits,  it  undermines  respondents’  claim  that  “public \ncharge”  has  a  uniformly  accepted  meaning  that  applies  only  to \nnarrowly drawn types of public support.  Nothing in the statute’s \ntext,  context,  or  history  requires  that  narrow  reading,  or \nprecludes DHS’s natural and reasonable conclusion that aliens who \nrely  on  public  support  to  feed  or  house  themselves  over  a \nprotracted or intense period are public charges.  Second, on the \nequities, it forecloses respondents’ argument that because aliens \nsubject to the Rule may disenroll from public benefit programs, \nallowing the Rule to go into effect would harm the public interest. \nIndeed,  two  courts  of  appeals  faced  with  substantively \nidentical  nationwide  preliminary  injunctions  already  have \n \n\n2 \nconcluded that stays are warranted to allow the Rule to go into \neffect pending appeal.  The nationwide injunctions of a single \ndistrict judge should not be allowed to supersede those appellate \ndeterminations or dictate national immigration policy.  Instead, \nhistorical limitations on the proper role of a district court, \ngiven force through Article III and principles of equity, require \nthat any relief be appropriately tailored to the parties.   \nI.  THERE  IS  A  REASONABLE  PROBABILITY  THIS  COURT  WOULD  GRANT \nCERTIORARI \nRespondents  do  not  seriously  dispute  that  if  the  Second \nCircuit  were  to  affirm  the  nationwide  preliminary  injunctions, \nthat  decision  would  warrant  this  Court’s  review.    Indeed,  the \nnationwide aspect of those injunctions by itself would warrant \nreview.  See Trump v. Pennsylvania, cert. granted, Jan. 17, 2020 \n(No.  19-454).    Instead,  respondents  contend  that  “until  the[] \ncourts [of appeals] issue their decisions, there is no reasonable \nbasis” to predict whether this Court would grant certiorari.  NY \nOpp. 21; see Make the Road (MTR) Opp. 20.  But this Court routinely \nmakes such predictive judgments when it considers whether to grant \na stay pending appeal of a preliminary injunction.  See, e.g., \nBarr v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 140 S. Ct. 3 (2019); Trump v. \nSierra Club, 140 S. Ct. 1 (2019).  And contrary to respondents’ \nsuggestion (MTR Opp. 17), making that prediction is especially \neasy here, where two courts of appeals already have entered stays \nof substantively identical nationwide injunctions -- one of them \n \n\n3 \nin  a  published  and  precedential  opinion  holding  that  the  Rule \n“easily” survives challenge.  City & County of San Francisco v. \nUSCIS, 944 F.3d 773, 799 (9th Cir. 2019).   \nII.  THERE IS A FAIR PROSPECT THAT THIS COURT WOULD VACATE THE \nINJUNCTIONS IN WHOLE OR IN PART   \nA.  Respondents Are Unlikely To Prevail On The Merits  \n1.  Respondents have failed to identify a cognizable Article \nIII injury that is within the zone of interests of the public-\ncharge inadmissibility provision.  Even if respondents could show \nthat the prospect of aliens’ disenrollment from public-benefits \nprograms poses a “certainly impending” threat to their coffers \nfairly traceable to the Rule, Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 \nU.S.  398,  410  (2013),  their  interest  in  preventing  such \ndisenrollment is “inconsistent” with the public-charge provision’s \ngoal of ensuring that aliens be self-sufficient, Match-E-Be-Nash-\nShe-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 \n(2012).  Respondents’ contrary assertion (NY Opp. 35-36; MTR Opp. \n22)  that  the  public-charge  provision  was  somehow  intended  to \nfacilitate continued dependence on public benefits in service of \nother goals finds no support in the statutory text.  \n2.  a.  Respondents’ challenges to the Rule also lack merit.  \nAs the Ninth Circuit recognized, Congress has over the course of \nmore than a century intentionally preserved the Executive Branch’s \nflexibility to interpret public-charge inadmissibility provisions \nin a way that takes account of changes in public welfare programs.  \n \n\n4 \nCity & County of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 791-798.  The Rule \nexemplifies  that  adaptive  approach,  and  fits  well  within  the \n“considerable discretion” Congress has granted to DHS “to determine \nif an alien is likely to become a public charge.”  Id. at 799.   \nDespite that history, respondents repeatedly insist that when \nCongress adopted the current provision in 1996, “public charge” \nhad a narrow, “well-established meaning” that Congress must have \nmeant to incorporate.  NY Opp. 6; see, e.g., id. at 7, 12, 22, 24, \n27.  In respondents’ view, the settled meaning of “public charge” \nis “an individual who does not work and is consequently primarily \ndependent on the government for long-term subsistence.”  Id. at 4; \nsee MTR Opp. 2.  There is no such well-established or settled \nmeaning.  See Appl. 20-27.  Even the 1999 agency discussions -- \nwhich respondents otherwise embrace -- acknowledged that “public \ncharge” is “ambiguous” and had “never been defined in statute or \nregulation.”  64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, 28,676-28,677 (May 26, 1999); \nsee City & County of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 796 (“[W]e are \nunable to discern one fixed understanding of ‘public charge’ that \nhas endured since 1882.  * * *  [D]ifferent factors have been \nweighted  more  or  less  heavily  at  different  times,  reflecting \nchanges in the way in which we provide assistance to the needy.”).  \nThree examples illustrate the point.  \nFirst, respondents’ position is impossible to square with the \naffidavit-of-support provisions of the Immigration and Nationality \n \n\n5 \nAct (INA).  See 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C) and (D).  Respondents do \nnot dispute that an alien subject to those provisions who fails to \nobtain a required affidavit of support is, as a matter of law, \ninadmissible on public-charge grounds, regardless of the amount or \ntype  of  benefits  the  alien  receives.    See  Appl.  20-22.  \nRespondents’ arguments (NY Opp. 29) that some public benefits are \ncurrently exempted by regulation from that treatment, and that the \naffidavit-of-support remains in effect for only a limited time, \nmiss  the  point:    in  classifying  aliens  who  fail  to  obtain  a \nrequired  affidavit-of-support  as  being  inadmissible  on  public-\ncharge grounds, Congress necessarily rejected respondents’ narrow \nunderstanding  of  “public  charge”  as  limited  to  aliens  who  are \ninstitutionalized or primarily dependent on cash payments. \nSecond,  respondents’  position  is  inconsistent  with  an \nimmigration treatise and the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of \n“public charge” from the time of the INA’s passage.  See Appl. 24-\n25.  Respondents essentially argue (NY Opp. 25; MTR Opp. 7 n.2.) \nthose definitions were incorrect, and that the correct definition \nis in a case that the dictionaries and treatise cited.  But that \ncase, Ex Parte Kichmiriantz, 283 F. 697 (N.D. Cal. 1922), does not \nsupport respondents either:  it recognized that “the words ‘public \ncharge,’ as used in the Immigration Act [of 1917], mean just what \nthey mean ordinarily”:  “a money charge upon, or an expense to, \nthe public for support and care.”  Id. at 698.  To be sure, the \n \n\n6 \ncourt  found  that  definition  inapplicable  because  the  alien’s \nrelatives had paid the State for the alien’s care, see ibid., but \nthe  court  (like  the  dictionary  and  treatise)  nevertheless \nunderstood that “public charge” naturally refers to aliens who \nimpose a charge on the public, without qualifications about cash \nassistance, primary dependence, or the like.  \nThird, respondents’ position is inconsistent with longstanding \nadministrative interpretations, such as the one adopted in In re \nB-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (B.I.A. 1948; A.G. 1948), that did not \nrequire a showing of cash support or primary dependence.  See id. \nat 326.  Respondents observe (NY Opp. 25-26; cf. MTR Opp. 7 n.1) \nthat unlike the Rule, In re B- required a showing of actual failure \nto repay funds upon demand.  But that difference simply underscores \nthe Executive’s longstanding flexibility in making public-charge \ndeterminations.  Critically, In re B- adopted an understanding of \n“public  charge”  decidedly  different  from  respondents’  narrow \ndefinition, see Appl. 25 & n.4, thereby disproving their central \nclaim that “public charge” has a single, well-established meaning \nthat DHS is required to maintain in perpetuity.   \nb.  Respondents misread Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 (1915), as \nestablishing that “the scope of ‘public charge’ remained limited \nto individuals likely to rely almost entirely on government support \nto  survive.”    NY  Opp.  6.    Gegiow  actually  addressed  only  the \n“single question” of “whether an alien can be declared likely to \n \n\n7 \nbecome a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the \ncity of his immediate destination is overstocked.”  239 U.S. at 9-\n10.  The Court said no, requiring such determinations to be based \non the characteristics of the alien, not his place of destination.  \nIbid.  Although the Court suggested in dicta that “public charge” \nmight be interpreted narrowly to accord with nearby terms (like \n“paupers”  and  “professional  beggars,”  id.  at  10),  Congress \nsubsequently  revised  the  relevant  language  specifically  to \ndisapprove that inference, see Immigration Act of 1917, 64th Cong. \nch. 29 § 3, 39 Stat. 875-876; S. Rep. No. 352, 64th Cong., 1st \nSess. 5 (1916) (“The purpose of this change is to overcome recent \ndecisions of the courts limiting the meaning of the description of \nthe excluded class.  * * *  (See especially Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 \nU. S., 3.).”); see also United States ex rel. Iorio v. Day, 34 \nF.2d 920, 922 (2d Cir. 1929) (L. Hand, J.) (the public-charge \nstatute “is certainly now intended to cover cases like Gegiow”). \nNor do any of the lower-court decisions and administrative \nadjudications respondents cite (NY Opp. 4-6, 23-25; MTR Opp. 5-8) \nestablish a uniform, settled understanding of “public charge.”  At \nmost,  those  decisions  --  when  contrasted  with  the  materials \ndiscussed  above  --  confirm  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee’s \nobservation in 1950 that “[d]ecisions of the courts have given \nvaried  definitions  of  the  phrase  ‘likely  to  become  a  public \ncharge.’”  S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 347, 349 (1950).  \n \n\n8 \nCongress’s reaction to that variation was to preserve Executive \nBranch  flexibility  to  adapt  the  public-charge  inadmissibility \nprovision as circumstances require -- not to incorporate a fixed \ndefinition of the term.  See Appl. 25-26. \nAs  the  Ninth  Circuit  correctly  recognized,  it  “easily” \nfollows  that  the  Rule’s  interpretation  is  “‘rational  and \nconsistent with the statute.’”  City & County of San Francisco, \n944 F.3d at 799 (citation omitted).  DHS adopted a reasonable \ninterpretation of “public charge” that -- like the mid-twentieth \ncentury  treatise  and  dictionaries  --  asks  whether  an  alien  is \nlikely to charge expenses to the public for support and care; the \nagency  then  moderated  that  interpretation  by  establishing  an \nadministrable threshold level of benefits below which an alien \nwould  not  be  considered  a  public  charge.    Especially  given \nCongress’s  identification  of  the  “compelling  governmental \ninterest” in “assur[ing] that aliens be self-reliant,” 8 U.S.C. \n1601(4), that is an eminently reasonable interpretation of the \nstatute, promulgated after notice-and-comment rulemaking; it is \ncertainly not, as respondents contend, “far ‘beyond the meaning \nthat the statute can bear.’”  NY Opp. 26 (citation omitted). \nc.  Contrary to respondents’ suggestion (NY Opp. 31-32; MTR \nOpp. 31), the Rule is not arbitrary and capricious in treating the \nreceipt  of  public  benefits  as  indicative  of  a  lack  of  self-\nsufficiency.  An alien who receives public “assistance to provide \n \n\n9 \nfor  * * *   basic necessities  is,” by  definition, “not  self-\nsufficient,” 83 Fed. Reg. 51,154, 51,159 (Oct. 10, 2018), whether \nor not he could have been self-sufficient had he chosen not to \naccept public benefits.  Nor is the Rule’s “aggregate-counting \nsystem” arbitrary and capricious.  NY Opp. 32; cf. MTR Op. 32.  \nThat system reflects DHS’s sensible approach to considering both \nthe intensity and duration of an alien’s receipt of benefits in an \nadministrable way, with periods of more intense usage weighed more \nheavily.  DHS also acted reasonably in including, as part of its \ntotality-of-the-circumstances  assessment,  factors  such  as  low \ncredit scores, lack of English proficiency, and family size.  See \nNY Opp. 32.  Such considerations bear on an alien’s financial \nstability,  earning  power,  and  material  needs,  and  DHS  cited \nevidence showing that they thus affect the likelihood that a given \nalien will receive public benefits in the future.  See 83 Fed. \nReg. at 51,184-51,185 (family size and English proficiency); 84 \nFed. Reg. 41,292, 41,425-41,426 (Aug. 14, 2019) (discussing causes \nand effects of credit scores). \nd.  The Rule also does not violate the Rehabilitation Act.  \nSee NY Opp. 34-35; MTR Opp. 29-31.  Congress has directed that DHS \n“shall” consider “health” in determining whether an alien is likely \nto become a public charge.  8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(B).  On respondents’ \nview,  instead  of  treating  health-related  conditions  as  one \nconsideration  among  many  in  the  totality-of-the-circumstances \n \n\n10 \nanalysis,  DHS  would  be  required  to  treat  minor  ailments  as  a \nnegative factor -- but disregard entirely more serious conditions \nthat rise to the level of a disability.  The Rehabilitation Act \ndoes not require such absurdities.  See Appl. 30-31.   \ne.  Finally,  the  Rule  does  not  violate  equal  protection \nprinciples.  See MTR Opp. 32-33.  It pursues in a facially neutral \nmanner  the  reasonable,  congressionally  declared  “national \nimmigration policy” of ensuring “that aliens be self-reliant,” 8 \nU.S.C.  1601(5).    Respondents  offer  no  colorable  basis  for \nsubjecting it to heightened scrutiny.   \nB.  The Nationwide Injunctions Are Overbroad  \n1.  As the government explained (Appl. 32-39), nationwide \npreliminary injunctions can be in serious tension with both Article \nIII and traditional principles of equity.  As to Article III, \nrespondents assert that the nationwide injunctions here “protect[] \nagainst  precisely  the  harm  [respondents]  ultimately  seek  to \nprevent -- implementation of an unlawful regulation.”  NY Opp. 38; \nsee MTR Opp. 37.  But “a plaintiff’s remedy must be ‘limited to \n \nthe  inadequacy  that  produced  his  injury  in  fact.’”    Gill  v. \nWhitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1930 (2018) (emphasis added; brackets \nand citation omitted).  An injunction limited to aliens receiving \nservices from respondents in the jurisdictions where respondents \n \n\n11 \noperate fully remediates respondents’ alleged injuries.1   \nAs to principles of equity, respondents contend that “[t]he \n‘scope  of  injunctive  relief  is  dictated  by  the  extent  of  the \nviolation  established,  not  by  the  geographical’  location  of \nplaintiffs.”    NY  Opp.  38  (citation  omitted).    But  respondents \noverlook that the case they quote for that proposition, Califano \nv. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682 (1979), involved a class action “brought \nin conformity with” Civil  Rule 23.  Id. at  702.   A certified \nnationwide class may of course pursue nationwide relief; indeed, \na principal problem with nationwide injunctions is that they elide \nthe requirements and protections of class-action litigation.  See \nAppl.  32.    Yamasaki  itself  cautioned  that  before  certifying  a \nnationwide class, courts should “ensure that nationwide relief is \nindeed appropriate” and “would not improperly interfere with the \nlitigation of similar issues in other judicial districts.”  442 \nU.S. at 702. Respondents’ position would turn Yamasaki on its head.   \nRespondents  assert  (MTR  Opp.  37)  that  a  court  in  equity \nhistorically could issue an injunction “that also protects the \n                     \n1   Respondents’ assertion (MTR Opp. 35) that one of them \n“supports  affiliate  programs  that  deliver  direct  services  to \nimmigrants  in  49  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia”  is \ninsufficient to create a nationwide injury.  Respondents’ claim to \ninjury  as  mere  service  providers  to  the  individuals  actually \naffected  by  the  Rule  already  is  tenuous,  see  Appl.  17-18; \nvoluntarily  providing  “support[]”  to  other  service  providers \nstretches the concept of Article III injury beyond all reasonable \nlimits.  See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 418.   \n \n\n12 \ninterests of nonparties.”  But in support, respondents cite an \narticle discussing a “bill of peace,” which was more analogous to \na class action (with similar requirements and protections), see \nFrost, In Defense of Nationwide Injunctions, 93 N.Y.U. L. Rev. \n1065, 1081 n.77 (2018), as best illustrated by the fact that such \nbills  bound  the  absent  parties  win  or  lose,  cf.  Smith  v. \nSwormstedt, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 288, 302-303 (1853); Supreme Tribe \nof Ben Hur v. Cauble, 255 U.S. 356, 366-367 (1921).  Respondents \ncite another article identifying a small handful of nationwide \ninjunctions issued in the early 20th century, one as early as 1913.  \nSee Sohoni, The Lost History of the “Universal” Injunction, 133 \nHarv. L. Rev. 920, 924-925 (2020).  But federal courts’ equity \njurisdiction  is  limited  to  the  “system  of  judicial  remedies” \napplied by “the High Court of Chancery in England” in 1789 -- not \n1913.  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, \nInc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 (1999) (citations omitted).2   \n2.  Respondents’ alternative reliance (NY Opp. 36-38; MTR \nOpp. 36-37) on 5 U.S.C. 705 is misplaced.  That provision states \nthat a court may “postpone the effective date of an agency action” \n                     \n2   The date of the earliest known nationwide injunction is \ncontested.    See  Bray,  A  Response  to  The  Lost  History  of  the \n“Universal” Injunction, Yale J. Reg. Notice & Comment (Oct. 18, \n2019); Sohoni, A Reply to Bray’s Response, Yale J. Reg. Notice & \nComment (Oct. 18, 2019).  Regardless, that scholars debate whether \nthe first nationwide injunction was in 1913 or 1939 or 1963 simply \nunderscores that it was not a traditional part of equity in 1789.   \n \n\n13 \nonly  “to  the  extent  necessary  to  prevent  irreparable  injury.”  \nPostponing  agency  action  solely  as  to  the  plaintiffs  properly \nbefore  the  court  is  all  that  is  “necessary”  to  prevent  their \nasserted injuries.  Ibid.  Respondents’ reliance (NY Opp. 36; MTR \nOpp. 36) on the observation that Section 705 “authorizes courts to \nstay  agency  rules  pending  judicial  review,”  Mexichem  Specialty \nResins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 562 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, \nJ., dissenting in part) (emphasis omitted), likewise is inapposite \nbecause it does not address the scope of such a stay.  And that \nagencies “routinely” “postpone the effective dates of their own \nrules  * * *  on a nationwide basis” (NY Opp. 37) says nothing \nabout whether courts may order them to do so under Section 705.   \nMoreover,  as  even  the  district  court  correctly  recognized \n(Appl. 24a n.5; id. at 50a n.4), the “standard for a stay” under \nSection  705  “is  the  same  as  the  standard  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction.”  Indeed, as this Court reaffirmed shortly before the \nAPA was enacted, statutory remedies should be construed consistent \nwith “traditions of equity practice.”  Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 \nU.S. 321, 329 (1944).  The Court has even suggested that the All \nWrits Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, confers remedial authority no broader \nthan  would  exist  under  traditional  “principles  of  equity \napplicable”  in  a  case.    Grupo  Mexicano,  527  U.S.  at  326  n.8 \n(citation omitted).  Nothing in Section 705 suggests it is any \nbroader than the capacious All Writs Act.  At a minimum, because \n \n\n14 \ntraditional principles of equity place fundamental limits on the \njudicial  power,  id.  at  318,  respondents’  expansive  reading  of \nSection 705 would raise serious constitutional doubts and so should \nbe rejected on that basis too.  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 \nS. Ct. 830, 842 (2018).3   \n3.  Finally, respondents assert (NY Opp. 38; MTR Opp. 38) \nthat the interest in the uniformity of the immigration laws and \nthe public interest support a nationwide injunction here.  But \nCongress’s  desire  that  the  immigration  laws  be  “enforced \nvigorously and uniformly,” Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986, Pub. L. No. 99-603, § 115, 100 Stat.  3384, is a  policy \ndirective to the Executive Branch -- not a license for courts to \nissue nationwide injunctions that impede development of the law.   \nAnd  it  is  respondents’  position  that  would  undermine  the \npublic interest.  Principles of efficient and effective governance \nsupport  the  vigorous  enforcement  of  the  immigration  laws, \nincluding regulations (such as the Rule here) duly promulgated \nthrough  notice-and-comment  rulemaking.    Two  courts  of  appeals \n                     \n3  Respondents’  reliance  (NY  Opp.  36;  MTR  Opp.  36)  on \nNational Mining Association v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 145 \nF.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998), also is misplaced.  The D.C. Circuit \ndid not grapple with any of the historical limitations on equitable \nremedies,  and  instead  relied  on  a  unique  practical  point \ninapplicable here:  that because venue for suits against federal \nagencies always lies in D.C., even a narrower injunction would as \na practical matter apply nationwide because successive plaintiffs \nwould benefit from the binding precedent.  See id. at 1409-1410. \n \n\n15 \nalready  have  determined  that  the  Rule  likely  is  lawful;  at  a \nminimum, therefore, it is in the public interest to enforce the \nRule in those jurisdictions.  A nationwide injunction prevents \nthat  by  precluding  operation  of  a  Rule  everywhere  if  it  is \nsuccessfully  challenged  anywhere  --  regardless  of  how  many \nunsuccessful challenges there may be.   \nIII. THE REMAINING STAY FACTORS WEIGH IN FAVOR OF A STAY  \nRespondents do not dispute that because of the nationwide \npreliminary injunctions, the government is presently awarding -- \non an effectively irrevocable basis -- grants of lawful permanent \nresident status to aliens who, under the Rule, should instead be \ndeclared  inadmissible.    See  MTR  Opp.  8,  34-35;  Appl.  39-40.  \nInstead, they claim (NY Opp. 16) these effects do not qualify as \nirreparable harm because any inadmissibility determinations made \nunder the Rule would be “of dubious legality.”  That argument thus \ncollapses into respondents’ arguments on the merits.   \nRespondents’ arguments about the “public interest” also are \ninextricably tied to their arguments on the merits.  Respondents \ncontend that the nationwide injunctions should be allowed to remain \nin place, notwithstanding the decisions of the Ninth and Fourth \nCircuits, because otherwise large numbers of aliens will disenroll \nfrom public benefit programs, forgoing billions of dollars’ worth \nof “benefits for which they are eligible.”  MTR Opp. 33-34; ibid. \n(describing these effects as “grave harms”).  But Congress has \n \n\n16 \nexpressly specified that it is the official “immigration policy of \nthe United States that  * * *  aliens within the Nation’s borders \nnot depend on public resources to meet their needs.”  8 U.S.C. \n1601  (emphasis  added).    To  the  extent  that  the  Rule  may \n“discourag[e]  aliens  from  receiving  public  benefits”  because \npursuing such benefits would be inconsistent “with the immigration \nstatus they are seeking,” that is not a valid objection because \n“self-sufficiency  is  the  rule’s ultimate  aim,”  consistent  with \nstatutory purposes.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312-41,313.  See United \nStates v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop., 532 U.S. 483, 497 (2001) \n(“[A]  court  siting  in  equity  cannot  ‘ignore  the  judgment  of \nCongress,  deliberately  expressed  in  legislation.’”)  (citation \nomitted).    And  to  the  extent  that  the  Rule  might  cause \n \ndisenrollment by aliens who are not subject to the Rule, such \ndisenrollment is “unwarranted,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,313, easily \ncorrected, and temporary.  It does not outweigh the long-term harms \nthe government will experience while the Rule is enjoined. \n    Respectfully submitted. \n \n  NOEL J. FRANCISCO \n    Solicitor General \n \n \nJANUARY 2020 \n ",

Reg. 41292 \n(Aug. 14, 2019) (“Rule”). See Mem. Decision and Order, ECF No. 110 (“PI Order”). The Court \nbased its decision on a determination that promulgation of the Rule exceeded DHS’s delegated \nauthority and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The \nCourt also held that there is “at least a colorable argument” that the Rule “may violate the \nRehabilitation Act.” PI Order at 18. On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court stayed this Court’s \ninjunction, necessarily finding both that Plaintiffs are not threatened with irreparable harm by \napplication of the Rule and also that the Defendants are likely to succeed on the merits of the case. \nPreviously, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a detailed opinion concluding that the Rule \nfalls well within the Executive Branch’s discretion to interpret and implement the public charge \ninadmissibility provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”). City and Cty. of San \nFrancisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2019). In light of the Supreme Court’s Stay of \nInjunction, the Ninth Circuit’s detailed ruling, and for the reasons discussed herein, Defendants \nrespectfully submit that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint in full.  \nBACKGROUND \n \n“Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this \ncountry’s earliest immigration statutes.” 8 U.S.C. § 1601(1). “[T]he immigration policy of the \nUnited States [is] that aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet \ntheir needs.” Id. § 1601(2)(A). Rather, aliens must “rely on their own capabilities and the resources \nof their families, their sponsors, and private organizations.” Id. Relatedly, “the availability of \npublic benefits [is] not [to] constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.” Id.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 11 of 53\n§ 1601(2)(B).  \nThese statutorily enumerated policies are effectuated in part through the public charge \nground of inadmissibility in the INA. With certain exceptions, the INA provides that “[a]ny alien \nwho, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of \nthe Attorney General [or the Secretary of Homeland Security] at the time of application for \nadmission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). An unbroken line of predecessor statutes going back to at least 1882 \nhave contained a similar public charge inadmissibility ground, and those statutes have, without \nexception, delegated to the Executive Branch the authority to determine who constitutes a public \ncharge for purposes of that provision. See Immigration Act of 1882, 47th Cong. ch. 376, §§ 1-2, \n22 Stat. 214 (“1882 Act”); 1891 Immigration Act, 51st Cong. ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084 (“1891 Act”); \nImmigration Act of 1907, 59th Cong. ch. 1134, 34 Stat. 898 (“1907 Act”); Immigration Act of \n1917, 64th Cong. ch. 29 § 3, 39 Stat. 874, 876 (“1917 Act”); INA of 1952, 82nd Cong. ch. 477, \nsection 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183. Indeed, in a Report leading up to the enactment of the INA, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee emphasized that because “the elements constituting likelihood of \nbecoming a public charge are varied, there should be no attempt to define the term in the law,” and \nthat the public charge inadmissibility determinations properly “rest[] within the discretion of” the \nExecutive Branch. S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349 (1950). \nIn 1996, Congress enacted immigration and welfare reform statutes that bear on the public \ncharge  inadmissibility  determination.  The  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 1110 Stat. 3009-546 \n(1996) strengthened the enforcement of the public charge inadmissibility ground in several ways. \nFirst, Congress instructed that, in making public charge inadmissibility determinations, “the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 12 of 53\nconsular officer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum consider the alien’s: (1) age; (2) \nhealth; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and financial status; and (5) education and skills,” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B), but otherwise left in place the broad delegation of authority to the \nExecutive Branch to determine who constitutes a public charge.  IIRIRA also raised the standards \nand responsibilities for individuals who must “sponsor” an alien by pledging to provide support to \nmaintain that immigrant at the applicable threshold for the period of enforceability and requiring \nthat sponsors demonstrate the means to maintain an annual income at the applicable threshold. \nContemporaneously, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996 (“PRWORA”), Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (1996), restricted most aliens from \naccessing many public support programs, including Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) and \nnutrition  programs.  PRWORA  also  made  the  sponsorship  requirements  in  IIRIRA  legally \nenforceable against sponsors. \nIn light of the 1996 legislative developments, the legacy Immigration and Naturalization \nService (“INS”) started in 1999 to engage in formal rulemaking to guide immigration officers, \naliens,  and  the  public  in  understanding  public  charge  inadmissibility  and  deportability \ndeterminations. See Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. \n28676 (May 26, 1999) (“1999 NPRM”). No final rule was ever issued, however. Instead, the \nagency adopted the 1999 NPRM interpretation on an interim basis by publishing Field Guidance \non Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28689 (May 26, \n1999)  (“Field  Guidance”).  The  Field  Guidance  dramatically  narrowed  the  public  charge \ninadmissibility ground by defining “public charge” as an alien who is likely to become “primarily \ndependent  on  the  government  for  subsistence,”  and  by  barring  immigration  officers  from \nconsidering any non-cash public benefits, regardless of the value or length of receipt, as part of  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 13 of 53\npublic charge inadmissibility and deportability determinations. See id. at 28689. Under that \nstandard, an alien receiving Medicaid (other than for institutionalization for long-term care), food \nstamps, and public housing, but not cash assistance, would have been treated as no more likely to \nbecome a public charge than an alien who was entirely self-sufficient.  \n  The Rule revises this approach and adopts, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, a \nwell-reasoned definition of public charge providing practical guidance to DHS officials making \npublic charge inadmissibility determinations. DHS began by publishing a Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking, comprising 182 pages of description, evidence, and analysis. See Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51114 (Oct. 10, 2018) (“NPRM”). The NPRM provided a \n60-day public comment period, during which 266,077 comments were received. See Rule at 41297. \nAfter considering these comments, DHS published the Rule, addressing comments, making several \nrevisions to the proposed rule, and providing over 200 pages of analysis in support of its decision. \nAmong the Rule’s major components are provisions defining “public charge” and “public benefit” \n(which are not defined in the statute), an enumeration of factors to be considered in the totality of \nthe circumstances when making a public charge determination, and a requirement that aliens \nseeking an extension of stay or a change of status show that they have not received public support \nin excess of the Rule’s threshold since obtaining nonimmigrant status. The Rule supersedes the \nInterim Field Guidance, establishing a new definition of public charge based on a minimum \ndurational threshold for the receipt of public benefits. Under this “12/36 standard,” a public charge \nis an alien who receives designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \na 36-month period. Id. at 41297. Such “public benefits” are extended by the Rule to include an \nenumerated  list  of  non-cash  benefits:  with  some  exceptions,  an  alien’s  participation  in  the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”), Section 8 Housing Programs, Medicaid, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 14 of 53\nand  Public  Housing  may  now  be  considered  as  part  of  the  public  charge  inadmissibility \ndetermination. Id. at 41501-02. The Rule also provides a non-exclusive list of factors for assessing \nwhether an alien is likely at any time to become a public charge and explains how DHS officers \nshould apply these factors as part of a totality-of-the-circumstances determination.1 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n  The Rule 12(b)(6) standard “require[s] that a complaint support the viability of its claims \nby pleading sufficient nonconclusory factual matter to set forth a claim that is plausible on its \nface.” EEOC v. Port Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 768 F.3d 247, 253 (2nd Cir. 2014) (alteration in original). \n“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “Although a court must accept as true all of the allegations \ncontained in a complaint, that tenet is inapplicable to legal conclusions, and threadbare recitals of \nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements do not suffice.” Harris \nv. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 72 (2nd Cir. 2009) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678).2 \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Have Not Established Standing Or Ripeness \n  As the party invoking  federal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing \nstanding, “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.” \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). “To seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must \nshow that [it] is under threat of suffering ‘injury in fact’ that is concrete and particularized; the \nthreat must be actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly traceable to \n                                                 \n1 A correction to the Rule was published in the Federal Register on October 2, 2019.  See Inadmissibility on Public \nCharge  Grounds;  Correction  (2019),  https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/02/2019-21561/ \ninadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds-correction. \n2 Internal quotation marks are omitted throughout. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 15 of 53\nthe challenged action . . . ; and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or \nredress the injury.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009). The “threatened \ninjury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact”; allegations of “possible future \ninjury do not satisfy . . . Art. III.” Whitmore v. Ark., 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990). Where, as here, \n“the  plaintiff  is  not  [itself]  the  object  of  the  government  action,”  standing  “is  ordinarily \n‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  \n  Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries consist of potential future harms that, if they ever came to pass, \nwould be spurred by decisions of third parties not before the Court. Here, the Rule governs DHS \npersonnel and certain aliens. It “neither require[s] nor forbid[s] any action on the part of” Plaintiffs, \nSummers, 555 U.S. at 493, nor does it expressly interfere with any of their programs applicable to \naliens. To be sure, Plaintiffs allege harms of (i) a theoretical economic impact that might arise \nshould aliens choose to rely more on State and local services; (ii) speculation that a public health \nepisode could occur should noncitizens choose to forgo health services altogether; and (iii) \ninterference with certain administrative programs. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 180, 194, 213 (ECF No. \n17). But none of these alleged harms would be sufficient to confer standing on any State or City \nPlaintiff. \nPlaintiffs’  purported  economic  harms  from  the  possibility  that  certain  aliens  may \nunnecessarily choose to forgo all federal health and housing benefits (thereby resulting in greater \nreliance on state and local benefits) do not establish standing. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 213, 216. As an \ninitial matter, this theory is inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ assertion that immigrants will generally \n“forgo public assistance altogether,” rather than just federal assistance. Compl. ¶ 182; Mem. in \nSupp. of Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 6, ECF No. 35 (“PI Mot.”) (aliens will disenroll from \n“benefits that are beyond the express scope of the Final Rule”). Further, plaintiffs do not have \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 16 of 53\n“standing to sue [in] situations where the chain of causation leading to damages” is “complicated \nby the intervening agency of third parties.” Laborers Local 17 Health & Benefit Fund v. Philip \nMorris, Inc., 191 F.3d 229, 240 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 410, 414 (2013) (courts are “reluctan[t] to endorse standing theories that rest on speculation \nabout the decisions of independent actors”). For any Plaintiff to suffer a net-increase in public \nbenefit expenditures (i) a material number of aliens must unnecessarily choose to forgo all federal \nhealth benefits (a result not required by the Rule); (ii) these aliens must then either apply for, and \nreceive, additional state or local health benefits, or use emergency room services ultimately \nfinanced by the government; and (iii) the increased state or local expenses for these aliens must be \ngreater than the costs they would have incurred for aliens who would have resided in the State, \nand consumed State and local resources, but for the Rule.3 Plaintiffs’ allegation that the Rule may \nharm their economies because fewer aliens may receive and then spend federal funds within their \nterritories is equally speculative. Plaintiffs do not even allege that this speculative injury would \nnoticeably affect their total state economies. \n  In its preliminary injunction order, the Court credited Plaintiffs’ theory that they would \nbear greater health costs due to health epidemics, since “patients [would] avoid preventive care.” \nPI Order, at 8. But like the alleged economic impacts, this allegation is too speculative to support \nstanding—it turns on individual choices by aliens to forgo all federal health benefits and, as a \nresult, contract and spread “communicable diseases,” or otherwise cause a public health crisis. See \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 410 (rejecting “highly attenuated chain” theory of standing).  \nThe Court likewise credited Plaintiffs’ alleged “programmatic costs” from changes to the \n                                                 \n3 This is distinct from New York’s standing theory in Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019). There, \nplaintiff did not rely on an elongated causal chain of independent third-party decisions. The Court noted that plaintiff \nrelied on a single, “predictable” reaction to a new federal policy (lower census response rates) resulting in definitive \ninjuries to the State itself. Id. at 2565-66. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 17 of 53\npublic charge ground of inadmissibility. PI Order, at 8. Bureaucratic inconvenience occasioned by \na change in federal policy, however, is insufficient to confer standing. See, e.g., Crane v. Johnson, \n783 F.3d 244, 253 (5th Cir. 2015) (rejecting government officials’ claim that they have standing \nsince DACA would require that them to “alter their current processes to ensure” compliance).  \n“Constitutional ripeness is a doctrine that, like standing, is a limitation on the power of the \njudiciary” and serves as another prerequisite of justiciability. Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, \nLLC v. Shumlin, 733 F.3d 393, 429 (2d Cir. 2013). Ripeness “prevents courts from declaring the \nmeaning of the law in a vacuum and from constructing generalized legal rules unless the resolution \nof an actual dispute requires it.” Id. Here, the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ claims is that individual \naliens—not the Plaintiffs themselves—may be erroneously determined as “likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge” under the totality of the circumstances test set forth in the Rule. Plaintiffs’ \nclaims therefore present the precise circumstance in which ripeness precludes review: resolving \nquestions about the application of “public charge” in the context of an “actual dispute” over \napplication of that ground of inadmissibility is needed to avoid “constructing generalized legal \nrules” in a “vacuum.” Id.; see 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (providing individuals who have a final order of \nremoval from the United States based on a public charge determination an opportunity to file a \npetition for review before a federal court of appeals to contest the definition of public charge as \napplied to them).  \nPrudential ripeness also counsels against consideration of Plaintiffs’ claims. This doctrine \nis “‘an important exception to the usual rule that where jurisdiction exists a federal court must \nexercise it,’ and allows a court to determine ‘that the case will be better decided later.’” In re MTBE \nProds. Liability Litig., 725 F.3d 65, 110 (2d Cir. 2013). “In determining whether a claim is \nprudentially ripe,” courts examine “whether the claim is fit for judicial resolution” and “whether \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 18 of 53\nand to what extent the parties will endure hardship if decision is withheld.” Id. Fitness is generally \nlacking where the reviewing court “would benefit from further factual development of the issues \npresented.” Ohio Forestry Ass’n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998). Here, Plaintiffs’ claims \nare all premised on hypothesizing about the potential future applications of the Rule to individuals, \nspeculation about the effects of the Rule on individual decision-making, and disagreement with \nDHS’s predictions based on the available evidence. In such a context, “judicial appraisal . . . is \nlikely to stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application” of the Rule, rather \nthan “in a factual vacuum.” Derby & Co, Inc. v. Dep’t of Energy, 524 F. Supp. 398, 408 (S.D.N.Y. \n1981) (internal quotations omitted).  \nIn addition, withholding judicial consideration of Plaintiffs’ claims will not cause them any \nsignificant hardship. With respect to the Plaintiffs bringing this case, the Rule “do[es] not create \nadverse effects of a strictly legal kind, that is, effects of a sort that traditionally would have \nqualified as harm,” and therefore cannot serve as the basis for a ripe claim. Ohio Forestry Ass’n, \n523 U.S. at 733. Instead, the harms alleged are possible cumulative side effects of third party \nindividuals’ decisions to take action not required by the Rule or the Plaintiffs’ own decisions to \nspend money in response to the Rule, so they do not create a ripe facial challenge. \nII.  Plaintiffs Are Outside The Zone of Interests Regulated By The Rule \nPlaintiffs’ claims fail because they are outside the zone of interests served by the limits of \nthe “public charge” inadmissibility provision in § 1182(a)(4)(A) and related sections. The “zone-\nof-interests” requirement limits the plaintiffs who “may invoke [a] cause of action” to enforce a \nparticular statutory provision or its limits. Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., \n572 U.S. 118, 129-30 (2014). Under the APA, a plaintiff falls outside this zone when its “interests \nare . . . marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute.” Clarke v. \nSec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987). This standard applies with equal force where, as here, \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 19 of 53\nPlaintiffs seek to challenge the government’s adherence to statutory provisions in the guise of an \nAPA claim. Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, \n224 (2012). \nPlaintiffs plainly fall outside the zone of interests served by the limits of the meaning of \npublic charge in the inadmissibility statute. At issue in this litigation is whether DHS will deny \nadmission or adjustment of status to certain aliens deemed inadmissible on public charge grounds. \nBy using the term “public charge” rather than a broader term like “non-affluent,” Congress ensured \nthat only certain aliens could be determined inadmissible on the public charge ground. It is aliens \nimproperly determined inadmissible, not States or a city, who “fall within the zone of interests \nprotected” by any limitations implicit in § 1182(a)(4)(A) and § 1183, because they are the \n“reasonable—indeed, predictable—challengers” to DHS’s inadmissibility decisions. Patchak, 567 \nU.S. at 227; see 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (providing individuals who have a final order of removal from \nthe United States based on, inter alia, a public charge determination, an opportunity to file a \npetition for review before a federal court of appeals to contest the charge of removability, including \nthe  definition  of  public  charge  as  applied  to  them).  Plaintiffs’  attenuated,  alleged  harms—\ndownstream economic and health effects—are not even “marginally related” to those of an alien \nseeking to demonstrate that the “public charge” inadmissibility ground has been improperly \napplied to his detriment. Cf. INS v. Legalization Assistance Proj., 510 U.S. 1301, 1304-05 (1993) \n(O’Connor, J., in chambers) (concluding that relevant INA provisions were “clearly meant to \nprotect the interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations [that provide legal \nhelp to immigrants],” and that the fact that a “regulation may affect the way an organization \nallocates its resources . . . does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of \ninterests the statute meant to protect”); Fed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno, 93 F.3d \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 20 of 53\n897, 899 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (dismissing under zone-of-interests test a suit challenging parole of \naliens into this country, where plaintiffs relied on incidental effects of that policy on workers). \nIn  the  preliminary  injunction  order,  the  Court  noted  that  Plaintiffs’  interests  are \n“intertwined” with the interests of aliens who may be subject to the Rule. PI Order at 10. But \nDefendants are aware of no case law suggesting that a party may fall within a statute’s zone-of-\ninterests simply because it has some connection with another party directly impacted by the statute. \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have not identified any injury within the public-charge statute’s zone of \ninterests because their purported interest is fundamentally at odds with the goal of that statute.  The \nclear purpose of the public-charge statute is to protect federal and state governments from having \nto expend taxpayer resources to support aliens admitted to the country or allowed to adjust to \nlawful-permanent-resident status.  The interest plaintiffs seek to further through this lawsuit—\nmore widespread use of taxpayer-funded benefits by aliens—is thus diametrically opposed to the \ninterests Congress sought to further through the public-charge inadmissibility statute. \nIII.  The Court Should Dismiss Count One \nCount One alleges that the Rule violates the APA by exceeding DHS’s statutory authority. \nCompl. ¶¶ 263-71. Plaintiffs advance four theories: (1) the Rule’s “public charge” definition is \ncontrary to the “long-standing” and “well-settled meaning of that term,” id. ¶ 266; (2) the Rule \nimpermissibly considers an applicant’s use of non-cash benefits programs, id. ¶ 267; (3) the Rule’s \n“weighted circumstances test” targets applicants whom Congress never intended to consider public \ncharges, id. ¶ 268; and (4) the Rule would permit DHS to apply the public-charge determination \nto “applicants seeking to adjust nonimmigrant visas and deprive them of a totality of circumstances \ninquiry,” id. ¶ 269. Because none of these theories is sound, Count One does not state a plausible \nclaim for relief and should be dismissed. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 21 of 53\nThe Court’s analysis of Count One is governed by the Chevron framework. See San \nFrancisco, 944 F.3d at 790; accord PI Order at 11. Under Chevron, courts first ask whether the \nstatute is clear. Chevron, U.S.A. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). If so, \n“that is the end of the matter[,] for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the \nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Id. at 842-43. Where there is ambiguity, however, \ncourts defer to the agency’s interpretation so long as it is reasonable. Id. at 843-44. Such deference \n“is premised on the theory that a statute’s ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from \nCongress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps.” FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., \n529 U.S. 120, 159 (2000).  \nRespectfully, the question is not whether the Rule’s current interpretation of “public \ncharge” is novel. Contra PI Order at 13. Rather, the question is whether that interpretation—\nregardless of whether it has previously been adopted—is within the bounds of the statute. See \nF.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“It suffices that the new policy \nis permissible under the statute [for Chevron purposes].”). As explained below, while the Rule \nmay offer a “new definition,” PI Order at 13, that definition nonetheless fits comfortably within \nthe statutory term “public charge” as it has been interpreted over time. \nA.  The Rule’s Definition of “Public Charge” Is Consistent With The Statute \nAs the Ninth Circuit recently held, the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is well within \nthe bounds of the statute. San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799 (“We conclude that DHS’s interpretation \nof ‘public charge’ is a permissible construction of the INA.”).  \nThe Ninth Circuit made four principal observations: (1) that the word “opinion” is classic \n“language of discretion,” under which immigration “officials are given broad leeway”; (2) that \n“public charge” is neither a “term of art” nor “self-defining,” and is thus ambiguous under Chevron \nas “capable of a range of meanings”; (3) that Congress set out five factors for consideration but \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 22 of 53\nexpressly did not limit officials to those factors, which gave officials “considerable discretion”; \nand (4) that Congress granted DHS the power to adopt regulations, by which “Congress intended \nthat DHS would resolve any ambiguities in the INA.”  Id. at 791-92.  \nFollowing these observations and a comprehensive, detailed account of the history of the \n“public charge” provision, id. at 792-97, the Ninth Circuit had little trouble concluding either that \n“the phrase ‘public charge’ is ambiguous,” id. at 798, or that “DHS’s interpretation of ‘public \ncharge’ is a permissible construction of the INA,” id. at 799.  The same result should follow here. \n1.  The  Rule’s  Definition  of  “Public  Charge”  Is  Consistent  With  The  INA, \nAdministrative Interpretations, And U.S. Immigration Policy  \nRelated provisions of the INA illustrate that the receipt of public benefits, including non-\ncash benefits, is relevant to the determination of whether an alien is likely at any time to become \na public charge.  Congress expressly instructed that, when making a public charge inadmissibility \ndetermination, DHS “shall not consider any benefits the alien may have received,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(s), including various noncash benefits, if the alien “has been battered or subjected to \nextreme cruelty in the United States by [specified persons],” id. § 1641(c); see also id. §§ 1611-\n1613 (specifying the public benefits for which battered aliens and other qualified aliens are \neligible).  The inclusion of that provision prohibiting the consideration of a battered alien’s receipt \nof public benefits presupposes that DHS will ordinarily consider the past receipt of benefits in \nmaking public charge inadmissibility determinations.  Cf. Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 \nS. Ct. 1833, 1844 (2018) (“There is no reason to create an exception to a prohibition unless the \nprohibition would otherwise forbid what the exception allows.”). \nIn addition, Congress mandated that many aliens seeking admission or adjustment of status \nsubmit  affidavits  of  support  executed  by  sponsors  to  avoid  a  public charge  inadmissibility \ndetermination.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(C) (requiring most family-sponsored immigrants to \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 23 of 53\nsubmit enforceable affidavits of support); § 1182(a)(4)(D) (same for certain employment-based \nimmigrants), § 1183a (affidavit-of-support requirements).  Aliens who fail to submit a required \naffidavit of support are inadmissible on the public charge ground by operation of law, regardless \nof their individual circumstances. Id. § 1182(a)(4). Congress further specified that the sponsor \nmust agree “to maintain the sponsored alien at an annual income that is not less than 125 percent \nof the Federal poverty line,” id. § 1183a(a)(1)(A), and it granted federal and state governments the \nright to seek reimbursement from the sponsor for “any means-tested public benefit” that the \ngovernment provides to the alien during the period of enforceability, id. § 1183a(b)(1)(A); see also \nid. § 1183a(a) (affidavits of support are legally binding and enforceable contracts “against the \nsponsor by the sponsored alien, the Federal Government, any State (or any political subdivision of \nsuch State), or by any other entity that provides any means-tested public benefit”).   \nThe  import  of  the  affidavit-of-support  provision  is  clear:  To  avoid  being  found \ninadmissible on the public charge ground, an alien governed by the provision must submit an \naffidavit of support executed by a sponsor—generally the individual who filed the immigrant visa \npetition on the alien’s behalf—who has agreed to reimburse the government for any means-tested \npublic benefits the alien receives while the sponsorship obligation is in effect, even if the alien \nreceives those benefits only briefly and only in minimal amounts.  Congress thus provided that the \nmere possibility that an alien might obtain unreimbursed, means-tested public benefits in the future \nwas sufficient to render that alien inadmissible on the public charge ground, regardless of the \nalien’s other circumstances. \nMoreover, since at least 1948, the Executive Branch has taken the authoritative position \nthat an alien may qualify as a “public charge” for deportability purposes if the alien or the alien’s \nsponsor or relative fails to repay a public benefit upon a demand for repayment by a government \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 24 of 53\nagency entitled to repayment. See Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323, 326 (BIA 1948), aff’d, id. at \n337 (A.G. 1948). Under that rubric, an alien can be subject to deportation on the public charge \nground based on a failure to repay upon demand, regardless of whether the alien was “primarily \ndependent” on the benefits at issue. See id. Indeed, although the Attorney General and Board of \nImmigration Appeals concluded that the alien in Matter of B- was not deportable as a public charge \nbecause Illinois law did not allow the State to demand repayment for the care she received during \nher stay in a state mental hospital, the opinion makes clear that the alien would have been \ndeportable as a public charge if her relatives had failed to pay the cost of the alien’s “clothing, \ntransportation, and other incidental expenses,” because Illinois law made the alien “legally liable” \nfor those incidental expenses. Id. at 327. That was so even though Illinois was not entitled to \nrecover the sums expended for plaintiff’s lodging, healthcare, and food. See id. \nFinally, the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is entirely consistent with Congress’s \ncodified statements of U.S. immigration policy. In its prior analysis of “Congress’s Intent,” PI \nOrder at 13-14, the Court focused on certain failed legislative initiatives in 1996 and 2013. “Failed \nlegislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a \nprior statute,” because “[a] bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected \nfor just as many others.” Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 531 \nU.S. 159, 160, 170 (2001). As a result, “several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from \nsuch inaction.” Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990). \nThat is particularly true here. There is no indication that Congress believed the proposed \ndefinitions were fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory term “public charge.” Congress did \nnot “discard[]” the proposed definitions of public charge “in favor of other language” eventually \nenacted. INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 443 (1987). It did not adopt an alternate definition \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 25 of 53\nin the 1996 legislation, which left the term undefined, and it enacted no legislation on the subject \nin 2013. See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 798 (“[T]he failure of Congress to compel DHS to adopt \na particular rule is not the logical equivalent of forbidding DHS from adopting that rule.”). In \naddition, the legislative history of the 1996 proposal indicates that the proposal was dropped at the \nlast minute because the President objected to the proposal’s rigid definition of “public charge,” as \nwell as other provisions, and threatened to veto the bill unless changes were made. See H.R. Rep. \nNo. 104-828, at 241; 142 Cong. Rec. S11872, S11881-82 (Sept. 30, 1996). Far from suggesting \nthat Congress attributed an unambiguous meaning to the still-undefined term “public charge,” \nthese circumstances suggest that Congress acceded to the President’s demands that the Executive \nBranch retain the discretion to define the term. See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 798 n.15 (“If \nanything, this legislative history proves only that Congress decided not to constrain the discretion \nof agencies in determining who is a public charge.”).  \nThe circumstances surrounding the 2013 proposal’s failure similarly do not support the \ninference that Congress would have viewed the Rule as an impermissible construction of the \npublic-charge inadmissibility provision. The 2013 proposal was rejected by a Senate committee, \nS. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013), but Congress then failed to enact the bill the committee agreed \non. The question of what significance to assign to a rejected committee proposal that formed a part \nof a bill subsequently rejected by the full Congress underscores the problems inherent in relying \non unenacted legislation.  \nFinally, both the 1996 and 2013 proposals were significantly broader than the Rule: the \n1996 proposal covered a similar amount of benefits usage within a period of seven years rather \nthan three, see H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 138, 240-41, and the 2013 proposal included receipt of \nany amount of public benefits, S. Rep. No. 113- 40, at 42, 63. Even if Congress’s failure to codify \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 26 of 53\nthose stricter standards were evidence of its understanding of the term “public charge” (which it is \nnot), they would not support the conclusion that Congress rejected the Rule’s narrower definition. \nThe Court’s preliminary injunction order focused on failed legislation, but did not address \nthe legislation that did pass. PI Order at 13-14. In PRWORA, for example, Congress reiterated our \n“national policy with respect to welfare and immigration.” 8 U.S.C. § 1601. In relevant part, \nPRWORA provides: “Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law \nsince this country’s earliest immigration statutes.” Id. § 1601(1). As a result, “[i]t continues to be \nthe immigration policy of the United States that . . . aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend \non public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources \nof their families, their sponsors, and private organizations.” Id. §§ 1601(2)-1601(2)(A). As the \nNinth Circuit had no trouble concluding, “[r]eceipt of non-cash public assistance is surely relevant \nto ‘self-sufficiency’ and whether immigrants are ‘depend[ing] on public resources to meet their \nneeds.’” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1601(1)–(2)). \n2.  Early Definitions Support the Rule’s Definition of “Public Charge” \nThe Rule’s definition of “public charge” is also consistent with its historical statutory \nmeaning. The term has always been understood as one that the Executive Branch could, in its \ndiscretion, interpret to encompass individuals partially or temporarily dependent on public support.  \nIndeed, there is longstanding evidence that the term “[p]ublic charge means any maintenance, or \nfinancial assistance, rendered from public funds.” Arthur Cook et al., Immigration Laws of the \nU.S., § 285 (1929); see also 26 Cong. Rec. 657 (1894) (statement of Rep. Warner) (explaining that \nunder the public charge inadmissibility ground, “[i]t will not do for [an alien] [to] earn half his \nliving or three-quarters of it, but that he shall presumably earn all his living . . . [to] not start out \nwith the prospect of being a public charge”). When Congress originally enacted the public charge \nground of inadmissibility, the term “pauper,” not “public charge,” was in common use for a person \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 27 of 53\nso impoverished they would be expected to be permanently dependent on public support. See, e.g., \nCentury Dictionary & Cyclopedia (1911) (defining “pauper” as “[a] very poor person; a person \nentirely destitute”); see also Overseers of Princeton Twp. v. Overseers of S. Brunswick Twp., 23 \nN.J.L. 169, 172 (N.J. 1851) (treating “a pauper” and “a person likely to become chargeable” as \ntwo separate classes).  \nAn 1828 dictionary defined “charge” as “[t]hat which is enjoined, committed, entrusted or \ndelivered to another, implying care, custody, oversight, or duty to be performed by the person \nentrusted,” or a “person or thing committed to anothers [sic] custody, care or management.” San \nFrancisco,  944  F.3d  at  793  (citing  “Charge,”  Webster’s  Dictionary  (1828  Online  Edition), \nhttp://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/charge). Another contemporary dictionary defined \n“charge” as “an obligation or liability.” Id. (citing Stewart Rapaljb & Robert L. Lawrence, \nDictionary of American and English Law, With Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon \nand Civil Laws 196 (Frederick D. Linn & Co. 1888)). \nThis definition was also reflected in contemporary judicial opinions. See generally San \nFrancisco, 944 F.3d at 793 (citing In re Day, 27 F. 678, 681 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1886) (defining a \n“public charge” as a person who “can neither take care of themselves, nor are under the charge or \nprotection of any other person”); State v. The S.S. “Constitution”, 42 Cal. 578, 584–85 (1872) \n(noting that those who are “liable to become a public charge” are “paupers, vagabonds, and \ncriminals, or sick, diseased, infirm, and disabled persons”); City of Alton v. Madison Cty., 21 Ill. \n115, 117 (1859) (noting that a person is not a “public charge” if the person has “ample means” of \nsupport)). And it is reflected in more recent sources: both the 1933 and 1951 editions of Black’s \nLaw Dictionary defined the term “public charge,” “[a]s used in” the 1917 Immigration Act, to \nmean simply “one who produces a money charge upon, or an expense to, the public for support \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 28 of 53\nand care”—without reference to amount. Public Charge, Black’s Law Dictionary (3d ed. 1933); \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951).  \n3.  Gegiow v. Uhl and the Immigration Act of 1917 \nThe original, broad meaning of “public charge” was not refuted or narrowed by the \nSupreme Court’s decision in Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 (1915), on which Plaintiffs rely for the \nproposition that the Supreme Court understood “public charge” in 1915 to mean “individuals who \ndepend completely or nearly completely on government support.” Compl. ¶ 28. Gegiow neither \ndefined “public charge” nor foreclosed Defendants’ interpretation of that term. At most, the case \nsuggests  that  public  charge  inadmissibility  determinations  be  based  on  an  alien’s  personal \ncharacteristics—which is precisely the approach the Rule employs, see Rule at 41501 (mandating \nthat individual public-charge inadmissibility determinations must be “based on the totality of the \nalien’s [individual] circumstances”).  \nIn Gegiow, an immigration official found a group of aliens likely to become public charges, \nand thus denied them entry, solely because the city to which they were headed (Portland, Oregon) \nhad few jobs available. 239 U.S. at 8-9. Thus, “[t]he single question” in the case was “whether an \nalien [could] be declared likely to become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in \nthe city of his immediate destination is overstocked.” Id. at 9-10. The Supreme Court held that \nsuch a finding was improper for two reasons, neither relevant here.  \nThe first was that, in the 1907 Immigration Act, the phrase “public charge” appeared within \na list that included “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “idiots,” id. at 10. The Court observed \nthat the other “persons enumerated” in the list were “to be excluded on the ground of permanent \npersonal objections.” Id. And thus it noted that “[p]resumably” the phrase “public charge” was “to \nbe read as generically similar to the others.” Id. But the close association of “public charge” with \n“paupers” and “professional beggars” was a feature peculiar to the 1907 Immigration Act, as \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 29 of 53\namended in 1910, not seen in statutes before or since, and which would later be undone expressly \nto overcome the Gegiow Court’s misunderstanding of the term. \nThe Supreme Court’s other ground for decision is likewise irrelevant here: the Court \nthought that “[i]t would be an amazing claim of power if commissioners decided not to admit \naliens because the labor market of the United States was overstocked.” Id. at 10. Thus, when the \nCourt referred to reliance on “permanent personal objections,” it was contrasting an approach \ncentered on the alien’s own circumstances with an approach centered on general labor conditions. \nIt would be implausible to attribute to that language, in that context, a holding that an individual \nalien who will rely on public resources for a significant period, but not necessarily indefinitely, \nmay not be excluded as a public charge. Indeed, even the 1999 Guidance, which Plaintiffs seek to \nreinstate, did not reflect that meaning of the term.  \nEven if Gegiow had given the term “public charge” Plaintiffs’ preferred definition, which \nit did not, that definition was fleeting at best. Shortly after the Gegiow decision, the Secretary of \nLabor sent a letter to Congress, requesting that the statute be amended to supersede the Supreme \nCourt’s ruling. See Letter from Sec. of Labor to House Comm. on Immig. and Naturalization, H.R. \nDoc. No. 64-886, at 3 (Mar. 11, 1916); NPRM at 51125. The Secretary defined “public charge” in \naccordance with its meaning at the time: as “a charge (an economic burden) upon the community” \nin which an alien intends to reside. The Secretary then explained that the Court’s opinion in \nGegiow had highlighted a never-before recognized “defect in . . . the arrangement of the wording,” \nwhich, if left uncorrected, would “materially reduce[] the effect of the clause” in protecting the \npublic fisc. \nCongress agreed. The next year, it amended the Immigration Act to move the public-charge \nground of inadmissibility toward the end of the list of exclusions, see 1917 Act § 3, so that the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 30 of 53\nGegiow Court’s mistaken inference about the phrase’s placement in the list would be dispelled. \nThat was how a Senate Report described the amendment: “The purpose of this change is to \novercome recent decisions of the courts limiting the meaning of the description of the excluded \nclass. . . . (See especially Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S., 3.).” S. Rep. No. 64-352, at 5 (1916); see also \nH.R. Doc. No. 64-886, at 3-4 (1916); 1917 Act § 3 n.5; as reprinted in Immigration Laws and \nRules of January 1, 1930 with Amendments from January 1, 1930 to May 24, 1934 (1935) \n(explaining that “[t]his clause . . . has been shifted . . . to indicate the intention of Congress that \naliens shall be excluded upon said ground for economic as well as other reasons” and “overcoming \nthe decision of the Supreme Court in Gegiow”).  \nCourts subsequently recognized that the term “public charge” is “not associated with \npaupers or professional beggars.” Ex Parte Horn, 292 F. 455, 457 (W.D. Wash. 1923) (explaining \nthat “public charge” in the 1917 Act “is differentiated from the application in Gegiow”); see also \nUnited States ex rel. Iorio v. Day, 34 F.2d 920, 922 (2d Cir. 1929) (L. Hand, J.) (explaining that \nin the wake of the 1917 Immigration Act, the public-charge statute “is certainly now intended to \ncover cases like Gegiow”); Arthur Cook, Immigration Laws, §§ 128-34. But see Ex Parte Mitchell, \n256 F. 229, 232 (N.D.N.Y. 1919) (declining to give effect to relocation of “public charge” within \nthe 1917 Act). \n*  *  * \nDefendants easily clear the hurdle of Chevron step one.  Congress has never defined \n“public charge,” let alone foreclosed the interpretation adopted in the Rule. Instead, Congress has \nrepeatedly and intentionally left the definition and application of the term to the discretion of the \nExecutive Branch.  See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 796-97 (finding that “‘public charge’ does not \nhave a fixed, unambiguous meaning” and that “[i]t is apparent that Congress left DHS and other \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 31 of 53\nagencies enforcing our immigration laws the flexibility to adapt the definition of ‘public charge’ \nas necessary”). Here, the Rule gives the statute its most natural meaning by specifying that an alien \nwho depends on public assistance for necessities such as food and shelter for extended periods \nmay qualify as a public charge even if that assistance is not provided through cash benefits or does \nnot provide the alien’s sole or primary means of support.  \nDefendants also prevail at Chevron step two, at which the Court “ask[s] whether the \nagency’s interpretation of the statute is reasonable.” PI Order. at 11. The Ninth Circuit held that \nthe Rule “easily satisfies this test.”  San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799. Because the Rule adopts a \nreasonable interpretation of the statutory provision, Plaintiffs cannot succeed on their theory that \nthe Rule’s definition of “public charge” exceeds DHS’s statutory authority. \nB.  The Weighted-Circumstances Test Is Also Consistent With the Statute \nThe ostensibly separate ground for finding the Rule contrary to law is, in reality, a \nreformulation of the preceding argument. Plaintiffs’ allegation, at bottom, is that the weighted-\ncircumstances test sweeps in persons who are not “likely to become permanently and primarily \ndependent on the government for support.” Compl. ¶ 157-59.4 But of course, that is Plaintiffs’ \ndefinition of “public charge.” And as detailed at length above, that has never been the statutory \ndefinition. More importantly, the Rule’s broader definition of “public charge,” to include those \nwho are not permanently and primarily dependent on the government, is within the bounds of the \nstatute. Because this theory is premised entirely on Plaintiffs’ preferred definition of “public \ncharge,” which has been rebutted above, it should be rejected for the same reasons. \nC.  The Public Charge Statute Does Not Require That Government Benefits Be \nPaid In Cash \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs separately allege that the weighted-circumstances test is discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious. Those \nallegations are addressed elsewhere. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 32 of 53\nPlaintiffs further allege in Count One that the Rule impermissibly mandates consideration \nof non-cash benefits programs. Compl. ¶ 267. This theory, too, fails to state a plausible claim. \nThe Ninth Circuit had no difficulty disposing of this same question: “We see no statutory \nbasis from which a court could conclude that the addition of certain categories of in-kind benefits \nmakes DHS’s interpretation untenable.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799. That court emphasized \nthat PRWORA set forth a “national policy with respect to welfare and immigration,” which policy \nincludes in pertinent part: “Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration \nlaw since this country’s earliest immigration statutes.”  Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. §§ 1601, 1601(1)). \n“PRWORA thus lends support to DHS’s interpretation of the INA,” which “is a permissible \nconstruction of the INA.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799. This Court should agree. \nNothing in the meaning of “public charge” suggests a distinction between non-cash \nbenefits and services and “cash assistance,” as Plaintiffs allege. Compare Compl. ¶ 129 (“As the \nrelevant statutory language, history, case law, and long-standing agency practice demonstrate, \nCongress never intended that an immigrant’s lawful receipt of non-cash supplemental benefits be \nused to render a public charge determination.”); with San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799 (“We see no \nstatutory basis from which a court could conclude that the addition of certain categories of in-kind \nbenefits makes DHS’s interpretation untenable.”). Both types of assistance create an obligation on \nthe part of the public, and both equally relieve recipients from the conditions of poverty. And, as \ndiscussed above, Congress’s instruction that DHS not consider benefits received by a battered alien \nindicates that Congress expected DHS to consider past receipt of benefits, including noncash \nbenefits, in other circumstances.  See Section III(A)(1) supra. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 33 of 53\nD.  DHS’s  Interpretation  Is  Reinforced  By  Congress’s  Unequivocal, \nLongstanding Delegation Of Authority To The Executive Branch \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Rule’s  definition  of  “public  charge,”  including  the \napplication of a weighted-circumstances test and consideration of non-cash benefits, is well within \nthe statute’s ambit. But the Court’s analysis is made easier by the undisputed, expressed, and \nconsistent delegation of authority by Congress to the Executive in this sphere. Indeed, this was the \nNinth Circuit’s foremost conclusion when examining the statute.  See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at \n791 (“First, the determination is entrusted to the ‘opinion’ of the consular or immigration officer. \nThat is the language of discretion, and the officials are given broad leeway.”) (footnote omitted). \nThe Ninth Circuit also relied on the fact that “Congress granted DHS the power to adopt \nregulations to enforce the provisions of the INA,” and thereby “intended that DHS would resolve \nany ambiguities in the INA.” Id. at 792 (citing Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. \n2117, 2125 (2016)). \nThe  Ninth  Circuit  was  right.  The  statutory  term  “public  charge”  has  “never  been \n[explicitly] defined by Congress in the over 100 years since the public charge inadmissibility \nground first appeared in the immigration laws.” Rule at 41308. Congress implicitly delegates \ninterpretive authority to the Executive Branch when it omits definitions of key statutory terms, \nthereby “commit[ting] their definition in the first instance to” the agency, INS v. Jong Ha Wang, \n450 U.S. 139, 144 (1981), to be exercised within the reasonable limits of the meaning of the \nstatutory term, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844. Congress has long recognized this implicit delegation of \nauthority to interpret the meaning of “public charge.” See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349 (1950) \n(stating that because “there is no definition of the term [public charge] in the statutes, its meaning \nhas been left to the interpretation of the administrative officials and the courts”). This delegation \nis reinforced by Congress’s directive that the determination be made “in the opinion of the \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 34 of 53\nAttorney General [or Secretary of Homeland Security]” or a “consular officer.” 8 U.S.C. § \n1182(a)(4)(A). The expansive delegation of authority by Congress grants DHS wide latitude to \ninterpret “public charge” within the reasonable limits set by the broad meaning of the term itself. \nThis delegation is reinforced by the explicit overall delegation of authority by Congress to \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to “establish such regulations . . . as he deems necessary for \ncarrying out” the INA. San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 782 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1) & (a)(3)). \nCongress has also provided the Secretary with specific responsibility to carry out the INA and to \nmake public charge inadmissibility decisions, as spelled out in detail in the NPRM and Rule. See \nNPRM at 51124; Rule at 41295. \nCongress’s comprehensive delegation of interpretive authority has been recognized in \nprecedent dating back to the early public charge statutes. See, e.g., Ex Parte Pugliese, 209 F. 720, \n720 (W.D.N.Y. 1913) (affirming the Secretary of Labor’s authority “to determine [the] validity, \nweight, and sufficiency” of evidence going to whether an individual was “likely to become a public \ncharge”); Wallis v. U.S. ex rel. Mannara, 273 F. 509, 510 (2d Cir. 1921) (deference required even \nif “evidence to the contrary [is] very strong”). It is also recognized in Executive Branch practice. \nAdministrative decisions have explained that Congress’s broad delegation of authority in this area \nwas necessary because “the elements constituting likelihood of becoming a public charge are \nvaried.” Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 588-90 (INS Reg’l Comm’r 1974) (quoting \nS. Rep. No. 81-1515 at 349 (1950) (holding that alien’s receipt of “old age assistance benefits” in \nCalifornia was sufficient to render the alien a “public charge”)); see also Matter of Vindman, 16 I. \n& N. Dec. 131, 132 (INS Reg’l Comm’r 1977) (citing regulations in the visa context, and \nexplaining that the “elements constituting likelihood of an alien becoming a public charge are \nvaried . . . [and] are determined administratively”).  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 35 of 53\nThe long history of congressional delegation of definitional authority over the meaning of \n“public charge” demonstrates the error in Plaintiffs’ claim that Congress has “repeatedly rejected \nefforts to expand public charge.” Compl. ¶¶ 37-42. That history cuts in precisely the opposite \ndirection. By its inaction, Congress left the definition of “public charge” to the Executive Branch. \nSee San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 797 (“If this legislative history is probative of anything, it is \nprobative only of the fact that Congress chose not to codify a particular interpretation of ‘public \ncharge.’”). In no event could this inaction be read as a withdrawal of the longstanding delegation \nto the Executive Branch to exercise definitional authority over the “varied” elements of the \nmeaning of “public charge.” S. Rep. No. 81-1515, at 349; see also San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 798 \n(“And no change to § [1182] means that consular officers, the Attorney General, and DHS retain \nall the discretion granted them in the INA.”). Certainly the INS, when it adopted the 1999 Field \nGuidance and proposed to issue a sweeping new definition of “public charge” through notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking in 1999, did not understand Congress’s 1996 action to have altered the statute \nby withdrawing the long-understood delegation. See 1999 NPRM at 28677 (“[T]he proposed rule \nprovides a definition for the ambiguous statutory term ‘public charge.’”). \nAt a minimum, the likelihood that Congress intended to preserve the delegation means that, \nunder  the  circumstances,  “[c]ongressional  inaction  lacks  persuasive  significance”  because \ncompeting “inferences may be drawn from such inaction.” Competitive Enter. Inst. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Transp., 863 F.3d 911, 917 (D.C. Cir. 2017). And the more plausible of the competing inferences \nis that Congress intended for DHS to retain the authority delegated to it to analyze the “totality of \nthe alien’s circumstances” to make “a prediction” about the likelihood that an alien will become a \npublic charge, Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974), including the delegated \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 36 of 53\nauthority for DHS to adopt further procedures to guide its officers, aliens, and the public at large \nin understanding the application of the public charge ground of inadmissibility. \nE.  DHS  Has  Statutory  Authority  to  Impose  Public-Benefits  Conditions  on \nApplications by Nonimmigrants for Extensions or Status Changes \nPlaintiffs’ final contrary-to-law theory also fails. See Compl. ¶ 269 (“The Final Rule further \nexceeds Defendants’ statutory authority because the Final Rule would permit Defendants to apply \nthe public charge determination to applicants seeking to adjust nonimmigrant visas and deprive \nthem of a totality of circumstances inquiry.”); id. ¶¶ 133-37. \nFirst, DHS is not imposing a public-charge determination on nonimmigrants who seek to \nextend their visas or change their statuses. See generally Rule at 41329. Rather, DHS is setting a \nnew  condition  for  approval  of  extension-of-stay  and  change-of-status  applications  by \nnonimmigrants. Although that condition requires such an applicant to establish that he has not \nreceived more than 12 months of public benefits in a 36-month period since obtaining his \nnonimmigrant status, that is manifestly not a public-charge determination—which only applies to \nimmigrants and which imposes other statutory considerations. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).5 In fact, \nDHS removed a prospective element of the public-benefits condition specifically because such an \nelement “might have been similar to a public charge inadmissibility assessment.” Rule at 41329. \nAt bottom, the Rule imposes a condition of approval, not a public-charge determination, on \nnonimmigrant visa holders. \n  Second, DHS has ample statutory authority to impose such conditions. See Rule at 41329 \n(citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1184, 1258). DHS governs by regulation “[t]he admission to the United States \nof any alien as a nonimmigrant.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(a)(1). But DHS’s role does not end upon the \n                                                 \n5 Ironically, if DHS acceded to Plaintiffs’ demand that requests by nonimmigrants be examined under a “totality of \nthe circumstances,” Compl. ¶¶ 135-36, that would more closely resemble the very public-charge-inadmissibility \nanalysis that they say is forbidden. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 37 of 53\nnonimmigrant’s  admission;  DHS  also  governs  how  long,  and  under  what  conditions,  the \nnonimmigrant can stay, id., or change nonimmigrant statuses, id. § 1258.6 And because it is \nnational policy “that aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet \ntheir needs,” id. § 1601(2)(A) (emphasis added), it is reasonable and consistent with the statute \nthat DHS require, as a condition of obtaining an extension of stay or change of status, evidence \nthat nonimmigrants inside the United States have remained self-sufficient during their stay. \n* * * \n  Because all four theories on which Plaintiffs allege that the Rule is contrary to law are \nbaseless, Count One should be dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim. \nIV.  The Court Should Dismiss Count Two \nCount Two alleges that the Rule is contrary to law under the APA. For the reasons stated \nbelow, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for which relief may be granted as to violation of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, PRWORA, and the Supplemental Nutrition Aid Program (“SNAP”), \nand each claim should be dismissed.  \nA.  The Rehabilitation Act \nPlaintiffs contend that the Final Rule “conflicts with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nwhich provides that no individual with a disability ‘shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, \nbe  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the  benefits  of,  or  otherwise  be  subjected  to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity[.]’” Compl. ¶ 274. In its PI Order, the Court held that \nPlaintiffs raised “at least a colorable argument that the Rule as to be applied may violate the \nRehabilitation Act,” because the Rule “clearly considers disability a negative factor in the public \n                                                 \n6 If a nonimmigrant is eligible and applies for legal permanent residency, then the public-charge inadmissibility \ndetermination would apply under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4). This again illustrates the difference between the public-\nbenefits condition imposed on changes among nonimmigrant statuses under 8 U.S.C. § 1258 and a true public-\ncharge determination under § 1182(a)(4). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 38 of 53\ncharge assessment,” and “do[es] not explain how disability alone is itself a negative factor \nindicative of being more likely to be a public charge.” PI Order at 18. Critically, however, the \nrequirement of § 504 is premised on the denial of services or discrimination “solely by reason of . \n. . disability.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (emphasis added). The fact that disability may constitute one \nfactor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances does not run afoul of § 504. Both the \nNinth Circuit and the Northern District of California rejected this same Rehabilitation Act \nargument in their decisions concerning preliminary injunction of the Final Rule. San Francisco, \n944 F.3d at 799-800 (reversing the Eastern District of Washington’s holding that the Final Rule \nwas inconsistent with the Rehabilitation Act); City & Cty. of San Francisco v. USCIS, Case No. \n19-4717, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177379, at *111-12 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2019) (reversed in part \non other grounds by San Francisco, 944 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2019)). \nBoth of these courts concluded that the plaintiffs in those cases had no likelihood of success \non the merits of their Rehabilitation Act claims because: (1) the INA specifically directs federal \nimmigration  authorities  to  consider  “health”  in  making  public  charge  determinations.  San \nFrancisco, 944 F.3d at 800; San Francisco, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177379 at *111-12; and (2) \ndisability cannot be the sole reason for a denial of adjustment of status under the Rule’s totality of \nthe circumstances test. For the same reasons, Plaintiffs’ claim based on the Rehabilitation Act fails.  \nFirst, the INA explicitly lists “health” as a factor that an officer “shall . . . consider” in \nmaking a public charge determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). “Health” certainly includes an \nalien’s medical conditions, and it is therefore Congress, not the Rule, that requires DHS to take \nthis factor into account. See, e.g., In Re: Application for Temporary Resident Status, 2009 WL \n4983092, at *5 (USCIS AAO Sept. 14, 2009) (considered application for disability benefits in \npublic charge inquiry). A specific, later statutory command, such as the INA’s, supersedes section \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 39 of 53\n504’s general proscription to the extent the two are in conflict, which they are not. See San \nFrancisco, 944 F.3d at 800. \n  Second, the Rule is fully consistent with § 504. Plaintiffs’ complaint does not even allege \nthat disability can be the sole reason for denial of adjustment of status under the Rule. Even if they \nhad made that claim, however, it is clear on the face of the Rule that the Rule does not deny any \nalien admission into the United States, or adjustment of status, “solely by reason of” disability. \nSan Francisco, 944 F.3d at 800. All covered aliens, disabled or not, are subject to the same inquiry: \nwhether they are likely to use one or more covered federal benefits for the specified period of time. \nAlthough an alien’s medical condition is one factor (among many) that may be considered, it \ncannot be dispositive, and is relevant only to the extent that an alien’s particular medical condition \ntends to show that he is “more likely than not to become a public charge” at any time. Rule at \n41368; see also San Francisco, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177379 at *111. Further, any weight \nassigned to this factor may be counterbalanced by other factors, including “[an] affidavit of \nsupport,” “employ[ment],” “income, assets, and resources,” and “private health insurance.” Id. \nThus, any public charge determination cannot be based “solely” on an applicant’s disability.   \nB.  SNAP \nPlaintiffs also fail to state a claim that the Rule violates the SNAP statute because the Rule \ndoes not consider SNAP benefits as “income or resources.” 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). Section 2017(b) \nprovides that: \nThe value of benefits that may be provided under [SNAP] shall not be considered \nincome or resources for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local laws, \nincluding,  but  not  limited  to,  laws  relating  to  taxation,  welfare,  and  public \nassistance programs, and no participating State or political subdivision thereof shall \ndecrease any assistance otherwise provided an individual or individuals because of \nthe receipt of benefits under this chapter. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 40 of 53\n7 U.S.C. § 2017(b) (emphasis added). The context of this full version, rather than the abbreviated \nquotation relied on by Plaintiffs, reveals the error in Plaintiffs’ argument. The Rule does not \nconsider the “value” of SNAP benefits as “income or resources,” only the fact of receipt. Indeed, \nthe Rule specifically prohibits including the amount of SNAP benefits received in the computation \nof income or assets. See Rule at 41375 (“The rule explicitly excludes the value of public benefits \nincluding SNAP from the evidence of income to be considered” and “[a]ssets and resources do not \ninclude SNAP benefits”). Nothing in § 2017(b) precludes consideration of the fact of receipt of \nSNAP benefits by other statutes or regulations. See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. § 54.409 (providing eligibility \nfor consumer telephone or Internet subsidies based on fact of receipt of SNAP benefits). Therefore, \nthe Rule does not violate § 2017(b) and Plaintiffs cannot state a claim. \nC.  PRWORA \nPlaintiffs also contend that the Rule “conflicts with Welfare Reform Act, which provides \nthat ‘a State is authorized to determine the eligibility of an alien . . . for any designated Federal \nprogram.’ 8 U.S.C. § 1612(b)(1).” Compl. ¶ 276. However, the Rule’s consideration of receipt of \npublic benefits, as defined by the Rule, does not limit or prohibit aliens’ entitlement to such \nbenefits  or  alter  states’  authority  to  determine  aliens’  eligibility.  Rather,  the  Rule  directs \nimmigration authorities to consider whether aliens have used such benefits as part of the totality-\nof-the-circumstances analysis required by 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B). See Rule at 41365-66. \nAlthough individual aliens may choose, for a variety of reasons related or unrelated to the Rule, \nnot to access certain benefits to which they are entitled, the Rule does nothing to alter the nature \nor extent of that entitlement or States’ authority to administer those programs, and there is therefore \nno conflict between the Rule and PRWORA. Because there is no set of facts under which the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 41 of 53\nRule’s post hoc consideration of the use of benefits can actually change any qualified alien’s7 legal \nentitlement to access those benefits or States’ authority related to them, Plaintiffs cannot state a \nclaim that the Rule is contrary to PWRORA.  \nV.  The Court Should Dismiss Count Three \nCount Three of Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the APA for various reasons. See Compl. ¶¶ 279-89. Count Three should be dismissed \nbecause none of the theories alleged in the Complaint plausibly suggest the Rule is arbitrary or \ncapricious.   \nA.  The Rule Meets The Standards Required For An Agency To Change Its \nPosition Through Notice-and-Comment Rulemaking \nPlaintiffs allege that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS “failed to reasonably \njustify their departure” from past practice regarding the definition of “public charge.” Compl. ¶ \n282. But the “fact that DHS has changed policy does not substantially alter the burden in the \nchallengers’ favor.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 801. It is well-settled that there is “no basis in the \nAdministrative Procedure Act . . . for a requirement . . . [of] more searching review” when an \nagency changes its position. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 514 (2009). And \nthere is certainly no basis to find that the agency’s prior interpretation in nonbinding guidance \ncould possibly foreclose DHS from adopting a different reasonable interpretation through notice-\nand-comment rulemaking. See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 \nU.S. 967, 982-83 (2005). As the Supreme Court explained in Fox, all that DHS was required to do \nto permissibly change course from the 1999 Field Guidance was to acknowledge that the Rule is \nadopting a policy change, provide a reasoned explanation for the change, and explain how it \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs’ claim also ignores that many of the “qualified aliens” to whom PRWORA’s authorization of certain public \nbenefits applies are generally not subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility. See 8 U.S.C. § 1641(b) \n(“qualified alien” includes, inter alia, asylum recipients and refugees). \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 42 of 53\nbelieves the new interpretation is reasonable. See Fox, 556 U.S. 514-16. The Rule readily meets \nthese standards, and so DHS is entitled to full deference to its changed interpretations, consistent \nwith its obligation to “consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing \nbasis.” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 863-64 (recognizing agencies receive deference to a “changed . . . \ninterpretation of [a] term”). \nFirst, the NPRM and Rule acknowledged that DHS was changing course. In the former, \nDHS announced it was proposing “major changes,” see, e.g., NPRM at 51116, and that these \nchanges included “a new definition of public charge,” id. at 51158; see also id. at 51163. DHS also \nstated that it would change and “improve upon the 1999 Interim Field Guidance” by changing the \ntreatment of non-cash benefits. Id. at 51123. In the Rule, DHS “agree[d] with commenters that the \npublic charge inadmissibility rule constitutes a change in interpretation from the 1999 Interim Field \nGuidance,” Rule at 41319, and repeatedly explained that it was “redefin[ing]” public charge, and \nadopting a “new definition” of “public benefit” that would be “broader” than before. Id. at 41295, \n41297, 41333; see also id. at 41347. \nSecond, DHS explained the reasons for the change. DHS described how the “focus on cash \nbenefits” in the 1999 Field Guidance had proved “to be insufficiently protective of the public \nbudget, particularly in light of significant public expenditures on non-cash benefits.” NPRM at \n51164. DHS presented statistics that reasonably support DHS’s conclusion that, under the 1999 \nField Guidance, the agency was failing to carry out the principles mandated by Congress that \n“aliens . . . not depend on public resources to meet their needs,” and instead “rely on their own \ncapabilities” and support from families, sponsors, and private organizations. 8 U.S.C. § 1601; see \nalso NPRM at 51160-63 & Tables 10-12; Rule at 41308, 41319 (explaining that the prior guidance \n“failed to offer meaningful guidance for purposes of considering the mandatory factors and was \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 43 of 53\ntherefore ineffective”). \nDHS also adequately explained how the new approach reasonably advances the stated \npurposes, including by “implement[ing] the public charge ground of inadmissibility consistent \nwith . . . [Congress’s goal of] minimiz[ing] the incentive of aliens to attempt to immigrate to, or to \nadjust status in, the United States due to the availability of public benefits.” Rule at 41305 (citing \n8 U.S.C. § 1601(2)(B)). Accordingly, the fact that the Rule presents a revised interpretation does \nnot render it arbitrary or capricious.  See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 804-05. \nRelatedly, Defendants respectfully disagree with this Court’s conclusion that the Rule is \narbitrary because it “change[d] the public charge assessment into a benefits issue, rather than an \ninquiry about self-subsistence[.]” PI Order at 15. Self-subsistence is merely the converse of \nreliance on public benefits, as Congress itself averred. It was thus rational for DHS to conclude \nthat aliens who rely on the public benefits enumerated in the Rule for months at a time are aliens \nwho “depend on public resources to meet their needs,” 8 U.S.C. § 1601(2)(A), and are not “self-\nsufficien[t],” id. § 1601(1). Even the 1999 Field Guidance tied the definition of public charge to \nthe receipt of public benefits. Field Guidance at 28689.  The Rule simply redefines what benefits \nreceived over what time period qualify an alien as a public charge. \nB.  DHS Adequately Considered Potential Harms \nPlaintiffs also allege that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants did not \n“adequately quantify or consider the harms that will result.” Compl. ¶ 286. But DHS rationally \nweighed the benefits and costs of the Rule. It explained that, by excluding from the country those \naliens likely to rely on public benefits and by encouraging those within the country to become self-\nsufficient, the Rule is likely to save federal and state governments billions of dollars annually in \nbenefit payments and associated costs. See NPRM at 51228. At the same time, DHS recognized \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 44 of 53\nthat the disenrollment of aliens from public-benefit programs could have certain adverse effects. \nIt noted, for example, that a reduction in public-benefit enrollment and payments could negatively \naffect third parties who receive such payments as revenue, including, for example, health-care \nproviders who participate in Medicaid and local businesses who accept SNAP benefits. NPRM at \n51118; Rule at 41313. DHS also recognized that disenrollment in public-benefit programs by \naliens subject to the Rule or those who incorrectly believe they are subject to the Rule could have \nadverse consequences on the health and welfare of those populations, while also potentially \nimposing some “costs [on] states and localities.” Rule at 41313. \nAlthough it recognized these potential costs, DHS explained that there were reasons to \nbelieve that the costs would not be as great as some feared. Id. at 41313. Among other things, in \nresponse to commentator concerns, DHS took steps to “mitigate . . . disenrollment impacts,” \nincluding by exempting certain public benefits from the list of those covered by the Rule. Id. at \n41313-14. DHS also noted that the majority of aliens subject to the Rule do not currently receive \npublic benefits, either because they reside outside the United States or because, following the 1996 \nwelfare-reform legislation, they are generally precluded from receiving such benefits. Id. at 41212-\n13. \nDHS also explained that those classes of aliens who are eligible for the noncash benefits \ncovered by the Rule, such as lawful permanent residents and refugees, are,  except in rare \ncircumstances, not subject to a public-charge inadmissibility determination and are thus not \naffected by the Rule. Id. at 41313. DHS also considered and made plans to address disenrollment \nby those not covered by the Rule. To the extent such individuals disenroll from public benefits out \nof confusion over the Rule’s coverage, the agency reasoned that the effect might be short-lived, as \nsuch individuals might re-enroll after realizing their error. Id. at 41463. DHS included in the Rule \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 45 of 53\ndetailed tables listing categories of aliens and indicating whether or not the public charge ground \nof inadmissibility applied, as well as tables of nonimmigrants indicating whether the public benefit \ncondition would apply. See id. at 41336-46; see also id. at 41292 (summarizing populations to \nwhom the rule does not apply). And, to clear up any potential remaining confusion as quickly as \npossible—thus  minimizing  disenrollment  among  populations  not  subject  to  the Rule—DHS \nfurther stated that it planned to “issue clear guidance that identifies the groups of individuals who \nare not subject to this rule, including, but not limited to, U.S. citizens, [certain] lawful permanent \nresidents, . . . and refugees.” Id. at 41313. \nUltimately, DHS rationally concluded that the benefits obtained from promoting self-\nsufficiency outweighed the Rule’s potential costs. Id. at 41314. As the agency explained, the \nprecise costs of the Rule were uncertain, given the impossibility of estimating precisely the number \nof individuals who would disenroll from public-benefit programs as a result of the Rule, how long \nthey would remain disenrolled, and to what extent such disenrollment would ultimately affect state \nand local communities and governments. See, e.g., id. at 41313. At the same time, the Rule \nprovided clear but similarly difficult-to-measure benefits, such as helping to ensure that aliens \nentering the country or adjusting status are self-reliant and reducing the incentive to immigrate that \nthe availability of public benefits might otherwise provide to aliens abroad. DHS’s ultimate \ndecision about whether to move forward with the Rule thus “called for value-laden decisionmaking \nand the weighing of incommensurables under conditions of uncertainty.” Dep’t of Comm., 139 S. \nCt. at 2571. Given Congress’s clear focus on ensuring that aliens admitted to the country rely on \nprivate resources and not public benefits, DHS’s decision to prioritize self-reliance among aliens \nis plainly reasonable. See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 800-05 (finding DHS likely to prevail in \ndefending against APA claim that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS inadequately \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 46 of 53\nconsidered harms); Consumer Elecs. Ass’n v. FCC, 347 F.3d 291, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“When . \n. . an agency is obliged to make policy judgments where no factual certainties exist . . . we require \nonly that the agency so state and go on to identify the considerations it found persuasive.”). \nC.  The Rule Retains The Totality Of The Circumstances Standard And Relies On \nAppropriate Factors \nPlaintiffs further allege that the Rule “replaces the statutory ‘totality of the circumstances’ \ntest with a test that is vague, arbitrary, and unsupported by the evidence.” Compl. ¶ 284. But the \nRule could not be more clear that it retains the “totality of the circumstances” approach under \nwhich Executive Branch officials make individualized determinations regarding whether “in the \nopinion of [the officer] at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, [the alien] \nis likely at any time to become a public charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). In addition, unlike the \n1999  Field  Guidance,  the  Rule  clearly  and  transparently  sets  out  the  relevant  factors  and \nconsiderations that DHS will take into account in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. By \ncontending otherwise, Plaintiffs disregard the plain text of the Rule. \nThe Rule, by its terms, “contains a list of negative and positive factors that DHS will \nconsider as part of [the public charge] determination, and directs officers to consider these factors \nin the totality of the alien’s circumstances.” Rule at 41295. “The presence of a single positive or \nnegative factor, or heavily weighted negative or positive factor, will never, on its own, create a \npresumption  that  an  applicant  is  inadmissible  .  .  .  or  determine  the  outcome  of  the  .  .  . \ninadmissibility determination. Rather, a public charge inadmissibility determination must be based \non the totality of the circumstances presented.” Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 41309 (“DHS \nhas established a systematic approach to implement Congress’ totality of the circumstances \nstandard.”). In fact, DHS made changes between the NPRM and the final version of the Rule to \nemphasize  that  the  “totality  of  the  circumstances”  approach  is  retained—for  example,  by \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 47 of 53\n“amend[ing] the definition of ‘likely at any time to become a public charge’” by clarifying that \nthis means “more likely than not at any time in the future . . . as determined based on the totality \nof the alien’s circumstances.” Id. at 41297.   \nD.  The Rule Considers Relevant Factors in Assessing an Alien’s Likelihood of \nBecoming a Public Charge \nPlaintiffs further allege that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it “runs counter to \nthe evidence before the agency, relies on factors Congress did not intend the agency to consider, \nand disregards material facts and evidence.” Compl. ¶ 281. But DHS explained, at length, its \nreasons for including in the Rule the various factors it identified as weighing on the question \nwhether  an  alien  is  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.  NPRM  at  51178-207.  The  factors \nimplemented Congress’s mandate that the agency consider, at a minimum, each alien’s “age”; \n“health”; “family status”; “assets, resources, and financial status”; and “education and skills” in \nmaking a public charge determination. See id. at 51178; 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B). DHS described \nin detail how each of the various factors bore positively or negatively on the determination whether \nan alien is likely to depend on public benefits in the future, while retaining the “totality of the \ncircumstances” approach that allows each adjudicating officer to make a decision appropriate to \neach alien’s particular circumstances. \nFor example, in concluding that English proficiency was a relevant factor in the public-\ncharge inadmissibility calculus, DHS cited Census Bureau data and other studies indicating that \nnon-English speakers earned considerably less money and were more likely to be unemployed than \nEnglish speakers, thus supporting the conclusion that non-English speakers were more likely to \nbecome public charges than their English-proficient counterparts. NPRM at 51195-96. DHS also \ncited evidence indicating that noncitizens who reside in households where English is spoken “[n]ot \nwell” or “[n]ot at all” received public benefits at much higher rates than noncitizens residing in \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 48 of 53\nhouseholds where English was spoken “[w]ell” or “[v]ery well,” lending further support to the \nconclusion that English proficiency is a relevant consideration. Id. at 51196. The Rule’s suggested \nreliance on an alien’s credit score was likewise not irrational. Credit scores provide an indication \nof the relative strength or weakness of an individual’s financial status, and thus provide insight \ninto whether the alien will be able to support himself or herself financially in the future. Id. at \n51189; Rule at 41425. \nE.  Plaintiffs’  Additional  Allegations  Do  Not  Show  Any  Arbitrariness  Or \nCapriciousness \nPlaintiffs next allege that the Rule is “arbitrary and capricious because it relies on incorrect \nlegal interpretations of” two administrative decisions. Compl. ¶ 287. But the Rule is entirely \nconsistent with both of those decisions as both decisions emphasized the Executive Branch’s broad \ndiscretion  to  make  public  charge  determinations.  In  Matter  of  Vindman,  the  Regional \nCommissioner emphasized that the “elements constituting likelihood of an alien becoming a public \ncharge  are  varied,”  and  that  the  term  is  “not  defined  by  statute,”  but  rather  “determined \nadministratively.”  16  I.  &  N.  Dec.  131,  132  (Reg’l  Comm’r  1977).    Likewise,  Matter  of \nHarutunian explained that Congress’s broad delegation of authority in this area was necessary \nbecause “the elements constituting likelihood of becoming a public charge are varied.” 14 I. & N. \nDec. 583, 588-90 (Reg’l Comm’r 1974). Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit explained, Matter of \nHarutunian “pegged the public-charge determination to whether the alien was likely to ‘need \npublic support,’ irrespective of whether the alien was likely to be institutionalized for any length \nof time and billed for the cost by the state.” San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 795.  \nLastly, Plaintiffs allege that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it allegedly \ndiscriminates against individuals with disabilities and immigrants of color. Compl. ¶¶ 283, 285-\n86. As discussed above and below, neither contention is correct. See Section IV.A supra; Section \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 49 of 53\nVII infra. \nVI.  The Court Should Dismiss Count Four \nCount Four of Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that the Rule was promulgated “without \nobservance of procedure required by law.” Compl. ¶¶ 290-95. As to Plaintiffs’ allegation that the \nRule does not “quantify” harms, id. ¶ 293, the law does not require an agency to “quantify” all \npotential effects of a rule in order to comply with the APA. See Inv. Co. Inst. v. CFTC, 720 F.3d \n370, 379 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (the “law does not require agencies to measure the immeasurable”); \nDefs. of Wildlife v. Zinke, 856 F.3d 1248, 1263 (9th Cir. 2017) (finding agency action was not \narbitrary and capricious notwithstanding agency’s “failure to quantify” effects). “As predicting \ncosts and benefits without reliable data is a primarily predictive exercise, the [agency] need[s] only \nto acknowledge [the] factual uncertainties and identify the considerations it found persuasive in \nreaching its conclusions.” Sec. Indus. Fin. Markets Ass’n v. CFTC, 67 F. Supp. 3d 373, 432 \n(D.D.C. 2014). As discussed above, DHS easily met this standard.  See Section V.B supra. \nAlso, there is no merit to Plaintiffs’ argument that they were deprived of an opportunity to \ncomment on certain aspects of the 12/36 standard. Compl. ¶ 294. An “agency’s final rule need \nonly be a logical outgrowth of its notice.” Agape Church, Inc. v. FCC, 738 F.3d 397, 411 (D.C. \nCir. 2013). A final rule qualifies as the logical outgrowth of the proposed rule if interested parties \nshould have anticipated that the change was possible. Id. Here, Plaintiffs complain that the Rule \ndid not adopt the 15% federal poverty guidelines threshold for the use of public benefits that was \nproposed in the NPRM, and instead used a standard that considers the duration and intensity of \nbenefit usage. Compl. ¶ 294. But the NPRM discussed the proposed standard at length, NPRM at \n51158-69, leading to extensive comments on the standard, including the 15% threshold, Rule at \n41357-58. In the Rule, DHS explained in great detail why it was adopting the 12/36 standard \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 50 of 53\ninstead.  Id. at 41357-63, 41358. Plaintiffs clearly had a sufficient opportunity to comment on what \nthey believed the appropriate standard should be, as the submitted comments demonstrate. \nVII.  The Court Should Dismiss Count Five  \nIn Count Five, Plaintiffs allege that the Rule violates the equal protection component of \nthe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Plaintiffs fail to state an equal protection claim because \ntheir complaint includes no well-pled allegation that DHS issued the Rule based on any improper \ndiscriminatory motive. Plaintiffs do not deny that the Rule is facially neutral, but claim that the \nRule violates Equal Protection because its alleged purpose is to disproportionately affect a \nparticular racial or ethnic subset of immigrants. See Compl. ¶¶ 298-99. In support, Plaintiffs rely \nprimarily on a handful of stray comments by certain non-DHS, government officials concerning \nimmigration in general, rather than the Rule in particular. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 175, 178. Plaintiffs’ \nallegations are insufficient to establish a plausible equal protection claim.  \n“[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially \ndisproportionate impact.” Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, \n264-65 (1977). “Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause.” Id. at 265. “Discriminatory purpose . . . implies more than intent \nas volition or intent as awareness of consequences.” Pers. Adm’r of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 \nU.S. 256, 279 (1979). “It implies that the decisionmaker . . . selected . . . a particular course of \naction at least in part ‘because of,’ not merely “in spite of,” its adverse effects upon an identifiable \ngroup.” Id. (emphasis added). Additionally, contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, strict scrutiny does \nnot apply simply because a plaintiff alleges a disproportionate impact on a particular racial or \nethnic group. Unless a plaintiff adequately “allege[s] actual discriminatory intent, the deferential \n‘rational basis’ standard is used to review the challenged” policy. United States v. Moore, 54 F.3d \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 51 of 53\n92, 96 (2d Cir. 1995); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976) (“Disproportionate impact \n. . . [s]tanding alone . . . . does not trigger the rule . . . that racial classifications are to be subjected \nto the strictest scrutiny”). \nA narrow standard of review here is particularly appropriate because this case implicates \nthe Executive Branch’s authority over the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals, “a matter \nwithin the core of executive responsibility.” Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2418 (2018); id. at \n2419 (highly deferential standard is appropriate “[g]iven the authority of the political branches \nover admission”). Indeed, this “deferential standard of review” applies “across different contexts \nand constitutional claims” because “‘it is not the judicial role in cases of this sort to probe and test \nthe justifications of immigration policies.” Id. “A conventional application of” this standard, \n“asking only whether the policy is facially legitimate and bona fide,” would plainly require \ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims because Plaintiffs do not contend there is anything \nfacially discriminatory about the Rule. Id. at 2420. But dismissal is also appropriate if the Court \nwere to apply rational basis review to Plaintiffs’ claim. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ allegations do not suggest that DHS issued the Rule “because of” any \nalleged “adverse effects upon an identifiable” racial or ethnic group. First, “the [stated] purposes \nof the” Rule “provide the surest explanation for its” design and implementation. Feeney, 442 U.S. \nat 275, 279. The Rule’s preamble (spanning roughly 200 pages) thoroughly explains the Rule’s \nnon-discriminatory  justifications,  including  the  need  to  facilitate  self-sufficiency  among \nimmigrants. See Rule at 41295 (“DHS is revising its interpretation of ‘public charge’ . . . to better \nensure that aliens subject to the public charge inadmissibility ground are self-sufficient”); id. at \n41308 (“DHS believes [the] broader definition [of public charge] is consistent with Congress’ \nintention that aliens should be self-sufficient. Self-sufficiency is, and has long been, a basic \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 52 of 53\nprinciple of immigration law in this country. DHS believes that this rule aligns DHS regulations \nwith that principle.”). Additionally, the Rule’s construction was guided by an extensive notice-\nand-comment process, following a NPRM that was just under 200 pages long. See NPRM, 83 Fed. \nReg. 51114 (Oct. 10, 2018). The Rule included a number of changes from the proposed rule in \nresponse to public comments. See, e.g., Rule at 41297. The Rule’s procedural history undermines \nPlaintiffs’ conclusory assertion that the Rule’s design may somehow be attributed to any alleged \nimproper bias. \nSecond, to show that DHS issued the Rule due to improper motives, Plaintiffs rely almost \nexclusively on alleged public statements by non-DHS officials that have no express connection to \nthe Rule. The vast majority of the alleged public statements in the Complaint reflect general views \non immigration. See Compl. ¶¶ 175-76, 178. And the few statements that arguably relate to the \nRule are consistent with DHS’s stated, non-discriminatory justifications for the Rule, including \nthe need to incentivize self-sufficiency. See Compl. ¶ 178(b) (“new immigration rules” must ensure \nthat “those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially”); \nCompl. ¶ 178(e) (aliens may come “from all the countries of the world” regardless of “whether \nthey can pay their own way” (emphasis added)). Regardless, “contemporary statements” may be \nrelevant to the question of whether an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor,” \nif made “by members of the decisionmaking body.” Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266, 268 \n(emphasis added); see also Clearwater v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 166, 231 F.3d 1122, 1126 (8th Cir. \n2000) (“Evidence demonstrating discriminatory animus in the decisional process needs to be \ndistinguished  from  stray  remarks  .  .  .  statements  by  nondecisionmakers,  or  statements  by \ndecisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process.”). Here, Plaintiffs rely almost exclusively on \nstatements made by non-DHS personnel, and Plaintiffs provides no explanation for how these \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 141   Filed 02/14/20   Page 53 of 53\nstatements reveal that DHS harbored an improper motive in implementing the Rule. Although \nPlaintiffs refer to statements from certain personnel affiliated with components of DHS, these \nstatements provide no indication of why these individuals supported the Rule. See Compl. ¶ 176. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \n \nDated:  February 14, 2020      Respectfully submitted, \n \n           \nGEOFFREY S.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY \n  AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT   \nOF HOMELAND SECURITY;   \nKEVIN K. McALEENAN, in his   \nofficial capacity as Acting Secretary of \nthe United States Department of \nHomeland Security; UNITED \nSTATES CITIZENSHIP AND \nIMMIGRATION SERVICES; \nKENNETH T. CUCCINELLI II, in his \nofficial capacity as Acting Director of \nUnited States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services; and UNITED \nSTATES OF AMERICA, \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  For generations, the United States has been a haven for immigrants seeking \nopportunity and upward mobility.  See, e.g., John F. Kennedy, Nation of Immigrants (1958); \nEmma Lazarus, The New Colossus (1883) (welcoming “your tired, your poor, your huddled \nmasses”).  Our federal immigration law reflects this history, permitting exclusion of immigrants \nas a “public charge” only in very narrow circumstances where the immigrants are unwilling or \nunable to work and have no other source of support, and therefore likely to be primarily \ndependent on the federal government in the long term.  \n1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 2 of 85\n \n2.  The Final Rule, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 \n(Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pt. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, 248) (“Final Rule”) turns \nthis history on its head.  The Final Rule upends Defendants’ circumscribed authority to exclude \nan individual as a “public charge,” exploding this narrow classification to radically realign \nnational immigration policy in a manner both proscribed by Congress and unauthorized by law.  \nIn so doing, the Final Rule implements this Administration’s explicit animus against immigrants \nof color; it is the means by which immigrants from what this Administration has described as \n“shithole countries” will be excluded to the benefit of white, wealthy Europeans.1  \n3.  The Final Rule weaponizes the public charge inquiry to target legal immigrants \nwho are lawfully present in this country, who have close ties to our communities, and who \nCongress has expressly decided should be entitled to certain federal benefits.  The Rule penalizes \nimmigrants for their use of vital, non-cash benefit programs—such as food stamps, Medicaid, \nand housing assistance—that are designed to encourage upward mobility and promote self-\nsufficiency.   As a result, the Rule will disproportionately harm immigrants of color, immigrants \nwith disabilities, and immigrants with limited resources at the time of their visa or green card \napplications.   \n4.  The Department of Homeland Security’s new definition of “public charge” \nunlawfully and unreasonably assumes that any recipient of certain federal benefits above a de \nminimis threshold of use will become a drain on public resources.  But the history and purpose of \nthe benefits programs that the Rule targets do not support such an assumption.  Rather, Congress \nintended to provide temporary, supplemental benefits to working families to enable them to \n                                                 \n1 Ali Vitali et al., Trump referred to Haiti and African nations as ‘shithole’ countries, NBC News (Jan. 11, 2018), \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-referred-haiti-african-countries-shithole-nations-n836946. \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 3 of 85\n \ncontinue to be productive members of our society.  Defendants thus contort the meaning of \n“public charge” beyond recognition by radically expanding its definition to include individuals \nwho receive benefits—however nominal—and by viewing the receipt of such benefits as \nevidence of long-term dependency rather than, as Congress intended, a means of empowering \nindividuals to continue contributing to their communities.  \n5.  The Final Rule will cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Plaintiffs and \ntheir residents.  Immigrants, forced to choose between feeding their children and losing their \npathway to citizenship, or believing they face such a forced choice due to confusion and fear \nabout the Final Rule, will withdraw from programs that Congress designed to promote stability \nand upward mobility.  And this chilling effect, and the concomitant increase in homelessness, \nfood insecurity, and undiagnosed and untreated medical issues, will force state and local \ngovernments to bear severe financial and public health consequences.  State and local \ngovernments will be forced to expend their own resources to assist low- and middle-class \nworkers and their families, including citizen children, and to cover the public health and other \nsevere consequences that will result from immigrants forgoing non-cash supplemental benefits.  \n6.  As Defendants themselves acknowledge, the Rule will not only drive families \naway from using the food supplements, health care, and housing assistance programs expressly \ncovered by the Rule, but will also deter households from availing themselves of other benefits to \nwhich they are lawfully entitled and which are not directly subject to the Rule.  The result will be \nless preventative health care, less nutritious food, and less stable housing, with enormous \nfinancial and public harms to Plaintiffs and their residents.  Additionally, immigrants who \nchoose to continue receiving public benefits stand to lose adjustments in their status critical to \ntheir stability and success. \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 4 of 85\n \n7.  The Final Rule directly and irreparably interferes with Plaintiff States’ and City’s \nsovereign interests in the governance of their jurisdictions.  The Rule would upend Plaintiffs’ \nstatutes and policies designed to combat homelessness and improve children’s health outcomes.  \nIt would undermine Plaintiffs’ systems designed to promote public health, well-being, and civil \nrights of their residents.  And the Rule will also inflict irreparable harm on Plaintiffs’ economies, \nincreasing poverty and housing instability, and reducing economic productivity and educational \nattainment within the Plaintiffs’ jurisdictions.  \n8.  Defendants’ radical reversal of longstanding practice and policy violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and the Constitution.  First, Defendants’ effort to overhaul federal \nimmigration policy by redefining the long-established meaning of the term “public charge” \nexceeds their statutory authority.  Second, the Final Rule discriminates against persons with \ndisabilities, in direct contravention of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The Final \nRule also is arbitrary and capricious in a host of ways, including Defendants’ failure to \nreasonably justify their departure from decades of settled practice and to adequately consider the \nRule’s varied and extensive harms.  And Defendants failed to give the public adequate notice of \nthese changes through the notice and rulemaking process.  Finally, the Rule intentionally \ndiscriminates against Latino immigrants and immigrants of color, in keeping with Defendants’ \nbroader scheme designed to instill fear in those communities and deter and decrease immigration \nfrom these communities.    \n9.  Plaintiffs the State of New York, the City of New York, the State of Connecticut, \nand the State of Vermont bring this action to vacate the Final Rule and enjoin its implementation \nbecause it exceeds and is contrary to Defendants’ statutory jurisdiction, authority, and limitations \nin violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); is arbitrary, \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 5 of 85\n \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A); and violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10.  This action is brought pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701-706.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 \nU.S.C. § 702.  \n11.  This Court has the authority to grant the requested declaratory and injunctive \nrelief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705 and 706.  \n12.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1391(b) and (e)(1) because Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their \nofficial capacities, Plaintiffs the State of New York and the City of New York are residents of \nthis judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action \noccurred and are continuing to occur in this district.  \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff the State of New York, represented by and through its Attorney General, \nis a sovereign state of the United States of America.  The Attorney General is New York State’s \nchief law enforcement officer and is authorized to pursue this action pursuant to N.Y. Executive \nLaw § 63. \n14.  Plaintiff the City of New York is a municipal corporation organized pursuant to \nthe laws of the State of New York.  New York City is a political subdivision of the State and \nderives its powers through the New York State Constitution, New York State laws, and the New \nYork City Charter.  New York City is the largest city in the United States by population. \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 6 of 85\n \n15.  Plaintiff the State of Connecticut, represented by and through its Attorney \nGeneral, William Tong, is a sovereign state of the United States of America.  The Attorney \nGeneral brings this action as the state’s chief civil legal officer under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 3-124 et \nseq. \n16.  Plaintiff the State of Vermont, represented by and through its Attorney General, \nThomas J. Donovan, is a sovereign state of the United States of America.  The Attorney General \nis the state’s chief law enforcement officer and is authorized to pursue this action pursuant to Vt. \nStat. Ann. tit. 3, §§ 152 and 157. \n17.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by Defendants’ actions and have standing to bring this \naction because the Final Rule harms their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, economic, and proprietary \ninterests and will continue to cause injury unless and until the Final Rule is vacated. \n18.  Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS” or “the \nDepartment”) is a cabinet agency within the executive branch of the United States government, \nand is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  DHS promulgated the Final Rule and \nis responsible for its enforcement. \n19.  Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of DHS and is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n20.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is an \nagency of DHS and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).  USCIS has primary \nauthority to make public charge determinations for adjustment of status applications \n21.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II is the Acting Director of USCIS and is sued \nin his official capacity.  \n22.  Defendant the United States of America is sued as allowed by 5 U.S.C. § 702.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 7 of 85\n \nALLEGATIONS \n23.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) provides that the federal \ngovernment may deem a non-citizen applying either to enter or to reside permanently in the \nUnited States likely to become a public charge, and thus inadmissible for entry or adjustment of \nstatus.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  In assessing whether an applicant is likely to fall within the \npublic charge definition, DHS is required to evaluate a range of factors in a totality of \ncircumstances determination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B).  The Final Rule drastically changes this \nprocess, far beyond statutory limits, to exclude from admissibility working individuals and \nfamilies, their children, the disabled, people of color, and other residents of Plaintiffs’ \njurisdictions who are not likely to depend primarily and permanently on government support.   \nA.  Federal Immigration Statutes Incorporated the Common Law Interpretation of \nPublic Charge. \n24.  Since the 19th century, the term “public charge” has been understood to mean \nsolely those individuals who depend permanently and primarily on government resources.  The \nterm has never been understood to include individuals who earn moderate or low incomes, or \nwho receive temporary or moderate amounts of public benefits that are designed to assist them in \nmaintaining stable and healthy lives.  For more than a century, federal immigration statutes have \nincorporated this established and narrow common law meaning of “public charge.”  And over \nsubsequent decades, Congress has repeatedly rejected numerous attempts to expand public \ncharge beyond the common law definition.   \n1.  Common Law Defines Public Charge as an Individual Primarily Dependent \non Governmental Assistance.  \n25.  For more than 130 years, courts, Congress, and federal agencies have consistently \ninterpreted the term “public charge” to mean an individual who has become or is likely to \nbecome primarily or completely dependent on the government in the long term. \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 8 of 85\n \n26.  The first federal immigration statute, enacted in 1882, adopted the concept of \n“public charge” that had been used by several local and state statutes enacted in the first half of \nthe 19th century.2  Like those early state and local statutes, the federal statute excluded those \nwho could not work on a sustained basis, including “convicts, lunatics, idiots, and any person \nunable to take care of himself without becoming a public charge.”  Immigration Act of 1882, ch. \n376, 22 Stat. 214, 47th Cong. (1882).  And like the early state and local statutes on which it was \nbased, the federal statute did not exclude as public charges individuals who were able to work.  \n27.  In 1907, Congress passed a second immigration statute, which it amended in \n1910.  Immigration Act of 1907, ch. 1134, § 2, 34 Stat. 898, 899 (1907); amended by Act of \nMar. 26, 1910, ch. 128, § 1, 36 Stat. 263, 263 (1910).  Both the 1907 law and the amendment \nretained the public charge exclusion for paupers, professional beggars, those with contagious \nillnesses, and those with permanent “defects,” and therefore, had to look to the government \nindefinitely for support.  These federal statutes thus continued the preexisting meaning of public \ncharge as including solely those individuals who needed to rely primarily on the government to \nlive, and not those who did or could work.    \n28.  Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”)3 have consistently \ninterpreted “public charge” to refer to individuals who depend completely or nearly completely \nupon government support.  In 1915, the Supreme Court has affirmed this understanding.  In \nGegiow v. Uhl,4 the Court held that the public charge exclusion did not cover the poor or the \n                                                 \n2 Gerald L. Neuman, The Lost Century of American Immigration Law (1776-1875), 93 Colum. L. Rev. 1833, 1850 \n(1993) (citing Act of Feb. 26, 1794, ch. 32, §§ 15, 1794 Mass. Acts & Laws 375, 385.). \n3 The BIA is a department within the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) that is the highest administrative body for \ninterpreting and applying immigration laws. The BIA has nationwide jurisdiction to hear appeals from certain \ndecisions rendered by immigration judges and by district directors of DHS.  \n4 239 U.S. 3 (1915). \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 9 of 85\n \ntemporarily unemployed, but was intended to reach individuals permanently unable to support \nthemselves through work.5  Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, explained that temporary \nfactors such as local labor conditions were irrelevant to a public charge finding and that such a \ndetermination should be based solely on “permanent personal objections.”6  A “likely public \ncharge” determination under the common law thus required a permanent and unalterable \ncondition of dependence, rather than a condition of temporary hardship or low-income status.  \n29.  In the decades following Uhl, courts rejected a “latitudinarian construction” of \npublic charge and held that it encompassed only “those persons who are likely to become \noccupants of almshouses for want of means with which to support themselves in the future.”7 \nFrom the 1940s to the present, the BIA and circuit courts have continued to adhere to this narrow \ndefinition, overturning public charge exclusions of employable immigrants found inadmissible \nfor having low incomes or using some public benefits.  Interpreting decades of common law on \npublic charge, the BIA found that the INA “requires more than a showing of a possibility that the \nalien will require public support.”8   \n30.  For applicants who arrived in the United States without financial resources but \nwere willing and able to work in the long term, the public charge exclusion did not apply; public \ncharge determination was thus the exception, rather than the rule.   \n                                                 \n5 Id. at 9-10. \n6 These permanent personal objections included: long-term poverty (“paupers and professional beggars”), disability \n(“idiots” and those with “a mental or physical defect”), a history of criminality (“convicted felons, prostitutes”), or \n“persons dangerously diseased.” Id. at 10. \n7 Ex parte Mitchell, 256 F. 229, 232 (N.D.N.Y. 1919); Howe v.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 Incorporated the Common \nLaw Definition of Public Charge. \n31.  In 1952, Congress passed the INA, which included a provision establishing public \ncharge as a ground of both inadmissibility and removal.  The INA provides that “[a]ny alien \nwho, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion \nof the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely \nat any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).   \n32.  The statute requires a public charge determination for applicants seeking to adjust \ntheir status to become permanent residents (i.e. green card holders).  Defendant USCIS is a \ncomponent of DHS and has authority to make public charge determinations for adjustment of \nstatus applications.  8 U.S.C. § 1201(a).  Prior to March 1, 2003, this function was performed by \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), under the purview of the United States \nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”).  After 2003, this authority was delegated to DHS.   \n33.  The statute also requires a public charge determination for applicants seeking \nentry to the United States via a visa application—such as people applying for family- or \nemployment-based visas.  The Department of State has jurisdiction to make such public charge \ndeterminations for visa applicants.  See Department of State, 9 Foreign Affairs Manual 302.8. \n34.  Additionally, the INA provides that any individual who becomes a public charge \n“within five years after the date of entry from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen \nsince entry” is subject to removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(5).  DOJ is responsible for initiating and \nadjudicating removal proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(g).  \n35.  The term “public charge” is used in both the admissibility and removal sections of \nthe INA, and applies in the admissibility context, to individuals seeking entry to the United \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 11 of 85\n \nStates and those seeking to adjust their status to become permanent residents, and in the \ndeportation context.     \n36.  Congress incorporated the common law definition of public charge into both the \nadmission and removal provisions of the INA.  Congress enacted the INA’s public charge \nprovision against the backdrop of decades of clear and consistent court and agency decisions \ndefining a public charge as an individual primarily and permanently dependent on governmental \nassistance and gave no indication that it intended to change that prevailing common law \ninterpretation.   \n3.  Congress Repeatedly Rejected Efforts to Expand Public Charge Beyond the \nCommon Law Definition. \n37.  Since the passage of the INA, Congress has consistently resisted expansion of the \npublic charge definition to reach immigrant applicants who receive basic, non-cash benefits. \n38.  With welfare and immigration reform in the 1990s, the scope of the public charge \nexclusion became a sharply contested issue.  While the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”) and the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act (the “Welfare Reform Act”) imposed restrictions on \nimmigration, the bills also set baseline protections for immigrants’ use of public benefits that \nDHS now seeks to ignore.  In these laws, and in subsequent statutory enactments, Congress made \nclear that the public charge provisions of the INA are not triggered by the use of benefits like \nMedicaid, nutritional supplements, and housing subsidies.   \n39.  In early 1996, Congress considered the Immigration Control and Financial \nResponsibility Act (“ICFRA”), which—much like the Final Rule—would have expressly altered \nthe well-established meaning of “public charge” to encompass a non-citizen who used almost \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 12 of 85\n \nany public benefit program for more than one year,9 with limited exceptions for certain \nemergency medical and childhood nutrition services.10  H.R. Rep. 104-469, at 266-67 (1996).  \nAfter months of debates and amendments, the Senate rejected the bill.  Discussing the proposed \nchange, Senator Leahy objected that “the definition of public charge goes too far in including a \nvast array of programs none of us think of as welfare. . . .  The bill would affect the working poor \nwho are striving against difficult odds to become self-sufficient. . . .  The bill is unnecessarily \nuncertain and will yield harsh and idiosyncratic results that no one should intend.”  S. Rep. No. \n104-249, at 64 (1996). \n40.  In 1996, Congress passed IIRIRA, which modified certain aspects of the public \ncharge analysis, but did not change the settled meaning of “public charge” as including solely \nindividuals who are not currently or likely to become primarily and permanently dependent on \nthe government.  Instead, IIRIRA amended the INA to include, for the first time, a list of \nmandatory factors to consider when determining which applicants were likely to become a public \ncharge, including the applicant’s age, health, family status, financial status, and education and \nskills.  Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 531(a), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-674-75 (1996).  As part of the \n                                                 \n9 The ICFRA would have defined “public charge” to encompass “any alien who receives benefits . . . for an \naggregate period of more than 12 months” from: (i) the aid to families with dependent children program, (ii) \nMedicaid, (iii) the food stamp program, (iv) the supplemental security income (“SSI”) program, (v) any state general \nassistance program, or (vi) “any other program of assistance funded, in whole or in part, by the Federal Government \nor any State or local government entity, for which eligibility for benefits is based on need.”  H.R. 2202 \n§ 202(a)(5)(D). \n10 The Act would have excluded the following services from public charge determinations: (i) emergency medical \nservices under title XIX of the Social Security Act; (ii) prenatal and postpartum services under title XIX of the \nSocial Security Act; (iii) short-term emergency disaster relief; (iv) assistance or benefits under (I) the National \nSchool Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), (II) the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.), (III) \nsection 4 of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (Public Law 93-86; 7 U.S.C. 612c note), (IV) the \nEmergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 (Public Law 98-8; 7 U.S.C. 612c note), (V) section 110 of the Hunger \nPrevention Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-435; 7 U.S.C. 612c note), and (VI) the food distribution program on Indian \nreservations established under section 4(b) of Public Law 88-525 (7 U.S.C. 2013(b)); or (v) any student assistance \nreceived or approved for receipt under title IV, V, IX, or X of the Higher Education Act of 1965 in an academic year \nwhich ends or begins in the calendar year in which the Act is enacted until the matriculation of their education.  H.R. \n2202 §§ 201-02.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 13 of 85\n \npublic charge determination, IIRIRA also permitted INS officials to take into account “a[n] \naffidavit of support,” i.e., an agreement by a sponsor to provide financial support to an applicant \nwho would otherwise be likely to become a public charge.  Id.  \n41.  During the drafting of IIRIRA, Congress specifically rejected a provision that—\nmuch like the Final Rule—would have redefined public charge to include individuals who \nreceived “federal public benefits for an aggregate of 12 months over a period of 7 years.”  142 \nCong. Rec. S11872 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1996) (statement of Sen. Kyl).  Senate Republicans \nremoved the controversial provision in response to President Clinton’s “threat of shutting down \nthe Federal Government unless Congress ma[d]e changes in the immigration bill.”  142 Cong. \nRec. S11612 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1996) (statement of Sen. Simpson).   \n42.  In 2013, Congress rejected yet another attempt to broaden the definition of public \ncharge in a proposed amendment to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \nImmigration Modernization Act of 2013, S. 744, 113th Cong. (2013) (“2013 Border Security \nBill”).  The amendment would have altered the meaning of public charge by including applicants \nfor admission, who sought either to remain in the United States or to adjust their status, likely “to \nqualify even for non-cash employment supports” such as Medicaid and SNAP.  S. Rep. No. 113-\n40, at 42 (2013).  The report of the Judiciary Committee noted that the senators opposing the \namendment “cited the strict benefit restrictions and requirements.”  Id.   \n4.  Congress Has Repeatedly Protected Immigrant Access to Non-Cash Public \nBenefits. \n43.  Over the past two decades, Congress has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to \nensuring that immigrants may enroll in certain non-cash benefits programs.  While non-citizens \nremain ineligible for a number of public programs, Congress preserved access to benefits like \nSNAP, housing assistance, and Medicaid for several categories of legally residing non-citizens.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 14 of 85\n \nThese non-cash benefits are designed to help working and employable individuals, promote self-\nsufficiency, and allow individuals who temporarily fall on hard times to avoid poverty.  \nIncreased enrollment in food, health care, housing programs also supports better public health \noutcomes and strengthens the labor force and economic productivity within Plaintiff States.   \n44.  In 1996, Congress passed the Welfare Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 104–193, 110 \nStat. 2105 (1996).  While it again left the definition of “public charge” intact, the Welfare \nReform Act excluded non-citizens from many federal and state cash public benefits programs.  8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1611(a), 1621(a).  Under the Welfare Reform Act, only “qualified aliens,” such as \ngreen card holders, refugees, recipients of temporary parole for humanitarian reasons, residents \nwhose deportation is being withheld, and entrants from certain enumerated countries, could \nenroll in means-tested benefits programs.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1611, 1641.  Of these “qualified aliens,” \nmost categories of individuals were only eligible for benefits after five years from their date of \nentry.  8 U.S.C. § 1613.  The House Budget Committee report stated that, as a result of these \nprovisions, the “welfare reform strategy end[ed] the role of welfare as an immigration magnet.” \nH.R. Rep. 104-651, at 6 (1996).  While Congress sought, through the Act, to promote self-\nsufficiency and eliminate the role of benefits as an incentive to immigrate to the United States, \nCongress chose not to expand the definition of public charge, instead addressing such goals \nthrough other means.   \n45.  At the same time, however, the Welfare Reform Act also ensured that non-\ncitizens would remain eligible for numerous non-cash benefits, including emergency medical \nassistance, disaster relief, immunization services, and public housing.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1611(b), \n1621(b).  Despite promoting concepts of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, the Act also \nrecognized the need for a safety net.  142 Cong. Rec. S9387 (Aug. 1, 1996) (Statements of Sen. \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 15 of 85\n \nPressler) (“The bill before us would change the welfare system and the lives of many Americans \nfor the better.  Welfare was meant to be a safety net, not a way of life.  This bill would restore \nthe values of personal responsibility and self-sufficiency by making work, not Government \nbenefits, the centerpiece of public welfare policy.”) \n46.  In 2002, Congress passed the Farm Bill, which rolled back the Welfare Reform \nAct’s restrictions to restore access to supplemental nutrition benefits for many non-citizen \nchildren and non-citizens receiving disability benefits.  Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002, Pub. L. No. 107–171, § 4401, 116 Stat. 134 (2002).  The Bill also provided that non-\ncitizens who had been present in the country for more than five years would be eligible for \nsupplemental nutrition benefits.  Id. \n47.  In support of the 2002 Farm Bill’s increased access to food stamps, Senator \nRobert Graham specifically recognized the importance of the food supplement programs to \nmoving people off welfare to work: “I am also acutely aware of the role the Food Stamp \nProgram plays in helping families leave welfare for work. . . .  I supported the 1996 welfare \nreform law.  Some of my original interest in the Food Stamp Program grew out of my desire to \nsee welfare reform succeed. . . .  I would call particular attention to [accomplishing] the \nfollowing: restor[ing] benefits to legal immigrant children—most of whom are members of \nworking families. . . .  This important legislation would improve basic benefits for senior \ncitizens, people with disabilities, and working citizen and legal immigrant families with \nchildren.”  147 Cong. Rec. S13245-07, S13270 (Dec. 14, 2001).  He also noted that ensuring \nimmigrants’ access to food stamps was consistent with the goals of the Welfare Reform Act: “A \nprovision of the 1996 law also cut off food stamps to legal immigrants.  This was unnecessary to \nachieve the goals of the law, since over 90 percent of legal immigrants are working.”  Id.   \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 16 of 85\n \n48.  The 2009 Child Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) Reauthorization Bill further \nexpanded access to benefits for non-citizens, allowing states to provide Medicaid and CHIP \ncoverage to lawfully residing non-citizen children and pregnant women during their first five \nyears in the country.  CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-3, § 214, 123 Stat. 8 \n(2009). \n49.  Recent efforts to limit immigrant access to non-cash benefits have failed.  The \nRAISE Act of 2017 proposed sweeping changes to the INA, including a point-based visa system.  \nS. 1720, 115th Cong. (2017).  A substantially identical bill of the same title was introduced in \n2019.  S. 1103, 116th Cong. (2019).  Both bills would have restricted parents of citizen children \nto obtaining only temporary immigrant visas and barred them from receiving any federal, state, \nor local public benefits.  S. 1720 § 4(d)(2)(s)(2)(b); S. 1103 § 4(d)(2)(s)(2)(b).  Congress has not \nacted on either bill.   \nB.  Regulatory Guidance on Public Charge Codified the Primarily Dependent \nStandard.  \n50.  In 1999, INS published guidance on the definition of public charge, which \nreflected the well-established common law meaning of “public charge” adopted by courts, \nagencies, and Congress: an individual primarily dependent on cash-based governmental \nassistance over the long term.  Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public \nCharge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689-93 (Mar. 26, 1999) (“1999 Field Guidance”).   \n51.  The 1999 Field Guidance defined a public charge as “an alien who has become \n(for deportation purposes) or who is likely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) \nprimarily dependent on the government assistance, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of \npublic cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at \ngovernment expense.”  Id.  Immigrant applicants who received non-cash benefits or who \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 17 of 85\n \nreceived less than 50 percent of their income from the government were not considered to fall \nwithin the definition of public charge.  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. \nReg. 51,114, 51,163-64 (Oct. 10, 2018) (the “Proposed Rule”).   \n52.  Before issuing the 1999 Field Guidance, the INS consulted with agencies that \nadminister public benefit programs and thus have expertise in the nature and use of public \nbenefits, including the Social Security Administration (“SSA”), the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (“HHS”), and the Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).  Those agencies \nopined that cash benefits, rather than non-cash benefits like SNAP, Medicaid, or housing \nassistance, and long-term institutionalization, were the best indicators of whether an individual is \nrelying primarily on the government.  After that consultation, INS determined in the 1999 Field \nGuidance that cash benefits, rather than non-cash benefits, are relevant to assessing the \nlikelihood that an individual would become a public charge.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41,351. \n53.  The 1999 Field Guidance applied in both the admission and removal contexts.  64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,690.   \n54.  The INS explained that guidance was necessary to clarify, in the wake of the \nWelfare Reform Act, “the relationship between the receipt of public benefits and the concept of \n‘public charge’” because the Welfare Reform Act “deterred eligible aliens and their families, \nincluding citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits that they are \nlegally entitled to receive.”  Id. at 28,692.   \n55.  The 1999 Field Guidance acknowledged the well-documented benefits of access \nto public benefits and recognized that receipt of non-cash benefits did not correlate with a \nlikelihood of long-term dependence on the government assistance.  The Department noted that \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 18 of 85\n \n“[t]his reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but \non public health and the general welfare.”  Id.   \n56.  The 1999 Field Guidance also concluded that the “nature of the public program” \nis critical to determining whether a particular public benefit is relevant to the public charge \ndetermination.  As the INS explained, “non-cash benefits (other than institutionalization for long-\nterm care) are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in combination, provide \nsufficient resources to support an individual or family.”  Such non-cash benefits are also often \n“available to families with incomes far above the poverty level,” the INS explained, reflecting \nbroad public policy decisions about improving general public health and nutrition rather than any \nindication that a recipient is primarily depend on the government.  Id.  By contrast, substantial \ncash benefits for income maintenance may provide enough resources to primarily support an \nindividual or family.  \n57.  In addition to expressly codifying which circumstances and public benefits gave \nrise to a public charge determination, the 1999 Field Guidance explained in more detail the \napplication of the INA’s public charge considerations, including “age, health, family status, \nassets, resources, and financial status, and education and skills.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  \nConsistent with BIA decisions in the 1960s and 70s,11 the 1999 Field Guidance required INS \nofficials to evaluate each factor as a part of a totality of circumstances test to assess whether an \napplicant would become primarily dependent on governmental assistance in the future.  64 Fed. \nReg. at 28690.  The 1999 Field Guidance provided that “[s]ervice officers should assess the \n                                                 \n11 See Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. 409, 421-22 (AG 1964) (finding that a determination of public \ncharge “requires more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will require public support” and “[s]ome specific \ncircumstance . . . tending to show that the burden of supporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public, must be \npresent”); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583 (BIA 1974) (determining applicant was a public charge after \nconsidering the totality of the applicant’s circumstances, including age, inability to earn a living, and lack of family \nor other support). \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 19 of 85\n \nfinancial responsibility of the alien by examining the totality of the alien’s circumstances at the \ntime of his or her application . . . .  The existence or absence of a particular factor should never \nbe the sole criterion for determining if an alien is likely to become a public charge.”  Id \n(emphasis omitted). \n58.  The 1999 Field Guidance further specified that the public determination for visa \nand green card applicants was forward-looking and that “past receipt of non-cash benefits” and \neven “past receipt of special-purpose cash benefits” should be not taken into account.  64 Fed. \nReg. at 28,690.   \n59.  The 1999 Field Guidance is currently in effect.  There is no indication that the \n1999 Field Guidance has failed to screen out applicants who were likely to become primarily or \npermanently dependent on the government.  Nor is there evidence that immigrants who utilized \nthe non-cash benefits excluded from consideration by the 1999 Field Guidance ultimately \nbecame primarily dependent on the government.  \n60.  Based on the 1999 Field Guidance, DOJ, the agency responsible for applying the \npublic charge determination in the removal context, issued a fact sheet acknowledging that the \npublic charge doctrine “ha[d] been part of U.S. immigration law for more than 100 years” and \nclarifying that benefits like food supplements, public health benefits, and housing assistance \nwere “not intended for income maintenance” and “are not subject to public charge \nconsideration.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Public Charge Fact Sheet, 2009 WL 3453730 (Oct. 29, \n2011). \nC.  Congress Has Expressly Prohibited Discrimination on the Basis of Disability. \n61.  In addition to protecting access to public benefits, Congress has also evinced its \nintent to eliminate barriers to admissibility faced by individuals with disabilities.  The 19th \ncentury definition of public charge encompassed individuals who were mentally or physically \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 20 of 85\n \ndisabled, based on the outdated assumption that disabled persons would not be able to work or \notherwise support themselves.  But Congress has since expressly prohibited discrimination based \non an applicant’s disability. \n62.  In 1973, Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act, which authorizes federal grants \nto states for vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities and prohibits \ndisability discrimination in federally funded programs.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  The Rehabilitation Act \nextended this prohibition on disability discrimination to the federal government itself in 1978.  \nPub. L. No. 95-602, § 119, 92 Stat. 2955 (1978). \n63.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination because of \ndisability in any program or activity conducted by any federal executive branch agency.  \nSpecifically, the statute provides that no individual with a disability “shall, solely by reason of \nher or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance \nor under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nThe DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel has determined that Section 504’s prohibitions on \ndiscrimination apply to all INS—and now DHS—activities and programs, which would include \npublic charge determinations.12  \n64.  In 1990, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) “to \nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1).  The ADA prohibits disability \ndiscrimination in private employment, state and local government, and public accommodations.  \n                                                 \n12 See April 1997 Opinion at 1; Memorandum for Maurice C. Inman, Jr., General Counsel, Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, from Robert B. Shanks, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Feb. 2, 1983). \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 21 of 85\n \nShortly after the ADA’s passage, and consistent with the policies embodied by the ADA, \nCongress also amended the INA to eliminate exclusions based on “mental retard[ation],” \n“insanity,” “psychopathic personality,” “sexual deviation,” or “mental defect.”  Immigration Act \nof 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, §§ 601-603, 104 Stat. 4978 (1990).   \n65.  Most recently, in 2008, Congress removed HIV and AIDS from the list of \ninfectious diseases that would prevent an individual from immigrating to or visiting the United \nStates, which broadened further protections for disabled immigrants.  Tom Lantos and Henry J. \nHyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nReauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-293, 122 Stat. 2918 (2008); 42 C.F.R. § 34.2(b) \n(2008).   \nD.  Public Benefits Enable Immigrants to Maintain Healthy Lives and Stable \nEmployment. \n66.  The long-standing definition of “public charge,” which the Final Rule would \nupend, ensures that immigrants are able to participate in essential federal, state, and local \nbenefits programs that provide supplemental assistance to further public health, nutrition, \nhousing-stability, and other public policy goals.    \n67.  Receipt of limited governmental assistance, particularly in the form of food, \nhousing, and health insurance subsidies, enables immigrants and their children to maintain \nemployment, continue healthy and stable lives, and to contribute fully to the federal and state \neconomies.  Rather than inhibiting self-sufficiency, these benefits help immigrants achieve their \nfull economic potential.   \n1.  Food Supplement Programs Prevent Health Problems and Promote Healthy \nEating Habits. \n68.  By providing supplemental nutrition benefits, state and local governments \npromote positive health outcomes and prevent conditions like obesity, diabetes, and malnutrition, \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 22 of 85\n \nwhich can limit an individual’s ability to work.  These benefits offer targeted and crucial \nassistance to working families, particularly those that support children, individuals with \ndisabilities, and seniors.   \n69.  SNAP is a federal nutritional supplement program that is overseen by USDA but \nadministered in large part at the state level.  SNAP benefits are available to low-income residents \nto purchase nutritional staples, such as bread and cereals, fruit and vegetables, meats, and dairy \nproducts.13    \n70.  New York State distributes SNAP benefits through its Office of Temporary and \nDisability Assistance (“NYOTDA”).  In 2018, an average of 2.7 million New York residents, \nincluding approximately 265,000 non-citizens, each month received a total of almost $4.5 billion \nin SNAP benefits.14   \n71.  New York City administers SNAP benefits through its Department of Social \nServices’ Human Resources Administration (“NYCDSS”) under the oversight of NYOTDA.   \n72.  Connecticut distributes SNAP through its Department of Social Services \n(“CTDSS”).15  In calendar year (“CY”) 2018, a total of 493,600 Connecticut residents—nearly \n14 percent of the state population—received SNAP benefits, including 168,489 children under \nthe age of 18.16 \n                                                 \n13 See Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Off. of Temp. & Disability Assistance, Frequently \nAsked Questions, http://otda.ny.gov/programs/snap/qanda.asp#noncitizen. \n14 Annual Report (2018), Off. of Temp. & Disability Assistance, 4 (2019), \nhttp://otda.ny.gov/news/attachments/OTDA-Annual-Report-2018.pdf. \n15  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - SNAP, Ct.

Vermont distributes SNAP benefits through a program called 3SquaresVT.  The \nDepartment for Children and Families, which is a division of the Agency of Human Services, \nadministers the program.  In fiscal year (“FY”) 2018, 74,038 Vermont residents received SNAP \nbenefits.  Approximately one third of SNAP recipients in Vermont are children under the age of \n18.   \n74.  Nationally, approximately two-thirds of SNAP beneficiaries are under 18, over \n60, or living with disabilities.17  The SNAP program has consistently reduced poverty among its \nparticipants, especially in non-metropolitan areas.  In 2015, SNAP lifted approximately 17 \npercent of its beneficiaries—over 8 million people—above the poverty line.  Among children, \nSNAP decreased the poverty rate by approximately 28 percent.18  The vast majority of SNAP \nbeneficiaries—over 90 percent—do not receive cash welfare benefits.19   \n2.  Health Insurance Programs Increase Access to Preventative Care and \nTreatment for Disabilities and Diseases. \n75.  Health insurance programs, like Medicaid, expand coverage to low-income \nindividuals and families who may otherwise be uninsured.  Having access to health insurance \nincreases the likelihood that individuals will seek medical care regularly and receive preventative \nand potentially life-saving treatment.   \n                                                 \n17 U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Characteristics of USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal \nYear 2017 (Summary) (Feb. 2019), https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-\nfiles/Characteristics2017-Summary.pdf; U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Characteristics of USDA Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2016 (Summary) (Nov. 2017), https://fns-\nprod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/ops/Characteristics2016-Summary.pdf. \n18  Laura Wheaton & Victoria Tran, The Antipoverty Effects of SNAP, Urb.

Medicaid offers coverage to those with income and assets below a certain \nthreshold, generally those earning 138 percent of, or less than, the Federal Poverty Guideline \n(“FPG”).   \n77.  New York State Department of Health (“NYSDOH”) manages the Medicaid \nprogram for New York and administers NY State of Health, New York State’s Insurance \nMarketplace (“NYS Marketplace”).  NYS Marketplace includes health insurance options for \nNew Yorkers, including Medicaid, Child Health Plus (New York’s version of CHIP), and other \ninsurance plans for low-income New Yorkers. \n78.  During FY 2019, Medicaid provided comprehensive insurance coverage to over 6 \nmillion New Yorkers, including children, pregnant women, single individuals, families, and \nindividuals certified blind or disabled.  More than one third of Medicaid enrollees statewide are \nchildren.    \n79.  In FY 2019, Child Health Plus covered 396,351 children in New York. \n80.  In New York City, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene \n(“DOHMH”) and NYC Health + Hospitals (“Health + Hospitals”) receive reimbursements from \nMedicaid for administrative costs and as medical services providers.  Health + Hospitals, \nDOHMH, and NYC DSS assist potential beneficiaries with applying for Medicaid and CHIP. \n81.  According to state enrollment data published in March 2019, 3.5 million New \nYork City residents—approximately 40 percent of the City’s population—are enrolled in \nMedicaid. \n82.  According to state enrollment data published in July 2019, in New York City \nnearly 159,000 children are covered by CHIP, or approximately 39 percent of the total CHIP \nenrollees in New York State.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 25 of 85\n \n83.  In Connecticut, the state’s Department of Social Services administers Medicaid \n(known as HUSKY A) and CHIP (known as Husky B).20  During 2018, 566,045 Connecticut \nresidents participated in Medicaid/HUSKY A and 31,672 Connecticut residents participated in \nCHIP/Husky B.21 \n84.  The Department of Vermont Health Access (DVHA) administers Medicaid and \nCHIP in Vermont.22  \n85.  During FY 2017, 5841 Vermont children participated in CHIP (known as Dr. \nDynasaur).23  In December 2018, Medicaid for children and adults (including CHIP) covered \n67,237 adults and 63,886 children.24  \n86.  Medicaid’s role is particularly important for vulnerable populations and \npopulations with specialized health care needs—for instance, Medicaid provides prenatal and \npostpartum care and covers almost half of all births.  Studies have shown that expanded \nMedicaid access is associated with improvement in public health, and in particular with lower \nmortality rates, better pregnancy and birth outcomes, and higher cancer detection rates.   \n87.  CHIP covers services such as check-ups, vaccinations, blood tests, and X-rays for \ninfants and children, which help to prevent them from developing a lifetime of serious diseases \nand medical conditions.   \n                                                 \n20 Connecticut’s Health Care for Children & Adults, https://www.ct.gov/hh/site/default.asp. \n21 People Served – CY 2012-2018, Ct.

Health insurance coverage contributes to the financial security and stability of \nmany low- and middle-income workers.  Not only are insured workers less likely to miss work \nfor health-related reasons, they are also less likely face exorbitant medical debt when they do \nseek medical care.   \n3.  Housing Assistance Programs Decrease Displacement and Homelessness. \n89.  Affordable housing programs decrease housing displacement and homelessness \nand allow recipients to live in a stable physical environment.      \n90.  New York State Homes and Community Renewal (“NYHCR”) administers \nfunding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), including for \nthe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (“HCV”), and Veterans Affairs Supportive \nHousing (“HUD-VASH”).  HCV provides rent subsidies to very low-income families, the \nelderly, individuals with disabilities, and those in shelters or at the risk of becoming homeless, \nincluding survivors of domestic violence, to afford safe and sanitary housing in the private \nmarket.  The HUD-VASH programs offer both Housing Vouchers and Project-Based Rental \nAssistance units to homeless veterans.   \n91.  In total, NYSHCR currently administers 44,332 vouchers (including HCVs and \nHUD-VASH vouchers) on behalf of participating families throughout New York State.  Of these \nfamilies, 73 percent are female-headed, 39 percent have children under 18, 23 percent have a \nperson with a disability, 31 percent are elderly, 27 percent are African American/Black, and 14 \npercent identify as Hispanic.   \n92.  NYSHCR also administers Project-Based Rental Assistance to private owners of \nmultifamily housing to lower rental costs.  In 2018, NYSHCR administered this assistance to \nover 92,000 apartments in 986 buildings for approximately 150,000 people statewide.  Of this \npopulation, 58 percent are elderly, 23 percent are families with children, and 12 percent have a \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 27 of 85\n \nfamily member who is disabled.  In addition, 25 percent identify as African-American/Black, and \n34 percent as Hispanic.  \n93.  In New York City, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and \nDevelopment (“HPD”) and New York City Public Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) administer \nthe Section 8 Choice Vouchers Program and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance.   \n94.  In Connecticut, public housing assistance is administered at the state level by the \nDepartment of Housing (“CTDOH”).25  Like its New York equivalent, CTDOH administers \nHUD grants, including the Section 8 Housing Vouchers Program and Section 8 Project-Based \nRental Assistance.  \n95.  CTDOH also administers special types of Section 8 vouchers targeted at specific \nvulnerable populations.  These include the Family Unification Program, a collaboration with the \nstate’s Department of Children and Families that provides housing vouchers to families for \nwhom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in the placement of the family’s child or \nchildren in out-of-home care; Mainstream Housing Opportunities Program for Persons with \nDisabilities, which creates a pipeline to housing for persons with disabilities; and Nursing \nFacility Transition Preference, which supplies vouchers for persons  with disabilities \ntransitioning from licensed nursing facilities into a private rental unit.26 \n96.  In FY 2017 to 2018, CTDOH directly administered $80,488,781 worth of Section \n8 vouchers to 7,524 families.  Across the state of Connecticut, in CY 2018, federal rental \nassistance programs provided low-income residents with $850 million in housing assistance, \nsupporting 37,200 households through the portable Section 8 voucher program; 22,800 \n                                                 \n25 Programs and Initiatives, Ct.

In all, 162,700 people in 83,000 Connecticut households benefitted from federal \nhousing assistance in CY 2018, including 92,800 people in families with children.  \n97.  CTDOH also administers a range of exclusively state-funded housing assistance \nprograms for low-income people, including the Rental Assistance Program (“RAP”), which \nawards vouchers to assist very-low-income families in affording decent, safe, and sanitary \nhousing in the private market,27 and the Elderly Rental Assistance Program, which provides \nrental assistance to low-income persons residing in state-assisted rental housing for the elderly.28  \nIn FY 2017 to 2018, CTDOH administered 6,486 RAP vouchers. \n98.  In Vermont, the Office of Economic Opportunity (“OEO”), which is within the \nDepartment for Children and Families, administers some housing assistance programs, including \nthe Family Supportive Housing program and the Housing Opportunity Grant Program.  The \nFamily Supportive Housing program provides intensive case management and service \ncoordination to homeless families with children.  This program is funded through Medicaid and \nuses roughly $700,000 annually, of which approximately 40 percent is federal and 60 percent is \nstate funding.  In FY 2018, the program served 187 families, including 462 people, of which 225 \nwere children under six.29  The Housing Opportunity Grant Program provides a blend of state \nand federal funding to support operations, homelessness prevention, and rapid re-housing \nassistance at approximately 39 non-profit emergency shelter, transitional housing, and prevention \n                                                 \n27 Rental Assistance Program (RAP), Ct.

The program provides approximately $7.4 million annually in core \nfunding to these homeless shelters and services.  Approximately 14 percent of the funding is \nfederal, largely through the HUD Homeless Assistance fund, and the remainder of the program is \nfunded by the state.  In FY 2018, Vermont’s publicly funded emergency shelters, domestic \nviolence shelters, and youth shelters served 3872 persons, including 2770 adults and 1102 \nchildren.  Of those persons, 58 percent were single adults and 42 percent were in families with \nchildren.  The average length of stay was approximately 50 days.30  The Economic Services \nDivision, also within the Department for Children and Families, also provides some emergency \ntemporary housing assistance through a state general assistance fund. And the Agency of Human \nServices funds a number of temporary rental assistance programs intended to provide “bridge” \nfunding as participants wait for Section 8 funding to become available. \n99.  The Vermont State Housing Authority (“VSHA”), a quasi-governmental body, \nadministers many of the Section 8-funded housing assistance programs statewide in Vermont. \nVt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 4005.31 These programs include Vermont’s Section 8 Existing Housing \nChoice Voucher program.  That program provides subsidy payments to owners of private \nhousing on behalf of a very-low income individual or family.  With a voucher, individuals and \nfamilies pay approximately 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent.  Tenants may select \ntheir own housing, subject to certain conditions.  Participants in this program also benefit from \naccess to the Family Self-Sufficiency program, which provides social services to help families \nachieve greater financial independence.  Section 8 vouchers may also be used to allow first-time \nhomebuyers to pay for a mortgage under certain conditions of the Homeownership program. \n                                                 \n30 State of Vt.

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, § 4003. \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 30 of 85\n \nVSHA also runs the HUD-VASH initiative and Housing for Persons with AIDS program as well \nas the Project Based Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, which help landlords and \ndevelopers improve and expand housing stock in return for making their housing available for \nuse by low-income families.  VSHA also administers the Shelter Plus Care program, which \nprovides rental assistance to homeless people with disabilities, and the Mainstream Housing \nprogram, which funds rental assistance for non-elderly disabled families.  It also administers the \nFamily Unification program, which provides rental assistance to families for whom lack of \nadequate housing is a primary factor in the separation of children from their families.  This \nprogram is a collaboration with the Agency of Human Services, VHSA’s direct housing services \nreach approximately 8,000 Vermont families.32  \n100.   Housing programs that Plaintiffs administer are essential to reducing \nhomelessness and promoting stability, safety, and health by ensuring housing accommodations \nthat families can afford.  For example, in New York State, where even middle class families \nstruggle to find affordable housing options, programs like Section 8 and public housing offer \ntools to correct the effects of skewed market forces.    \n101.  Recipients of public housing benefits often work and do not necessarily receive \nother governmental assistance.   \n102.  Affordable housing programs also promote employment by installing \nbeneficiaries in stable accommodations, which often provide access to reliable transportation.  \nIndividuals who receive housing assistance are less likely to face chronic tardiness or \nabsenteeism at work or school.   \n                                                 \n32 Rental Assistance Program, Vermont State Housing Authority, https://www.vsha.org/vsha-programs/rental-\nassistance-program/. \n30 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 31 of 85\n \nE.  The 2018 Proposed Rulemaking. \n103.  On October 10, 2018, DHS published in the Federal Register a Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking regarding the public charge ground for inadmissibility.  83 Fed. Reg. at \n51,114-51,296.   \n104.  The Proposed Rule re-defined the meaning of public charge and significantly \nchanged the process by which DHS decides whether an applicant would likely become a public \ncharge and thus be inadmissible.   \n105.  First, the Proposed Rule drastically expanded the established common law \ndefinition of public charge incorporated into the INA and abandoned the long-standing \nunderstanding of a public charge as a person who was and would remain primarily dependent on \nthe government over the long term.  Instead, the Proposed Rule set a monetary threshold and \nconsidered any applicants who received public benefits valued at 15 percent of the FPG \n(approximately $5 per day) for a period of 12 consecutive months to be a public charge.  83 Fed. \nReg. at 51,290.   \n106.  Second, the Proposed Rule radically expanded the benefits within the public \ncharge definition, adding supplemental non-cash benefits, like food supplements, public health \ninsurance, and housing assistance.  Id. at 51,289-90.  The Proposed Rule classified subsidies like \nSNAP and Section 8 as monetary benefits and services like Medicaid as non-monetary benefits.  \nIf an applicant received both monetary and non-monetary benefits simultaneously, then use of \nthe non-monetary benefits for only nine months within a 36-month period would render the \napplicant a public charge.  Id. at 51,158, 51,290. \n107.  Finally, the Proposed Rule sought to replace the public charge’s case-by-case \ntotality of circumstances test, which DHS used to determine whether applicants were likely to \nbecome a public charge, with a formulaic test that would assign positive, negative, heavily \n31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 32 of 85\n \npositive, and heavily negative weights to enumerated factors.  This weighted circumstances \nscheme stacked the odds of admissibility against disabled, non-white, and low-income \napplicants.  Id. at 51,291-92. \n108.  The Proposed Rule received over 200,000 comments, “the vast majority of which \nopposed the rule.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297.  Many commenters strenuously opposed both the \nchanges to the definition of public charge and the changes to the totality of circumstances test.  \nCommenters expressed concern for the substantial negative public health outcomes and \neconomic consequences that would result from a decrease of enrollment in subsidized nutrition, \nhealth insurance, and housing programs.   \n109.  Commenters cautioned also that these proposed changes, taken together, would \ntarget some of the country’s most vulnerable residents, including persons with disabilities, the \nelderly, women, children, and racial minorities.   \nF.  The Final Rule. \n110.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Final Rule in the Federal Register.  The \nFinal Rule changes both the public charge definition and the process by which DHS determines \nwhether an applicant is likely to meet this definition in the future.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,292-508.   \n111.  Specifically, the Final Rule eliminates the primarily dependent standard; includes \nreceipt of non-cash benefits in the public charge definition; and establishes a weighted \ncircumstances test that relies heavily on factors that bear no reasonable relationship to whether \nan individual will become a drain on the public fisc.  Id. at 41,294-95.  \n112.  Despite the longstanding exclusion of supplemental, non-cash benefits from the \npublic charge analysis, the Final Rule creates a new standard of total self-sufficiency, a concept \n32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 33 of 85\n \nnowhere found in the relevant portions of INA itself, and requires individuals to satisfy this \nrequirement to avoid a public charge determination.33   \n113.  DHS’s total self-sufficiency standard contravenes Congressional intent and \ndecades of case law and legislative history.  Moreover, the predictable consequences of the Final \nRule—resulting in immigrant communities becoming less healthy, less educated, and less \nequipped for the workforce—significantly undermine immigrants’ ability to attain self-\nsufficiency through reliance on programs that Congress created and extended to immigrants for \nthat very purpose.   \n114.  The Final Rule also fails to acknowledge that the DHS concluded in 1999, three \nyears after Congress passed IIRIRA and the Welfare Reform Act, that immigrants’ use of \nsupplemental, non-cash benefits did not raise apprehensions about improper incentives.  Nor \ndoes the Final Rule provide evidence that immigrants are motivated by participation in non-cash \nbenefits programs to come or to stay in the United States.  \n115.  Likewise, the Final Rule does not provide support for the conclusion that \nimmigrants who utilized the benefits excluded from consideration under the 1999 Field Guidance \ntypically became primarily dependent on the government, rather than using those benefits to \nbecome upwardly mobile and more self-sufficient.   \n116.  Finally, while the Final Rule projects certain savings for federal and state budgets, \nit does not account for a wide range of public health, economic, and administrative harms to \nPlaintiffs.   \n                                                 \n33 On August 13, 2019, just one day after announcing the Final Rule, Cuccinelli publicly rewrote the iconic Emma \nLazarus poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two \nfeet and who will not become a public charge.”  Jason Silverstein, Trump’s top immigration official reworks the \nwords on the Statue of Liberty, CBS News (Aug. 14, 2019), https://cbsnews.com/news/statue-of-liberty-poem-\nemma-lazarus-quote-changed-trump-immigration-official-ken-cuccinelli-after-public-charge-law/.   \n33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 34 of 85\n \n1.  The Rule Arbitrarily and Unlawfully Departs from the Well-Established \nMeaning of Public Charge  \na.  The Rule Abandons the Permanently and Primarily Dependent \nStandard. \n117.  The Final Rule drastically changes the scope of the public charge determination, \nwhich for more than 130 years has applied only to individuals primarily dependent on the \ngovernment for support over the long term.  The Rule would expand the public charge definition \nfar beyond its historical and statutory boundaries to exclude from admissibility the majority of \nlow-income immigrants, many of whom are on their way to building stable and more prosperous \nlives.  By penalizing even temporary and minimal use of public benefits, the Rule would place \nsignificant obstacles along the path of upward mobility. \n118.  The Final Rule defines “public charge” to include an immigrant “who receives \none or more public benefit,” without regard to whether the benefits received suggest long-term \ndependence upon the government, rather than temporary, short-term help to overcome specific \nhardships.  The Rule deems a public charge any person who has (i) received any amount of \ncertain non-monetary public benefits—including, for example, food stamps, Medicaid, certain \ntypes of housing assistance or cash subsidies—for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \nany 36-month period.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a)).  Whereas \nthe Proposed Rule set a value threshold for evaluating whether an applicant’s use of benefits fell \nwithin the public charge definition, the Final Rule dispenses with the threshold altogether, and \nreplaces it with a pure durational requirement that looks only to the fact of receiving benefits \nover some period of time rather than the amount of such benefits.   \n119.  In a further departure from the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule provides that when \nan individual receives two or more benefits simultaneously, DHS would count each benefit \nseparately in calculating the duration of use.  Id. at 41,295-97; see also id. at 41,501 (to be \n34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 35 of 85\n \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a)).  For example, under this stacking scheme, an applicant who \nsuffered a temporary health setback and who received both Medicaid and SNAP during a six-\nmonth period would be considered a public charge because the applicant used six months of \nMedicaid and six months of SNAP.  The Final Rule provides no limit on the magnitude of the \nstacking effect; an applicant who experienced an unexpected job loss and enrolled, for a limited \ntime, in three benefits programs would fall within the public charge definition after just four \nmonths.  Nor does the Rule provide guidance for how receipt of public benefits during only part \nof a month will count; this ambiguity may result in immigrants being excluded as public charges \nfor receiving benefits for even shorter durations than 12 full months.   \n120.  This change impermissibly expands the INA’s—and Congress’s—definition of \npublic charge, which understood a public charge to be an individual primarily and permanently \ndependent on government assistance.  Consistent with this understanding, DHS has historically \ninterpreted the INA’s public charge provision to apply to applicants who receive more than 50 \npercent of their income from public cash benefits.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,164.  By ignoring the \namount of public benefits received by an immigrant, and treating any receipt of benefits as \nevidence that somebody will become a public charge, DHS exceeds its rulemaking authority.  \n121.  Egregiously, the Rule’s interpretation of public charge encompasses all applicants \nreceiving any amount of almost any public benefits for one year in the aggregate (less if the \napplicant is receiving more than one benefit at the same time).  This radical re-definition of \npublic charge would reach, for example, an immigrant who received less than $1 per day in food \nstamps.  The Department does not articulate any reasoned basis for the new durational threshold \nnor attempt to justify exclusion of applicants who receive minimal governmental assistance.    \n35 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 36 of 85\n \n122.  As support for its conclusion that an applicant who received any amount \ngovernment assistance is excludable as a public charge, DHS repeatedly cites BIA decisions in \nMatter of Vindman and Matter of Harutunian.  Both cases, however, involved immigrant \napplicants who relied almost exclusively on the government for income; these cases only \nreinforce the permanently and primarily dependent standard set forth in the history, case law, and \nagency interpretations, including the 1999 Field Guidance.  DHS’s flawed legal analysis is \nirrational. \n123.  The Final Rule’s changes to the dependence standard are also not a logical \noutgrowth of the Proposed Rule.   \n124.  First, while the Proposed Rule contemplated lowering the dependence threshold \nto include individuals who received smaller amounts of public benefits, the Proposed Rule did \nnot contemplate or suggest that Defendants were considering eliminating the quantity threshold \naltogether and instead counting the receipt of any amount of certain public benefits as relevant to \nthe public charge determination.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,290. \n125.  Second, in determining whether an applicant meets the 12-month durational \nthreshold for benefits-use, the Final Rule allows DHS to stack the number of months when the \napplicant uses more than one benefit at a time.  DHS did not provide the public notice of this \nstacking scheme.  The Department deprived the public of the opportunity to comment on how \noften and when individuals use benefits in conjunction with one another and how these patterns \nwould affect the public charge analysis.   \nb.  The Rule Dramatically Expands the Types of Benefits Considered As \nPart of the Public Charge Definition. \n126.  The Final Rule also expands the benefits that give rise to a public charge \ndetermination.  In sweeping these supplemental benefits, which currently support approximately \n36 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 37 of 85\n \none third of all citizens born in the United States, into the public charge definition,34 DHS seeks \nto evade the legislative decision-making process and alter immigration law in ways that \nCongress never authorized and has, in fact, explicitly rejected. \n127.  Consistent with statutory directive, the 1999 Field Guidance provides that income \nreplacement programs, such as TANF and SSI, or long-term institutionalization, are the only \nbenefits relevant to the public charge determination.  The current guidance prohibits DHS from \ntaking into account most non-cash benefits because “non-cash benefits (other than \ninstitutionalization for long-term care) are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in \ncombination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family.”  64 Fed. Reg. at \n28,692.   \n128.  The Final Rule, by contrast, requires consideration of an applicant’s use of almost \nany public benefit, regardless of whether the benefit is supplemental in nature.  The Rule defines \n“public benefit” to include all Federal, State, local or tribal cash assistance programs; SNAP; \nvarious forms of housing assistance, including Section 8, Section 8 Project-Based Rental \nAssistance, and public housing; and most non-emergency Medicaid benefits (the “enumerated \nbenefits”).  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b)(1)(i)).35  \n129.  DHS exceeds its rulemaking authority by including non-cash supplemental \nbenefits like SNAP, Medicaid, Section 8 subsidies, and public housing in the public charge \n                                                 \n34 Danilo Trisi, One-Third of U.S.-Born Citizens Would Struggle to Meet Standard of Extreme Trump Rule for \nImmigrants, Ctr. for Budget and Pol’y Priorities, (Sept. 27, 2018), https://www.cbpp.org/blog/one-third-of-us-born-\ncitizens-would-struggle-to-meet-standard-of-extreme-trump-rule-for. \n35 Recognizing that Proposed Rule would have potentially devastating impacts on women and children, the Final \nRule makes limited exceptions for pregnant women and children on Medicaid.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,476.  Women and \nchildren would still be penalized, however, for enrolling in SNAP, and women would have to enroll and disenroll in \nMedicaid depending on their pregnancy status.  The Final Rule also purports to allow consideration for “primary \ncaregiver” role as part of the totality of circumstances test.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,438, 41,504, 41,438, 41,502 (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. 212.21(f)).   \n37 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 38 of 85\n \ndetermination.  As the relevant statutory language, history, case law, and long-standing agency \npractice demonstrate, Congress never intended that an immigrant’s lawful receipt of non-cash \nsupplemental benefits be used to render a public charge determination.    \n130.  On three occasions—while debating ICFRA, IIRIRA, and the Border Security \nBill—Congress considered and rejected proposals to alter the well-settled meaning of public \ncharge to reach non-cash benefits like food stamps, health insurance, and housing assistance \nprograms.  Opponents of these provisions expressly resisted including non-cash benefits in the \npublic charge inquiry.  The Final Rule ignores this statutory history and directly contradicts clear \nCongressional intent.   \n131.  DHS also interferes with Plaintiffs’ discretion under the Welfare Reform Act to \nadminister federal benefits programs.  The Welfare Reform Act provides that “a State is \nauthorized to determine the eligibility of an alien . . . for any designated Federal program.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1612(b)(1).  The Final Rule is inconsistent with congressional intent to place in State \nhands determinations of who should be eligible for benefits by deterring non-citizens from \nenrolling in benefits for which Plaintiff states deemed them eligible. \n132.  Finally, the proposed changes irrationally penalize low-income applicants from \nusing benefits that Congress expressly allowed them to receive, and that are designed to assist \nbeneficiaries and enable them to participate in the workforce. \nc.  The Rule Impermissibly Extends the Public Charge Determination to \nNon-Immigrant Visas.  \n133.  The INA subjects only applicants for visas or adjustment of status to a public \ncharge determination.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(4)(a).  \n134.  The INA does not require that individuals seeking to extend or change the status \nof non-immigrant visas, including students, tourists, and certain types of temporary workers, \n38 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 39 of 85\n \nundergo a public charge determination. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184; 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(defining \nclasses of non-immigrant visas). \n135.  Without statutory authority, the Final Rule would subject an applicant requesting \nto extend a non-immigrant visa or to change the status of a current visa to a public charge inquiry \nand require denial of the application if, at any point in the prior 36 months, the applicant received \nbenefits for 12 months in the aggregate.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,507 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 214.1).  For example, individuals studying in the United States and seeking to extend their \nstudent visas in order to complete their education will, for the first time and without any statutory \nbasis, be subject to a public charge inquiry.  For these individuals, the Final Rule imposes an \neven more draconian test that looks only to the receipt of public benefits and does not take into \nany other factors, much less the totality of circumstances.  \n136.  As with the changes to the public charge definition, DHS ignores the statutory \nlimits on its authority.   \n137.  Furthermore, the Final Rule unlawfully removes discretion from DHS officials to \ndetermine whether these applicants are likely to become a public charge.  Under the INA, DHS \nmust weigh a minimum of six statutory factors in a totality of circumstances test to determine \nwhether an applicant is likely to become a public charge.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(b).  By \nautomatically denying visa extensions for every applicant who has received 12 months of public \nbenefits within the past 36 months, without considering any other factors, the Final Rule violates \nthis statutory mandate. \n2.  The Rule Arbitrarily and Unlawfully Transforms the Totality of \nCircumstances Test to Stack the Odds Against Disabled, Non-White, and \nPoor Immigrant Applicants. \n138.  The Final Rule arbitrarily and unlawfully overhauls the public charge “totality of \ncircumstances” test to stack the odds against immigrants with disabilities, immigrants of color, \n39 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 40 of 85\n \nand low-income immigrants.  The Rule does so by arbitrarily and unlawfully relying on a \ncollection of “negative” factors that both individually and collectively bear little reasonable \nrelationship to whether an individual immigrant will become a public charge.  The Rule’s \nreliance on these irrational factors skews the inquiry against immigrants who are not wealthy, \nwho receive small amounts of non-cash supplemental benefits, who speak languages other than \nEnglish, or who are disabled.  And the Rule places a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of \nimmigrants from predominately wealthy, white, and English-speaking countries.    \n139.  To determine the likelihood that a particular applicant would become a public \ncharge, the INA specifies that DHS must take into account a range of factors, including, at a \nminimum, an immigrant’s age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education, \nand skills, in determining whether the applicant is inadmissible.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).  \nWhile DHS must assess each factor in the totality of circumstances test, the statute neither \nprioritizes nor permits the prioritization of any given factor.  Id.  Both courts and DHS itself have \ninterpreted the statutory mandate to require a case-by-case determination based on the facts of \neach application.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,690, 28,692. \n140.  The Final Rule transforms the statutorily-mandated totality of circumstances test \nby adding a host of secondary factors to each of the statutory factors and assigning mandatory \nweights to each factor considered.  The Rule divides the factors into four weights: negative, \nheavily negative, positive, and heavily positive.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,397; id. at 41,502-04 (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)).   \n141.  The Final Rule’s negative factors include an applicant’s (i) age, if he or she is  \nunder 18 or over 62; (ii) health, if he or she is diagnosed with a medical condition that could \ninterfere with the immigrant's educational or work opportunities; (iii) income, if he or she earns \n40 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 41 of 85\n \nless than 125 percent of the FPG and does not have other significant assets; (iv) financial status, \nif he or she has a poor credit score, has applied or been certified for, or received, benefits in the \npast, or has future foreseeable medical costs that he or she cannot cover without Medicaid; (v) \nskills, if he or she is non-proficient in English; (vi) education if he or she lacks a high school \ndiploma; and (vii) family status, if the applicant has a large family or family members that are \nfinancially interdependent.  Id. at 41,502-04 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)(1)-(5)).   \n142.  The heavily negative factors include an applicant’s (i) lack of employability; (ii) \nreceipt or authorization to receive benefits for 12 months within 36 months of filing application \n(for a visa, admission, adjustment of status, extension of stay, change of status); (iii) diagnosis of \na medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or \ninterfere with the applicant’s ability to attend work or school where the applicant lacks private \ninsurance; and (iv) previous findings of inadmissibility.  Id. at 41,504 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 212.22(c)(1)). \n143.  The only heavily positive factors are an applicant’s financial assets, resources, \nsupport, or annual income of at least 250 percent of the FPG, and enrollment in a private \ninsurance plan.  Id. at 41,504 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)).  However, enrolling in a \nprivate insurance plan using tax credits to offset health care premium costs under the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not count as a heavily weighted positive factor. \nId. at 41,504.   \n144.  The Final Rule instructs DHS officials to weigh the factors and find in favor of \nadmissibility only if the positive factors outweigh the negative factors.  Id. at 41,397-98.  When a \nheavily weighted negative factor is present, the applicant can only overcome a public charge \n41 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 42 of 85\n \ndetermination by showing two or more countervailing positive factors or one heavily weighted \npositive factor.  Id.  \n145.  While contending that agency officials would retain discretion to balance all \nfactors in deciding whether an applicant would more likely than not become a public charge, the \nRule guides DHS officials to enter public charge findings for applicants with disabilities, non-\nwhite applicants, and applicants who do not arrive in the United States with significant resources.  \nThe Final Rule reshapes the public charge exception, which has until now applied only to \napplicants who likely to become primarily and permanently dependent on the government, into \nan effective presumption against admissibility for these groups.   \na.  The Weighted Circumstances Test Discriminates Against Individuals \nwith Disabilities and Irrationally Presumes that Their Disabilities will \nRender them Public Charges. \n146.  The Final Rule resurrects the legacy barriers to admissibility for the mentally and \nphysically disabled that Congress has dismantled over time.  By heavily weighting medical \ndiagnoses, the costs of government subsidized treatments and care, and the lack of private health \ninsurance against applicants, DHS unlawfully discriminates against individuals with disabilities \nin violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n147.  The Final Rule intentionally discriminates against individuals with disabilities by \nrequiring DHS officials to consider an applicant’s “disability diagnosis that, in the context of the \nalien’s individual circumstances, [when it] affects his or her ability to work, attend school, or \notherwise care for him or herself.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,408.  \n148.  Under the weighted circumstances test, which penalizes applicants who are \ndiagnosed with or in treatment for a disability, most persons with disabilities, even those not \nprimarily depending on government assistance, would be found inadmissible.  For example, the \nFinal Rule would heavily weigh as a negative factor a disabled applicant’s receipt of Medicaid.  \n42 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 43 of 85\n \nId. at 41,504 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(iii)).  Many persons with disabilities, even \nworking professionals with advanced degrees, retain Medicaid coverage because Medicaid is the \nonly insurer that sufficiently covers some forms of personalized care and medical equipment.  \nYet the Rule does nothing to reasonably accommodate that reality for individuals with \ndisabilities.  Accordingly, the Final Rule would penalize individuals who, based solely on their \ndisabilities, chose Medicaid coverage, the only appropriate insurance to meet their needs.   \n149.  Additionally, the Final Rule provides that DHS would consider whether an \napplicant has been diagnosed with a medical condition “that will interfere with [the applicant’s] \nability to provide and care for him- or herself, to attend school, or to work upon admission or \nadjustment of status.”  Id. at 41,316.  A significant proportion of disabilities affect, in some way, \nan individual’s ability to work or learn.  The Final Rule would thus disproportionately assign a \nnegative weight to individuals with disabilities, including to an applicant requiring a reasonable \naccommodation at work or an Individualized Education Program at school.   \n150.  The weighted circumstances would also count the same factors multiple times \nagainst a disabled applicant of limited means.  For example, an applicant in a wheelchair who \nneeds an accommodation at work would presumptively be deemed a public charge.  Because the \nindividual has been diagnosed with a medical condition that interferes with work and likely does \nnot have private insurance, the applicant would start the test with a heavily weighted negative \nfactor.  If he had used Medicaid for more than 12 months at any point in the past three years, he \nwould have two heavily weighted negative factors.  He would then receive additional negative \nmarks in (i) health, for his disability and (ii) financial status, for his use of and application for \nMedicaid.  The applicant would further be disqualified from the heavily positive factor of having \n43 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 44 of 85\n \nprivate health insurance.  In substance, the Final Rule counts the same underlying facts against \nan individual in multiple ways, stacking the results towards inadmissibility.  \nb.  The Weighted Circumstances Test Would Have A Discriminatory \nImpact on Immigrants of Color. \n151.  The weighted circumstances test disproportionately places applicants from \ncountries with predominately non-white populations at a disadvantage, regardless of their ability \nto find employment and achieve self-sufficiency in the future.  Sixty percent of applicants from \nMexico and Central America and 41 percent from Asia would have two or more negative factors, \ncompared to only 27 percent of immigrants from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.36  Applicants \nfrom countries with non-white majorities are also less likely to have assets in excess of 250 \npercent of the FPG.  DHS fails to adequately address this discriminatory impact and, \naccordingly, ensures that immigrants of color would be significantly more likely to be found \ninadmissible.      \n152.  DHS also does not sufficiently address the specific effects of the Rule’s language-\nbased discrimination.  The new test assigns a negative weight to an applicant’s limited English \nproficiency (“LEP”) without specifying how DHS officials should determine whether an \napplicant’s English is proficient.   \n153.  Nor does the Final Rule make a reasonable connection between LEP status and \nthe likelihood of becoming a public charge. Immigrants from Central and South American as \nwell as Asian countries are more likely to have limited English skills, but are almost equally \nlikely to find gainful employment as are non-LEP immigrants from Europe.37   \n                                                 \n36 Randy Capps, Mark Greenberg, Michael Fix & Jie Zong, Gauging the Impact of DHS’ Proposed Public-Charge \nRule on U.S. Immigration, Migration Pol’y Inst., 9 (Nov. 2018), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/impact-\ndhs-public-charge-rule-immigration. \n37 Jie Zong & Jeanne Batalova, The Limited English Proficient Population in the United States, Migration Pol’y Inst. \n(July 8, 2018), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/limited-english-proficient-population-united-states.  \n44 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 45 of 85\n \n154.  This change lacks a rational relationship to the determination of whether an \napplicant will depend on governmental resources, since immigrants who speak limited English \ncan readily find employment in industries that do not require frequent employee communication \nas well as within non-English speaking communities.  Furthermore, this factor also runs afoul the \nfederal government’s obligation not to discriminate on the basis of national origin.  \n155.  Moreover, the Rule’s mandatory consideration of household size irrationally \ndisfavors families that live together and pool resources, and will further disfavor immigrants of \ncolor who tend to reside in larger households comprised of multiple generations.  See 84 Fed. \nReg. 41,501-41,502; 8 C.F.R. §212.21(d). \n156.  DHS acknowledges the Rule’s impact on immigrants of color and recognizes the \npossibility that the Rule would have discriminatory effects, but does nothing to meaningfully \naddress or ameliorate the disproportionate harms to non-white immigrant communities.  Id. at \n41,322.          \nc.  The Weighted Circumstances Test Unlawfully and Arbitrarily \nTargets Immigrants Who Are Not Likely to Become Public Charges. \n157.  The weighted circumstances test targets immigrants who Congress never intended \nto consider public charges.  Under the INA, a public charge is an applicant who is likely to \nbecome permanently and primarily dependent on the government for support.   \n158.  But the weighted circumstances test targets applicants who are not remotely likely \nto become permanently and primarily dependent on the government for support.  For example, \nwithout reasoned analysis, the Final Rule counts a large family as a negative factor, even though \nmore family members may be able to contribute to the family’s shared finances.  The weighted \ncircumstances test also undervalues the significance of affidavits of support, which have \n45 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 46 of 85\n \ntraditionally allowed and encouraged family members to take financial responsibility for one \nanother.    \n159.  Under the Rule, applicants who work (or are employable) are likely to be deemed \npublic charges simply because, among other things, they earn (or are likely to earn) moderate or \nlow incomes, obtain health insurance using premium tax subsidies designed to assist moderate- \nor low-income working individuals and families, or use small amounts of non-cash supplemental \npublic benefits.  The weighted circumstances test thus goes far beyond Congress’s intent in \nenacting the public charge inquiry, and far beyond DHS’s authority. \nd.  The Weighted Circumstances Test Arbitrarily Deters Immigrants \nfrom Accepting Benefits to Which They Are Legally Entitled. \n160.  The weighted circumstances test deters immigrant applicants from enrolling in \nbenefits programs to which they are legally entitled in contravention of Congressional intent.  In \nthe decades since the Welfare Reform Act, Congress expressed an intent to provide non-citizens \nwith access to basic food, health care, and housing needs.   \n161.  Additionally, Congress has specified, in particular, that SNAP may not be \nconsidered against recipients as income or resources under any federal, state, or local law.  See 7 \nU.S.C. § 2017(b). \n162.  Despite this, the new test heavily weighs as a negative factor any use of the \nenumerated public benefits for an aggregate of 12 months within the last 36 months of the \nimmigrant’s application.  Under the Final Rule, the statutory protections for these benefits \nbecome illusory; a non-citizen could not enroll in benefits programs without being heavily \npenalized for exercising that right.  \n163.  As in the disability context, the weighted circumstances test double counts use of \nlegally protected benefits against applicants.  For example, a single working mother who \n46 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 47 of 85\n \nreceived food stamps for the previous year starts the test with a heavily weighted negative factor \nbecause she used benefits for an aggregate of 12 months within the 36 months.  Because, in order \nto qualify for SNAP benefits, she must make below 125 percent of the FPG, she receives an \nadditional negative factor for her income and is disqualified from the countervailing heavily \npositive factor of making 250 percent of the FPG.  She also receives a negative financial status \nrating for her use of public benefits.  The Final Rule’s calculus imposes multiple, separate \ndemerits based on a single factual predicate.    \ne.  The Weighted Circumstances Test Arbitrarily Penalizes Immigrants \nwith Limited Resources at the Time of Application. \n164.  The Final Rule’s changes to the totality of circumstances test ensure that \nimmigrants with limited resources at the time of their application will face a nearly \ninsurmountable burden to escape a public charge finding—even if they are hardworking and \nproductive members of Plaintiffs’ communities.    \n165.  The Rule counts a household income of less than 125 percent of the FPG as a \nnegative factor even if the applicant has not received any of the enumerated public benefits.  The \nRule arbitrarily targets hardworking immigrants simply because they work in moderate- or low-\npaying jobs.  For example, the annual income of applicants who hold steady jobs that are \nimportant to Plaintiffs’ economies—including childcare and early education providers, food-\nservice workers, and farm workers—are often at or below the Rule’s 125 percent income cutoff.  \n166.  DHS fails to offer any rationale for why the Rule counts a household income of \nless than 125 percent of the FPG as a negative factor.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,413-16.  DHS states \nonly that the 125 threshold is an appropriate measure for sponsors who provide affidavits to \nsupport otherwise inadmissible applicants.  Yet the threshold for sponsors, who undertake the \nobligation to support themselves as well as the immigrant applicant, has no bearing on \n47 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 48 of 85\n \nappropriate income threshold for the applicant herself.  DHS does not justify the departure from \nthe current standard, which requires an income threshold sufficient to keep applicants from \nbecoming primarily dependent on government income-replacement programs.    \n167.  The weighted circumstance test’s consideration of an applicant’s credit score is \nsimilarly without rational explanation.  DHS does not provide any support for the conclusion that \nan individual’s credit score is indicative of whether he or she is likely to become dependent on \ngovernment assistance in the future.  Id. at 41,425-28.  \n3.  DHS Underestimates and Fails to Quantify Widespread Harms. \n168.  The Final Rule’s Regulatory Impact Analysis simply declines to quantify or \nassess many of the very real harms that Defendants admit will arise from the Final Rule.   \n169.  While DHS concludes that federal and state governments will reduce their direct \nbenefits payments to immigrants by approximately $2 billion annually, DHS fails to even \nattempt to quantify the bulk of the countervailing costs attributable to the Rule.  84 Fed. Reg. at \n41,485.  For example, this estimate does not account for downstream indirect costs on state and \nlocal economies, see id. at 41,489-90, nor does it consider many of the longer-term costs on a \npopulation that will, as a result of the Rule, become sicker, poorer, and less educated. \n170.  First, DHS severely underestimates the Final Rule’s chilling effect.  The \nDepartment acknowledges that experts predict that 24 to 25 million people will forgo or disenroll \nin benefits, but then estimates without basis that the Rule will only affect approximately 700,000 \npeople.  Id. at 41,463.            \n171.  The Final Rule also acknowledges that DHS did not attempt to quantify many \nsignificant costs, including effects on “potential lost productivity, [a]dverse health effects, \n[a]dditional medical expenses due to delayed health care treatment, and [i]ncreased disability \n48 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 49 of 85\n \ninsurance claims, [and] a]dministrative changes to business processes such as reprogramming \ncomputer software and redesigning application forms and processing.”  Id. at 41,489.  \n172.  Specifically, the Final Rule recognizes but refuses to quantify “increases in \nuncompensated health care or greater reliance on food banks or other charities,” id. at 41,485,  \nand “reduced revenues for health care providers participating in Medicaid, companies that \nmanufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals, grocery retailers participating in SNAP, \nagricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, or \nlandlords participating in federally funded housing program.”  Id. at 41,486. \n173.  The Final Rule also did not include a federalism analysis nor did it account for the \nRule’s effect on state tax revenue and economic activity, which likely decrease due to the rise in \nillness and poverty.  Id. at 41,492. \nG.  Defendants Were Motivated by Animus toward Immigrants and Latino \nCommunities When Adopting the Final Rule. \n174.  Defendants were fully aware of the disparate impact that Final Rule will have on \nLatino communities and other immigrants of color.  Indeed, Defendants proposed the Rule \nspecifically to prevent members of those communities from residing permanently or obtaining \ncitizenship in the United States, a result desired by Defendants.  The Final Rule is of a piece with \nthe Administration’s rhetoric and policies, which have long reflected a deep animus toward \nimmigrants of color and Latino communities.   \n175.  President Trump has long engaged in rhetoric that disparages Latinos and \nimmigrants of color.  In statements stretching back to the beginning of his campaign, President \nTrump has repeatedly dehumanized, devalued, and vilified immigrants in general, and \nspecifically immigrants from Latin America.  For instance: \na.  During his campaign launch in June 2015, President Trump claimed that “[w]hen \n49 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 50 of 85\n \nMexico sends its people. . . .

It’s coming from more than Mexico.  It’s \ncoming from all over South and Latin America.”38 \nb.  In December 2015, President Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of \nMuslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure \nout what the hell is going on.”39 \nc.  In December 2016, in an interview with TIME magazine, President Trump stated \nin reference to a supposed crime wave on Long Island, “They come from Central \nAmerica.  They’re tougher than any people you’ve ever met.  They’re killing and \nraping everybody out there.  They’re illegal.  And they are finished.”40 \nd.  During a meeting regarding a proposed immigration reform package in the Oval \nOffice in June 2017, President Trump stated that 15,000 immigrants from Haiti \n“all have AIDS” and that 40,000 immigrants from Nigeria would never “go back \nto their huts” in Africa after seeing the United States.41 \ne.  On June 28, 2017, speaking of immigrants, President Trump stated, “They are bad \npeople.  And we’ve gotten many of them out already . . . .

During a January 2018 meeting with lawmakers, while discussing protections for \nimmigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and other African countries, President Trump \nasked why the United States is “having all these people from shithole countries \ncome here” and suggested that the United States should have more immigrants \nfrom countries like Norway.43 \ng.  In a May 16, 2018 speech, President Trump stated that “[w]e have people coming \ninto the country, or trying to come in . . . You wouldn’t believe how bad these \npeople are.  These aren’t people, these are animals.”44 \nh.  At an event on April 7, 2019, President Trump claimed that the asylum program \nin the United States was a “scam,” claiming beneficiaries were “some of the \nroughest people you’ve ever seen,” and that they “carry[] the flag of Honduras or \nGuatemala or El Salvador, only to say [they are] petrified to be in [their] \ncountry.”45 \ni.

Indeed, several senior level officials at the DHS, including the official responsible \nfor implementing the public charge rule, have similarly expressed their animus towards \nimmigrants of color.   \na.  On August 13, 2019, just a day after announcing the Final Rule, Defendant \nCuccinelli stated that the famous inscription on the Statue of Liberty, welcoming \n“huddled masses” of immigrants to the United States, only referred to “people \ncoming from Europe.”49 \nb.

You should look over your shoulder.  And you need to be \nworried.”51  \nd.  Homan repeated the threat on June 22, 2017, stating that “[f]or those who get by \nthe Border Patrol they need to understand there’s no safe haven in the United \nStates . . . if you happen to get by the Border Patrol, ICE is looking for you.”  \nLater he clarified that while the enforcement priorities were those who committed \ncrimes, “[n]ow the message is clear: If you’re in the United States illegally . . . \nsomeone is looking for you.  And that message is clear.”52  \ne.  In January 2019, Mark Morgan, the current Acting Director of ICE, speaking of \nchildren detained in border facilities stated, “I’ve been to detention facilities \nwhere I’ve walked up to these individuals that are so-called minors, 17 or under.  \nI’ve looked at them I’ve looked at their eyes . . . and I’ve said that is a soon-to-be \nMS-13 gang member.

Defendants have acted on this rhetoric by adopting policies that seek to isolate \nand exclude Latino immigrants and other immigrants of color.  For instance, the Trump \nAdministration has: \na.  Rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected \n800,000 individuals, 90 percent of which were Latino and 80 percent of which \nwere Mexican-American; \nb.  Banned travel from several majority-Muslim countries;  \nc.  Suspended refugee admissions to the United States;  \nd.  Terminated special protections from removal for migrants from nations \nexperiencing war and natural disasters, including Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti and \nEl Salvador;  \ne.

Further, President Trump and Defendants, including and senior officials in the \nDHS have explicitly sought to disparage immigrant use of public benefits.  These comments \noften contain false and misleading assertions that generically characterize immigrants, and \nespecially immigrants of color, as poor, a drain on the United States, and taking advantage of \nUnited States citizens:  \na.  On July 18, 2015, President Trump tweeted: “It’s a national embarrassment that \nan illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care.”56  \nb.  On June 21, 2017, during a rally, President Trump demanded “new immigration \nrules which say those seeking admission into our country must be able to support \nthemselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five \nyears.”57  However, immigrants are already held to this standard.   \nc.  In August 2017, while announcing his support of the RAISE Act, a bill designed \nto decrease the population of Latino immigrants and immigrants of color in the \nUnited States by restricting family-based visas, President Trump stated that the \n                                                 \n55 UN News, After Rio Grande tragedy, UNICEF chief highlights “dire” detention centers on US-Mexico border \n(June 27, 2019), https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1041421. \n56 Donald J.

During a press conference on August 2, 2017, Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to \nPresident Trump, misleadingly claimed that “roughly half of immigrant head of \nhouseholds in the United States receive some type of welfare benefit.”59  But \nresearchers have shown that poor immigrant households use less welfare than \npoor non-immigrant households.60 \ne.  At the same press conference, Stephen Miller went on to falsely state that the \nUnited States “issue[s] a million green cards to foreign nationals from all the \ncountries of the world” without regard to “whether they can pay their own way or \nbe reliant on welfare.”61 \nf.  On March 11, 2019, during an interview, President Trump said: “I don’t want to \nhave anyone coming in that’s on welfare.”  He continued “I don’t like the idea of \npeople coming in and going on welfare for 50 years, and that’s what they want to \nbe able to do—and it’s no good.”62  \ng.

The Final Rule Harms the Plaintiffs. \n179.  The Final Rule’s destructive and far-reaching consequences significantly frustrate \nPlaintiffs’ obligations to provide for the social and economic well-being of their residents, harms \nPlaintiffs’ economies, and inflicts substantial and burdensome administrative costs on Plaintiffs’ \ninstitutions.   \n1.  The Final Rule Will Have a Broad Chilling Effect on Public Benefits \nEnrollment. \n180.  The Final Rule will result in non-citizens withdrawing from or forgoing \nenrollment in public benefit programs that their tax dollars support, and to which they are legally \nentitled. The Final Rule may also result in harm to American citizens who share a case with a \nnon-citizen household member. \n181.  With respect to those individuals directly affected by the Final Rule, DHS \nabsurdly “expects that [non-citizens] . . . will make purposeful and well-informed decisions \ncommensurate with the immigration status they are seeking.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312.  But the \nonly decision for which the Final Rule’s weighted test effectively allows is for immigrants to \nmake the impossible choice of either forgoing critical public benefits, or risking being found \nlikely to become a public charge, resulting in denial of admission or adjustment of status.  \n                                                 \n63 Stephen Dinan, HUD moves to cancel illegal immigrants’ public housing access, Wash. Times (April 17, 2019) \nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/17/hud-moves-cancel-illegal-immigrants-public-housing/. \n57 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 58 of 85\n \n182.  Moreover, millions of immigrants—including many of Plaintiffs’ residents—will \nbe frightened and confused about the potential consequences of applying for benefits and will \nforgo public assistance altogether, even if the Final Rule does not implicate their immigration \nstatus or include a particular benefit in the public charge analysis. \n183.  Nonprofit research and education entities estimate that Plaintiff States will \nexperience disenrollment from public benefits at rates between 15 to 35 percent.64 \n184.  Indeed, this chilling effect has already begun.  Families, responding to rumors and \nnews reports that use of public benefits would have adverse immigration consequences,65 began \ndisenrolling from multiple public benefit programs even before the publication of the Proposed \nRule.  The Final Rule will exacerbate the chilling effect and the number of immigrants forgoing \ncritical and sometimes life-saving public benefits will increase.  \n185.  For example, a web and phone survey of citizens and non-citizens in the \ncommunity commissioned by the City of New York in December 2018 and January 2019 \nconfirmed that many fear the impact of changes to the public charge rule.  The survey showed \nthat, because of concern over public charge, three-quarters of the non-citizens surveyed (76 \npercent) would consider withdrawing from or not applying for services, even if the survey \nrespondent felt he or she needed the services.   \n186.  Additionally, frontline staff members from Health + Hospitals and DOHMH have \nobserved and reported that clients have disenrolled from or expressed reluctance to enroll in \n                                                 \n64 “Only Wealthy Immigrants Need Apply”: How a Trump Rule’s Chilling Effect Will Harm the U.S., Fiscal Pol’y \nInst.

Vermont’s multiple refugee resettlement communities face similar concerns.  \nRefugees are exempt from the Final Rule and may continue to receive public benefits without \njeopardizing their immigration status.  However, many refugees have families with mixed \nimmigration statuses.  Fear and confusion surrounding the Final Rule will likely result in \nrefugees, as well as their non-refugee family members, disenrolling in critical benefits that help \nthem successfully integrate.   \n188.  Vermont’s Refugee Health Program, which is managed through the Department \nof Health at the Agency of Human Services, works to protect and promote the health of refugees \nfrom the time they arrive in Vermont.  The Program collaborates with community partners to \nhelp refugees integrate into the health care system.  Among other things, all eligible refugees are \nimmediately enrolled in Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF when they arrive in Vermont. \nReenrollment after the initial resettlement period is challenging and can cause substantial \nconfusion.  Immigrants and refugees in Vermont have already demonstrated anxiety and fear \nsurrounding the changes to the public charge rule. \n189.  The Final Rule will harm children with at least one non-citizen parent, regardless \nof the child’s citizenship status.  Approximately 9.2 million of the 10.5 million children with at \nleast one immigrant parent in the United States are American citizens by birth.66  \n                                                 \n66 Jeanne Batalova et al., Chilling Effects: The Expected Public Charge Rule and Its Impact on Legal Immigrant \nFamilies’ Public Benefits Use, Migration Pol’y Inst.

Children thrive when their families thrive.  When the immigrant parents of citizen \nchildren disenroll or decline to enroll in public benefits, their children will suffer too.  Tragically, \nexperts estimate that up to 2 million citizen children will disenroll from medical insurance and \nup to 3 million will disenroll from food supplement programs as a result of the Final Rule.67   \n191.  DHS is aware of the devastating impact of the Final Rule on residents who \ndepend on the enumerated public benefits and on residents who depend on benefits that are not \ndirectly subject to the Rule.  After enactment of the Welfare Reform Act in the mid-1990s, there \nwas a sharp decline in the usage of benefits, even among groups whose eligibility remained \nunchanged.  This trend prompted the INS to publish the 1999 Field Guidance to “reduce negative \npublic health and nutrition consequences generated by the confusion.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,133.  \n192.  Defendants acknowledge that the Final Rule would affect Plaintiffs’ residents \nregardless of whether the Final Rule directly applies to their immigration status.  84 Fed. Reg. at \n41,312.  \n193.  Additionally, DHS concedes that the chilling effect will have far-reaching \nconsequences with respect to food insecurity, housing scarcity, public health and vaccinations, \neducation health-based services, reimbursement to health providers, and increased costs to states \nand localities.  Id. at 41,313.  \n2.  The Final Rule Will Result in Negative Public Health Outcomes.  \na.  The Final Rule will Harm Public Health.  \n194.  The Final Rule will endanger health insurance coverage for a substantial number \nof Plaintiffs’ residents and cause significant harms to the public health.  \n                                                 \n67 Artiga et al., supra note 64. \n60 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 61 of 85\n \n195.  In New York, up to 2 million non-citizens and their citizen children enrolled in \nMedicaid, Child Health Plus (New York’s version of CHIP), and other health care options \navailable through the State may choose to disenroll from these programs because of the Final \nRule.         \n196.  New York City’s Health + Hospitals estimates that over 200,000 of its patients \ncould be either directly affected by the Final Rule or change their behavior out of concern about \nthe Final Rule even if they are not directly impacted by the Final Rule itself.  Health + Hospitals \nexpects that patients will respond to the Final Rule in three ways if they believe their use of \npublic benefits could endanger their ability to attain immigration relief in the future, or if they \nbelieve it may impact the ability of a household member to attain immigration relief in the \nfuture: First, patients may disenroll.  Second, patients may use fewer preventative services \nresulting in a downstream increase of high-severity and inpatient services.  Third, patients may \nmake it more difficult for healthcare providers to collect identifying information, and thus \nadversely affect Health + Hospitals’ ability to collect payment for services.  Each of these \npotential responses has detrimental consequences for the City.   \n197.  In Connecticut, an estimated 45,000 children with non-citizen parents participate \nin Medicaid or CHIP, known in Connecticut as HUSKY A and HUSKY B.68  Based on the \nprojected disenrollment rates from nonprofit institutes, between 6,750 to 15,750 children in \nConnecticut may lose health care coverage because of the Final Rule.  \n198.  By deterring participation in Medicaid, CHIP, and other health insurance \nprograms Plaintiff States administer, the Final Rule undermines Plaintiffs’ interest in improving \n                                                 \n68 Samantha Artiga et al., Potential Effects of Public Charge Changes on Health Coverage for Citizen Children, The \nHenry J. Kaiser Fam. Found. (May 18, 2018), https://www.kff.org/report-section/potential-effects-of-public-charge-\nchanges-on-health-coverage-for-citizen-children-appendix/. \n61 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 62 of 85\n \nboth short- and long-term health and advancing public health interests for both immigrants and \ncitizens. \n199.  An increase in uninsured residents will have significant adverse effects on \nindividuals’ well-being and the public health of Plaintiff States and of New York City.  \nImmigrants will delay care, avoid seeking treatment, and fall back on financially strained public \nand nonprofit clinics and hospitals for emergency care.  Children are at significant risk: because \nuninsured children will not have access to routine well-child visits and primary care, they will be \nat greater risk for potentially serious health issues and will be more likely to rely on emergency \nroom visits for treatments.   \n200.  Lack of access to primary care not only puts the health and well-being of non-\ncitizens at risk but also jeopardizes Plaintiffs’ ability to provide for the well-being of all their \nresidents.  For example, because uninsured persons are less likely to receive immunizations, \nthere is an increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases to the entire community.  Additionally, \nNew York City agencies are concerned that patients will fail to seek testing and treatment for \ncommunicable diseases, leading to poor health outcomes and increasing the risk of disease \ntransmission.   \n201.  The Final Rule will also imperil New York’s significant progress in combatting \nthe spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by reducing enrollment in Medicaid and thus decreasing \naccess to HIV prophylaxis, testing, and care; chilling participation in federal, State, and City \nprograms and services for people with HIV; and discouraging HIV testing.  New York’s \nMedicaid Program for Persons with HIV assists nearly 67,000 New Yorkers by providing health \ncare and other supportive services.  New York State’s AIDS Drug Assistance Program helps \nensure access to HIV medication for uninsured and underinsured persons; and federal programs, \n62 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 63 of 85\n \nsuch as Ryan White, help ensure access to primary medical care, essential support services, and \nmedications for people living with HIV.  \n202.  Treating persons with HIV and persons at risk for HIV helps prevents the \ntransmission and acquisition of HIV.  By deterring HIV-positive individuals and those at risk for \nHIV from enrolling in Medicaid and other health insurance programs, non-citizens will not \nreceive life-saving health care and the risk for disease transmission will increase within \nPlaintiffs’ jurisdictions. \nb.  The Final Rule Will Increase Food Insecurity. \n203.  By penalizing immigrant participation in SNAP, the Final Rule undermines \nPlaintiffs’ interest in combatting food insecurity.  While WIC is not an enumerated benefit under \nthe Final Rule, the Rule’s chilling effect extends to the WIC program, which works in tandem \nwith other benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid. \n204.  Food-insecure individuals are disproportionately more likely to experience poor \nphysical health.  Food insecurity has particularly harmful direct and indirect impacts on the \nhealth, development, and overall well-being of children.  For example, children in food-insecure \nhouseholds are more likely to be sick and experience increased behavioral and emotional issues, \nand are less likely to perform well in school.69  \n205.  In an effort to stretch their food budget, food-insecure immigrants will be more \nlikely to engage in cost-saving strategies that harm their health.  For example, individuals will \n                                                 \n69 The Impact of Poverty, Food Insecurity, and Poor Nutrition on Health and Well-Being, Food Res. & Action Ctr. 1 \n(Dec. 2017), http://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/hunger-health-impact-poverty-food-insecurity-health-well-\nbeing.pdf. \n63 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 64 of 85\n \npurchase inexpensive and nutrient-poor food; underuse or skip medication; and choose between \nhaving food and having adequate housing, transportation, health care, and utilities.70  \n206.  Additionally, because fewer non-citizen mothers and their children will \nparticipate in WIC, both will be at risk of birth complications, malnutrition, and even death.  \nMoreover, non-citizen mothers will not receive other health supports that WIC provides, like \nbreastfeeding support services.  By deterring non-citizen mothers from accessing these services, \nthe Final Rule will put children at greater risk of short- and long-term adverse health effects that \nare correlated with reductions in breastfeeding, including diabetes, obesity, and chronic disease, \nas well as reduced cognitive development. \nc.  The Final Rule Will Increase Housing Insecurity. \n207.  The Final Rule’s inclusion of housing assistance programs and its overall chilling \neffect on seeking public assistance will discourage individuals and families from participating in \naffordable housing programs.  Individuals deterred from participating in housing programs \nbecause of the Final Rule will face substantial challenges in finding affordable housing and \navoiding homelessness.  For example, the New York State housing market is plagued by low \nvacancy rates and high rents.  Specifically, the vacancy rate in New York State for non-rural \nareas is 4.3 percent compared to 6.1 percent nationally.  Nearly 80 percent of New Yorkers \nliving in non-rural areas confront a rental housing market that has less than a 5 percent vacancy \nrate.  Extremely low vacancy rates can be found throughout New York, including in Albany, \nBuffalo, New Rochelle, Troy, White Plains, and New York City.  Additionally, the median rent \nin New York State is $1,075, hundreds of dollars higher than the national median rent of $827.  \n                                                 \n70 Eleanor Goldberg, 8 Impossible Choices People Who Can’t Afford Food Make Every Day, HuffPost (Oct. 23, \n2014), https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hunger-statistics-us_n_6029332. \n64 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 65 of 85\n \nThe disparity is even wider for many municipalities throughout New York, including New York \nCity and Hempstead.   \n208.  Non-citizens will also incur substantial and potentially prohibitive costs, including \nthousands of dollars for deposits, brokers’ fees, up-front rental payments, and storage and \nmoving fees. \n209.  Once an individual forgoes housing because of the Final Rule, it will be very \ndifficult for such an individual to reenroll in housing programs to receive the benefits they once \nhad.  For example, all federal housing programs in New York State have waiting lists, and once \nindividuals terminate their housing benefit, they will not be able to return to their old apartment \nor neighborhood. \n210.  Further, housing insecurity has negative health impacts.  Scarce affordable \nhousing can cause families to cohabitate in crowded, multi-family households, which can have \nnegative health effects from overcrowding and stress.  \n211.  Housing instability and homelessness further contribute to severe stress and \nmental health issues, including depression and anxiety—health issues that may follow children \ninto adulthood.  Additionally, children who experience housing instability are less likely to \nperform well in school and are more likely to experience economic insecurity in adulthood.  \n3.  The Final Rule Will Harm State Economic Interests.  \n212.  If adopted, the Final Rule will cause Plaintiff States to suffer massive federal \nfunding cuts, significant economic ripple effects, and thousands of lost jobs.  Specifically, even \nestimating that only 15 percent of households containing at least one non-citizen would disenroll \nin SNAP and Medicaid—enumerated benefits under the Final Rule—the Final Rule’s chilling \neffect will collectively cost Plaintiff States approximately $1.1 billion in federal funding; $2.3 \nbillion in economic ripple effects; and 15,816 lost jobs.  If benefits disenrollment reaches 35 \n65 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 66 of 85\n \npercent, Plaintiff States collectively stand to lose $2.7 billion in federal funding; $5.5 billion in \nripple effects and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.71 \na.  The Final Rule Will Increase State Medical and Hospital Costs. \n213.  The Final Rule will shift the costs of health care to hospitals and state and local \ngovernments.  Moreover, the health care costs state and local governments will bear will increase \noverall and cause significant financial strain on these institutions.  Because individuals without \nhealth insurance wait longer to seek care, the care they eventually receive from emergency \nrooms is more costly.  \n214.  Because Medicaid and other health insurance programs offered through the NYS \nMarketplace have made health insurance more affordable, the number of uninsured New Yorkers \nhas decreased.  In 2013, the uninsured rate was 10 percent—it is now 4.7 percent because of \nincreased health insurance coverage, including through Medicaid.  The Final Rule will reverse \nthis progress. \n215.  NYC Health + Hospitals estimates that if 20 percent of potentially affected \nMedicaid enrollees were to drop their health insurance, over 15,000 insured patients would \nbecome uninsured and Health + Hospitals would face a significant financial loss as a result in the \nfirst year of the Final Rule being in effect.   \n216.  DOHMH may face increased costs for clinic services resulting from \nuncompensated care due to its obligation to provide certain types of care that it must provide \nregardless of a patient’s ability to pay; this may be compounded by an influx of uninsured \npatients.   \n                                                 \n71 Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Reduced Food and Medical Assistance,” Fiscal Pol’y Inst. (2018), \nhttp://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/50-states-economic-impact-of-public-charge-1.pdf. \n66 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 67 of 85\n \n217.  In Connecticut—again, because of improved Medicaid access—the uninsured rate \nfor low-income people making less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level fell from 27 \npercent in 2013 to 15 percent in 2017, while the overall uninsured rate fell from 9 percent to 6 \npercent.    \n218.  In Vermont, the overall uninsured rate fell from 7 percent to 4 percent during the \nsame time frame.72   \n219.  Plaintiffs will be also responsible for the substantial financial burden of increased \nhealth care costs associated with the decline in SNAP and WIC usage.  Children who grow up \nwith resulting higher rates of disease and malnutrition will likely need to rely on health care \nprovided by state governments to treat these long-term issues.  \nb.  The Final Rule Will Shift Costs to Plaintiffs’ Benefit Programs.  \n220.  The Final Rule will shift the costs of providing non-cash, supplemental benefits to \nstate and local governments.  Like Congress, many state and local governments provide non-cash \nsupplemental benefits to their residents to further critical public policy goals—such as improving \ngeneral public health and nutrition, promoting education and child health, and assisting working \nfamilies to maintain or achieve economic stability.   \n221.  The Final Rule will transfer costs to these and other similar programs, forcing \nPlaintiffs to bear costs that Congress intended the federal government to share.  As many \nimmigrants disenroll or forgo the use of supplemental benefits enumerated in the Final Rule, \nPlaintiffs will need to try to cover the costs of providing such supplemental benefits to promote \nthe health, nutrition, education, and housing security of their residents.     \n                                                 \n72 Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population, The Henry J. Kaiser Fam. Found., \nhttps://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-\npopulation/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D  \n67 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 68 of 85\n \nc.  The Final Rule Will Negatively Affect the Labor Force. \n222.  Deterring non-citizens from enrolling in Medicaid and other health insurance \nprograms will negatively affect the workforce.  Without routine, preventive health care, \nemployees will be more likely to miss work because of their own illnesses or because they have \nto care for sick family members.  This instability in the workforce will diminish economic \nproductivity.  \n223.  The increase in uninsured workers will significantly affect the health care \nindustry, which disproportionately employs immigrants in lower-skilled positions such as \nnursing and home-health aides.  In New York, 59 percent of employees in these fields are \nimmigrants—the highest share nationally.  Harms to this workforce will have cascading impacts \nin the fields and markets where these workers are employed.   \n224.  Because home health agencies and nursing homes are less likely to provide \nemployer-sponsored insurance, their employees are more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid.  A \nsicker health-care workforce may result in a labor shortage, harming the workers and the \nindividuals cared for by the workers.   \n225.  In Vermont, the increase in uninsured workers will affect the farming, fishing, \nand forestry industry, in which 13.4 percent of all workers are immigrants.73  Like lower-skilled \nhealth care workers, agricultural workers are unlikely to receive employer-sponsored insurance \nand therefore more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid. \n226.  The decrease in Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC enrollment for children, which will \nworsen health outcomes, will also impede their academic success, and thus limit their economic \ncontributions in the future.   \n                                                 \n73  Immigrants in Vermont, Am. Immigr. Council, 3 (2017), \nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/immigrants_in_vermont.pdf. \n68 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 69 of 85\n \n227.  Additionally, the decrease in safe and stable housing interferes with children’s \neducational and financial prospects.       \nd.  The Final Rule Will Decrease Economic Productivity. \n228.  Research has shown that SNAP helps to stimulate state and local economies.  The \nSNAP program has a direct economic multiplier effect: for every one dollar in SNAP benefits \nreceived, there is an approximate $1.79 in increased economic activity.74   \n229.  In 2017, New York had one of the highest number of SNAP benefit redemptions \nin the United States, along with California, Texas, and Florida.  More than $4.7 billion federal \nSNAP dollars were spent in New York State at the more than 18,600 authorized retailers, \nincluding supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores.75   \n230.  In 2017, Connecticut SNAP recipients spent $653.08 million at some 2,600 \napproved authorized retail locations, buoying the state's economy. 76 \n231.  In 2017, Vermont SNAP recipients spent $112.95 million at 700 authorized \nlocations in the State.77  \n                                                 \n74 Kenneth Hanson, The Food Assistance National Input-Output Multiplier (FANIOM) Model and Stimulus Effects \nof SNAP, U.S. Dep’t of Agric., iv (Oct. 2010), \nhttps://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/44748/7996_err103_1_.pdf?v=0.   \n75  U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Fiscal Year 2017 At a Glance, 3 (Jan. 16, 2018), https://fns-\nprod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/snap/2017-SNAP-Retailer-Management-Year-End-Summary.pdf. \n76 Catlin Nchako & Lexin Cai, A Closer Look at Who Benefits from SNAP: State-by-State Fact Sheets, Ctr. for \nBudget and Pol’y Priorities (Dec. 3, 2018), https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-\nbenefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Connecticut \n77 Catlin Nchako & Lexin Cai, A Closer Look at Who Benefits from SNAP: State-by-State Fact Sheets, Ctr. for \nBudget and Pol’y Priorities (Dec. 3, 2018), https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-\nbenefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Vermont. \n69 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 70 of 85\n \n232.  SNAP also benefits local farms in New York.  In 2017, approximately 60,000 \nNew York households spent $3.4 million federal SNAP dollars at authorized farmers’ markets \nthroughout the State.78  \n233.  Vermont SNAP recipients are eligible for “crop cash,” a program funded by the \nUSDA that incentivizes spending SNAP benefits at local farmer’s markets.79  In 2018, recipients \nspent $62,533 in crop cash in Vermont. \ne.  The Final Rule Will Increase the Cost of Providing Shelter. \n234.  The lack of participation in affordable housing programs will increase emergency \nshelter use, which will place a substantial financial strain on states and municipalities.  It is \nsignificantly more expensive to house a family in an emergency shelter than to provide long-term \nhousing through either public housing or Section 8.  In 2016, it cost Connecticut an average of \nover $91 per night – or $33,360 per year – to shelter a homeless person, as against an average of \n$15,198 annually to rent a HUD-subsidy-eligible two-bedroom apartment at the average \nstatewide HUD-determined fair market rent.80  In Vermont, the average cost for emergency \nhousing from the state general assistance fund was $74 per night.  \n4.  The Final Rule Interferes With Obligations Under State Law.  \n235.  The Final Rule will significantly impede the ability of Plaintiffs, their agencies, \nand their institutions to provide critical care and services to their residents, including those as \nmandated by state law.  The Rule’s chilling effect prevents Plaintiffs and their agencies from \nfulfilling their mandate to provide aid to their residents.   \n                                                 \n78  Press Release, N.Y.S. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor Cuomo Announces Plan to Protect SNAP \nRecipients’ Access to Farmers’ Markets (July 27, 2018), https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-\nannounces-plan-protect-snap-recipients-access-farmers-markets. \n79 NOFA-VT, https://nofavt.org/cropcash.  \n80  CECHI: Connecticut Estimating Costs of Child Homelessness Initiative (Apr. 26, 2016),  \nhttp://www.pschousing.org/files/CECHI_4_21_16-2final.pdf. \n70 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 71 of 85\n \n236.  For example, Article XVII of the New York State Constitution provides that “the \naid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state and by \nsuch of its subdivisions.”  N.Y. Const., art. XVII, § 1.  It also provides that “the protection and \npromotion of the health of the inhabitants of the state are matters of public concern and provision \ntherefore shall be made by the state and by such of its subdivisions.”  Id.   \n237.  In accordance with this constitutional mandate, the New York State Legislature \ncreated OTDA, and charged it with providing for the health and well-being of New York \nresidents.  The New York Legislature has made clear that this includes providing “family \nassistance,” “safety net assistance,” and “medical assistance” to non-citizens.  See N.Y. Social \nServices Law § 122.  Because the Final Rule deters non-citizens from accessing benefits that and \nother New York State agencies administer, the Final Rule would significantly frustrate OTDA’s \nconstitutional and statutory responsibilities. \n238.  Similarly, in New York State, the Office for New Americans (“ONA”)—a \nstatutorily-created state-level immigrant services office—is charged with helping immigrants \nfully and successfully integrate into their communities through, among other things, English \nlanguage instruction and job training.  Because the Final Rule would cause immigrants to forgo \nservices necessary to their health and well-being, the Final Rule would impede ONA’s ability to \nprovide its core services, and will instead force ONA to divert resources to deal with the effects \nof unmet basic needs, and the burdens that the Final Rule imposes.  For example, attorneys that \nONA’s resources support may need to divert significant staff time to assisting immigrants \ncomplete the forms that the Final Rule requires. \n71 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 72 of 85\n \n5.  The Final Rule Imposes Programmatic and Administrative Burdens on \nPlaintiffs and Their Institutions. \n239.  The Final Rule will impose significant additional programmatic and \nadministrative burdens on the state and local agencies that administer many of the programs that \nare included in the public charge analysis, or will be implicated by the Final Rule’s chilling \neffect.   \n240.  Plaintiffs will no longer be able to consistently rely on current systems they have \ninvested in to streamline benefits enrollment, and will need to instead employ costly and time-\nconsuming processes that will strain their budgets.   \n241.  For example, New York, Connecticut, and Vermont commonly determine \nwhether individuals are income-eligible for WIC based on their participation in programs like \nMedicaid and SNAP.  Because the Final Rule will result in a decrease in participation in \nMedicaid and SNAP among WIC families, WIC staff will no longer be able to rely on such \nparticipation to determine income-eligibility for many individuals.   \n242.  Accordingly, state agency staff will need to spend additional time conducting \nincome assessments for WIC applicants, which is one of the most burdensome elements of the \nprocess.  \n243.  Plaintiffs will also need to undertake significant efforts to educate agency staff \nand the public on the Final Rule.  Indeed, although DHS significantly underestimates the costs of \nfamiliarizing individuals with the Final Rule, it acknowledges these costs exist, and will burden a \nwide variety of Plaintiffs’ entities.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,467, 41,488.    \n244.  NYC Health + Hospitals will incur significant costs to implement the Final Rule, \nwhich will include costs for staff training, outreach, preparation of materials, and additional \nfinancial counseling and legal services to support its patients.  MetroPlus, the managed care plan \n72 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 73 of 85\n \nowned by Health + Hospitals, would also experience a negative financial impact related to \ndecreased enrollment and the cost of implementation.   \n245.  NYSDOH expects to expend approximately $8.3 million because of the Final \nRule.  These costs include training the NYS Marketplace customer service center representatives \nand approximately 7,000 in-person assistors who help residents apply for health insurance \nprograms; developing policies and procedures for these representatives to refer non-citizens and \ncitizens with non-citizen family members to other state agencies, like ONA for more information \nwith respect to the Final Rule; and increased call time for customer service center representatives \nresponding to questions about the Rule.  \n246.  Additionally, state agencies will have to divert staff resources to educate \nvulnerable communities, and address increased call volume and traffic from concerned \nresidents.81  In New York, for example, ONA has already expended considerable efforts in \nresponding to the Proposed Rule.  For instance, in response to a significant increase in telephone \ncalls and individuals seeking guidance from ONA’s community partners, ONA hosted a two-day \nphone bank on public charge in early October 2018, which drew over 800 callers, and resulted in \nover 1,000 referrals to other services.  ONA anticipates that because of the Final Rule it will \nneed to continue and intensify these efforts.   \n247.  Likewise, the City of New York has expended and will continue to expend \nsubstantial resources in connection with the new regulation.  The City’s efforts include creating \nand implementing a comprehensive media and community outreach and education campaign, \ndeveloping a script for 311 operators to field calls from New Yorkers concerned about how the \n                                                 \n81 The Office for New Americans, a New York State immigration service, has reported triple the staff time necessary \nto answer questions on public charge and enrollment in public benefits since the Proposed Rule was published.  \n73 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 74 of 85\n \nrule will affect them, participating in over 150 public meetings, developing a City-wide strategy \nwith consistent messaging for use by all affected City Agencies, expanding the scope of the \nCity’s immigration telephone hotline in order to better address New Yorkers’ questions and \nconcerns about the public charge regulation, and connecting New Yorkers who may be \nimpacted—or who fear that they may be impacted—by the regulation with referrals to City-\nfunded, free legal services. \n248.  Moreover, state agencies will have to expend time to process disenrollment \nrequests and applications to re-enroll (“churn”).  Churn is associated with fear-based \ndisenrollment followed by subsequent re-enrollment.  Re-enrollment may happen when \nindividuals learn they are not subject to a public charge determination or when medical or \nnutritional problems advance such that re-enrollment is necessary despite the potential negative \nimpact on the family’s immigration status.   \n249.  In some contexts, the effects of disenrollment and re-enrollment will be \nparticularly costly.  For example, NYSHCR currently has no policies or procedures in place to \nassist individuals in reentering federal housing programs after termination because re-enrollment \nis rare.  If the Final Rule were to go into effect, NYSHCR may need to devise policies and \nprocedures to address how to assist families that may relinquish their housing because of fear, \nbut then may subsequently seek housing because of a change in circumstances.   \n250.  The Final Rule also obligates state and local agencies to provide information to \nUSCIS to determine whether a “public charge bond has been breached.”  Gathering, storing, and \ntransmitting this information will require Plaintiffs either to expend additional resources or to \ndivert resources from other areas to comply.   \n74 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 75 of 85\n \n6.  The Final Rule Harms Plaintiffs’ Interest in Civil Rights. \n251.  Plaintiffs have an interest in promoting and protecting the civil rights of their \ncitizens, which the Final Rule dramatically undermines.  The Final Rule would impose \ndevastating and disproportionate burdens on Plaintiffs’ most vulnerable populations, including \nindividuals with disabilities, women, and people of color.   \na.  The Final Rule Disproportionately Impacts Individuals with \nDisabilities. \n252.  The Final Rule targets and penalizes individuals with disabilities; the Rule will \nhave a direct and disproportionate impact on immigrants with disabilities.  \n253.  Individuals with disabilities disproportionately rely on public benefit programs—\noften because of their disability—to be self-sufficient.  Approximately 33 percent of Medicaid \nenrollees between the ages of 18 and 65 have a disability, as compared with approximately 12 \npercent of adults under the age of 65 in the general United States population.  Additionally, non-\nelderly individuals with disabilities are significantly less likely to have private health \ninsurance—often because of their disability—because of decreased access to employer-provided \nhealth insurance and increased health care needs.82  Medicaid provides preventative and primary \ncare and medical treatment for chronic conditions.  It also provides access to medical devices, \nand home- and community-based services, which are not covered by private insurance.   \n254.  Although the Final Rule exempts services funded through Medicaid but instituted \nthrough the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) and exempts Medicaid \nbenefits received by children themselves, as detailed above, the Final Rule will cause families to \n                                                 \n82 MaryBeth Musumeci & Julia Foutz, Medicaid Restructuring Under the American Health Care Act and \nNonelderly Adults with Disabilities, The Henry J. Kaiser Fam. Found. (Mar. 2017), \nhttp://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Medicaid-Restructuring-Under-the-American-Health-Care-Act-and-\nNonelderly-Adults-with-Disabilities. \n75 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 76 of 85\n \ndisenroll even from benefits that are not technically within the scope of the Final Rule and will \nlikely deter families from enrolling or maintaining their special needs children in Medicaid.  \nPublic health insurance programs like Medicaid provide specialized care and services that help \nchildren with special needs stay healthy, manage their activities of daily living, attend school, \nand, for some, to stay alive.83 \nb.  The Final Rule Disproportionately Impacts Women. \n255.  The Final Rule disproportionately harms women because non-citizen women, \nparticularly women of color, are at a higher risk for economic insecurity than non-citizen men \nare and therefore are more likely to participate in and benefit from the supplemental public \nprograms that the Final Rule targets.  This heightened risk of economic insecurity is due in part \nto pay disparities, discrimination, overrepresentation of immigrant women and especially \nimmigrant women of color in low-wage work, which all inhibit the ability of immigrant women \nto have private health care coverage and food security.  For example, in 2017, 47 percent of non-\ncitizen recipients of Medicaid were women (as compared to 40 percent men and 13 percent \nchildren).  Similarly, 48 percent of non-citizen recipients of SNAP were women (as compared to \n40 percent men and 12 percent children).84 \n256.  Moreover, the Final Rule harms women by including employment history in the \npublic charge analysis.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,503.  Women have a disproportionate \nresponsibility for caregiving duties and immigrant women often forgo careers in the formal \n                                                 \n83 MaryBeth Musumeci & Julia Foutz, Medicaid’s Role for Children with Special Health Care Needs: A Look at \nEligibility, Services, and Spending, The Henry J. Kaiser Fam. Found.

Robert Warren. Integrated Public Use Microdata \nSeries, Current Population Survey: Version 6.0 [dataset].

In the Final Rule, DHS pays lip service \nto this reality by including a provision that permits DHS to consider whether the applicant is a \n“primary caregiver” for an individual presently residing in the applicant’s home.  However, the \nFinal Rule’s primary caregiver consideration applies only to current caregivers, and will not help \nimmigrants whose employment history is limited by their former caregiver role.  See id. at \n41,438, 41,504, 41,438, 41,502 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. 212.21(f)).  Moreover, when \ndetermining whether an applicant is a “primary caregiver,” USCIS will consider evidence of \nwhether the individual is residing in the alien’s home, the individual’s age and medical \ncondition, including disability.  See id. at 41,504.  \n257.  The Final Rule further disproportionately affects women by considering lack of \nhigh school diploma and LEP as indicators of likelihood that an immigrant may become a public \ncharge.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,190, 51,195.  Women receive less formal education in many \nregions.  This is even more likely to harm women when compounded with the above focus on \nemployment history.   \nc.  The Final Rule Disproportionately Impacts People of Color. \n258.  The Final Rule will overwhelmingly harm non-white immigrants.  Of the 25.9 \nmillion immigrants who will be affected by the Rule, 23.3 million are non-white.85  \n259.  Immigrant applicants of color will be disproportionately harmed by the inclusion \nof LEP as a negative factor.  In 2015, individuals with LEP represented 9 percent86 of the United \nStates population ages five and older.  New York is home to one of the highest concentrations of \n                                                 \n85 Custom Tabulation by Manatt Phelps & Philips LLP, Public Charge Proposed Rule: Potentially Chilled \nPopulation Data Dashboard, (Oct. 11,  (2018), https://www.manatt.com/Insights/Articles/2018/Public- Charge-\nRule-Potentially-Chilled-Population (using 2012-2016 5-Year American Community Survey Public Use Microdata \nSample (ACS/PUMS); 201220162012-201620122016 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates \naccessed via American FactFinder; Missouri Census Data Center (MCDC) MABLE PUMA-County Crosswalk).   \n86 Zong & Batalova, supra note 37. \n77 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 78 of 85\n \nindividuals with LEP—approximately 10 percent of the United States individuals with LEP call \nNew York home.  In New York, 2,518,700 people—more than 13 percent of New York’s \npopulation—had limited English proficiency.   \n260.  In 2015, 278,700 people—more than 8 percent of Connecticut’s population—had \nlimited English proficiency.87 In Vermont, this number was 9,000, or roughly 1.5 percent of \nVermont’s population.88  \n261.  Latino and Asian immigrants have the lowest rates of English proficiency, as \ncompared to European and Canadian immigrants who have the highest rates.89 \n262.  The Final Rule’s weighted circumstances test favors white immigrants.  Sixty \npercent of green card applicants from Mexico and Central America and 41 percent from Asia had \ntwo or more negative factors, whereas only 27 percent of immigrants from Europe, Canada, and \nOceania have two or more negative factors.90  Immigrants from Europe and Canada, and Oceania \n(primarily Australia and New Zealand) are the least likely to be affected by the Final Rule’s \nchanges to public charge because they are generally wealthier, more educated, and more likely to \nspeak English.  In fact, immigrants from these regions with predominantly white populations \nhave the highest proportion of recent lawful permanent residents with family income above 250 \npercent FPG.91   \n                                                 \n87 Id.  \n88 Id. \n89 Jynnah Radford, Key Findings about U.S. Immigrants, Pew Res.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n264.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action” that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \n265.  Defendants may only exercise authority conferred by statute.  City of Arlington v. \nFCC, 569 U.S. 290, 297-98 (2013). \n266.  The Final Rule exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority because the Final Rule \nimposes a novel meaning of “public charge” that is contrary to the well-settled meaning of that \nterm.  The Final Rule disregards the long-standing meaning of primary and permanent \ndependence incorporated into the definition of public charge, and considers receipt of any public \nbenefits for 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period sufficient to render an \napplicant a public charge.  This change is not authorized by the relevant federal statutes. \n267.  The Final Rule also exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority because the Final \nRule, contrary to Congressional intent, would permit Defendants to consider applicants’ use of \nnon-cash benefits, such as food supplements, public health insurance, and housing assistance in a \npublic charge determination.   \n268.  The Final Rule also exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority because the weighted \ncircumstances test targets applicants who Congress never intended to consider public charges.  \n269.  The Final Rule further exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority because the Final \nRule would permit Defendants to apply the public charge determination to applicants seeking to \nadjust non-immigrant visas and deprive them of a totality of circumstances inquiry.   \n79 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 80 of 85\n \n270.  The Final Rule is therefore “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right,” in violation of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n271.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and their residents. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act—Not in Accordance with Law) \n272.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n273.  Under the APA, a court must set “aside agency action” that is “not in accordance \nwith law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n274.  The Final Rule conflicts with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which \nprovides that no individual with a disability “shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or \nactivity conducted by any Executive agency[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n275.  The Final Rule also conflicts with the SNAP statute, which provides that “[t]he \nvalue of benefits that may be provided under this chapter shall not be considered income or \nresources for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local laws, including, but not limited to, \nlaws relating to taxation, welfare, and public assistance program.”  7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n276.  Finally, the Final Rule conflicts with the Welfare Reform Act, which provides \nthat “a State is authorized to determine the eligibility of an alien . . . for any designated Federal \nprogram.”  8 U.S.C. § 1612(b)(1).  \n277.  The Final Rule is therefore “not in accordance with law” as required by the APA.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n278.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and their residents. \n80 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 81 of 85\n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary and Capricious) \n279.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n280.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n281.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS’s justification for its \ndecision runs counter to the evidence before the agency, relies on factors Congress did not intend \nthe agency to consider, and disregards material facts and evidence.  \n282.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants have failed to \nreasonably justify their departure from decades of settled practice with respect to the scope and \ndefinition of a “public charge” and their expansion of the public charge determination to include \nfactors that are not rationally related to whether an individual will become primarily and \npermanently dependent on governmental assistance.    \n283.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it arbitrarily discriminates \nagainst individuals with disabilities and does not address the Rule’s conflict with Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n284.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because its replaces the statutory \ntotality of the circumstances test with a test that is vague, arbitrary, and unsupported by the \nevidence.  \n285.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it is pretextual.  While the \nFinal Rule purports to identify individuals who will be public charges, its adoption of factors that \nbear no reasonable relationship to that inquiry demonstrates that defendants were instead seeking \nto reduce immigration by immigrants of color.    \n81 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 82 of 85\n \n286.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS fails to adequately \naddress the Final Rule’s discriminatory impact. The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause it does not adequately quantify or consider the harms that will result.   \n287.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because it relies on incorrect legal \ninterpretations of Matter of Vindman, 16 I &N Dec. 131 (Reg’l Comm’r 1977), and Matter of \nHarutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583 (Reg’l Comm’r 1974). \n288.  The Final Rule is therefore “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion” in \nviolation of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n289.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and their residents. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Administrative Procedure Act—Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law) \n290.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n291.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n292.  The APA requires agencies to publish notice of all proposed rulemakings in a \nmanner that “give[s] interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through \nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments . . . .”  5 U.S.C. § 553(c); see also id. § 553(b).  \n293.  The Final Rule failed to quantify harm to public health, state economies, and other \nadministrative burdens.   \n294.  In addition, the Final Rule entirely eliminates the benefits value threshold of 15 \npercent of the FPG in the public charge definition and allows DHS offices to stack the number of \nmonths when counting how long an applicant has used benefits.  Neither of these policies was \ndiscussed in the Proposed Rule, and they are not a logical outgrowth of the Proposed Rule.  \n82 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 83 of 85\n \nAccordingly, these provisions were adopted without conforming to procedure required by law in \nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).   \n295.  The regulations as drafted must be set aside as in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n (U.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment—Due Process Clause Equal Protection Guarantee) \n296.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n297.  Under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution, the federal government cannot deny to any person \nthe equal protection of its laws.  The Due Process Clause prohibits the federal government from \ndiscriminating against individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin.  U.S. \nConstitution Amend. V.  \n298.  Defendants were motivated by discriminatory animus toward Latinos and \nimmigrant communities of color when they promulgated the Final Rule.   \n299.  Defendants intend to target Latino immigrants and immigrants of color with the \nFinal Rule, as part of their broader effort to reduce the population of permanent residents of color \nin the United States.   \n300.  Defendants’ violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and their residents. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare that the Final Rule is in excess of the Department’s statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); \n2.  Declare that the Final Rule is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n83 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777   Document 1   Filed 08/20/19   Page 84 of 85\n \n3.  Declare that the Final Rule is without observance of procedure required by law \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D); \n4.  Declare that the Final Rule is unconstitutional; \n5.  Vacate and set aside the Final Rule; \n6.  Enjoin the Department and all its officers, employees, and agents, and anyone \nacting in concert with them, from implementing, applying, or taking any action whatsoever under \nthe Final Rule;  \n7.  Postpone the effective date of the Final Rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705;  \n8.

App. 6-32).   \nSTATEMENT \n1.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 \net seq., provides that an alien is “inadmissible” if, “in the \nopinion of the [Secretary of Homeland Security] at the time of \napplication for admission or adjustment of status, [the alien] is \nlikely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge.”    8  U.S.C. \n1182(a)(4)(A);  see  Stay  Appl.  5-8.    In  August  2019,  following \nnotice and comment rulemaking, DHS promulgated a rule regarding \npublic-charge inadmissibility determinations under the INA.  84 \nFed. Reg. 41,292, 41,501 (Aug. 14, 2019) (Rule).  The Rule defines \n\n2 \n“public charge” -- which the statute itself does not define -- to \nmean  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more  [designated]  public \nbenefits  * * *  for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \nany  36-month  period  (such  that,  for  instance,  receipt  of  two \nbenefits  in  one  month  counts  as  two  months).”    Ibid.    The \ndesignated  public  benefits  include  cash  assistance  for  income \nmaintenance and certain federally funded or administered non-cash \nbenefits, including most Medicaid benefits, Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance  Program  benefits,  and  federal  housing  assistance.  \nIbid.  They do not, however, include emergency medical services \nunder Medicaid.  Id. at 41,363, 41,483-41,484, 41,501.  Nor do \nthey include non-cash benefits that are not federally funded or \nadministered, such as state and local public benefits.  Id. at \n41,312.  Receipt of those benefits therefore will not be considered \nin making a public-charge inadmissibility determination under the \nRule.   \nIn August 2019, movants -- a group of three States and the \nCity  of  New  York  --  challenged  the  Rule  in  the  United  States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York.  Movants \nargued that the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is not a \npermissible construction of the INA, that the Rule is arbitrary \nand capricious, and that the Rule violates the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.  On October 11, 2019, the district \ncourt  granted  movants’  request  for  a  nationwide  preliminary \n\n3 \ninjunction  and  stay  under  5  U.S.C.  705  barring  DHS  from \nimplementing the Rule.  See Mot. App. 6-29.  The district court \nalso granted identical relief in another case filed by private \nplaintiffs.  See Stay Appl. 9. \nOn  January  27,  2020,  this  Court  stayed  the  nationwide \ninjunctions  issued  by  the  district  court  in  their  entirety, \n“pending  disposition  of  the  Government’s  appeal  in  the  United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and disposition of \nthe Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ \nis timely sought.”  140 S. Ct. 599, 599.  In a concurring opinion, \nJustice  Gorsuch,  joined  by  Justice  Thomas,  expressed  concerns \nabout  “the  underlying  equitable  and  constitutional  questions \nraised  by  the  rise  of  nationwide  injunctions.”    Id.  at  601.  \nJustices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan would have denied \nthe application for a stay.  Id. at 599. \n2.  The government also has been litigating challenges to \nthe Rule in four other district courts.  See Stay Appl. 12-13 \n(describing other litigation).  Two of those district courts issued \nnationwide injunctions against implementation of the Rule, while \nthe remaining two issued more limited injunctions.  See ibid.   \nThe  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit \ngranted the government’s motions for stays pending appeal in the \ncases  filed  in  that  circuit,  including  one  case  in  which  the \ndistrict court had entered a nationwide injunction.  City & County \n\n4 \nof San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773 (2019).  In a lengthy \npublished opinion that canvassed the history of the public-charge \nprovision and related immigration laws, the Ninth Circuit held \nthat “DHS has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits, \nthat it will suffer irreparable harm, and that the balance of the \nequities and public interest favor a stay.”  Id. at 781.  The \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit also granted \na stay pending appeal of the nationwide injunction entered by a \ndistrict court in Maryland.  Order, Casa de Maryland, Inc. v. \nTrump, No. 19-2222 (Dec. 9, 2019).   \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \ndid not grant the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal of \nan  injunction  against  the  Rule  issued  by  a  district  court  in \nIllinois, and denied the government’s renewed motion for a stay \nfollowing  this  Court’s  issuance  of  a  stay  in  this  case.    See \n2/10/2020  Order,  Cook  County  v.  Wolf,  No.  19-3169.    In  its \nsubsequent application to this Court for a stay of the Illinois \ninjunction,  the  government  explained  that  by  staying  the \nnationwide injunctions here, the Court had “necessarily determined \nthat the government had a fair prospect of success  * * *  on the \nmerits of its defense of the challenged Rule.”  Stay Appl. at 15, \nWolf  v.  Cook  County,  No.  19A905  (Feb.  13,  2020).    This  Court \ngranted a stay of the Illinois injunction “pending disposition of \nthe Government’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for \n\n5 \nthe Seventh Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition \nfor a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.”  Wolf v. \nCook County, 140 S. Ct. 681, 681 (2020) (No. 19A905).   \n3.  On March 13, 2020, President Trump issued a proclamation \nstating  “that  the  COVID-19  outbreak  in  the  United  States \nconstitutes a national emergency.”  Proclamation No. 9994, 85 Fed. \nReg. 15,337 (Mar. 18, 2020).  That same day, U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance explaining that it \n“encourages  all  those,  including  aliens,  with  symptoms  that \nresemble  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  (fever,  cough, \nshortness  of  breath)  to  seek  necessary  medical  treatment  or \npreventive services.  Such treatment or preventive services will \nnot negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge \nanalysis.”    Mot.  App.  44  (emphasis  added).    The  guidance \nspecifically states that “[t]o address the possibility that some \naliens  impacted  by  COVID-19  may  be  hesitant  to  seek  necessary \nmedical  treatment  or  preventive  services,  USCIS  will  neither \nconsider  testing,  treatment,  nor  preventative  care  (including \nvaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as \npart of a public charge inadmissibility determination.”  Ibid.   \nARGUMENT  \nThis  Court  has  twice  stayed  the  effect  of  preliminary \ninjunctions preventing implementation of the Rule.  Both times, \nthe Court’s entry of a stay reflected its assessment of whether \n\n6 \nchallenges to the Rule are likely to succeed.  Movants do not argue \nthat  the  current  public-health  crisis  has  any  bearing  on  that \nassessment,  and  they  do  not  ask  this  Court  to  revisit  it.  \nRemarkably, movants nevertheless ask the Court to enter relief \nthat would require DHS to modify the status quo nationwide by \nhalting its ongoing implementation of the Rule.  In other words, \neven though movants’ suit is likely to fail as a legal matter, \nthey want this Court to block the Rule in the interim by evaluating \nnew  declarations  and  making  a  factual  assessment  of  how  the \nExecutive Branch should best respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \nMovants identify no case in which this Court has ever granted \nthat sort of relief.  The Executive Branch has moved aggressively \nto address the current public-health emergency.  As relevant here, \nit has made clear that aliens’ use of publicly funded prevention \nand treatment services related to COVID-19 will not be considered \nin making predictions about whether aliens are likely to become \npublic charges in the future.  Movants’ attempt to discount that \nguidance  is  more  than  incorrect;  it  is  unhelpful  by  creating \nconfusion about the Rule and the government’s COVID-19 response in \nan effort to advance this litigation.  In any event, movants’ \ndeclarations -- submitted for the first time in this Court -- \nprovide no basis for this Court to second-guess the Executive’s \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n\n7 \n1.  To  the  government’s  knowledge,  this  Court  has  never \narticulated the standard applicable to a motion to vacate a stay \npreviously issued by the full Court.  That is unsurprising, given \nthat movants have not identified any instance in which the Court \nhas granted a contested motion to vacate or even temporarily lift \na stay that the full Court had previously granted.  Cf. Cities \nServ. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 487 U.S. 1245, 1245 (1988) (partially \ngranting a “[j]oint application to vacate the stay”); Stephen M. \nShapiro, et al., Supreme Court Practice § 17.12, at 897 (10th ed. \n2013)  (explaining  that  even  stay  orders  entered  by  individual \nJustices are reviewed and reversed by the Court “only in the most \nextraordinary circumstances”).   \nWhen, as here, a motion asks this Court to vacate or lift a \nstay in a manner that would materially change the status quo, the \ncorrect legal standard should be similar to the one that the Court \nwould apply if it were vacating or lifting a lower court’s order, \nor enjoining an administrative rule in the first instance.  See \nMot. 14 (invoking the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, and Section \n705 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 705).  The status \nquo secured by a prior order of this Court should not be entitled \nto less respect than the status quo secured by an order of a lower \ncourt.  Cf. Supreme Court Practice § 15.6, at 837-840 (describing \nthe  heightened  standard  this  Court  applies  to  petitions  for \nrehearing).   \n\n8 \nBut  even  assuming  that  movants  in  effect  seek \nreconsideration, at a minimum they bear the burden of showing that \nthe  Court’s  previous  determination  that  the  government  had \nsatisfied  the  factors  for  obtaining  a  stay  --  a  reasonable \nprobability  of  certiorari,  a  fair  prospect  of  success  on  the \nmerits, and a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a stay -- is \nnow incorrect in light of the current public-health crisis.  See \nConkright v. Frommert, 556 U.S. 1401, 1402 (2009) (Ginsburg, J., \nin chambers) (setting forth the factors to obtain a stay).  Movants \nhave not attempted to make that showing; their motion does not \neven  cite  those  factors,  much  less  explain  how  the  COVID-19 \npandemic renders incorrect the Court’s legal judgment as to those \nfactors.  That is reason enough to deny the motion.   \n2.  In  particular,  as  the  government  has  explained (Stay \nAppl. 18-31), and as the Ninth Circuit has recognized in a lengthy \npublished opinion addressing materially identical challenges to \nthe Rule, see City & County of San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F. 3d \n773 (2019), the government is likely to succeed on the merits of \nits defense of the Rule because the Rule “easily” qualifies as a \npermissible  interpretation  of  the  INA,  id.  at  799.    Movants’ \nchallenge  to  the  Rule  is  inconsistent  with  the  INA’s  broader \nstructure, express statutory statements of national immigration \npolicy, and DHS’s careful and considered judgment about how best \n\n9 \nto implement its responsibilities under the INA.  See Stay Appl. \n18-31; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 3-10.   \nThis Court has twice granted relief to the government based \non those arguments about the likelihood that challenges to the \nRule would fail -- first in its January 27 order in this case, and \nlater in its order staying the Illinois-specific injunction in \nWolf v. Cook County, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020) (No. 19A905).  Yet \nmovants make no attempt to show that the intervening COVID-19-\nrelated events on which their motion relies have any bearing on \nthe legal merit of their challenge.  Nor could they:  all of those \nevents post-date the finalization of the Rule and are thus legally \nirrelevant in their underlying challenge.  Movants’ attempts to \nset aside the Rule are thus just as unlikely to succeed now as \nthey were three months ago.  And because the Rule is lawful, the \nCourt should not lift its January 27 stay simply because movants \nbelieve the Rule reflects bad policy.   \nMovants’ reliance (Mot. 17) on Orloff v. Willoughby, 72 S. Ct. \n998 (1952) (Douglas, J., in chambers), and King v. Smith, 88 S. Ct. \n842 (1968) (Black, J., in chambers), is misplaced.  In Orloff, \nJustice  Douglas  did  not  lift  the  stay  that  he  had  previously \nentered (as movants request here); rather, he simply clarified \nthat  the  stay  --  which  he  had  issued  solely  to  preserve  this \nCourt’s jurisdiction over a service member’s habeas petition -- \nwould  not  prevent  the  government  from  reassigning  the  service \n\n10 \nmember to another military base.  See 72 S. Ct. at 998-989.  In \nKing, Justice Black vacated his own previously issued stay in light \nof “[a] recent congressional amendment to the” relevant federal \nstatute that altered his earlier assessment of the stay factors, \nsee 88 S. Ct. at 842, and the full Court eventually ruled in favor \nof the parties that had sought the stay modification, see King v. \nSmith, 392 U.S. 309, 333 (1968).  The motion in King was thus \nunlike  the  motion  here  in  at  least  three  important  respects:  \n(i) it  concerned  a  single  Justice’s  modification  of  his  own \npreviously  issued  stay;  (ii)  the  movants  had  a  likelihood  of \nsuccess  on  the  merits;  and  (iii)  the  motion  depended  on  an \nintervening legal change, rather than contested arguments about \nthe effect of intervening factual developments.   \n3.  Rather than explain how the Court erred in its evaluation \nof any of the traditional stay factors when issuing its January 27 \norder,  movants  argue  (Mot.  14)  that  the  current  public-health \ncrisis has “shifted the balance of equities.”  When evaluating an \napplication for a stay, such considerations are relevant only “in \na close case.”  Conkright, 556 U.S. at 1402 (Ginsburg, J., in \nchambers) (citation omitted); see ibid. (“[I]n a close case it may \nbe appropriate to ‘balance the equities’ -- to explore the relative \nharms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the \npublic at large.”) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, to the extent \nthe Court granted the January 27 stay because the government had \n\n11 \nmade a strong showing on the traditional stay factors set forth \nabove, it would not have had occasion to engage in that balancing \n-- and nothing in the present motion would even be relevant to the \npropriety of the existing stay.   \nTo the extent that the balance of equities factored into the \nCourt’s prior order, movants have not met their burden to show \nthat  those  equities  have  shifted  in  a  way  that  would  warrant \nrevisiting the Court’s earlier decision.  Movants assert (Mot. 14) \nthat  the  Rule  is  “impeding  efforts  to  stop  the  spread  of  the \ncoronavirus,  preserve  scarce  hospital  capacity  and  medical \nsupplies, and protect the lives of everyone in our communities.”  \nThey therefore contend (Mot. 22) that it would be in “the public \ninterest”  to  lift  the  stay,  which  would  have  the  effect  of \nsuspending the Rule, in its entirety, nationwide.  But the public \nhas  an  interest  in  both  addressing  the  COVID-19  crisis  and \nenforcing lawful immigration policy -- and it is the Executive \nBranch that is charged with determining how best to do both.  See \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435-436 (2009).  The Executive Branch \nhas considered the arguments movants advance, and has concluded \nthat movants’ preferred outcome -- a wholesale suspension of the \nRule, just as they sought before the COVID-19 crisis -- is not \nwarranted.  Movants provide no basis for this Court to overrule \nthat judgment about how the Nation’s lawful immigration policies \nshould be implemented during the COVID-19 crisis.   \n\n12 \nRather than a wholesale suspension, the Executive Branch has \ninstead opted to take more targeted steps to ensure that the Rule \nis being administered in an appropriate way in light of current \nconditions.  Specifically, USCIS’s March 13 guidance makes clear \nthat the government will exclude from consideration the receipt of \nany public benefits related to COVID-19 care -- including testing, \ntreatment,  preventive  care,  and  vaccinations  --  when  making \npublic-charge inadmissibility determinations under the Rule.  Mot. \nApp. 44.  The guidance also reiterates that the Rule, by its own \nterms, does not consider the receipt of emergency medical services \nunder Medicaid; “CHIP, or State, local, or tribal public health \ncare services/assistance that are not funded by federal Medicaid”; \nor  various  other  non-federal  benefits  in  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  Ibid.  And it makes clear that in \nall events, “USCIS considers the receipt of public benefits as \nonly one consideration among a number of factors and considerations \nin the totality of the alien’s circumstances over a period of time \nwith no single factor being outcome determinative.”  Ibid.   \nMovants seek to undermine that guidance, claiming that an \nalien “who obtains or maintains Medicaid coverage that helps him \naccess  COVID-19  testing  or  treatment  will  still  receive  an \nautomatic negative factor in the public-charge analysis based on \nhis Medicaid coverage, even if his COVID-19 test or treatment will \nnot itself be considered.”  Mot. 13; see Mot. 24-25.  But movants \n\n13 \nare incorrect:  under USCIS’s guidance (as DHS has reaffirmed to \nthis Office), if an alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive COVID-\n19-related care, that enrollment will not be a negative factor in \na  public-charge  inadmissibility  determination,  so  long  as  the \nalien disenrolls from Medicaid once he or she no longer needs \nCOVID-19-related  care,  or  provides  evidence  of  a  request  to \ndisenroll.  That is why USCIS explicitly advised the public that \nCOVID-19-related  “treatment  or  preventive  services  will  not \nnegatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge \nanalysis.”  Mot. App. 44 (emphasis added). \nMovants also assert that “an applicant who applies for SNAP \nbenefits because a COVID-19 public-health order forced him out of \nhis job will continue to receive a negative factor in a public-\ncharge inquiry.”  Mot. 13;  see  Mot. 23-24.   But as  the  USCIS \nguidance explains, if an alien “must rely on public benefits for \nthe duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and recovery phase” as a \nresult of extrinsic factors -- such as enforced social distancing \nor  an  employer’s  shutting  down  --  “the  alien  can  provide  an \nexplanation and relevant supporting documentation” and “[t]o the \nextent [those materials are] relevant and credible, USCIS will \ntake all such evidence into consideration” when making public-\ncharge inadmissibility determinations.  Mot. App. 44.   \nEven if USCIS had not undertaken those discretionary steps, \nthe Rule’s effects on current benefits usage during the COVID-19 \n\n14 \ncrisis still would have been modest.  That is because most aliens \nto whom the Rule could potentially apply are not presently eligible \nfor federal means-tested benefits like Medicaid.  See 8 U.S.C. \n1613(a), 1641(b), and 1642(a).  The Rule cannot possibly prevent \nor  deter  aliens  from  using  benefits  for  which  they  are  not \neligible.  Conversely, many aliens who are eligible for means-\ntested federal benefits (such as refugees and asylees) are not \nsubject to the Rule in the first place.  See Mot. App. 46.  And \nwhile certain lawfully present aliens who are pregnant or under \nage  21  may  be  both  subject  to  the  public-charge  ground  of \ninadmissibility and also eligible for Medicaid, the Rule itself \nexempts  their  receipt  of  Medicaid  benefits  from  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297.   \nMovants assert (Mot. 14) that notwithstanding USCIS’s COVID-\n19-related guidance and the limited relevance of the Rule to aliens \nwho are actually eligible for benefits, “the Rule is deterring \nmany immigrants and their family members, including those who are \nU.S. citizens, from seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19.”  \nBut their accompanying declarations make clear that this asserted \neffect  is  not  the  result  of  the  Rule  itself,  but  rather  of \n“mistaken  belief[s]”  about  the Rule’s  application  and  content.  \nMot. App. 171 (emphasis added).*  In fact, nearly every example \n                     \n*  See also, e.g., Mot. App. 60 (“[U]ninsured people may be \nable to receive medical care free through safety net facilities, \nsuch as community health centers or government clinics; evidence \n\n15 \nmovants cite (Mot. 19-20) involves aliens who wrongly believe that \nobtaining  COVID-19-related  care  will  affect  a  public-charge \ninadmissibility determination in the future, contrary to the USCIS \nguidance.  Plaintiffs identify no case holding that the “balance \nof  the  equities”  favors  suspending  a  lawful  Rule  because  some \nsubset of people misunderstands its legal effects.   \nThat is not to say that movants are without recourse.  If, as \nthey  say,  members  of  their  communities  are  avoiding  COVID-19-\nrelated care and treatment because of mistaken beliefs about the \nRule,  then  movants  should  address  that  problem  by  helping  to \ncorrect those misunderstandings -- not by filing motions that, if \nanything, only reinforce them.   \n                     \nsuggests that the chilling effect leads to reductions in use of \nservices like these, even though the public charge determinations \ndo not apply to such programs.”); ibid. (“[A]lthough the public \ncharge rule does not apply to benefits from the Women, Infants and \nChildren (WIC) nutrition assistance program, many immigrants have \navoided enrolling in WIC because of public charge fears.”); id. at \n140  (“Many  New  Yorkers  mistakenly  believe  they  are  receiving \nMedicaid  as  defined  in  the  public  charge  rule,  due  to \nmisunderstanding  the  program  in  general.    *  *  *    [W]e  have \nencountered  many  noncitizens  who  are  afraid  to  get  COVID-19 \ntesting”  because  “people  are  afraid  that  testing  requires \nMedicaid, which would get them deported.”); id. at 220 (“[S]ome \nfamilies  that  organizers  speak  with  have  withdrawn  their  U.S. \ncitizen children from healthcare coverage out of a mistaken fear \nthat  their  children’s  coverage  will  trigger  immigration \nconsequences related to public charge.”); id. at 221 (“[C]lasses \nof immigrants to whom the public charge rule does not apply, such \nas Lawful Permanent Residents, have also disenrolled from services \nout  of  the  mistaken  fear  that  they  could  face  immigration \nconsequences for receiving benefits.”).   \n\n16 \n4.  In all events, movants are not entitled to reinstatement \nof the nationwide injunctions.  As the government has explained \n(Stay Appl. 32-39; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 10-12), the nationwide \naspect of the preliminary injunctions here is an independent issue \nwarranting  this  Court’s  attention.    This  Court  stayed  the \ninjunctions in their entirety, making it unnecessary to address \nthe issue at that time.  See 140 S. Ct. at 599-601 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring).  But if the Court were inclined to grant this motion \nnow, it would have to confront that issue, which was squarely \nraised and presented.  If the district court lacked authority under \nArticle  III  and  traditional  principles  of  equity  to  enter \ninjunctions that applied outside movants’ jurisdictions, see Stay \nAppl. 32-39; Stay Appl. Reply Br. 10-12, there would be no basis \nto lift or modify the Court’s January 27 stay, even on a temporary \nbasis,  to  the  extent  the  stay  precludes  the  injunctions  from \noperating in that universal fashion.   \n5.  Finally,  the  Court  also  should  reject  movants’ \nalternative request (Mot. 16) that the Court “clarify” that its \nJanuary 27 stay order “does not preclude the district court from \nconsidering  whether  the  current  COVID-19  crisis  warrants \ntemporary,  tailored  relief  from  the  Public  Charge  Rule.”    As \nmovants recognize (ibid.), the district court probably lacks the \nauthority to modify the nationwide injunctions it issued, now that \nthe Court has stayed those injunctions.  See Heckler v. Turner, \n\n17 \n468 U.S. 1305, 1308-1309 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers).  Even \nif it has that authority, movants do not explain why the district \njudge should in effect be permitted to second-guess and modify a \nstay issued by this Court.  Judicial economy alone counsels against \nthat course, for the losing party would, as movants recognize (Mot. \n16), inevitably seek “appellate review” of any adverse decision.   \nTo the extent movants seek to obtain a new injunction, the \ndistrict court probably lacks authority to issue one.  Such a “new” \ninjunction would for all intents and purposes be identical to the \ninjunctions that the Court already has stayed -- but simply issued \nbased on the district judge’s “new” evaluation of the applicable \nequitable factors.  If the district court lacks the authority to \nmodify the existing injunctions, it also must lack the authority \nto  end  run  that  rule  by  issuing  a  materially  identical  “new” \ninjunction.  And even setting aside the question of the court’s \nauthority, movants would be precluded by ordinary law-of-the-case \nprinciples from re-litigating in district court the issues that \nthis Court necessarily decided in granting the January 27 stay, \nincluding that the government has a fair prospect of success on \nthe merits of its defense of the Rule’s lawfulness, and that the \ngovernment -- and thus the public -- would suffer irreparable harm \nwere the Rule enjoined.  Movants thus could not demonstrate the \nlikelihood of success and irreparable harm required to secure new \n\n18 \ninjunctive relief against the Rule’s enforcement.  See Winter v. \nNRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   \n*   *  *   *   * \nMovants identify no prior case in which the Court has granted \nthe kind of relief they request here -- and this case should not \nbe the first.  The Executive Branch has taken aggressive actions \nto address the current public-health crisis.  Those actions include \nissuing guidance about the Rule that clearly assures the public \nthat USCIS will exclude from consideration the receipt of public \nbenefits  for  COVID-19-related  care  when  making  public-charge \ninadmissibility determinations.  In light of that guidance, the \nExecutive Branch has determined that a wholesale suspension of the \nRule is unwarranted.  Nothing in the motion or in the accompanying \nnew declarations provides any basis for this Court to second-guess \nthat policy judgment.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe motion should be denied.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n  NOEL J.

Decision and Order (\"Gov't Pis. Decision\"), No. 19 Civ. 7777, \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 3 of 31\nECFNo. 110 (reported at 408 F.

Specifically, this Court issued a nationwide injunction, as well as a stay postponing the \neffective date of the Rule, pending adjudication on the merits or ftuther order of the Court (the \n\"October 2019 Injunction\").  (Gov't Pis. Decision at 24; Org. Pis. Decision at 26.)  Between \nOctober 11 and October 14, four other district courts issued similar injunctions, two of which were \nalso nationwide in scope.  Cook Cty., Illinois v. McAleenan, 417 F. Supp. 3d 1008, 1014 (N.D. Ill. \n2019) (injunction as to Illinois); Casa de Md., Inc.  v.  Trump, 414 F. Supp. 3d 760, 767 (D.

On \nJanuary  27,  2020,  the  Supreme  Court  granted  Defendants'  request  and  stayed this  Court's \npreliminary injunctions, pending disposition of Defendants' appeal in the Second Circuit and \nfurther petition for a writ of certiorari, if timely sought. Dep 't ofH  omeland Sec. v. New York, 140 \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 4 of 31\nS.  Ct.  599 (2020) (mem.).  Following the Supreme Court's stay, the Rule went into effect on \nFebruary 24,2020.1 \nMuch has significantly changed since January 27.  Today, the world is in the throes of a \ndevastating  pandemic,  triggered  by  the  novel  coronavirus  SARS-Co V -2.  In  six  months, \napproximately 16.5 million people around the globe have been afflicted by the disease caused by \nthis virus.  That disease (COVID-19) has claimed over 650,000 lives worldwide.  In the United \nStates alone, COVID-19 has spread rapidly, infecting over four million people.  Close to 150,000 \nAmerican residents have died.  All of these staggering numbers continue to climb on a daily basis. \nThe  Secretary  of Health and  Human Services  declared  a public health emergency in \nresponse to the virus on January 31, 2020.  As of March 12, 1,645 people from 47 states had been \ninfected.  On March 13, the President declared a state of national emergency, beginning March 1, \n2020, which is ongoing.  Proclamation No. 9994,85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 13, 2020).  Thousands \ncontinue to die indiscriminately.  Attempting to effectively combat this plague has immediately \ncome in conflict with the federal goverument' s new \"public charge\" policy, a policy which is \nintended to discourage immigrants from utilizing government benefits and penalizes them for \nreceipt of financial and medical assistance.  In an effort to ensure that the Rule will not deter \nimmigrants  from  seeking  necessary  medical  treatment  and  preventive  services  related  to \nCOVID-19,  the  federal  government issued  an \"alert,\" contemporaneous  with the President's \ndeclaration of a national emergency, that excludes COVID-19 medical treatment and services from \npublic  charge  determinations.

(See Mot. to Dismiss, No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 140; Mot. to \nDismiss, No.  19  Civ.  7993,  ECF No.  176.)  Plaintiffs,  on the  other hand,  seek  additional \npreliminary injunctive relief in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, Plaintiffs move, \npursuant to FederalR  ule of Civil Procedure 65, for a new limited preliminary injunction enjoining \nDefendants from implementing, applying, or taking any action under the Rule, during the national \nemergency.  (See Pis.' Notice of Mot., No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECFNo. 168.)  Alternatively, Plaintiffs \nseek, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. § 705, a stay postponing \nthe effective date of the Rule during the national emergency.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs also request that this \nCourt issue an indicative ruling under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, stating that this Court \nwould issue the new preliminary injunction, and factual findings supporting that injunction, if the \nSecond Circuit detennines that this Court cunently lacks jurisdiction and remands the case for that \npurpose.2  (Id.)  Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of the \n2 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 details a court's options for addressing a motion when a pending \nappeal divests the court ofj urisdiction to grant such motion.  In particular, under Rule 62.1, a court may (1) \ndefer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the \ncourt of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

DEFENDANTS' MOTIONS TO DISMISS \nA.  Rule 12(b)(l) Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction. \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot meet the jurisdictional requirements of standing \nand ripeness.  The proper procedural route for such a challenge is a motion to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b) (1 ).  See All. for Envtl. Renewal, Inc. v. Pyramid \nCrossgates Co., 436 F.3d 82, 88 n.6 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"[T]he proper procedural route [for a standing \nchallenge] is a motion under Rule 12(b)(l).\"); Duane Reade, Inc.  v.  St.  Paul Fire & Marine Ins. \nCo., 261 F. Supp. 2d 293, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"Ripeness is jurisdictional in nature and therefore \nproperly considered on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(l) of the Federal Rules.\"). \nDefendants raise several arguments that Plaintiffs' claims are not justiciable.  This Court \nhas heard these arguments before and need not revisit in great detail its analysis of whether \nPlaintiffs have standing or whether their claims are ripe for judicial review.  (See  Gov't Pls. \nDecision at 6-9; Org. Pls. Decision at 6-11.)  First, as this Court previously found, Plaintiffs \nsufficiently  allege  \"concrete  and  particularized\"  injuries  stemming  fi·om  Defendants' \npromulgation of the Rule.  Organizational Plaintiffs establish that they have already diverted \n3H Teoaldthay a, ntdh isH uCmouarnt  Salesrov igcreasu atsc taio pnrse lriemleivnaarnyt  tion jpuunbcltiico nc heanrjgoein dinegte rDmeipnaarttimonesn ti no af  Sretalatete adn adc Dtioenp,m Mtmakeen tt hoef  \nRoad New Yorkv.

Second, Plaintiffs' claims are \nripe for review because the legal questions presented do not depend on any factual contingencies. \nPlaintiffs bring facial challenges to the Rule, which is already in effect.  And as Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated, iliey will suffer significant harm by further delay.  Defendants' motions to dismiss \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction are denied. \nB.  Rule 12(b)(6) Failure to State a Claim. \n\"To  survive  a motion to  dismiss,  a complaint must contain sufficient factual  matter, \naccepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"'  Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bel/At/. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). The plaintiff \nmust demonstrate \"more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully\"; stating a \nfacially plausible claim requires the plaintiff to plead facts that enable the court \"to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" !d. (citation omitted). \nThe factual  allegations  pled must therefore \"be enough to  raise  a right to  relief above ilie \nspeculative level.\"  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted).4 \nA  district court must first  review a plaintiff's complaint to  identifY  allegations that, \n\"because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\"  Iqbal, \n4 \"In deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court may refer 'to documents attached to the \ncomplaint as an exhibit or incorporated in it by reference, to matters of which judicial notice may be taken, \nor to documents either in plaintiffs' possession or of which plaintiffs had knowledge and relied on in \nbringing suit.\"'  Fishbein v.  Miranda, 670 F. Supp. 2d 264, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting Brass v.

The court then considers whether the plaintiffs remaining well-pleaded factual \nallegations, assumed to be true, \"plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\"  Id.; see also \nTargum v.  Citrin Cooperman &  Co.,  LLP, No.  12 Civ. 6909 (SAS), 2013 WL 6087400, at *3 \n(S.D.N. Y. Nov. 19, 20 13).  In deciding the 12(b) (6) motion, the court must also draw all reasonable \ninferences in the non-moving party's favor.  See N.J Carpenters Health Fund v.  Royal Bank of \nScot. Grp., PLC, 709 F.3d 109, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2013). \nThis Court previously found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims under the \nAPA   that promulgation of the Rule was contrary to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") \nand arbitrary and capricious. 5  Such claims also meet the lower threshold of surviving a motion to \ndismiss.6  See Fashion TelevisionAssocs., L.P. v. Spiegel, Inc., 849 F. Supp. 19,22 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. \n1994) (\"[T]he standard in deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction is more stringent than \nthat used in a motion to dismiss ....\" ).  Defendants, however, argue that this Court should \nreconsider its analysis of the merits of Plaintiffs' claims. \nThis Court specifically concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their claim that \nDefendants lacked the authority to redefine \"public charge\" as they have in the Rule, contrary to \nthe INA and in violation of the APA  .  (See Gov't Pls. Decision at 11-14; Org. Pis. Decision at 13-\n15.) The longstanding definition of\"public charge\" is someone who is primarily dependent on the \n5 These claims are reflected in Counts I and ill of the Governmental Plaintiffs' complaint and Counts I and \nII of the Organizational Plaintiffs' complaint. \n6 Defendants also argue that these claims, along with the rest of Plaintiffs' claims, fail because Plaintiffs \nfall outside the zone of interests regulated by the Rule.  However, as this Court already concluded, Plaintiffs \nplainly satisfY the lenient zone-of-interests test.  (See Gov't Pis. Decision at 10-11; Org. Pis. Decision at \n11-12.)  Plaintiffs' interests are not \"so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in \nthe [INA] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\"  Match-E-Be \nNash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v.  Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (citation omitted). \nGovernmental  Plaintiffs  are  administrators  of public  benefits  programs  targeted  by  the  Rule  and \nOrganizational Plaintiffs' very mission is to assist, advise, and advocate for  immigrants, including in \nimmigration proceedings.  Moreover, all plaintiffs allege economic injury as a result of the Rule. \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 9 of 31\ngovernment for subsistence.  (See Gov't Pis. Decision at 11-13; Org. Pis. Decision at 13-14.) \nFurther, it is undisputed that the tetm has never been constmed as receipt of 12 months of benefits \nwithin a 36-month period.  (See Gov't Pis. Decision at 13; Org. Pis. Decision at 14.)  Rather, prior \nto the implementation of the Rule, public charge detetminations were an inquiry about self \nsubsistence,  not  about  lawful  receipt  of benefits  that  are  in  many  cases  temporary  and \nsupplemental. Moreover, there is no evidence that Congress ever intended for a redefinition of the \nterm as set forth in the Rule, including the consideration of non-cash assistance.  (See Gov't Pis. \nDecision at 13-14; Org. Pis. Decision at 15.)  In fact, Congress repeatedly rejected attempts to \nn \nimplement such a fi·amework, (see Gov't Pis. Compl.  37--42; Org. Pis. Compl. ~~ 80-85)-a \nfact that strongly favors finding that Defendants acted in excess of statutoty authority, see Hamdan \nv. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 579-80 (2006) (\"Congress' rejection of the very language that would \nhave achieved the result the Government urges here weighs heavily against the Government's \ninterpretation.\").  Simply  put,  Defendants'  definition  is  outside  the  bounds  of the  statute, \nconsidering the inherent meaning of the words \"public charge\" and its historical context.  And \nbecause Defendants fail to provide any reasonable justification for this change in the definition of \n\"public charge,\" or the framework for determining whether an individual is likely to become a \npublic charge, the Rule is also arbitrary and capricious.  (See Gov't Pis. Decision at 14-17; Org. \nPis. Decision at 15-19.) \nDefendants claim that the Supreme Court's order staying the October 2019 Injunction and \nthe Ninth Circuit's decision to stay preliminaty injunctions issued by judges in the Eastern District \nof Washington and the Northern District of California, City & Cty.  of San Francisco v.  USCIS, \n944 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2019), provide reason to revisit this Court's analysis and dismiss Plaintiffs' \ncomplaints, (Mem. of Law in Supp. ofDefs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Gov't MTD Mem.\"), No. 19 Civ. \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 10 of 31\n7777, ECF No. 141, at 1; Mem. of Law in Supp. ofDefs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Org. MTD Mem.\"), \nNo. 19 Civ. 7993, ECF No. 177, at 1).  To the contrary, the Supreme Court did not address the \nmerits of the claim that the Rule is unlawful.  See Wolf v.  Cook Cty.,  fllinois,  140 S. Ct. 681, 682 \n(2020) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting that in issuing a stay of the October 2019 Injunction, \n\"[n]o Member of the [Supreme] Court discussed the application's merit apart from its challenges \nto the injunction's nationwide scope.\").  Fmther, the Ninth Circuit's analysis stands in contrast to \nthe Seventh Circuit's recent decision to affitm the preliminary injunction issued in the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois.?  See  Cook Cty.,  Illinois  v.  Wolf,  962  F.3d 208  (7th Cir.  2020).  Here, \nDefendants' appeal of this Court's prior order issuing the October 2019 Injunction is cunently \npending before the Second Circuit.  As such, this Comt' s determination regarding the propriety of \na preliminary injunction remains undisturbed. \nI.  Governmental Plaintiffs State a Claim that the Rule is Contrary to the \nRehabilitation Act. \nGovernmental Plaintiffs allege in Count II of their complaint that the Rule is \"not in \naccordance with law\" in violation of the APA, because it conflicts with (1) Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), (2) the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (\"SNAP\") statute, 7 U.S.C.  § 2017(b), and (3) the Welfare Reform Act, \n8 U.S.C.  §  1612(b)(l).

Wolf, 962 F.3d at 229. \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 11 of 31\nPlaintiffs raise \"at least a colorable argument that the Rule as to be applied may violate\" Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, (see Gov't Pls. Decision at 18; Org. Pls. Decision at 19-20), which \nprohibits goverument discrimination against a person with a disability \"solely by reason of her or \nhis disability,\" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \"Exclusion or discrimination [under Section 504] may take the \nfmm of disparate treatment, disparate impact, or failure to make a reasonable accommodation.\" \nB.C.  v.  Mount Vernon Sch.  Dist., 837 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2016).  Defendants do not dispute \nthat a disability is considered a negative factor under the public charge framework.  Indeed, the \nRule indicates that DHS will consider whether \"the alien has been diagnosed with a medical \ncondition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will \ninterfere with the alien's ability to provide and care for himself or herself, to attend school, or to \nwork.\"  84 Fed. Reg. 41,502.  Defendants, however, justify this treatment by pointing to the fact \nthat the INA lists \"health\" as a factor for consideration inpublic charge determinations.  (Gov't \nMTD Mem. at 28-29; Org. MTD Mem. at 30-31.)  While the INA directs officials to consider an \nindividual's  health,  it does  not provide  license to penalize  an applicant solely  because  of a \ndisability.  Defendants apparently make no distinction between a disabled individual who is not \nself-sufficient and one who is able to cope with his or her disability, even if it requires extensive \nmedical treatment or accommodation. The Rule treats disabilities as a per se negative health factor, \nin apparent violation of the Rehabilitation Act. 8  Governmental Plaintiffs therefore adequately state \na claim that the Rule is \"not in accordance with law.\" \n8cci nooTennhvctreilta uavSdbeeelnevdt e titohnhnateht   o aRCf pu tihrelecer u sR\"oidtne ihr'ssepa cdbreoiinslpiattolbayrti tilioifotonynu  aAwntdeci,llt ly. \"fb  oberCu  trhosdieome knb iCsula tt-ryd f.i,ors eraI albclsliaoenundoss ie,ps   eotvho.f ap hWtle eo\"r  ltabfh,ne ed9i n 6Rgi2nu   dFlmee. 3eapmdne yean dta i 2lnli2izsk8teae.s nl ycTd etihosse a  bmbSeleaecvkdoee msnp etehi rta s C aoplniulr scbb uliuinictt    \ncharge.\"  Id. \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 12 of 31\n2.  Governmental Plaintiffs State a Claim that the Rule Violates Procedural \nRequirements of the APA   \nIn Count IV of their complaint, Governmental Plaintiffs claim that Defendants failed to \nmeet the procedural requirements oft he APA in promulgating the Rule.  (Gov't Pls. Compl. ~ 290-\n95.)  Specifically, Governmental Plaintiffs allege that Defendants did not \"give interested persons \nan opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, or \narguments,\" 5 U.S.C. § 553(c).  They argue that the Rule's definition of\"public charge\" was not \na logical outgrowth of DHS's notice of proposed rulemaking, Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018) (\"NPRM\"), in two respects.  First, Governmental \nPlaintiffs point to the fact that the NPRM included a value threshold (i.e.,  15% of the Federal \nPoverty Guidelines) for counting public benefits as relevant to the public charge determination. \nThat value threshold was eliminated in the Rule in favor of a purely durational standard.  (Gov't \nPls. Compl. ~ 124.)  Second, Governmental Plaintiffs argue that DHS did not provide public notice \nof the so-called \"stacking scheme\" for counting multiple benefits received in a given month when \ncalculating the 12/36-month durational tln·eshold (i.e., each benefit received in a month counts as \none month of benefits towards the threshold).  (!d.  ~ 125.)  Governmental Plaintiffs claim that \nthese policies were neither discussed in, nor a logical outgrowth of, the NPRM.  \"A final rule \nqualifies as a logical outgrowth 'if interested parties \"should have anticipated\" that the change was \npossible, and thus reasonably should have filed their comments on the subject during the notice-\nand-comment period.\"'  CSXTransp., Inc.  v. Surface Transp. Bd., 584 F.3d 1076, 1079-80 (D.C. \nCir.  2009) (citations omitted).  Here, both the value threshold and the stacldng scheme on the \n12/36-month standard were discussed in the NPRM, but the former was limited to monetizable \nbenefits (e.g., cash benefits and SNAP) and the latter was proposed for non-monetizable benefits \n(e.g., Medicaid).  83  Fed.  Reg.  51,163-66, 51,289-90.  Ultimately, DHS decided to apply the \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 13 of 31\n12/36-month standard, including the stacking scheme, to all benefits, whether monetizable or not. \nGovernmental Plaintiffs had an opportunity to comment on the stacking structure, but this Comi \ncannot conclude that they  should have  anticipated DHS  eliminating the value threshold  and \nreplacing it with an entirely durational threshold for all benefits.  DHS only proposed the 12/36-\nmonth durational threshold because it lacked \"an easily administrable standard for assessing the \nmonetary value of an alien's receipt of some non-cash benefits.\" Id at 51,165.  DHS even sought \ncomments on \"other potential approaches to monetizing these benefits.\" Id at 51,166. If anything, \nGovernmental Plaintiffs could have anticipated a valuation-based standard for all benefits in the \nfinal rule.  They could not have reasonably expected DHS to do away with the valuation-based \nthreshold entirely.  Accordingly, Governmental Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the Rule violates \nprocedural requirements of the AP A. \n3.  Plaintiffs State a Claim that the Rule Violates the Equal Protection Guarantee of \nthe Fifth Amendment. \nIn Count IV of their complaint, Organizational Plaintiffs claim that the Rule violates the \nequal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  This  Court previously determined that \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have \"at the very least, raised serious questions going to the merits of \ntheir Equal Protection Claim.\" (Org. Pls. Decision at 21 (quoting Saget v. Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d \n280,374 (E.D.N.Y. 2019).)  In particular, this Court concluded that the Rule likely fails to satisfY \neven the highly deferential standard of rational basis scrutiny, because it disproportionately harms \nnoncitizens of color, and Defendants have not articulated a \"rational relationship between the \ndisparity of treatment and some legitimate government purpose.\"  Lewis v.  Thompson, 252 F.3d \n567, 582 (2d Cir.  2001) (quoting Heller v.  Doe, 509 U.S.  312, 320 (1993)).  Governmental \nPlaintiffs  bring  similar  claims  under  Count  V  of their  complaint,  which  likewise  survive \nDefendants' motion to dismiss.  Plaintiffs also sufficiently plead animus required for an equal \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 14 of 31\nprotection claim under the legal standard set forth in Village ofA rlington Heights v. Metropolitan \nHousing Development Corporation, 429 U.S. 252 (1977).  In addition to their allegations that the \nRule will disparately impact immigrants of color, (Gov't Pis. Compl. '1['1[151-56, 258-62; Org. Pis. \nCompl. '1['1[ 235-37), which Defendants do not dispute, Plaintiffs provide extensive evidence of \nstatements that may evince discriminatory intent made by high-level officials who were allegedly \nthe decision-makers behind the Rule or influenced such decision-makers, (Gov't Pis. Compl. '1['1[ \n174-78; Org. Pis. Compl. '1['1[203-34).  Plaintiffs include, inter alia, statements by the President \nallegedly expressing \"dismay that [the United States] do[es] not 'have more people from places \nlike Norway,' contrasting such immigrants with those from '[expletive deleted] countries' such as \nHaiti and countries in Africa.\"  (Org. Pis. Compl. '1[211; see also Gov't Pis. Compl. '1[175.) \nThe Supreme Court recently rejected an equal protection challenge to the  decision to \nrescind the Defen·ed Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that was based, in part, on \ndisparate impact on Latinos and alleged discriminatory statements by the President.  Dep 't of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents oft he Univ. ofC  alifornia, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915-16 (2020). Defendants \nargue  that the  plurality  opinion in Regents  strongly  supports  dismissal  of Plaintiffs'  equal \nprotection claims in this case.  (Defs.' Letter dated June 26, 2020, No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 193; \nDefs.' Letter dated June 26, 2020, No.  19 Civ. 7993, ECF No. 219.)  Defendants point to two \naspects of the plurality opinion, in particular.  First, the plurality discounted the disparate impact \nof the rescission of DACA because \"Latinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien \npopulation,\" and so \"one would expect them to make up an outsized share of recipients of any \ncross-cutting immigration relief program.\"  Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  The Court explained that \n\"[w  ]ere this fact sufficient to state a[ n] [equal protection] claim, virtually any generally applicable \nimmigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds.\"  !d.  at 1916.  But here, \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 15 of 31\nPlaintiffs are not simply alleging that more immigrants of color are hurt by the agency action at \nissue.  Instead, Plaintiffs cite evidence regarding the disproportionate percentage of nonwhite \nimmigrants that would be hurt by the agency action at issue, as compared to the percentage of \nimmigrants from predominantly white countries.  (See,  e.g., Gov't Pls. Compl. ~~ 151, 262; Org. \nPls. Compl. ~~ 235-36.)  This finding is unaffected by the share of the immigrant population that \nis nonwhite. \nSecond, the Regents plurality dismissed the President's statements as  \"unilluminating\" \nbecause they were \"remote in time and made in umelated contexts.\"  Id.  at 1916.  Here, the \nPresident's statements cited by Plaintiffs were not ''remote in time\" to Defendants' promulgation \nof the Rule and actions by the President that allegedly precipitated promulgation of the Rule.  (See, \ne.g.,  Gov't Pls. Compl. ~ 175; Org. Pls. Compl. ~~ 93-94, 203-11.)  For instance, Plaintiffs cite \nstatements from January 2018, May 2018, and July 2019.  (Gov't Pls. Compl. ~ 175; Org. Pls. \nCompl. ~~ 208-209, 211.)  The Rule's development fits squarely within this timeframe.  Drafts of \nthe Rule were obtained by the news outlets in February and March 2018, (Org. Pls. Compl. ~ 94), \nthe NPRM was published in October 2018, and the Rule was issued in August 2019.  Plaintiffs \nallegations also  extend beyond the President's statements to  include statements by high-level \nofficials that are responsible for the Rule.  Indeed, Defendant Cuccinelli, a day after announcing \nthe Rule, stated that the Emma Lazarus poem etched on the base of the Statue of Liberty welcoming \n\"tired,\" \"poor,\"  and  \"huddled masses\" of immigrants was refen·ing to  \"people coming from \nEurope.\"  (Gov't Pls. Compl. ~ 176; Org. Pls. Compl. ~ 227.)  Drawing reasonable inferences in \nPlaintiffs' favor, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that issuance ofthe Rule was based, at least in \npart, on discriminatory motives and their claims survive Defendants' motions to dismiss. \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 16 of 31\n4.  Organizational Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim that DHS and USCIS Lack \nRulemaking Authority to Issue the Rule. \nOrganizational Plaintiffs allege in Count III of their complaint that DHS and USCIS lack \nrulemaking authority to issue the Rule.  (See Org. Pls. Compl. '1['1[179-83, 285-91.)  Section l 03 \nof the INA, as amended by the Homeland Security Act of2002 (\"HSA\"), sets forth the powers and \nduties of the Secretary of Homeland Security (the \"Secretary\") as it relates to the immigration \nlaws.  See  8 U.S.C.  § 1103.  Specifically, the Secretary is \"charged with administration and \nenforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of \naliens, except insofar as this chapter or such laws relate to the powers, functions,  and duties \nconferred upon the ... Attomey General.\"  !d.  § 1103(a)(1).  The Secretaty is authorized to \n\"establish  such  regulations  as  he  deems  necessary  for  carrying  out  his \nauthority.\"  Jd § 1103(a)(3).  Additionally, under the HSA, Congress specifically confened on \nDHS the authority to \"carry[] out the immigration enforcement functions,\" 6 U.S.C. §§ 202(3), \nand \"establish[] and administer[] rules . . . goveming the granting of visas or other forms of \npermission, including pmole, to enter the United States to individuals who me not a citizen or an \nalien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States,\" id.  § 202(4). \nThe public chm·ge provision states that the Attorney General is responsible for public \ncharge  determinations  for  those  seeking  admission  or  adjustment  of  status, \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A),  which  Organizational  Plaintiffs  argue  divests  the  Secretary  of \nresponsibility for making such determinations, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(l), and therefore \nalso any associated rulemaking authority. However, as Defendants note, under the HSA, Congress \nalso made clear that such references to the Attomey General should be construed as references to \nthe Secretary.  See 6 U.S.C. § 557 (\"With respect to any function transfened by or under this \nchapter, ... reference in any other Federal law to ... any officer or office the functions of which \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 17 of 31\nare so transferred shall be deemed to refer to the Secretary, other official, or component of [DHS] \nto which such function is so transferred.\").  The Secretary is thus at least concurrently responsible \nfor administering public charge dete1minations and any associated rulemaking. 9  Cf Scheerer v. \nUS. Atty. Gen., 513 F.3d 1244, 1251 & n.6 (11th Cir. 2008). Count III of Organizational Plaintiffs' \ncomplaint is dismissed. \n9 To be sure, there must be some set of powers, functions and duties conferred on the Attorney General that \nare excluded from the purview ofDHS and the Secretary for the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(l), \nas amended by the HSA, to carry meaning.  As Defendants aptly point out, we find a likely set of such \nduties elsewhere in Section 1103.  Under clause (g)( I), also added as part of the HSA, the Attorney General \nexplicitly retains the authorities and functions exercised by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. \n8 u.s.c. § 1103(g)(l). \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 18 of 31\nII.

Ct.  1942, 1943 (2018) (per curiam) (citation omitted).  To \nobtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must establish \"that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"  Winter v. Nat. \nRes.  Def Council,  Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The standard for a stay of agency action under \n5 U.S.C. § 705 is the same as the standard for a preliminary injunction.  Nat.  Res.

Inj. \nand Stay or TRO Pending Nat'l Emergency (\"Emergency PI Opp'n\"), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. \n176, at 6-10.) \n\"As a general rule, an appeal may be taken only from a final judgment.\"  NY.

As an exception to this rule, \n\"Congress permits ... an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order that either grants or denies \na preliminary injunction.\" Id at 1350.  Such an appeal, however, does not prevent the matter from \notherwise proceeding in the district court.

Therefore, \"its application is guided by concems of \nefficiency and is not automatic.\"  Id.  (citing Webb v.  GAF Corp., 78 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir. 1996) \nand United States v.

In deciding Defendants' pending appeal, the Second Circuit is charged with reviewing this \nCourt's analysis and conclusions based on the information available to this Court at the time of its \noriginal decision.  Therefore, by considering new, materially different evidence and issuing a new, \nnanowly tailored, temporary injunction, this Court does not disturb its prior orders or interfere \nwith the particular questions presented by Defendants' pending appeal. \nOverlapping legal issues between this Court's previous order and Plaintiffs' instant motion \ndo not automatically divest this Court of jurisdiction.  A district comt may advance a case despite \na pending interlocutory appeal and, in doing so, is often required to rule on issues relevant to those \non appeal.  The Second Circuit has held that a district court retains jurisdiction to issue a pe!Tllanent \ninjunction despite a pending appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction.

Moreover, the judicial efficiency concems that guide the divestiture ofj urisdiction rule \ncotmsel against depriving this Court of authority to hear Plaintiffs' motion.

Emergency (\"Emergency PI Reply\"), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 183, at 2.) \nBy issuing such relief, this Court would also not be ignoring the Supreme Court's stay of \nthe October 2019 Injunction.  First, as discussed above, there is no indication that the Supreme \nCourt disagreed with this Court's analysis of the merits of Plaintiffs' case.  Second, the Supreme \nCourt issued its stay on a significantly different factual record.  In issuing a stay of a lower comt's \n\"exercise of equitable  discretion  [in granting  a preliminary injunction],  [the  Supreme  Court] \nbring[s] to bear an equitable judgment of [its] own.\"  Trump v.  Int'l Refitgee Assistance Project, \n137 S. Ct. 2080,2087 (2017) (citing Nken v.  Holder,  556 U.S. 418,433 (2009)).

E-\nSystems,  Inc.  Grp.  Hasp.  Med &  Surgical Ins.  Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (199I) (Scalia, J., in \nchambers)).  Here, the Supreme Court provided no analysis for its decision to stay the October \n2019 Injunction, nor any insight into its equitable judgment.  What is clear, however, is that the \nirreparable hatm and public interests that watmnt an injunction have come into sharper focus in \nthe intervening months since the Supreme Comt issued its stay.  What were previously theoretical \nharms have proven to be tme.  We no longer need to imagine the worst-case scenario; we are \nexperiencing its dratnatic effects in very real time.  Equitable relief has become nothing short of \ncritical.  In issuing temporary relief today, this Court certainly is mindful of the Supreme Comt' s \nstay of the previously issued injunctions, but exercises equitable discretion based on the record \nnow before it--one the Supreme Court never had the opportunity to consider when it stayed the \npending October 2019 Injunction.10 \nt1h0 eT hSouupgrhem thee  CSuopurret'ms es tCayo motf d tehnei eOd cGtoobveerr n2m01e9n taIln jPulnacintitoinff,s 't hreec eJnuts tmicoesti odni dto  ntoetm ipnodriacraitley  wlifht eotrh emro tdhifeYy  \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 22 of 31\nB.  The COVID-19 Pandemic Warrants Temporary Equitable Relief \nAs an initial matter, this Court has already found that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their claims.  As to the remaining factors to be considered for preliminary injunctive \nrelief, Plaintiffs argue that the \"pandemic has drastically altered the nature and magnitude of the \nirreparable harms faced by Plaintiffs, their residents, and the nation due to the Rule and tipped the \nbalance of the equities decisively in favor  of granting injunctive relief while the COVID-19 \nemergency continues.\"  (Emergency PI Mem. at 16.) \n\"A showing of ineparable harm is 'the single most important prerequisite for the issuance \nof a preliminary injunction.\"' Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v.  Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d \nCir.  2009)  (citation  omitted).  \"To  satisfy  the  irreparable  hmm requirement,  Plaintiffs  must \ndemonstrate that absent a preliminmy injunction they will suffer 'an injury that is neither remote \nnor speculative, but actual and imminent,' and one that cannot be remedied 'if a court waits until \nthe end of trial to resolve the harm.\"' Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60, \n66 (2d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).  Though Plaintiffs need not show \"that irreparable harm \nalready ha[s] occurred,\" Mullins v.  City ofN  ew York, 626 F.3d 47, 55 (2d. Cir. 2010), they have \ndone just that here. \n1.  Plaintiffs Are Subject to Pressing and Substantial Harms. \nIn addition to the national emergency, Governmental Plaintiffs have declared public-health \nemergencies in their respective jurisdictions.  (Emergency PI Mem. at 5.)  Officials have taken a \nvariety of dramatic measures to reverse the course of the pandemic, including \"requir[ing] all \nconsidered the evidence regarding COVID-19 and rejected Governmental Plaintiffs' motion on that basis. \nFurther, the Supreme Court did not state that its stay of the October 2019 Injunction, or refusal to modify \nsuch stay, precluded Governmental Plaintiffs' from seeking new temporary relief tailored to the national \nemergency in the district court.  Instead, the Supreme Court instructed that its denial \"does not preclude a \nfiling in the District Court as counsel considers appropriate.\" \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 23 of 31\nnonessential employees to work from home, clos[ing] schools, and issu[ing] orders to increase \nhospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients.\" (!d.)  Medical care is a vital component of these \nefforts to \"slow[] infection rates, preserv[ e] hospital capacity and medical equipment, and sav[ e] \nlives.\"  (!d.  at 6.)  Infected individuals who are not tested or receive inadequate medical care are \nmore likely to spread the virus to others and experience serious complications from COVID-19, \nincluding death.  (!d. at 6; see also Dec!. of Elena Goldstein, Ex. 16 (Dec!. of Leighton Ku), No. \n19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-16, ~~ 11-12,20, 22.) \nPlaintiffs provide ample evidence that the Rule deters immigrants from seeking testing and \ntreatment for COVID-19, which in turn impedes public efforts in the Governmental Plaintiffs' \njurisdictions to stem the spread of the disease.  Doctors and other medical personnel, state and \nlocal officials, and staff at nonprofit organizations have all witnessed immigrants refusing to enroll \nin Medicaid or other publicly funded health coverage,  or forgoing testing  and treatment for \nCOVID-19,  out of fear that accepting such insurance or care will increase their risk of being \nlabeled a \"public charge.\"  (See,  e.g., Dec!. of Elena Goldstein, Ex. 8 (Dec!. of Eden Almasude), \nNo. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-8, ~~ 4-8; Ex. 14 (Dec!. of Dana Kennedy), No. 19 Civ. 7777, \nECF No.  170-14,  ~~ 5-9,  11-13; Ex.  15  (Dec!.  of Camille  Kritzman),  No.  19  Civ.  7777, \nECF No. 170-15, ~~ 2-4; Ex.  16 (Dec!. of Leighton Ku), No.  19 Civ. 7777, ECF No.  170-16, \n~~ 10-11; Ex. 17 (Dec!. ofPedro Moreno), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECFNo. 170-17, ~ 4; Ex. 18 (Dec!. \nofBitta Mostofi), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-18, ~~ 13, 15; Ex. 21 (Dec!. of Rachel Pryor), \nNo. 19 Civ.  7777,  ECF  No.  170-21,  ~~ 13-17,  19;  Ex.  22  (Dec!.  of Aaron  Coskey  Voit), \nNo. 19 Civ.  7777,  ECF  No.  170-22,  ~~ 27-28,  30;  Ex.  27  (Dec!.  of Alejandra  Aguilar), \nNo. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-27, ~~ 7-13, 18.)  As a direct result of the Rule, immigrants are \nforced to make an impossible choice between jeopardizing public health and personal safety or \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 24 of 31\ntheir innnigration status.  Defendants claim that any such effect of the Rule is based on \"mistaken \nbeliefs\" about the Rule's application and therefore cannot be fairly attributed to the Rule.  (See \nEmergency PI Opp'n at 15-17.)  Defendants point to statements in Plaintiffs' declarations that \ndescribe instances of immigrants inconectly believing they are subject to the Rule or declining \nbenefits that are not treated negatively under the Rule.11  (!d. at 16.)  However, even if innnigrants \nact in part on mistaken belief, the Supreme Court has recognized injmy where the plaintiffs hatms \nare based on the \"predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties,\" even \nif such decisions are \"motivated by unfounded fears.\" Dep't ofC  ommerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. \n2551,2566 (2019).  Here, such decisions are more than predictable, they are already occuning. \nAny  policy  that  deters  residents  from  seeking  testing  and  treatment  for  COVID-19 \nincreases the risk of infection for such residents and the public.  Adverse govemment action that \ntargets immigrants, however, is particularly dangerous during a pandemic.  Innnigrants make up a \nsubstantial portion of workers in essential industries who have continued to work throughout the \nnational emergency and  interact with large swaths of the population, whether in healthcare, \nagriculture, food packing and distribution, or sanitation, atnong other industries.  (See, e.g., Dec!. \nof Elena Goldstein, Ex. 10 (Dec!. of Lawrence L. Benito), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-10, \n,  11; Ex. 12 (Dec!. of Sabrina Fong), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-12, ,, 12-13; Ex. 14 (Dec!. \nof Dana Kennedy), No.  19 Civ. 7777, ECF No.  170-14,, 15; Ex.  16 (Dec!. of Leighton Ku), \nNo. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-16,, 20; Ex. 22 (Dec!. of Aaron Coskey Voit), No. 19 Civ. 7777, \nECF  No.  170-22,  ,, 9-10.)  Essential  workers  have  been  disproportionately  affected  by \nCOVID-19.  Protecting them is in their best interest and the interest of the public at large.  When \n11 Plaintiffs' declarations also cite instances of immigrants avoiding benefits that may be covered by the \nRule.  (See,  e.g., Dec!. of Elena Goldstein, Ex. 8 (Dec!. of Eden Almasude), No.  19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. \n170-8, '1[6; Ex. 14 (Dec!. of Dana Kennedy), No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 170-14, '1[11.) \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 25 of 31\nindividuals with a high percentage of public exposure are fearful of receiving medical care for a \ndeadly,  contagious  disease,  the  health  and  security  of communities  across  the  country  is \njeopardized. \n2.  USCIS's Alert Does Not Sufficiently Mitigate the Harms. \nUSCIS 's own effmis to address these substantial harms are particularly revealing, though \nplainly  insufficient.  In the first  test  of the  Rule's  immediate  application,  Defendants have \ndete1mined that the Rule cannot be uniformly or effectively applied in response to this deadly \nhealth crisis.  For good reasons, Defendants have now immediately changed the Rule by what it \ncalls \"informal guidance.\"  That \"infmmal guidance\" presently indicates that the Rule will not be \napplied to certain coronavirus-related benefits.  Specifically, on March 13, 2020, US CIS issued an \nalert that excludes \"testing, treatment, [and] preventative care ... related to COVID-19\" from \npublic charge inadmissibility determinations, \"even if such treatment is provided or paid for by \none or more public benefits, as defined in the [R]ule (e.g., federally funded Medicaid).\"  Public \nCharge Alert, U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card \nprocesses-and-procedures/public-charge  (last  updated March 27,  2020).  That response  is  a \nrecognition of \"the possibility that some aliens impacted by COVID-19 may be hesitant to seek \nnecessary medical treatment or preventive services.\"  !d.  Still, the Alert is unlikely to remedy \nPlaintiffs' harms considering its limited scope in the context of the Rule.  As Defendants explain, \nan immigrant's emollment in Medicaid will only be excluded from the public charge analysis if \nthe  immigrant  emolls  \"solely  in  order  to  obtain  COVID-19-related  testing,  treatment,  or \npreventative care\" and provided the immigrant \"disenrolls fi-om Medicaid once he or she no longer \nneeds COVID-19-related care, or provides evidence of a request to disenroll.\" (Dec!. of Joseph B. \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 26 of 31\nEdlow, No. 19 Civ. 7777, ECF No. 177, \"lf12 (emphasis added); see also Emergency PI Opp'n at \n13.) \nPlaintiffs argue that the Aleti exempts testing and treatment related to COVID-19 paid for \nby federally funded Medicaid, but not the enrollment in Medicaid itself.  But even crediting \nDefendants' interpretation leaves immigrants in an impractical position.  As this Comi explained \nat oral argument, few emoll in Medicaid for a single purpose.  There is no box for applicants to \ncheck off that limits their use of Medicaid to COVID-19-related treatment.  (See Tr. of Oral Arg. \ndated May 18, 2020, at 59:9-17.)  Defendants offer no direction regarding how an immigrant \nshould establish that he or she emolled in Medicaid solely to obtain COVID-19-related care.  In \nsum, an immigrant who uses federally funded Medicaid to access COVID-19 treatment is now told \nthat he will not be negatively impacted in a future public charge determination by such COVID-\n19 treatment, but his emollment in Medicaid itself may be counted against him and any use not \ndetermined to be COVID-19 related will count against him.  At a minimum, such ambiguity and \nstrict limitations belie any notion that the Alert adequately encourages immigrants to seek medical \ntreatment or preventative care related to COVID-19. \nThe Alert falls short in a number of other respects as well.  First, it keeps in place the Rule's \ndisincentives for using economic supplemental benefits.  The country is experiencing a sharp \neconomic downturn, as a predictable direct and indirect effect of the pandemic.  Accordingly, \nmany immigrants and citizens alike, who otherwise would not be classified as public charges under \nany reasonable definition, are experiencing substantial financial burdens as employers slash jobs, \nbenefits, and pay.  Yet, the Rule offers no meaningful relief or incentive for immigrants in such \ncircumstances to confidently access supplemental benefits, such as  SNAP.  Instead, the Alert \nexplains that an individual who: \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 27 of 31\nlives  and  works  in a jurisdiction  where  disease  prevention  methods  such  as  social \ndistancing or quarantine are in place, or where [his or her] employer, school, or university \nvoluntarily shuts down operations to prevent the spread ofCOVrD-19, ... may submit a \nstatement with his or her application for adjustment of status to explain how such methods \nor policies have affected [him or herl  as relevant to the factors users must consider in a \npublic charge inadmissibility determination. \nWhat an adequate statement should say is unknown.  The Alert provides no articulable standard to \nwhich  one  should  conform  one's  conduct.  users  will  then  take  such  statement  \"into \nconsideration\" to  the  extent \"relevant and credible.\"  Such a hollow promise provides little \ncomfort.  Simply relying on the compassion or sympathy of immigration officials is not rational, \neither in rulemaking or in informally attempting to amend those rules. \nAdditionally, the exception for coronavirus-related treatment likely does not cover a wide \nvariety of other reasonable steps that may be taken to protect public health during the pandemic. \nAt oral argument, Defendants at least implied that if an immigrant obtained Medicaid for purposes \nof securing COVrD-19 treatment, but during such treatment he or she was also treated for the flu, \nsuch flu treatment would not be exempt from the public charge determination because it is \nunrelated to COVID-19 treatment.  (Tr. of Oral Arg. dated May 18,2020, at 58-59.)  It appears \nthat an individual would be similarly penalized for utilizing Medicaid to receive treatment for \nmedical conditions that place patients at increased risk of suffering severe illness or death if they \ncontract COVID-19, such as clu·onic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Type 2 diabetes, or \nserious heart conditions.  See Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)- People ofA  ny Age with \nUnderlying  Medical  Conditions,  Ctrs.  for  Disease  Control  &  Prevention, \nhttps :// www .cdc. govI  coronavirus/20 19-ncov/ need -extra-precautions/people-with-medical-\nconditions.html (last updated July 17, 2020). \nFinally, at oral argument, Defendants conceded that users has no obligation to retain the \nAlert for any period of time, let alone for the pendency of the public health emergency.  (Tr. of \n27 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 28 of 31\nOral Arg. dated May 18, 2020, at 75:16-25.) Nor is there any protection from a retroactive change \nin policy.12  The characterization of the published \"alert\" as \"informal guidance\" outside of \nrulemaking provides no assurance of its future reliability.  Any semblance of a mitigating effect \nthat the Alert has on the tangible hmms caused by the Rule's general application may be wiped \nout at a moment's notice.  The uncertainty surrounding the scope of the Alert's coronavirus \ntreatment exception further adds confusion and chaos. It defeats the stated purpose of encouraging \nimmigrants to seek COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. \n3.  The Balance oft he Equities and Public Interest Decidedly Favor Temporary \nInjunctive ReliefD  uring the National Health Emergency. \nConsidering the substantial harm to the public caused by the Rule during the present \npandemic, the balance of the equities and public interest also strongly favor an injunction.  While \nthe Rule has only been in effect since February 24, 2020, the prior public charge framework has \nbeen uniformly  applied  for  decades.  (Gov't Pis.  Decision at 21.)  Defendants'  interest in \neffectuating the Rule fails to measure up to the gravity of this global pandemic that continues to \nthreaten the lives and economic well-being of America's residents.  No person should hesitate to \nseek medical care, nor should they endure punishment or penalty ifthey seek temporary financial \naid as a result of the pandemic's impact. \nMoreover, Defendants' new \"informal guidance\" that attempts to carve out a COVID-19 \nexception is an admission that it is neither in the public interest nor compelled by the balance of \nequities to cunently apply the Rule as written and adopted.  Plainly, Defendants have indicated \nthat the Rule's uniform application is likely to be injurious to Plaintiffs, immigrants, and the public \n12 Defendants asserted at oral argument that \"as long as the policy is in place, people who use benefits in a \nway that's described by the policy, they can be sure that at any point in the fi.Jture,  if they submit an \napplication for adjustment of status, this is the policy that will be applied to their benefit usage that occmTed \nwhile this policy was in place.\" (Tr. of Oral Arg. dated May 18, 2020, at 75:5-1 0.) This Court is aware of \nno legal obligation that accompanies this pledge, in the Alert, the Rule, or otherwise. \n28 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 29 of 31\nat large during this national public health emergency. The problem is not with the decision to issue \nthe Alert or declare a public health emergency, but with the Rule.  All agree that the Rule should \nnot to be applied, as written, during this current pandemic.  There is also a question of whether it \nshould be applied to future deadly plagues, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or other \nnatural and manmade disasters that threaten the health and safety of citizens and immigrants alike, \nthrough no fault of their own.  The Rule has demonstrably failed the first real world test of its \napplication. \nC.  A Nationwide Temporary Injunction is Appropriate. \nAs this  Court found with respect to  its  initial injunction regarding the Rule, and for \nadditional reasons, a nationwide injunction is both necessary to redress the harms caused by the \nRule, and appropriate given the strong federal interest in uniformity of the national health and \nimmigration policies at issue here.  (See Gov't Pls. Decision at 21-24; Org. Pls. Decision at 24-\n26); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187-88 (5th Cir. 2015) (upholding a nationwide \ninjunction of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \n(DAPA) immigration relief program, in part, because the Constitution requires and Congress has \ncalled for uniform administration of immigration laws).  The scope of preliminary injunctive relief \ngenerally should be \"no broader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused by the \nviolation,\" Church & Dwight Co.  v.  SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics, GmBH, 843 F.3d 48, 72 \n(2d Cir. 20 16), but \"is dictated by the extent of the violation established, not by the geographical \nextent of the plaintiff,\" Califano v.  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).  The likely unlawful \nagency action in this case applies universally, to every public charge determination made by \nimmigration officials across the country.  Limited relief would simply not protect the interests of \nall stakeholders.  A geographically restricted injunction, in particular, would undoubtedly result in \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-07777-GBD   Document 195   Filed 07/29/20   Page 30 of 31\ninconsistent applications of the Rule, and different public charge determinations based solely on \nlocation.  The effect of the Rule's application should not depend on what side of the George \nWashington bridge between New York and New Jersey one fortuitously finds oneself. \nMoreover, as Plaintiffs correctly point out, nationwide relief is critical to curing Plaintiffs' \nharms associated with the pandemic, considering the \"interconnected nature of the risks between \nand within states, and the realities attendant to the spread of this disease.\"  (Emergency PI Mem. \nat  25.)  Even  Defendants'  limited  COVID-19  exception  does  not  distinguish  its  benefits \ngeographically.  A patchwork public charge framework would only contribute to the spread of \nCOVID-19 in our communities.  As we have all come to recognize, the virus knows no artificial \nboundaries.  And as the country returns to business, so too will interstate travel and commerce. \nEach infected individual that travels to Governmental Plaintiffs' jurisdictions risks undoing crucial \nprogress made in combatting this disease.  Discouraging noncitizens nationwide from obtaining \nnecessary treatment and care ce1tainly undermines those efforts.  Issuing geographically limited \nrelief would not meaningfully abate the public health risk, especially when applied to a population \nthat represents a significant po1tion of essential workers who continue to work outside of their \nhomes and interact with the public at large.  Thus, a temporary injunction entirely barring the Rule \nis appropriate. 13 \n13 This Court is cognizant of the equitable and constitutional concerns regarding nationwide injunctions. \nSee,  e.g.,  Dep 't  of Homeland Sec.  v.  New  York,  140  S.  Ct.  599  (2020)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring). \nNevertheless, in the appropriate circumstances, \"district comts sitting in equity have the authority to issue \nnationwide injunctions.\"  Saget v.  Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 378 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Leman v. \nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U.S. 448, 451  (1932)).  To be sure, a comt's authority to issue \nnationwide injunctions is a power that should be exercised sparingly, and certainly cannot be applied in \nconflict with each circuit's own determination of its appropriateness. This Court certainly does not discount \nlegitimate  concerns,  but  concludes  that  the  convoluted geographic  patchwork of mtificially  limited \ntemporary relief, in this case, is just as likely to be \"patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the \ngovernment, courts, and all those affected.\"  Dep't of Homeland Sec.  v.

Trump v. International \nRefugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (“IRAP”). Here, as plaintiffs’ motion \nexplained, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has so drastically altered the balance of the equities \nthat this Court should revisit its previously issued stay and either lift it during the pendency of the \nnational emergency declared by the president concerning COVID-19, or clarify that the lower \ncourt may consider these changed circumstances (including plaintiffs’ new evidence) in the first \ninstance. (Mot. by Gov’t Pls. to Temporarily Lift or Modify the Court’s Stay (“Mot.”) 14-24.) \nDefendants do not dispute that this Court has the power to issue such relief. Nor do they \ndispute that there is a direct connection between the COVID-19 crisis and the Public Charge Rule \nat issue here—indeed, they have already been forced to limit the Rule in light of the COVID-19 \ncrisis, and they have announced further changes for the first time in their response to plaintiffs’ \nmotion here. Their arguments against the narrow relief that plaintiffs request are meritless.  \nFirst, defendants miss the mark in presuming that this Court has already deemed plaintiffs’ \nclaims unlikely to succeed and that any change to the balance of the equities would thus not “even \nbe relevant to the propriety of the existing stay.” (Response in Opp. to Resps.’ Mot. to Temporarily \nLift or Modify the Court’s Stay (“Opp.”) 11; see also id. at 5-6, 8-10.) A stay is “often dependent \nas much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.” IRAP, 137 \nS. Ct. at 2087 (citations omitted). Indeed, the stay order does not mention the parties’ merits \narguments at all. (App. 1.)  \nAt minimum, there are sufficiently serious questions about defendants’ likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits that this Court can and should evaluate whether the drastically changed \n\ncircumstances presented by the COVID-19 crisis warrant a temporary halt to the Rule. See Wolf v. \nCook County, Ill., 140 S. Ct. 681, 683 (2020) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting “weighty \narguments on the merits” raised by plaintiffs in separate challenge to the Rule). And as plaintiffs’ \nmotion established and defendants do not contest, the Court plainly has authority to temporarily \nlift or modify its own stay, or to postpone the effective date of the Rule under 5 U.S.C. § 705, in \norder to properly “balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.” IRAP, 137 S. Ct. at 2087. \n(See Mot. 14-16.)  \nSecond, this Court’s exercise of its undisputed authority here would not be unprecedented, \nas defendants contend. (See Opp. 7, 10, 18.) In prior cases, this Court, acting through a single \nJustice or the full Court, has lifted, modified, or clarified the meaning of its own stay orders when \nnew circumstances not previously considered by the Court warranted such a response. See, e.g., \nKing v. Smith, 88 S. Ct. 842, 843 (1968) (Black, J., in chambers). For example, in IRAP, this Court \neffectively  clarified  that  its  earlier-issued  stay  order  permitted  the  entry  of  “grandparents, \ngrandchildren,  aunts,  uncles,  nieces,  nephews,  cousins,  brothers-in-law  and  sisters-in-law,”1 \nnotwithstanding the president’s executive order halting immigration from certain countries, when \nit rejected the federal government’s effort to limit that stay only to more immediate family \nmembers. See Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 34 (2017) (Mem.); IRAP, 137 S. Ct. at 2088. And lower \ncourts routinely alter or lift their own equitable orders when new circumstances warrant such a \nchange. See, e.g., New York v. Kraeger, 972 F. Supp. 2d 291, 295 (N.D.N.Y. 2013) (granting in \npart motion to modify injunction given “significant change in circumstances”); NML Capital, Ltd. \nv. Republic of Argentina, No. 08-cv-6978, 2016 WL 836773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 2, 2016) (lifting \n                                                 \n1 Hawai’i v. Trump, 263 F. Supp. 3d 1049, 1054 (D. Haw. 2017). \n  2 \n\npreviously issued injunctions where “circumstances have changed so significantly as to render the \ninjunctions inequitable and detrimental to the public interest”).  \nMoreover, this Court is likely the only court that can provide temporary relief from the \nharms imposed by the Public Charge Rule during the national emergency. Defendants themselves \nstrenuously argue that the district court here “probably lacks the authority” to consider plaintiffs’ \nconcerns about the changed circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic “now that the \nCourt has stayed” the district court’s orders of preliminary relief. (Opp. 16.) Thus—unless this \nCourt clarifies that, contrary to defendants’ assertion, the district court can consider the COVID-\n19 crisis and appropriately tailor temporary relief to those new circumstances—only this Court can \ndecide whether the balance of the equities warrants the lifting or modification of its own stay.  \nIn any event, the unprecedented crisis currently facing this nation calls for unprecedented \nrelief. The COVID-19 pandemic is the largest public-health and economic disaster that the country \nhas faced in at least a century. And the Public Charge Rule is impeding efforts to mitigate the \nvirus’s spread and to stabilize the economy. These exceptional circumstances have already led to \nextraordinary changes in this country—and indeed around the world. The temporary and targeted \nrelief that plaintiffs request here is thus not disproportionate to the severe problems that we are \nfacing.    \nThird, defendants dispute that the “equities have shifted in a way that would warrant \nrevisiting” this Court’s stay. (See Opp. 11.) In so arguing, defendants do not contest that the Public \nCharge Rule is deterring immigrants and their family members from obtaining publicly funded \nhealth insurance and medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus undermining efforts to \nslow the spread of the virus. (See Mot. 18-22.) Nor do they dispute that the Rule is deterring \nimmigrants  and  their  family  members  from  using  public  benefits,  such  as  Medicaid  and \n  3 \n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, that are critical to helping plaintiffs and the \nnation recover from the current economic crisis. (Id. at 22-24.) Indeed, defendants do not challenge \nas a factual matter any of the concrete evidence of harms presented by plaintiffs.   \nInstead, defendants assert that they have “taken aggressive actions to address the current \npublic-health crisis” through the alert they issued regarding the application of the Public Charge \nRule to COVID-19 medical treatment or preventive services. (Opp. 18.) But plaintiffs have already \nexplained why defendants’ alert is inadequate and thus no substitute for the relief requested here. \n(Mot. 24-26.) Tellingly, defendants’ principal response to plaintiffs’ objections is to further modify \nthe Rule’s application by stating for the first time that “if an alien enrolls in Medicaid to receive \nCOVID-19-related  care,  that  enrollment  will  not  be  a  negative  factor  in  a  public-charge \ninadmissibility determination.” (Opp. 13.) Although defendants purport to base this position on \nthe text of the alert they issued, the alert actually appears to say the opposite by admonishing that \ndefendants will continue “to consider the receipt of certain cash and non-cash public benefits, \nincluding those that may be used to obtain testing or treatment for COVID-19 in a public charge \ninadmissibility determination.” (App. 44 (emphasis added).) Defendants’ attempt to further alter \nthe Rule through their opposition to a motion in this Court not only highlights the defects in the \noriginal alert, but will also likely cause more confusion about the Rule’s applicability during these \ntumultuous times—thus further demonstrating the need for this Court to issue a clear ruling that \ntemporarily lifts or modifies its stay until the national emergency ends.  \nIn any event, defendants’ new modification of the Rule’s application falls short for \nadditional reasons. For example, under the alert, the Rule continues to penalize an LPR applicant \nfor seeking or using Medicaid coverage to obtain treatment for medical conditions other than \nCOVID-19 that place patients at high risk of suffering more severe symptoms or death if they \n  4 \n\ncontract COVID-19. (See Mot. 25; App. 66 (explaining that because “much of the medical harm \nof COVID-19 is related to other medical problems, such as heart disease, asthma, or diabetes, \neffective  treatment  may  involve  care  for  other  medical  problems  for  which  insurance  is \nnecessary”).) And defendants’ assertion that they may consider other COVID-19-related factors \nthat lead an immigrant to access public benefits—“such as enforced social distancing or an \nemployer’s shutting down” (Opp. 13)—is no assurance at all because defendants purport to retain \ncomplete discretion to give such factors any weight they choose, including no weight at all. The \nambiguous and incomplete nature of defendants’ alert thus should not preclude this Court from \ndetermining whether the equities here warrant narrow relief from this Court to fully address the \nPublic Charge Rule’s impact on the COVID-19 crisis. \nDefendants also contend (Opp. 14-15) that the Court should simply ignore the evidence of \nthe Rule’s new harms to public health and the economy because many immigrants are forgoing or \ndisenrolling from critical public benefits out of “mistaken beliefs about the Rule’s application and \ncontent.” (Opp. 14 (quotation marks and alterations omitted).) But defendants do not dispute that \nthe Public Charge Rule is in fact deterring many immigrants and their family members from using \nany publicly funded healthcare or nutritional benefits, even if those individuals or benefits are not \ndirectly subject to the Rule. In the standing context, this Court has recognized that cognizable \ninjury can be based on the “predictable effect[s]” of a challenged government action—including \nthe effects on individuals who are not directly subject to the government’s action and who react \nbased on purportedly “unfounded fears.” Department of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2566 (2019). Defendants have cited no case that would preclude this Court from similarly \nconsidering such predictable harms in balancing the equities here—particularly when the Rule’s \n  5 \n\ndeterrent effects, and their resulting harms to both the parties and the public interest, are not only \npredictable but are actually happening now.  \nMoreover, defendants cannot simply dismiss the confusion about the Public Charge Rule \nthat is deterring many immigrants and their family members from using public benefits during the \ncurrent crisis when that confusion is largely the product of defendants’ own actions. It is entirely \nunderstandable that the many ambiguities and deficiencies in the alert and the Rule are driving \nmany immigrants and their family members to avoid public benefits rather than risk losing the \nopportunity to obtain LPR status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship. (See, e.g., App. 158 (alert has \n“only created more confusion” about Public Charge Rule); App. 192-193 (explaining difficulties \nin differentiating between use of federally funded Medicaid, which is a negative or heavily \nweighted negative factor under Rule depending on duration of use, and use of purely state-funded \nMedicaid or other healthcare benefits, which is not a negative factor under Rule).) And contrary \nto defendants’ contention (Opp. 15), officials and agencies in plaintiffs’ jurisdictions, as well as \nmany other state and local officials and private organizations across the country, are expending \nsignificant resources to educate the public and clarify the scope of the Public Charge Rule. These \nefforts have continued during the pandemic despite the enormous strains that COVID-19 is placing \non plaintiffs’ resources. (See, e.g., App. 36-37, 116-118.) But temporary and targeted relief from \nthis Court is needed precisely because the Rule continues to drive many immigrants and their \nfamily members away from publicly funded healthcare and benefits despite plaintiffs’ efforts to \nmitigate such harms.  \nFinally, defendants object to the Court temporarily lifting or modifying its stay on the \nground that such relief will halt implementation of the Rule nationwide until the federal emergency \nends. (See Opp. 16.) But such nationwide relief is perfectly appropriate to address the nationwide \n  6 \n\nharms that the Rule is inflicting during a public-health and economic crisis that is currently \naffecting every State in the country. And temporary, nationwide relief will provide needed clarity \nabout the Rule’s application during the pandemic. In any event, to the extent that the Court is \nconcerned about this point, it “need not grant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold \nits decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.” IRAP, 137 S. Ct. at 2087 (quoting 11A \nCharles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2947, \nat 115 (3d ed. 2013)). The Court may thus temporarily lift or modify its stay as applied to plaintiffs’ \njurisdictions, which are some of the jurisdictions hardest hit by the pandemic. Or the Court may \nclarify that its stay does not preclude the district court from reconsidering the geographic scope of \nany further preliminary relief to respond to the new circumstances caused by the COVID-19 \npandemic.  \n  7 \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should temporarily lift or modify its stay to halt implementation of the Public \nCharge Rule during the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020. In the alternative, the \nCourt should clarify that its stay does not preclude the district court from considering whether \nchanged  circumstances  from  the  COVID-19  outbreak  warrant  temporary  relief  from \nimplementation of the Public Charge Rule. \nDated:  New York, New York \nApril 22, 2020 \nRespectfully submitted, \nLETITIA JAMES \nAttorney General \nState ofN  ew York \nBARBARA D.

In the event the petition for a writ \nof certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the \nsending down of the judgment of this Court. \nJUSTICE GINSBURG,  JUSTICE BREYER,  JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR,  \nand  JUSTICE  KAGAN would deny the application. \nJUSTICE  GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE  THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the grant of stay. \n  On October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Secu-\nrity began  a rulemaking process to define the term “public \ncharge,” as it is used in the Nation’s immigration laws.  Ap-\nproximately 10 months and 266,000 comments later, the \nagency issued a final rule. Litigation swiftly followed, with\na number of States, organizations, and individual plaintiffs \nvariously alleging that the new definition violates the Con-\nstitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the immi-\ngration  laws  themselves.  These  plaintiffs  have  urged\ncourts to enjoin the rule’s enforcement not only as it applies  \n \n\n2  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. NEW YORK \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., concurring  \nto them, or  even to some definable group having something \nto do with their claimed injury, but as it applies to anyone. \n  These efforts have met with mixed  results.  The Northern  \nDistrict of California ordered the government not to enforce \nthe new rule within a hodge-podge of jurisdictions—Califor-\nnia, Oregon, Maine, Pennsylvania, and the District of Co-\nlumbia. The Eastern District of Washington entered a sim-\nilar order, but went much farther geographically, enjoining \nthe government from enforcing its rule globally.  But both  \nof  those  orders  were  soon  stayed  by  the  Ninth  Circuit \nwhich, in a 59-page opinion, determined the government \nwas likely to succeed on the merits.  Meanwhile, across the  \ncountry, the District of Maryland entered its own universal \ninjunction, only to have that one stayed by the Fourth Cir-\ncuit.  And while all these developments were unfolding on \nthe coasts, the Northern District of Illinois was busy fash-\nioning its own injunction, this one limited to enforcement \nwithin the State of Illinois.  \n  If all of this is confusing, don’t worry, because none of it \nmatters much at this point.  Despite the fluid state of \nthings—some interim wins for the government over here, \nsome preliminary relief for plaintiffs over there—we now \nhave an injunction to rule them all:  the one before us, in  \nwhich a single judge in New York enjoined the government \nfrom applying the new definition to anyone, without regard \nto geography or participation in this or any other lawsuit.  \nThe Second Circuit declined to stay this particular univer-\nsal injunction, and so now, after so many trips up and down \nand around the judicial map, the government brings its \nwell-rehearsed arguments here.\n  Today the Court (rightly) grants a stay, allowing the gov-\nernment to pursue (for now) its policy everywhere save Illi-\nnois.  But, in light of all that’s come before, it would be de-\nlusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the \nproblem. The real problem here is the increasingly common \npractice of  trial courts ordering relief that transcends the \n \n\n  Cite as:  589 U. S. ____ (2020)  3 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., concurring  \ncases before them.  Whether framed as injunctions of “na-\ntionwide,” “universal,” or “cosmic” scope, these orders share \nthe same basic flaw—they direct how the defendant must \nact toward persons who are not parties to the case. \n  Equitable remedies, like remedies in general, are meant \nto redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in \na particular lawsuit.  When a district court orders the gov-\nernment not to enforce a rule against the plaintiffs in the \ncase before it, the court redresses the injury that gives rise \nto its jurisdiction in the first place.  But when a court goes \nfurther than that, ordering the government to take (or not \ntake) some action with respect to those who are strangers \nto the suit, it is hard to see how the court could still be act-\ning in the judicial role of resolving cases and controversies.  \nInjunctions like these thus raise serious questions about \nthe scope of courts’ equitable powers under Article III.  See \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (THOMAS,  J.,  \nconcurring); Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the Na-\ntional Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471–472 (2017) \n(Bray); Morley, De Facto Class Actions? Plaintiff- and De-\nfendant-Oriented  Injunctions  in  Voting  Rights,  Election \nLaw, and Other Constitutional Cases, 39 Harv. J. L. & Pub.  \nPol’y 487, 523–527 (2016).\n  It  has  become  increasingly  apparent  that  this  Court\nmust, at some point, confront these important objections to \nthis increasingly widespread practice.  As the brief and fu-\nrious history of the regulation before us illustrates, the rou-\ntine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworka-\nble, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and \nall those affected by these conflicting decisions.  Rather  \nthan spending their time methodically developing argu-\nments and evidence in cases limited to the parties at hand, \nboth sides have been forced to rush from one preliminary \ninjunction hearing to another, leaping from one emergency \nstay application to the next, each with potentially nation-\nwide stakes, and all based on expedited briefing and little \n \n\n4  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY v. NEW YORK \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., concurring  \nopportunity for the adversarial testing of evidence. \n  This is not normal.  Universal injunctions have little ba-\nsis in traditional equitable practice.  Bray 425–427.  Their \nuse has proliferated only in very recent years.  See Trump, \n585 U. S., at ___–___ (THOMAS,  J., concurring) (slip op., at \n8–9).  And they hardly seem an innovation we should rush \nto embrace.  By their nature, universal injunctions tend to\nforce judges into making rushed, high-stakes, low-infor-\nmation decisions. Bray 461–462. The traditional system of\nlower courts issuing interlocutory relief limited to the par-\nties at hand may require litigants and courts to tolerate in-\nterim uncertainty about a rule’s final fate and proceed more \nslowly until this Court speaks in a case of its own.  But that  \nsystem encourages multiple judges and multiple circuits to \nweigh in only after careful deliberation, a process that per-\nmits the airing of competing views that aids this Court’s \nown decisionmaking process.  Ibid.   The rise of nationwide  \ninjunctions may just be a sign of our impatient times.  But  \ngood judicial decisions are usually tempered by older vir-\ntues. \n  Nor do the costs of nationwide injunctions end there.  \nThere are currently more than 1,000 active and senior dis-\ntrict court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts, and \nsubject to review in 12 regional courts of appeal.  Because \nplaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in \ncases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly \nboundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure \na win nationwide. Id., at 457–461. The risk of winning con-\nflicting nationwide injunctions is real too.  Id., at 462–464.  \nAnd the stakes are asymmetric. If a single successful chal-\nlenge is enough to stay  the challenged rule across the coun-\ntry, the government’s hope of implementing any new policy \ncould face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-\nto-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the \ncourts of appeal.  A single loss and the policy goes on ice—\npossibly for good, or just as possibly for some indeterminate  \n \n\n  Cite as:  589 U. S. ____ (2020)  5 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., concurring  \nperiod of time until another court jumps in to grant a stay.  \nAnd all that can repeat, ad infinitum, until either one side  \ngives up or this Court grants certiorari.  What in this \ngamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?\n  I concur in the Court’s decision to issue a stay.  But I  \nhope, too, that we might at an appropriate juncture take up  \nsome of the underlying equitable and constitutional ques-\ntions raised by the rise of nationwide injunctions. \n ",
