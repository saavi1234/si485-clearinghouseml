    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. District court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule but after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The district court in this case denied a preliminary injunction but issued a preliminary injunction covering California in a related case. This preliminary injunction was stayed pending the Supreme Court's disposition on petitions for certiorari from the Second and Seventh Circuits on similar injunctions. On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule and the petitions for certiorari were voluntarily dismissed by the government.</p>\r\n<p><u>Healthcare Providers and Nonprofits Sue Over the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2019, several healthcare providers and nonprofit organizations serving immigrant communities filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-17142/inadmissibility-on-public-charge- grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Final Rule</a> (the Rule) vacated due to violations of the APA and unconstitutional for violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs also sought to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Rule from being implemented and enforced. The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley but was reassigned to District Judge Haywood S Gilliam, Jr after the plaintiffs declined to proceed before a magistrate judge.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a revised, final public charge rule, which defines personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The Rule increases the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is &ldquo;inadmissible.&rdquo; The traditional conception of public charge has meant \"someone who is primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution.\" Under the Rule, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid (the plaintiffs have alleged that over one-half of U.S. citizens can be expected to use one of these programs at some point in their lifetime), or is deemed likely to receive them in the future, may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. According to a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/immigration-public-charge-injunction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a>, the new standards would directly affect about 1.2 million applicants annually, primarily immigrants from Africa and Latin America.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asserted four claims for relief against the defendants. First, the plaintiffs asserted that the Rule's definition of public charge was \"contrary to the plain and well- established meaning of that phrase, and to how it has been interpreted and applied since 1882.\" In support of this claim, the plaintiffs stated that Congress has repeatedly declined to change the longstanding definition of public charge. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious, as it departs from prior law and practice without adequate explanation of the reasons for the departure and consideration for the consequences of the change. Next, the plaintiffs asserted that in enacting the Rule, \"defendants acted with improper discriminatory intent and bias against non-white immigrants,\" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Lastly, the plaintiffs argued that the Rule was invalid because it was issued by the acting head of the USCIS and that his designation as acting head of USCIS violated the Constitution and federal law.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the implementation and enforcement of the Rule to prevent harm to themselves and the immigrant families they represent; \"The Rule has and will continue to divert Plaintiffs&rsquo; resources, both to address the harmful effects of the Rule and to educate immigrant families about those effects, preventing Plaintiffs from carrying out other aspects of their missions and ensuring that their patients, members, and clients do not forgo critical services to lead healthy, productive, and successful lives.\"</p>\r\n<p>The case was ordered related to <a href=\"../../../../case/17409/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</a>&nbsp;on August 30, 2019. Accordingly, the case was reassigned to the judge presiding over that related case, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton.</p>\r\n<p><u>Plaintiffs Seek A Nationwide Preliminary Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking a nationwide injunction enjoining the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule and an order postponing the effective date of the Rule pending judicial review. The plaintiffs argued that a preliminary injunction was appropriate because of their likely success on the merits and that absent an injunction, the Rule would cause plaintiffs to suffer irreparable harm \"by interfering with their missions, forcing them to divert resources from providing their core services to handling the effect of the Regulation, and depriving them of revenue.\" In their opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs have \"no basis for turning their abstract policy disagreement with the Executive Branch into a nationwide injunction.\" The defendants asserted that because the plaintiffs are \"municipalities rather than [noncitizens] governed by the Rule,\" they cannot meet jurisdictional requirements. Furthermore, the defendants contended that the Rule was not unlawful, as it \"reflects Congress&rsquo;s delegation of broad authority to the Executive Branch concerning the meaning of 'public charge'\" and was \"the product of a well-reasoned process that considered the plain text of the statute, legislative intent, statistical evidence, and the substance of hundreds of thousands of comments submitted by the public.\"</p>\r\n<p><u>The Court Grants a Geographically Limited Preliminary Injunctions</u></p>\r\n<p>Following a hearing on October 2, 2019, on October 11, 2019, Judge Hamilton issued an order denying the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, but granted preliminary injunctions in two related cases that would enjoin the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hamilton denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction in the current case, finding that the plaintiffs \"have not met their burden to demonstrate that there are serious questions concerning whether they are within the challenged statute&rsquo;s zone of interest, and certainly they have failed to demonstrate a likelihood that they are able to bring the APA actions underlying their present motion.\"</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hamilton concluded that a preliminary injunction was appropriate in the two related cases because the plaintiff states and counties were likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claims and would be irreparably harmed absent an injunction. However, Judge Hamilton did not grant the plaintiffs' request to enjoin the implementation of the Rule nationwide. Because the plaintiff states and counties did not establish \"the necessity of such relief,\" the scope of the injunction was limited to California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court Stay the Preliminary Injunctions</u></p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel issued an order in a related case, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City and County of San Francisco</em></a>, granting the government's emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. In the same order, the Ninth Circuit panel stayed a nationwide injunction that was issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of Washington v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Following the stay, on December 10, plaintiffs in this case filed notice that they would appeal the district court's October 11 decision denying their preliminary injunction. However, they withdrew their appeal shortly thereafter, and it was dismissed by the Ninth Circuit on February 4, 2020. 2020 WL 1170719.</p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court, in <em>State of New York</em>, issued a stay on all nationwide injunctions enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. 140 S.Ct. 599. Following this decision, the defendants indicated that the Rule would be implemented and enforced starting February 24, 2020.</p>\r\n<p><u>Defendants&rsquo; Motion to Dismiss</u></p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on April 22. In response, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 20. Defendants filed a new motion to dismissed the amended complaint on June 10.</p>\r\n<p>On August 7, Judge Hamilton granted the motion to dismiss in part. He deferred ruling on the arbitrariness and capriciousness of the new public charge rule pending a Ninth Circuit ruling on the preliminary injunction. 477 F. Supp. 3d 951. He held that plaintiffs did not lack standing, and so denied that part of the motion to dismiss. However, he granted dismissal of plaintiffs' invalid appointment claims, holding (1) that President Trump had the authority to appoint Acting Secretary of DHS McAleenan; and (2) the Public Charge rule wasn't promulgated under Acting Secretary of USCIS Cuccinelli&rsquo;s authority, making his appointment irrelevant to the complaint. Judge Hamilton also granted dismissal of, but with leave to amend, the equal protection claim. He held that the disparate impact was real but not dispositive; that none of the statements pointing to racial motivation were stated by anyone directly involved in promulgating the Rule; and that fast-tracking the Rule was not indicative of discriminatory intent.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs moved to reconsider the ruling on September 10. On November 25, Judge Hamilton granted the motion to reconsider and amended his August 7 order. 2020 WL 6940934. He reversed his dismissal of the claims against McAleenan's appointment, finding that factual investigation would be required to determine whether President Trump's tweet appointing McAleenan violated the order of succession outlined in Executive Order 13753.</p>\r\n<p><u>Preliminary Injunction is Affirmed in the Ninth Circuit then Stayed</u></p>\r\n<p>On December 2, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction from the related case of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City and County of San Francisco</em></a>. 981 F.3d 742. However, Judge Hamilton stayed the order on December 17, as did the Ninth Circuit on January 20, 2021, pending the Supreme Court's disposition on petitions for certiorari from the Second and Seventh Circuits.</p>\r\n<p><u>President Biden Issues Executive Order to Review the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule.</p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 2021, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the Rule had been implemented by DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan. Pointing out that this court and others throughout the country had determined Mr. McAleenan was serving invalidly, the plaintiffs argued he therefore lacked authority to implement the rule. They also argued that defendants' attempts to ratify the rule through Chad Wolf instead suffered from similar issues of lacking authority.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u></p>\r\n<p>Also on March 9, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>. The government voluntarily dismissed its appeal to the Seventh Circuit, lifting the stay of the Northern District of Illinois' November 2, 2020 decision vacating the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide from (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cook County v. Wolf</em></a>). That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition for <em>Cook County</em>, as well as similar petitions for the Ninth (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City and County of San Francisco v. USCIS</em></a>) and Second (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>New York v. DHS</em></a>) Circuits.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Ninth Circuit. They filed similar motions in the Seventh and Fourth Circuits, and a day later on March 11, they filed an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <em>Cook County</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 2021 the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 to deny the motion to intervene without an opinion. 2021 WL 1310846. However, Judge Vandyke wrote a lengthy dissent, arguing that the Biden administration was now colluding with the plaintiffs in the Public Charge lawsuits, making their interests at odds with the interests of the states who were seeking to intervene. He explained that this case was clearly still worth pursuing, since it had sufficient merit to warrant Supreme Court review and the government was circumventing APA requirements. Moreover, even though the Rule had been vacated, there was still a chance the Supreme Court may reverse that decision, making this lawsuit not yet moot.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 15, 2021, the Public Charge Final Rule has been abandoned and vacated nationwide. The parties are currently conferring on how this will impact litigation. The case is ongoing.</p>",

Trump, the \n4  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS” or the “Department”), the U.S. Citizenship and \n5  Immigration Service (“USCIS”), Chad Wolf, and Kenneth Cuccinelli (collectively \n6  “defendants”) and challenges promulgation of DHS’s final rule entitled “Inadmissibility on \n7  Public Charge Grounds,” published on August 14, 2019.  See Inadmissibility on Public \n8  Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“the Rule”).   \n9  The FAC alleges that former Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin \n10  McAleenan assumed the role in violation of the FVRA and DHS’s organic statute and \n11  therefore the unlawful appointment renders the Rule invalid.  See, e.g., FAC ¶ 138.

L.R. 7-9(b). \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 3 of 16\n \n1  B.  Analysis \n2  1.  Summary of Prior Order \n3  Plaintiffs’ third, fifth, and eighth claims allege that former Acting Secretary \n4  McAleenan assumed that role in violation of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (“HSA”) \n5  and the FVRA and therefore the Rule should be vacated pursuant to the APA, the FVRA, \n6  and the Declaratory Judgment Act.  FAC ¶¶ 203, 211–13, 230.  Defendants moved to \n7  dismiss these claims, arguing that former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen established a new \n8  order of succession pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) and under that revised order, \n9  McAleenan validly assumed the role of Acting Secretary.  Dkt. 166 at 18.  In response, \n10  plaintiffs argued that, when Secretary Nielsen resigned and McAleenan assumed the role \n11  of Acting Secretary, DHS’s order of succession—Delegation No. 00106—explicitly \n a  12  provided that in cases of resignation, Executive Order 13753 governed the orderly \ntruin\noro 13  succession of officials and Secretary Nielsen did not amend the order of succession in \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  cases of resignation.  Dkt. 167 at 18.  In turn, Executive Order 13753 provided a list of \niD tc 15  eighteen officers and McAleenan was not next in line according to this list.  Id.  In reply, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  defendants argued that in her April 2019 order, Secretary Nielsen exercised her authority \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to designate the order of succession pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) and that order \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  superseded any prior order of succession.  Dkt. 172 at 14.   \nN\n19  This court determined that, contrary to defendants’ argument, Secretary Nielsen’s \n20  April 9, 2019 order only amended the portion of Delegation No. 00106 that applied in \n21  cases when the Secretary is unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n22  emergency but did not apply in cases of death, resignation, or inability to perform the \n23  functions of the office.  Dkt. 177 at 25.  The court agreed with plaintiffs that Executive \n24  Order 13753 controlled the order of succession in cases of resignation and that \n25  McAleenan, as the Commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”), was seventh in \n26  line with two individuals ahead of him.  Id. at 26.  However, the court relied on \n27  subsection (b)(ii) of Executive Order 13753, which states that “[n]otwithstanding the \n28  provisions of this section, the President retains discretion, to the extent permitted by the \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 4 of 16\n \n1  Vacancies Act, to depart from this order in designating an acting Secretary.”  Id.  The \n2  court reasoned that because plaintiffs did not allege that McAleenan failed to meet one of \n3  the three options under the FVRA for the temporary appointment of officers, the \n4  President had discretion to appoint McAleenan as Acting Secretary.  Id.  Thus, plaintiffs \n5  failed to state a claim based on invalid appointment.  Id.  \n6  2.  New Evidence \n7  In their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs offer four pieces of evidence that \n8  occurred after this court’s prior order that purportedly establish that McAleenan was not \n9  appointed as acting secretary pursuant to the FVRA and the court should therefore \n10  modify its prior order.  First, on August 14, 2020, defendants DHS and Chad Wolf \n11  appeared before the district court for the District of Maryland and at a hearing on a \n a  12  motion for preliminary injunction, they repeatedly disavowed that the President appointed \ntruin\noro 13  McAleenan pursuant to the FVRA.  Mtn. at 4.  Second, also on August 14, 2020, the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) issued an opinion in which it determined that \niD tc 15  McAleenan was not validly appointed to his position as Acting Secretary.  Id. at 5–6.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Third, DHS submitted a letter to the GAO on August 17, 2020 demanding that GAO \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  withdraw its opinion and stated that GAO’s report did not concern an appointment under \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the FVRA.  Id. at 6.  Fourth, Acting Secretary Wolf has publicly disagreed with the GAO \nN\n19  report and represented that the authority to appoint successors was governed by the \n20  Homeland Security Act, not the FVRA.  Id. at 7.   \n21  The court discusses this new evidence in the broader context of the FVRA, the \n22  HSA, and the DHS’s order of succession.  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution requires \n23  that the President obtain “the Advice and Consent of the Senate” to appoint “Officers of \n24  the United States.”  U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 2. \n \n25  Given this provision, the responsibilities of an office requiring \nPresidential appointment and Senate confirmation—known as \n26  a “PAS” office—may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and \nthe  President  and  Senate  cannot  promptly  agree  on  a \n27  replacement.  Congress has long accounted for this reality by \nauthorizing the President to direct certain officials to temporarily \n28  carry out the duties of a vacant PAS office in an acting capacity, \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 5 of 16\n \nwithout Senate confirmation. \n1 \n2  N.L.R.B. v. SW Gen., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, 934 (2017). \n3  The FVRA is the current version of Congress’s authorization for the President to \n4  temporarily appoint acting officers.  5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.  Section 3345(a) outlines \n5  three categories of individuals who may become acting officers.  The first category, the \n6  first assistant to the office, “automatically fills the vacancy as an acting officer unless \n7  someone else is appointed.”  Hooks v. Kitsap Tenant Support Servs., Inc., 816 F.3d 550, \n8  557 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(1)). \n \n9  Signaled by the phrase “notwithstanding paragraph (1),” the \nstatute goes on to provide two ways the President may override \n10  the  automatic  operation  of  (a)(1).    First,  (a)(2)  permits  the \nPresident  to  designate  an  acting  officer  from  the  second \n11  category  of  eligible  candidates—prior  Senate-confirmed \nofficers.    Alternatively,  under  (a)(3),  the  President  may \n a  12  designate a within-agency officer or employee, provided that \ntruin the individual served in the Executive agency for not less than \noCrof 13  ninety days in the year preceding the date of the vacancy in a \n tila position with a rate of pay equal to or greater than the minimum \ncC\nirts fo 14  GS–15 rate. \niD tc 15  Id.  Each of the three categories in § 3345(a)1 is subject to the time limit in section 3346, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  which generally provides that “the person serving as an acting officer as described under \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  section 3345 may serve in the office—for no longer than 210 days beginning on the date \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the vacancy occurs.”  5 U.S.C. § 3346(a)(1). \nN\n19  Next, section 3347, the exclusivity provision, states that sections 3345 and 3346 \n20  are the exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting officer to perform the \n21  functions and duties of any office subject to Senate confirmation.  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a).  \n22  However, section 3347 carves out an exception to the exclusivity provision for “a \n23  statutory provision” that either designates an officer or employee to perform the functions \n24  and duties of an office or expressly authorizes the President, a court, or the head of an \n25 \n \n1 The three categories in § 3345(a) are also subject to the limitations of § 3345(b).  \n26 \n“Subsection (b)(1) . . . precludes someone from continuing to serve as an acting officer \nafter being nominated to the permanent position, unless he or she had been the first \n27 \nassistant for ninety days of the prior year.”  Hooks, 816 F.3d at 558 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 3345(b)(1)).  There is no allegation that the President nominated McAleenan for the \n28 \npermanent Secretary position and subsection (b)(1) does not appear to apply here. \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 6 of 16\n \n1  Executive department to designate such an officer or employee.  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1).  \n2  “Accordingly, when such an agency-specific statute exists, the FVRA is no longer the \n3  ‘exclusive’ means, but rather is ‘a means’ of selecting a person to serve in an acting \n4  capacity for a vacant PAS office.”  Casa de Md., Inc. v. Wolf, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2020 WL \n5  5500165, at *16 (D. Md. Sept. 11, 2020) (citing Hooks, 816 F.3d at 556; Guedes v. \n6  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, & Explosives, 356 F. Supp. 3d 109, 143 (D.D.C. \n7  2019) (“Agency-specific statutes like the AG Act were expected to operate alongside the \n8  FVRA, not to displace it”), aff’d on other grounds, 920 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per \n9  curiam)). \n10  On December 9, 2016, President Obama signed an executive order in which he \n11  exercised his authority under the FVRA, 5 U.S.C. § 3345, to designate in advance the \n a  12  order of succession to perform the functions and duties of the office of the Secretary of \ntruin\noro 13  Homeland Security.  See Executive Order 13753, 81 Fed. Reg. 90667, 90667 (Dec. 14, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  2016).  On December 15, 2016, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson signed and issued \niD tc 15  Revision 8 to DHS Delegation No. 00106 that implemented Executive Order 13753.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Revision 8 contained two relevant provisions.  Section II.A provided for an order of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  succession, stating “[i]n the case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  perform the functions of the Office, the orderly succession of officials is governed by \nN\n19  Executive Order 13753, amended on December 9, 2016.”  Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr. v. \n20  Wolf, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2020 WL 5798269, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2020).  Section II.B \n21  authorized delegation of authority in certain situations: “I hereby delegate to the officials \n22  occupying the identified positions in the order listed (Annex A), my authority to exercise \n23  the powers and perform the functions and duties of my office, to the extent not otherwise \n24  prohibited by law, in the event I am unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n25  emergency.”  Id.   \n26  At the time Secretary Johnson issued Revision 8 to Delegation No. 00106, the \n27  FVRA provided the exclusive means to appoint an acting secretary.  See Opp. at 4 n.2; \n28  see also 5 U.S.C. § 3347.  Under the FVRA, only the president had the authority to \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 7 of 16\n \n1  designate an order of succession.  See 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a)(2)–(3) (“[T]he President (and \n2  only the President) may direct a person . . . .”).  Thus, Executive Order 13753 codified the \n3  President’s designated order of succession and Delegation No. 00106 cross referenced \n4  that order.  Further, the HSA provided that the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security \n5  would be the Secretary’s first assistant for purposes of the FVRA and provided no \n6  authority to the Secretary to designate an order of succession.  See 6 U.S.C. \n7  § 113(a)(1)(A) (2012).   \n8  On December 23, 2016, Congress amended the HSA in two relevant ways.  See \n9  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Pub. L. No. 114-328, § 1903, \n10  130 Stat. 2000, 2672 (2016).  First, the HSA established that the Under Secretary for \n11  Management would “serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence, disability or \n a  12  vacancy in office, neither the Secretary nor the Deputy Secretary is available to exercise \ntruin\noro 13  the duties of the Office of Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1).  Second, the Secretary has \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the authority, notwithstanding the FVRA, “to designate such other officers of the \niD tc 15  Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  6 U.S.C. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  § 113(g)(2).  As both parties acknowledge, (FAC ¶ 148; Opp. at 4–5), Secretary Nielsen \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  could amend the order of succession; the question is whether she in fact did amend the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  order of succession. \nN\n19  a.  Whether Secretary Nielsen Amended the Order of Succession \n20  Similar to their motion to dismiss, defendants’ opposition to the motion for \n21  reconsideration asserts that, prior to her resignation in April 2019, Secretary Nielsen \n22  issued an order of succession pursuant to her section 113(g)(2) authority that effectively \n23  designated McAleenan as next in line to assume the role of acting secretary.  Opp. at 2.  \n24  Before addressing the parties’ arguments on this issue, the court will detail the substance \n25  of Secretary Nielsen’s order. \n26  On April 9, 2019, Secretary Nielsen signed a memorandum prepared by John M. \n27  Mitnick, the DHS General Counsel, that acknowledged the Secretary’s authority “set forth \n28  in section 113 of title 6, United States Code” and summarized that Secretary Nielsen \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 8 of 16\n \n1  “expressed [her] desire to designate certain officers of the Department of Homeland \n2  Security (DHS) in order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”  Dkt. 166-3 at 2.2  \n3  The memo stated “[b]y approving the attached document, you will designate your desired \n4  order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security in accordance with your \n5  authority pursuant to Section 113(g)(2), of title 6, United States Code.”  Id.  The \n6  attachment to the memorandum stated:  \n \n7  By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity, including the Homeland Security Act of 2002, 6 U.S.C. \n8  § 113(g)(2), I hereby designate the order of succession for the \nSecretary of Homeland Security as follows: Annex A of DHS \n9  Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for Named \nPositions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby amended by striking \n10  the text of such Annex in its entirety and inserting the following \nin lieu thereof:   \n11 \n a  12  Id. at 3.  The attachment then describes the replacement text for Annex A: “Annex A.  \ntruin\noro 13  Order for Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Security” and includes a list of eighteen positions.  Id.  \niD tc 15  On April 10, 2020, DHS updated Delegation No. 00106 to reflect Secretary \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Nielsen’s order.  This update, Revision 8.5, did not change the text of section II.A \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  (pertaining to order of succession) or section II.B (pertaining to delegation of authority).  \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Revision 8.5 did, however, include the updated Annex A that was attached to Secretary \nN\n19  Nielsen’s April 9th order.  See Dkt. 167-1 at 2, 6.  When Secretary Nielsen resigned, the \n20  office of the Deputy Secretary was vacant, and the Under Secretary of Management \n21  resigned the same day as Nielsen.  See Dkt. 183-3 at 8.  At the time, McAleenan was \n22  serving in the Senate-confirmed role of CBP Commissioner and assumed the role of DHS \n23  Acting Secretary.  According to Annex A of Revision 8.5 to Delegation No. 00106, the \n24  CBP Commissioner was third in line, but according to Executive Order 13753, the CBP \n25  Commissioner was seventh in line of succession.  The divergence between Annex A’s \n26 \n \n2 Pin citations to Secretary Nielsen’s order, (Dkt. 166-3), Revision 8.5 to Delegation No. \n27 \n00106, (Dkt. 167-1), the GAO Opinion, (Dkt. 183-3), and Acting Secretary Wolf’s memo, \n(Dkt. 186), refer to the electronically stamped ECF page numbers at the top of each \n28 \npage. \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 9 of 16\n \n1  order and the order established by Executive Order 13753 is the focus of the parties’ \n2  arguments here. \n3  Defendants urge the court to reconsider its prior determination that Secretary \n4  Nielsen’s order did not alter the order of succession.  Defendants’ argument relies on the \n5  distinction between the terms “order of succession” and “delegation of authority.”  \n6  Defendants explain that section 113(g)(2) empowers the Secretary to designate an order \n7  of succession, while section 112(b)(1) empowers the Secretary to delegate his or her \n8  authority to other officials, even when the Secretary continues to occupy his or her office.  \n9  Opp. at 3.  According to defendants, Secretary Nielsen’s April 9th order sets forth an \n10  order of succession because the document only refers to amending DHS’s “order of \n11  succession,” not a delegation of authority.  Id.  Defendants also rely on the fact that the \n a  12  order references section 113(g)(2), which empowers the Secretary to designate an order \ntruin\noro 13  of succession, in three separate locations demonstrating that the April 9th order intended \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to establish a new order of succession pursuant to section 113(g)(2).  Id. at 3–4.   \niD tc 15  Defendants also advance other arguments.  They assert that Annex A performed \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  two separate functions; it designated the order of succession and it amended the list of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  officials for delegation of authority.  Id. at 4.  Next, they contend that Secretary Nielsen \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  “designate[d] the order of succession” and the use of the term “designation”—rather than \nN\n19  the term “delegation”—confirms that the amended Annex A was a designation of the \n20  order of succession.  Id. at 5.  Finally, defendants argue that the court should defer to \n21  DHS’s interpretation of Secretary Nielsen’s order.  Id. at 6.   \n22  In reply, plaintiffs first contend that defendants’ opposition is essentially a motion \n23  for reconsideration filed by defendants without requesting the court’s permission to file \n24  such a motion in violation of Civil Local Rule 7-9(a).  Reply at 4–5.  With respect to the \n25  substance of defendants’ opposition, plaintiffs argue that the plain text of Secretary \n26  Nielsen’s order only changed Annex A but did not amend the portion of Delegation No. \n27  00106 providing for succession according to Executive Order 13753.  Id. at 7.  Plaintiffs \n28  characterize defendants’ argument as premised on disregarding the plain text of the \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 10 of 16\n \n1  order and relying instead on out-of-context prefatory language or surrounding \n2  circumstances to divine what Secretary Nielsen intended.  Id. at 8.  They also cite two \n3  district court opinions that have likewise determined that Secretary Nielsen did not alter \n4  the order of succession.  Id. at 9–10.  Plaintiffs also point out that section 113(g)(2) does \n5  not necessarily apply only in cases of succession due to vacancy and, when read with \n6  section 113(g)(1), also applies to circumstances where the Secretary is not available to \n7  exercise the duties of the office due to absence or disability.  Id. at 12.   \n8  The court rejects defendants’ arguments for several reasons.  First, the court \n9  agrees with plaintiffs that defendants’ opposition is a de facto motion for reconsideration \n10  for which defendants did not request the court’s permission to file.  Moreover, defendants \n11  are not relying on new evidence, arguing the court committed clear error, or that there \n a  12  was a change in law to support their arguments; rather, they take issue with the court’s \ntruin\noro 13  prior ruling, putting forward similar arguments as those previously advanced.  As a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  general rule, a motion for reconsideration “may not be used to raise arguments or present \niD tc 15  evidence for the first time when they could reasonably have been raised earlier in the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  litigation.”  Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2000) \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  (citing 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, 179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir. 1999)).  That rule \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  applies here as defendants’ arguments could have been raised in their motion to dismiss.  \nN\n19  Defendants’ failure to request leave to file a motion for reconsideration, combined with \n20  the fact that defendants have not presented a basis to grant such reconsideration, is \n21  sufficient grounds to reject their arguments.  Given the importance of the issues and the \n22  fact that the ultimate disposition of this motion does not prejudice plaintiffs, the court \n23  briefly addresses the substance of defendants’ arguments. \n24  Second, as discussed in the court’s prior order, the plain language of Nielsen’s \n25  order is clear and unambiguous.  As a general rule of interpretation, “[w]here the \n26  language is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does \n27  not arise, and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.”  Carson \n28  Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp., 270 F.3d 863, 878 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (quoting \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 11 of 16\n \n1  Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917)); see also Safe Air for Everyone v. \n2  U.S. EPA, 488 F.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2007) (applying plain meaning rule to \n3  regulations).3  Secretary Nielsen’s order amended Annex A by stating, “I hereby \n4  designate the order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security as follows: \n5  Annex A of . . . Delegation No. 00106, is hereby amended by striking the text of such \n6  Annex in its entirety and inserting the following in lieu thereof.”  Dkt. 166-3 at 3 (emphasis \n7  added).  The specific change made by the order was to strike the prior version Annex A \n8  in its entirety and replace it with an amended Annex A.  The order did not amend the \n9  circumstances that would trigger Annex A’s application; that is, it did not modify section \n10  II.A or II. B of Delegation No. 00106.  Revision 8.5 to Delegation No. 00106, released \n11  after Secretary Nielsen’s order, is persuasive contemporaneous evidence that the \n a  12  replacement of Annex A was the only such change effectuated by the order.   \ntruin\noro 13  In light of the plain meaning, defendants’ arguments concerning the surrounding \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  references to order of succession are unpersuasive.  As a general principle, “prefatory \niD tc 15  clauses or preambles cannot change the plain meaning of the operative clause.”  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Kingdomware Techs., Inc. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1969, 1978 (2016) (citing Yazoo & \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Miss. Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, 132 U.S. 174, 188 (1889)).  As the district court in Casa \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  de Maryland recognized, the memo prepared by the DHS general counsel constitutes \nN\n19  such a prefatory clause or preamble and the memo does not detract from the operative \n20  language that altered only Annex A.  See Casa de Md., 2020 WL 5500165, at *22.  \n21  Further, as noted in the prior order, the fact that on November 8, 2019, McAleenan \n22  purported to revise Delegation No. 00106 by amending Section II.A to explicitly reference \n23  Annex A in cases of resignation, instead of Executive Order 13753, confirms that \n24  Nielsen’s revision did not do so.  See Dkt. 177 at 25–26; see also Casa de Md., 2020 WL \n25 \n \n26 \n3 The court notes that neither Secretary Nielsen’s order nor Delegation No. 00106 are \nstatutes or regulations.  Yet, as defendants pointed out in their reply in support of the \n27 \nmotion to dismiss, it is appropriate to apply rules of statutory construction to \nadministrative orders delegating authority.  See Dkt. 172 at 14 & n.7 (citing Crowell v. IRS \n28 \n(In re Crowell), 258 B.R. 885, 889 (E.D. Tenn. 2001)). \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 12 of 16\n \n1  5500165, at *21 (“McAleenan next amended Delegation Order 00106 on November 8, \n2  2019.  But unlike Nielsen’s amendment, McAleenan actually changed the order of \n3  succession applicable in the event of vacancy . . . .”). \n4  Third, subsequent to this court’s prior order, three district courts have examined \n5  this precise question and have also concluded that Secretary Nielsen’s April 9th \n6  amendment only changed Annex A but did not amend the order of succession in cases of \n7  resignation.  See Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2020 WL 6695076, at *9 \n8  (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2020); Immigrant Legal Res. Ctr., 2020 WL 5798269, at *7–8; Casa \n9  de Md., 2020 WL 5500165, at *22–23.  On August 14, 2020, the GAO issued an opinion \n10  that examined whether Acting Secretary Wolf had validly assumed the title of Acting \n11  Secretary.  Dkt. 183-3 at 2.  As a necessary predicate to determining whether Wolf was \n a  12  validly appointed, the GAO examined whether McAleenan was validly appointed as \ntruin\noro 13  Acting Secretary following the resignation of then Secretary Nielsen.  Similar to this \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  court’s prior order, the GAO concluded that Secretary Nielsen’s April 9th order only \niD tc 15  amended Annex A but did not amend the order of succession established in Executive \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Order 13753.  Id. at 8.  These opinions are persuasive and support the court’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interpretation. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Fourth, the court need not defer to defendants’ interpretation of the April 9th order.  \nN\n19  While courts have sometimes “deferred to ‘official staff memoranda’ that were ‘published \n20  in the Federal Register[,]’ . . . . [that] interpretation must at least emanate from those \n21  actors, using those vehicles, understood to make authoritative policy in the relevant \n22  context.”  Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2416 (2019).  In this case, the court assumes \n23  the Secretary’s order and the memo attached to the order are authoritative.  Yet, \n24  defendants are asking the court to defer to their interpretation of the order offered in the \n25  context of this litigation, not the Department’s contemporaneous explanation.  See Dep’t \n26  of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1909 (2020) (“The \n27  functional reasons for requiring contemporaneous explanations apply with equal force \n28  regardless whether post hoc justifications are raised in court by those appearing on \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 13 of 16\n \n1  behalf of the agency or by agency officials themselves.” (citations omitted)).  In other \n2  words, DHS has not issued an interpretation of Secretary Nielsen’s order, rather the \n3  interpretation is a litigation position to which the court owes no deference.  See United \n4  States v. Trident Seafoods Corp., 60 F.3d 556, 559 (9th Cir. 1995) (“No deference is \n5  owed when an agency has not formulated an official interpretation of its regulation, but is \n6  merely advancing a litigation position.”). \n7  Therefore, the court reaffirms its prior findings that former Secretary Nielsen’s April \n8  9th order did not alter the Department’s order of succession in cases of resignation and \n9  that Executive Order 13753 continued to govern the order of succession at the time of \n10  Secretary Nielsen’s resignation. \n11  b.  Whether McAleenan’s Appointment Was Valid Under the FVRA \n a  12  Assuming Executive Order 13753 governed the order of succession, the court next \ntruin\noro 13  examines whether McAleenan validly assumed the role of Acting Secretary pursuant to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  that executive order and the FVRA.  In its prior order, the court determined that, despite \niD tc 15  the order of succession established in section (a) of Executive Order 13753, subsection \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  (b)(ii) reserved to the President the discretion to depart from subsection (a) as long as the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  FVRA permitted McAleenan’s appointment.  Dkt. 177 at 26.  Because plaintiffs did not \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  allege that McAleenan’s appointment was invalid under the FVRA, they failed to state a \nN\n19  claim.  Id.  Plaintiffs move for reconsideration of this finding.   \n20  Plaintiffs contend that, subsequent to this court’s finding, new evidence \n21  demonstrates that defendants have taken the position that the President did not appoint \n22  McAleenan as Acting Secretary pursuant to his FVRA authority.  Mtn. at 7.  According to \n23  plaintiffs, the court’s prior legal conclusion relied on a factual premise that defendant did \n24  not advance before the court and have now admitted was incorrect.  Id.  For their part, \n25  defendants state that plaintiffs are correct that the President did not appoint Secretary \n26  McAleenan under the FVRA.  Opp. at 2.  They offer no further argument on this point. \n27  As stated previously, President Obama issued Executive Order 13753 as an \n28  advance exercise of his FVRA authority.  See Executive Order 13753 (“By the authority \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 14 of 16\n \n1  vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of \n2  America, including the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 5 U.S.C. 3345 et \n3  seq., . . . .”).  Section (a) establishes the President’s designated order of succession and \n4  subsection (b)(ii) reserves to the President discretion to depart from section (a) so long \n5  as that departure meets the requirements of the FVRA.  The relevant inquiry here is \n6  therefore whether the President exercised that discretion under section (b)(ii) because \n7  there is no dispute that under the order of succession in section (a), there was one \n8  individual ahead of McAleenan at the time of Secretary Nielsen’s resignation.4 \n9  As described in plaintiffs’ new evidence and in defendants’ opposition to the \n10  motion for reconsideration, defendants have repeatedly represented that McAleenan was \n11  appointed pursuant to the HSA and not the FVRA.  See, e.g., Dkt. 183-2 at 40:5–9; Opp. \n a  12  at 2 (“Plaintiffs are correct that the President did not designate Mr. McAleenan as Acting \ntruin\noro 13  Secretary under the [FVRA] . . . .”).  Other opinions have arrived at a similar outcome, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  though no opinion appears to have considered the implications of subsection (b)(ii).  For \niD tc 15  example, the district court in Casa de Maryland determined that the order of succession \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  in section (a) of Executive Order 13753 dictated the order of succession.  See Casa de \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Md., 2020 WL 5500165, at *18 (“McAleenan’s leapfrogging over Director Krebs therefore \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  violated the agency’s own order of succession.  From this record, the Court cannot help \nN\n19  but conclude that McAleenan assumed the role of Acting Secretary without lawful \n20  authority.”).  The GAO Report also applies section (a) without any discussion of the \n21  President’s reserved discretion in subsection (b)(ii).  See Dkt. 183-3 at 9 (“The first \n22  previously confirmed official in the order of succession in E.O. 13753 was the Director of \n23  CISA.  However, instead of following the order of succession in E.O. 13753, DHS applied \n24  the one in Annex A.” (footnote omitted)). \n25 \n \n26 \n4 As the GAO Opinion states, Christopher Krebs was serving in the Senate-confirmed \nrole of Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which was \n27 \npreviously known as the Under Secretary for Protection and Programs.  Dkt. 183-3 at 7 \nn.8, 9 n.11.  The Under Secretary for Protection and Programs was fourth in the order of \n28 \nsuccession in Executive Order 13753. \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 15 of 16\n \n1  That said, it is not clear that the President failed to designate McAleenan as Acting \n2  Secretary.  In the FAC, plaintiffs allege that on April 7, 2019, President Trump tweeted \n3  that McAleenan would assume the role of Acting Secretary.  FAC ¶ 145.  Indeed, the \n4  President sent two tweets on April 7, 2019, stating:  \n \n5  Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving \nher position, and I would like to thank her for her service. . . . I \n6  am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current \nU.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  Commissioner,  will \n7  become Acting Secretary for @DHS.gov.  I have confidence \nthat Kevin will do a great job! \n8 \n9  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter (Apr. 7, 2019), \n10  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1115011884154064896?s=20, \n11  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1115011885303312386?s=20.5   \n a  12  Of course, these tweets lack the formality of an executive order, but in other \ntruin\noro 13  instances, courts have noted that the President’s tweets are akin to official statements \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and government speech.  See Knight First Amendment Inst. at Columbia Univ. v. Trump, \niD tc 15  928 F.3d 226, 231 (2d Cir. 2019) (“The public presentation of the Account and the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  webpage associated with it bear all the trappings of an official, state–run account. . . . \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  The President and multiple members of his administration have described his use of the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Account as official.”); see also id. at 239 (“Everyone concedes that the President’s initial \nN\n19  tweets (meaning those that he produces himself) are government speech.”). \n20  At the very least then, there appears to be a factual conflict whether the \n21  President’s tweets constituted a designation under section 3345(a)(2) or whether, as both \n22  parties maintain, the President did not appoint Acting Secretary McAleenan under the \n23  FVRA.  That factual conflict cannot be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and therefore \n24  necessitates reconsideration of the court’s prior order granting defendants’ motion to \n25  dismiss the third, fifth, and eighth claims.  Further, if plaintiffs are correct that the \n26 \n \n5 The Ninth Circuit has recognized that the President’s tweets are judicially noticeable \n27 \npursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201 and, additionally, plaintiffs referred to the \ntweets in their FAC.  See Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 773 n.14 (9th Cir.), vacated \n28 \nand remanded on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 377 (2017). \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 188   Filed 11/25/20   Page 16 of 16\n \n1  President did not designate McAleenan as Acting Secretary, then they state a claim that \n2  McAleenan’s appointment violated the FVRA, which again requires reconsideration of the \n3  court’s prior order.  Accordingly, the court will grant plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration. \n4  One final matter bears mention.  On October 8, 2020, defendants filed a notice in \n5  which they include a memorandum signed by Acting Secretary Wolf on October 7, 2020.  \n6  Dkt. 186.  Defendants then filed a second notice on November 23, 2020 that includes a \n7  second memorandum signed by Acting Secretary Wolf on November 16, 2020.  Dkt. 187.  \n8  Both versions of the memo purport to affirm and ratify certain actions taken by former \n9  Acting Secretary McAleenan, including the Rule.  The court does not consider the notices \n10  or attached memoranda for two reasons.  First, Civil Local Rule 7-3(d) prohibits the filing \n11  of “additional memoranda, papers or letters” once the reply brief is filed unless a party \n a  12  receives the court’s approval.  No such approval was sought here, and defendants’ filings \ntruin\noro 13  violate the Civil Local Rules.  Second, whether Acting Secretary Wolf validly ratified the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Rule has no bearing on the narrow issue raised by plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, \niD tc 15  that is, whether their new evidence warrants reconsideration of the court’s prior order \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  granting defendants’ motion to dismiss. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  CONCLUSION \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration is GRANTED and \nN\n19  defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third, fifth, and eighth claims pertaining to \n20  McAleenan’s appointment as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security is now DENIED.  \n21  The court’s prior order on the motion to dismiss will be amended accordingly. \n22    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n23  Dated: November 25, 2020 \n24  /s/ Phyllis J.

President Donald J. Trump is determined to prevent immigrants of color from \n3 coming to and remaining in the United States.  As part of this broad effort, the administration has \n4 promulgated a “public charge” regulation, which erects hurdles to family-based immigration that \n5 Congress has not authorized.  This unlawful regulation harms and specifically targets immigrants \n6 of color. \n7 2.  Defendants’ “public charge” regulation (“Regulation”) violates the Administrative \n8 Procedure Act (“APA”) and the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n9 Constitution.  The Regulation is squarely at odds with the language of the statute, its century-long \n10 interpretation, and Congress’ purpose in enacting the statute.  It is arbitrary and capricious and \n11 motivated by animus toward non-white immigrants.  It also was promulgated and developed by \n12 administration officials appointed in contravention of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act \n13 (“FVRA”) and the statute and regulations prescribing the order of succession for appointing an \n14 acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  Those officials were therefore without authority to \n15 promulgate and otherwise contribute to the Regulation.  \n16 3.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) bars certain individuals from \n17 obtaining a green card or from obtaining certain visas if they are “likely at any time to become a \n18 public charge.”  Since Congress first introduced the term in the immigration context in 1882, \n19 “public charge” has been understood to mean only a person who is primarily dependent on the \n20 government to avoid destitution (i.e., someone who is effectively a “charge” or ward of the state).  \n21 From its first use in the immigration laws, “public charge” was included alongside other grounds \n22 of inadmissibility that necessitate reliance on the government to avoid destitution, such as \n23 “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “insane persons.”  Congress has never altered the long-\n24 standing meaning of “public charge” as articulated by the courts and administrative agencies.  \n25 “Public charge” has never been understood to reach immigrants who, like a near-majority of \n26 citizens born in the United States, may at some point in their lives receive supplemental health \n27 care, nutrition, or housing assistance to improve their lives and those of their families.   \n28\n  -1-  Case No. 19-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 4 of 58\n \n1 4.  Acting unilaterally and without congressional approval, Defendants now deviate \n2 from the established meaning of the term public charge, dramatically altering it to effect a sea-\n3 change in immigration law.  The Regulation treats as a public charge any immigrants found more \n4 likely than not, at any time over their lifetime, to receive any amount of benefits from a wide range \n5 of supplemental public benefits programs.  \n6 5.  The targeted benefits include health care coverage (non-emergency Medicaid for \n7 non-pregnant adults), housing assistance (Section 8 and public housing), and food assistance \n8 (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or “SNAP”).  Indeed, nearly one in four U.S.-born \n9 citizens (over 60 million individuals) participate in one or more of the programs listed in the \n10 Regulation in any given year.  Moreover, about one half of U.S.-born citizens can be expected to \n11 use one of the programs listed in the Regulation at some point in their lifetime.  Those who rely on \n12 these programs include low- and moderate-income working families who depend primarily on \n13 income from employment, but who receive supplemental benefits that improve their quality of life \n14 and their communities.  These non-cash programs, by design, help millions of citizens and \n15 immigrants alike, enabling them to remain healthy and productive in communities where rents and \n16 other costs of living are high.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2011 (purpose of SNAP is “raising levels of \n17 nutrition among low-income households” by spreading the “Nation’s agricultural abundance \n18 and . . . economy”); 42 U.S.C. § 1437(f) (purpose of Section 8 vouchers is to help “low-income \n19 families obtain[] a decent place to live” and to promote “economically mixed housing”). \n20 6.  In addition, the Regulation fundamentally distorts the totality-of-the-circumstances \n21 test that the public charge statute prescribes.  The Regulation sets forth a series of arbitrary factors \n22 that are not reasonably related to whether a person is likely to become a public charge—including \n23 English proficiency and credit scores.  Most of the factors enumerated in the Regulation are \n24 negatively weighted, significantly and arbitrarily tipping the scale in favor of finding an applicant \n25 to be a public charge.  \n26 7.  The Regulation also introduces a public charge determination against an entirely \n27 new group—nonimmigrants seeking a change of status or an extension of their stay—making \n28 those nonimmigrants who have received certain designated benefits generally ineligible for a \n  -2-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 5 of 58\n \n1 change of status or extension, despite the agency’s acknowledgement that the public charge statute \n2 does not apply to this group. \n3 8.  This Regulation fits squarely within a consistent pattern of racial discrimination in \n4 this Administration’s immigration policies—including separating thousands of Central American \n5 children from their mothers and fathers; refusing refuge to non-white immigrants seeking asylum; \n6 attempting to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; terminating Temporary \n7 Protected Status for nationals of several predominantly non-white countries; excluding individuals \n8 from majority Muslim countries and expanding that ban to prevent substantial immigration from \n9 multiple African nations; proposing a rule that would bar families from housing programs if any \n10 family member is without eligible immigration status; and proposing a Regulation that would \n11 apply the same overbroad definition of “public-charge” to deportability.  \n12 9.  Defendants fail to provide adequate reasons for their dramatic changes to the public \n13 charge policy, and they fail to explain how those changes are consistent with the statutory \n14 language and the well-settled interpretation of that language.  Defendants have acted in total \n15 disregard of the Regulation’s effects on families, communities, and the nation.  And the agency \n16 has failed to respond adequately to the myriad concerns expressed in the over 260,000 comments \n17 submitted.   \n18 10.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to enjoin the implementation of Defendants’ new public \n19 charge Regulation in order to prevent irreparable harm to themselves and their communities.  \n20 Plaintiffs represent health care providers and other nonprofit organizations that seek to protect \n21 access to health care, nutrition, housing, and other public benefits for immigrants, including \n22 immigrants of color, regardless of their immigration status or financial means.  The Regulation has \n23 and will continue to divert Plaintiffs’ resources, both to address the harmful effects of the \n24 Regulation and to educate immigrant families about those effects, preventing Plaintiffs from \n25 carrying out other aspects of their missions and ensuring that their patients, members, and clients \n26 do not forgo critical services to lead healthy, productive, and successful lives.  Plaintiffs also \n27 include legal service providers who assist clients that receive one or more of the public benefits \n28 included in the Regulation, who meet several of the Regulation’s totality of the circumstance \n  -3-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 6 of 58\n \n1 factors, and who will be subject to the Regulation when they seek to adjust to LPR status or \n2 maintain or change their non-immigrant status.  The Regulation also has and will continue to \n3 affect Plaintiffs’ operations, such as by reducing patient and client caseloads as individuals cease \n4 receiving benefits due to the Regulation or become ineligible for immigration relief.  Plaintiffs \n5 rely on caseloads for funding and goodwill, and their inability to serve their communities \n6 frustrates their organizational missions.    \n7 11.  The Regulation is impermissibly vague and complex, inviting arbitrary and \n8 discriminatory enforcement by immigration officials.  As a result, the regulation will cause \n9 immigrant families, including those with U.S. citizen members, to disenroll from programs or to \n10 forgo benefits for which they are eligible.  Many of these immigrant families will not in fact be \n11 subject to the public charge inquiry but will nonetheless disenroll due to fear or lack of \n12 understanding of how the Regulation operates.  The impacts of this chilling effect are far-reaching.  \n13 The Regulation not only will jeopardize the health of the affected immigrants, their children, and \n14 other family members, but will also endanger public health by, among other things, increasing the \n15 likelihood of untreated communicable disease, depriving essential community health providers of \n16 Medicaid revenue, and creating food and housing instability.  The Regulation will produce \n17 negative health and economic outcomes nationwide over generations.    \n18 12.  Indeed, the Regulation is already having a detrimental effect on public health since \n19 it took effect on February 24, 2020.  The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”), which \n20 has become a global pandemic, has afflicted over 1.5 million people in the United States, causing \n21 a nationwide public health crisis.  The President has declared a national emergency and all 50 \n22 states have made emergency declarations in order to take extraordinary measures to protect the \n23 health and well-being of their residents.  The Regulation, however, is deterring immigrants from \n24 obtaining the health care—including testing and treatment—necessary to protect public health \n25 along with the public benefits that will help them survive the economic crisis that COVID-19 has \n26 caused.  \n27 13.  Immigrants make up a substantial portion of essential workers on the frontlines of \n28 the national, state, and local response to the crisis.  These workers are more likely to be exposed to \n  -4-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 7 of 58\n \n1 the virus and—without adequate testing and treatment—to suffer worse health outcomes if \n2 infected.  Infected workers wary of obtaining testing and treatment for symptoms of COVID-19 \n3 for fear that they will be penalized by the Regulation when adjusting status are also more likely to \n4 inadvertently spread the virus to others.  The Regulation thus threatens to worsen this \n5 unprecedented public health and economic crisis. \n6 14.  Plaintiffs request that this Court hold unlawful and set aside the Regulation under \n7 the Administrative Procedure Act, the Equal Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the \n8 U.S. Constitution, the FVRA, and DHS’s organic statute, and that it enter an injunction barring \n9 Defendants from implementing the Regulation.  \n10 PARTIES \n11 I.  Plaintiffs \n12 15.  Plaintiff LA CLÍNICA DE LA RAZA (“LA CLÍNICA”) is a Federally Qualified \n13 Health Center whose mission is to improve the quality of life of the diverse communities it serves \n14 by providing culturally appropriate, high-quality, and accessible health care for all.  LA CLÍNICA \n15 serves more than 86,000 patients annually in the San Francisco Bay Area and is one of the largest \n16 community health centers in California, with a total of 35 clinical service and \n17 support/administrative sites across three Bay Area counties.  \n18 16.  LA CLÍNICA serves patients who may seek to extend or adjust their immigration \n19 status, and whose immigration applications are likely to be subject to Defendants’ Regulation.  \n20 Many LA CLÍNICA patients receive Medicaid and other public benefits.  A significant number of \n21 LA CLÍNICA’s patients are low-income, have limited English proficiency, and/or have limited \n22 skills and education.  Many LA CLÍNICA patients also reside in large households.  LA \n23 CLÍNICA’s patients are predominantly people of color.   \n24 17.  Defendants’ new Regulation will frustrate LA CLÍNICA’s ability to provide \n25 accessible health care to the thousands of patients it treats each year.  Because of the Regulation’s \n26 chilling effect, many of LA CLÍNICA’s patients—and their families—are likely to avoid using \n27 public benefits, including seeking health care services.  Many of LA CLÍNICA’s patients will \n28 either disenroll themselves and/or their family members from Medicaid based on the fear that \n  -5-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 8 of 58\n \n1 using these benefits will hinder their ability to adjust status in the future.  Other LA CLÍNICA \n2 patients will cancel or refrain from scheduling medical appointments for fear that using health care \n3 services could affect their ability to adjust status.  This will harm immigrant patients and their \n4 communities, whose health and well-being form a key part of LA CLÍNICA’s mission.  It will \n5 also severely harm LA CLÍNICA by significantly reducing LA CLÍNICA’s funding stream that is \n6 linked to caseload while imposing substantial unbudgeted costs. \n7 18.  Plaintiff CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION (“CPCA”) brings this \n8 action on behalf of its members, including member Asian Health Services, described below.  \n9 Formed in 1994, CPCA has become the statewide leader and a recognized voice in representing \n10 the interests of California community health centers and their patients.  CPCA represents Regional \n11 Clinic Associations and 1,370 nonprofit community health centers (“CHCs”) that provide \n12 comprehensive primary and preventive health services to low-income and uninsured patients in \n13 California.  CPCA’s membership consists of 157 CHC entities that work through more than 983 \n14 service delivery sites.  CPCA’s members include community and free health centers, some \n15 federally funded and federally designated health centers, rural and urban clinics, large and small \n16 clinic corporations, and clinics dedicated to special needs and special populations. \n17 19.  CPCA’s members serve diverse populations and ensure that everyone has access to \n18 health care regardless of their ability to pay, their immigration status, or their individual \n19 circumstances.  CPCA’s CHC members serve over 7.2 million California residents every year.  \n20 Approximately 70% of the CHCs’ patients are Latino, Asian Pacific Islander, or Black.  CHCs \n21 serve patients of various immigrant statuses, including immigrants who will be subject to the \n22 public charge admission test when they seek to extend or change their nonimmigrant visas or \n23 apply for lawful permanent residence. \n24 20.  Sixty-one percent of the patients served by CPCA’s members are enrolled in Medi-\n25 Cal, the Medicaid program in California.  This means that these CHCs serve more than 4 million \n26 Medi-Cal enrollees, providing care to 1 in 3 Medi-Cal beneficiaries.  \n27 21.  CPCA has brought this suit because its purpose is to promote the interests of its \n28 members and its members will face significant financial harm as a result of the Regulation.  CPCA \n  -6-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 9 of 58\n \n1 expects CHCs’ patients will disenroll from public benefits, including Medi-Cal, because of the \n2 changes to the public charge test.  Specifically, CPCA predicts that as many as 101,000 to 305,000 \n3 of its members’ patients will disenroll from Medi-Cal as a result of the Regulation, causing the \n4 CHCs to lose $56 to $170 million in Medi-Cal reimbursements.  This will lead to an increase in \n5 uninsured patients.  CPCA anticipates that a number of these patients will continue seeking \n6 services at CHCs, forcing the CHCs to incur increased costs serving uninsured patients while \n7 experiencing a dramatic drop in revenue.  \n8 22.  One of CPCA’s members, Asian Health Services (“AHS”), is a nonprofit \n9 community health center headquartered in Oakland, California.  AHS provides health services at \n10 more than a dozen locations in Oakland and San Leandro, California and has 28,000 active \n11 patients of all ages.  AHS is a member in good standing of CPCA and has been a member since \n12 1994, when CPCA was formed.  \n13 23.  Founded in 1974, AHS’s mission is to serve and advocate for the medically \n14 underserved, including the immigrant and refugee Asian community, and to ensure equal access to \n15 health care for all, regardless of income, insurance status, immigration status, language, or culture.  \n16 As a federally qualified health center, AHS offers services to uninsured patients on a sliding fee \n17 scale.  Individuals with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level receive most services at \n18 no cost.  Approximately 93% of AHS patients are Asian; 2% are Latino; and 2% are Black.  In \n19 addition, approximately 58% of AHS patients are not yet United States citizens.  For 73% of \n20 patients, English is not their primary language.  Roughly two-thirds of AHS patients are enrolled \n21 in Medi-Cal, which is the Medicaid program in California.  \n22 24.  The Regulation will cause irreparable harm to many AHS patients and to AHS.  \n23 The Regulation will have a substantial chilling effect on AHS patients’ access to health care \n24 and/or use of their health coverage.  Some patients will stop receiving services altogether based on \n25 fears about the effect on their or their children’s immigration status.  Other AHS patients will \n26 continue to receive services from AHS, but will decline to enroll in or will disenroll from Medi-\n27 Cal due to the Regulation. \n28\n  -7-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 10 of 58\n \n1 25.  As a result of the Regulation, AHS will incur significant financial loss.  Medi-Cal \n2 reimbursements account for 52% of AHS’s annual budget.  AHS estimates that as its patients \n3 disenroll from or decline to enroll in Medi-Cal, it will lose as much as $5.2 million in Medi-Cal \n4 reimbursements every year.  AHS will have no way to recoup the cost of the services provided to \n5 those patients who disenroll but continue to receive services.  In addition to losing Medi-Cal \n6 funding, AHS will have to divert considerable resources to responding to the Regulation.  For \n7 example, AHS expects staff to spend time responding to individual patients’ questions and \n8 concerns about enrolling in or remaining enrolled in Medi-Cal and/or CalFresh given the \n9 Regulation.  These efforts will leave staff members with less time to help patients enroll in health \n10 coverage and SNAP, schedule appointments, and provide case management, referrals and care \n11 coordination.   \n12 26.  Plaintiff Maternal and Child Health Access (“MCHA”) works to ensure access to \n13 quality and comprehensive health care for all, with a focus on perinatal care and child health.  \n14 MCHA works with low-income immigrant families who access services through California’s \n15 SNAP program, California’s Medicaid program, and Section 8 housing.  Since the 1990s, \n16 MCHA’s purpose has been to support women and their families so they can be healthy and \n17 financially independent.  MCHA offers enrollment assistance programs to help people of all \n18 genders and ages secure and navigate SNAP and health-care coverage, training and education for \n19 organizations and individuals about eligibility for benefit programs for low-income and immigrant \n20 families, plus home visits, weekly classes, and mental health supports to help families succeed.   \n21 27.  The Regulation is frustrating MCHA’s mission by reducing access to nutrition, \n22 medical care, and adequate housing.  Immigrant families who MCHA serves are already \n23 disenrolling from public benefit programs, such as SNAP and Medicaid, based on fears that using \n24 those programs will affect their future immigration relief options.  Women have refrained and will \n25 continue to refrain from seeking health services, food, and other programs for themselves and their \n26 children, based on fears that using those benefits will prevent them from adjusting status.  As the \n27 Regulation is implemented, MCHA expects even more women to refrain from seeking Medicaid \n28 and other necessary health services, food, and other programs for themselves and their children, \n  -8-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 11 of 58\n \n1 based on fears that using those benefits will prevent them from adjusting status.  To support their \n2 babies, pregnant women need, on average, an additional 300 calories per day.  Yet MCHA already \n3 sees women pulling themselves out of nutrition support programs based on fear of public charge \n4 and anticipates even more SNAP disenrollments.  Losing access to critical health and nutrition \n5 services during pregnancy and early childhood could negatively affect MCHA’s clients for years.   \n6 28.  Their clients’ disenrollment from health, housing, and nutrition programs will make \n7 it difficult for MCHA to continue its operations.  MCHA will be forced to shift its capacity and \n8 divert its resources to respond to the Regulation instead of assisting clients with accessing public \n9 benefits or other resources to which they are entitled.  MCHA will need to identify alternative \n10 forms of assistance for those who disenroll from benefit programs, develop and implement \n11 additional measures so that mothers and families feel comfortable continuing to use MCHA’s \n12 home-visitation program, and engage in substantial community education to try to combat the \n13 Regulation’s chilling effect.  In addition, MCHA will be forced to address client situations that \n14 have worsened over time, such as prolonged malnutrition and delayed access to medical care.  \n15 These heightened client problems require additional staff time.  To respond to the Regulation, \n16 MCHA also needs to allocate staff members who can follow up with individuals who raise \n17 concerns about the Regulation.   \n18 29.  Plaintiff Farmworker Justice (“FJ”) is a national non-profit organization \n19 representing farmworkers and their families across the country who perform agricultural work in \n20 the United States.  FJ’s mission is to empower migrant and seasonal farmworkers to improve their \n21 living and working conditions, health, occupational safety, and access to justice.  It also provides \n22 policy analysis and advocacy, legal advocacy, training, and technical assistance to farmworkers, \n23 attorneys, migrant health centers, and immigrant advocacy groups across the United States, \n24 including in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Florida, New York, \n25 Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, and California.  FJ also hosts remote assistance, such as webinars \n26 and conferences, reaching additional locations, such as Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Puerto Rico, North \n27 Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Oregon, District of Columbia, Montana, Minnesota, \n28 Nebraska, Oklahoma, Virgin Islands, Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.  FJ \n  -9-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 12 of 58\n \n1 represents approximately 2.5 million farmworkers who work in the United States, as well as their \n2 spouses and children who, combined, represent approximately 4.5 million individuals in the \n3 United States.  A large and growing number of farmworkers have H-2A non-immigrant visas, \n4 which are for temporary agricultural workers. \n5 30.  The Regulation will disadvantage many farmworkers who seek to adjust to lawful \n6 permanent resident (LPR) status or to obtain or extend their non-immigrant H-2A status.  For \n7 example, the Regulation penalizes individuals with low incomes, and farm laborers’ wages are \n8 among the lowest in the nation.  FJ also represents immigrant farmworker families who receive \n9 Medicaid and SNAP, and who feel compelled by the Regulation to forgo those benefits in order to \n10 remain eligible to adjust their status.  Farmworkers are disenrolling eligible U.S. citizen children \n11 from Medicaid due to fears that their children’s health care coverage will affect their ability to \n12 seek immigration relief.  They also fear that this may lead eventually to the forced separation of \n13 their family and are not seeking health coverage or services at health centers for the same reasons. \n14 31.  The Regulation has forced FJ to divert substantial resources in order to develop and \n15 disseminate information about the Regulation that addresses the farmworker communities’ needs.  \n16 Beginning in March 2020, FJ has been addressing concerns that farmworkers have about the \n17 implications of the public charge Regulation when seeking to take action to prevent or treat \n18 COVID-19.  Spending considerable resources to address the Regulation has reduced the \n19 organization’s ability to engage extensively in other issues that affect farmworker families and \n20 advance FJ’s mission.  \n21 32.  Plaintiff COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS–CALIFORNIA \n22 (“CAIR-CA”) is dedicated to enhancing the understanding of Islam, protecting civil rights, \n23 promoting justice, and empowering American Muslims.  CAIR-CA was established in 1994 and \n24 has four offices throughout the state.  CAIR-CA serves Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South \n25 Asian (“AMEMSA”) communities.  Among other activities, CAIR-CA provides direct \n26 immigration assistance, including by helping AMEMSA communities with adjustment of status \n27 applications. \n28\n  -10-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 13 of 58\n \n1 33.  CAIR-CA has clients who are seeking or will seek to adjust their status in the \n2 future.  CAIR-CA also has clients who use public benefits, including Medicaid, public housing, \n3 and SNAP.  CAIR-CA’s clients have incomes at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level \n4 (“FPL”).  The Regulation is frustrating CAIR-CA’s mission to protect civil rights, promote justice, \n5 and empower American Muslims.  CAIR-CA will need to divert its resources in an attempt to \n6 reduce the harm stemming from Defendants’ Regulation, forcing CAIR-CA staff members to \n7 reduce their capacity in other areas that further CAIR-CA’s mission.  Moreover, the Regulation is \n8 causing many of the immigrant families that CAIR-CA serves to refrain from seeking \n9 supplemental benefits or to disenroll from those programs, cutting off important services and \n10 destabilizing their families and their communities.  It also will decrease the number of \n11 immigration cases CAIR-CA files, as clients will take longer to process due to the Regulation’s \n12 complexity and may not qualify for relief or decide not to seek relief due to concerns over the \n13 Regulation.  This in turn will decrease CAIR-CA’s funding linked to case filings and may impact \n14 its good will if it is not able to serve its community as effectively.    \n15 34.  Plaintiff AFRICAN COMMUNITIES TOGETHER (“ACT”) is a national \n16 membership organization of African immigrant members fighting for civil rights, opportunity, and \n17 a better life for African immigrant families residing in the United States.  ACT serves immigrant \n18 families who are originally from Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Ethiopia, and other African nations.  It is \n19 a resource for African immigrants seeking legal assistance with immigration relief, including by \n20 providing assistance with adjustment of status applications.  ACT has approximately 3,000 \n21 members and serves clients from across the nation; in 2019 alone, it provided services to clients \n22 from Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, \n23 Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \n24 Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, \n25 Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia.  ACT maintains \n26 offices in New York, Arlington, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, where it serves in-person \n27 clients from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and the \n28 District of Columbia.  It also organizes a national network of African immigrant-serving \n  -11-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 14 of 58\n \n1 organizations, including national committees with members in 18 states (California, Illinois, Iowa, \n2 Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North \n3 Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Virginia) and other \n4 organizations with members and clients in 23 states (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, \n5 the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, \n6 New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, \n7 Texas, Virginia, and Washington).  As a national organization, ACT is open to receiving inquiries \n8 and providing assistance to residents and organizations in all states. \n9 35.  Defendants’ Regulation is frustrating ACT’s mission by directly restricting the \n10 number of African immigrants who will be able to adjust to LPR status or maintain or change their \n11 non-immigrant immigration status due to the public charge test, thus eliminating essential \n12 pathways for this population to obtain LPR status.  This is because ACT’s clients who will seek to \n13 adjust status include individuals who are low-income and who possess other characteristics \n14 considered to be negative factors under the Regulation.  ACT also has clients who receive \n15 Medicaid, SNAP, and other public benefits.  Moreover, ACT will be forced to divert its resources \n16 to combat the chilling effects and discriminatory message of the Regulation, forcing the \n17 organization to spend less time on its other areas of work and to reduce the overall number of \n18 cases the organization can take on.  The Regulation is discouraging ACT’s clients from accessing \n19 social services for fear that receipt of any public benefit will affect any future attempt to adjust, \n20 maintain or change their immigration status, causing harm to individuals and families who are \n21 eligible for those benefits. \n22 36.  Plaintiff LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATEO COUNTY (“LEGAL AID”) \n23 has been the primary legal service provider for low-income and vulnerable residents in San Mateo \n24 County for over sixty years.  LEGAL AID engages in community education, legal representation, \n25 systemic advocacy, and collaboration with community partners to help vulnerable community \n26 members secure safe, affordable housing, access health care, achieve economic security, and \n27 obtain immigration benefits for which they are eligible.  LEGAL AID has devoted significant \n28 resources to educating San Mateo County’s immigrant residents about the various public programs \n  -12-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 15 of 58\n \n1 for which they are eligible, including Medicaid and SNAP, as well as about the public charge \n2 inadmissibility test. \n3 37.  Some of LEGAL AID’s clients will be subject to the Regulation when they seek to \n4 adjust their status or extend or change their non-immigrant visas.  Many of LEGAL AID’s clients \n5 are likely to disenroll from, or fear enrolling in, these important programs.  Some clients may be \n6 deemed public charges under the Regulation because they either use or will become eligible for \n7 public benefits, including Medicaid, SNAP, and housing benefits and have other characteristics \n8 that will weigh against them, including low household incomes, limited-English proficiency, and \n9 large household sizes.  Access to these programs enables LEGAL AID clients to thrive.    \n10 38.  The Regulation frustrates LEGAL AID’s mission to fight social injustice by \n11 helping San Mateo County residents obtain services through legal advocacy, and to help low-\n12 income individuals achieve self-sufficiency.  When the Regulation deters applicants from \n13 accessing LEGAL AID’s services, the resulting unmet grant goals mean LEGAL AID risks losing \n14 funding.  LEGAL AID also has had to divert its resources to help San Mateo County’s immigrant \n15 residents and their families who are either directly subject to the Regulation or harmed because of \n16 the Regulation’s chilling effect.  These diversions have increased costs and limited LEGAL AID’s \n17 capacity to take additional cases and address other important areas of operations. \n18 39.  Plaintiff CENTRAL AMERICAN RESOURCE CENTER of Los Angeles \n19 (“CARECEN”) is a civil rights, social services and community empowerment organization.  \n20 Founded by Salvadoran refugees in 1983, it is now the largest Central American immigrant-rights \n21 organization in the country.  CARECEN’s mission is to empower Central Americans and all \n22 immigrants by defending human and civil rights, working for social and economic justice, and \n23 promoting cultural diversity, including by providing pro bono and low-cost immigration legal \n24 services to low-income immigrants.  Most of CARECEN’s legal work consists of legal counseling \n25 and representation to low-income individuals seeking admission and LPR status.  CARECEN also \n26 engages in community outreach and education, including about the process for obtaining lawful \n27 permanent residence.  \n28\n  -13-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 16 of 58\n \n1 40.  The Regulation will frustrate the core component of CARECEN’s mission to \n2 provide legal representation to individuals seeking admission and adjustment to lawful permanent \n3 residence.  More than half of CARECEN’s clients receive, have received, or have household \n4 members who receive or have received one or more forms of public assistance, including \n5 Medicaid and SNAP.  About half of CARECEN’s clients’ household incomes fall below the \n6 federal poverty line, and nearly all of its clients’ household incomes fall below 250% of the FPL.  \n7 CARECEN’s legal staff will have to expend significant additional time interviewing clients about \n8 their public-benefits history and assessing whether they are harmed by the Regulation, as well as \n9 advising clients about the potential impact of the Regulation if they receive certain benefits in the \n10 future.  Since the implementation of the Regulation, CARECEN has experienced a significant \n11 decrease in submission of adjustment of status applications.  In addition to the high risk for \n12 applicants, the administrative burden of document collection is also much more time-consuming \n13 and, at times, inaccessible for some applicants.  As fewer cases are filed due to the time it takes to \n14 process existing cases and clients become ineligible (or believe that they are) for immigration \n15 relief, CARECEN’s funding will also decrease because it is tied to the number of cases filed.  \n16 CARECEN will also expend considerable time educating the community about the Regulation as \n17 well as training its own staff so they can properly counsel clients who may be adversely affected \n18 by the Regulation.  This will divert significant resources away from other aspects of CARECEN’s \n19 mission.  \n20 41.  Plaintiff KOREAN RESOURCE CENTER (“KRC”) is a 38-year-old non-profit \n21 community and membership organization empowering low-income, immigrant, Asian American \n22 and Pacific Islander, and people of color communities in Southern California.  KRC’s mission is \n23 to empower members and clients, using a holistic approach, by integrating services, education, \n24 culture, organizing, and coalition building, all of which seek to help individuals thrive.  KRC has \n25 offices in Los Angeles and Orange County.  \n26 42.  KRC engages in community education and organizing, systemic advocacy, legal \n27 representation, and policy impact analysis.  KRC’s legal representation in immigration matters \n28 includes family-based adjustment of status applications, naturalization, Deferred Action for \n  -14-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 17 of 58\n \n1 Childhood Arrival (DACA) renewals, protection under the Violence Against Women Act, and \n2 deportation defense.  KRC also assists members, particularly seniors, with public benefits, such as \n3 Medicaid, SNAP, and subsidized housing.  The Regulation will cause KRC members and their \n4 families to disenroll from, or to fear enrolling in, these important programs.   \n5 43.  The Regulation will frustrate KRC’s mission by directly reducing the number of \n6 clients and members who will be able to adjust to LPR status or maintain or change their non-\n7 immigrant immigration status due to the public charge test.  KRC’s members and clients include \n8 individuals who are low-income and receive Medicaid, SNAP, subsidized housing, and other \n9 public benefits, and who possess other characteristics considered to be negative factors under the \n10 Regulation, including being elderly, having low incomes, and having limited-English proficiency.  \n11 KRC believes its individual members will be unable to adjust status as a result of the Regulation. \n12 44.  In addition, the Regulation will cause a diversion of limited resources by requiring \n13 increased staffing and expenses related to immigration consultations, translation services, \n14 outreach, and direct services related to public benefits eligibility.  \n15 45.  KRC’s resources will also continue to be diverted to address the negative effects of \n16 the Regulation and its implementation.  Specifically, KRC has conducted educational outreach and \n17 media releases about the public charge Regulation in both Korean and English, thereby diverting \n18 resources away from critical services such as survival counseling for victims of domestic violence, \n19 senior housing support, and health access education.  KRC’s ongoing efforts to correct \n20 misinformation about the public charge Regulation and its implementation continue, especially \n21 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated the uncertainty regarding public \n22 benefits.   \n23 II.  Defendants \n24 46.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  He is sued in his \n25 official capacity. \n26 47.  Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal \n27 agency headquartered in Washington, D.C. \n28\n  -15-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 18 of 58\n \n1 48.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is a \n2 component agency of DHS, which is responsible for the adjudication of applications for \n3 adjustment of status and for extensions or modifications of stay by non-immigrant visa holders.  \n4 USCIS is the component of DHS that promulgated the public charge Regulation.  \n5 49.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this case \n12 arises under the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. \n13 52.  Venue properly lies in this district because Plaintiffs LA CLÍNICA, CPCA, \n14 LEGAL AID, CAIR-CA, and FJ work and provide services in this district.  28 U.S.C. \n15 § 1391(e)(1).  Venue also properly lies in this district because a substantial part of the events or \n16 omissions giving rise to this action occurred in the district.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n17 BACKGROUND \n18 I.  Current Statutory Framework \n19 53.  The INA is the primary statute governing immigration to the United States.  Under \n20 the INA, if a current resident of the United States seeks LPR status through a family-based or \n21 employment-based petition, the first step is to file the petition and, if it is approved, wait until a \n22 visa becomes available.  If the resident has been admitted or paroled into the United States and \n23 meets certain other conditions, the individual may file an application for adjustment of status with \n24 USCIS, in most cases only once a visa becomes available.  In determining whether a noncitizen is \n25 eligible for adjustment of status, or whether an LPR who has been outside the United States for \n26 more than 180 days can reenter the country, DHS officers assess whether the applicant is \n27 inadmissible under section 212 of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1182).   \n28\n  -16-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 19 of 58\n \n1 54.  Individuals seeking admission as nonimmigrants, such as temporary agricultural or \n2 health care workers, foreign students, and cultural exchange visitors, are also assessed for \n3 inadmissibility before receiving a visa.  Most nonimmigrant visa holders may apply to extend or \n4 change their visa provided certain conditions are satisfied, such as compliance with the terms of \n5 their current visa.     \n6 55.  Section 212(a)(4) of the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the \n7 consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at \n8 the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a \n9 public charge is inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  This is commonly known as the \n10 “public charge” ground of inadmissibility. \n11 56.  The statute further directs that an adjudicator making a determination on the public \n12 charge ground “shall at a minimum consider the alien’s (I) age; (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) \n13 assets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \n14 Together these five factors are referred to as the “totality of circumstances” test. \n15 57.  The adjudicator “may also consider any affidavit of support.”  8 U.S.C. \n16 § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).  The U.S. citizen or LPR sponsor who signs the affidavit of support pledges to \n17 accept financial responsibility for the immigrant who is seeking admission or adjustment of status \n18 and specifically pledges to maintain the sponsored immigrant “at an annual income that is not less \n19 than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the period in which the affidavit is \n20 enforceable.”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A).  The affidavit is a legally enforceable contract between \n21 the sponsor and the U.S. government. \n22 II.  The Public Charge Statute and Its Long-Standing Meaning. \n23 58.  For over a century, the term “public charge” has referred to persons who cannot \n24 care for themselves and are thus primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution.  \n25 Further congressional definition of the term was not necessary as the phrase had an established \n26 meaning when first used and has been interpreted consistent with that meaning. \n27\n28\n  -17-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 20 of 58\n \n1 59.  The term first appeared in an 1882 act barring the admission of “any convict, \n2 lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public \n3 charge.”  An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214 (1882).   \n4 60.  The Immigration Act of 1907 included those “likely to become a public charge” \n5 among the categories of individuals barred entry, which also included “idiots,” “imbeciles,” \n6 “insane persons,” “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “persons . . . with a loathsome or \n7 dangerous contagious disease.”  An Act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United \n8 States, Pub. L. No. 96, § 2, 34 Stat. 898, 898–99 (1907). \n9 61.  As the Second Circuit recognized, “The excluded classes with which this provision \n10 is associated are significant.  It appears between ‘paupers’ and ‘professional beggars.’”  Howe v. \n11 United States, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917).  The court concluded, “We are convinced that \n12 Congress meant the act to exclude persons who were likely to become occupants of almshouses \n13 for want of means with which to support themselves in the future.”  Id.; see also Gegiow v. Uhl, \n14 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915) (reasoning that “public charge” had “to be read as generically similar to the \n15 others mentioned before and after” and rejecting an attempt to exclude individuals on public \n16 charge grounds). \n17 62.  In 1952 Congress enacted § 212 of the INA, which excluded from admissibility \n18 individuals “who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n19 the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time \n20 to become public charges.”  Pub. L. 414, ch. 2, § 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952). \n21 63.  The Department of Justice has recognized courts’ longstanding interpretation of the \n22 term “public charge” to mean a person who is “destitute.”  For instance, the Department has \n23 explained that “[t]he words ‘public charge’ had their ordinary meaning: that is to say, a money \n24 charge upon or an expense to the public for support and care, the alien being destitute.”  Matter of \n25 Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 586 (BIA 1974).  Congress has not altered this meaning of \n26 “public charge,” though it has revisited the topic on many occasions. \n27\n28\n  -18-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 21 of 58\n \n1 64.  In the INA of 1965, for instance, Congress deliberately overturned decades-old \n2 laws that restricted immigration from certain global regions and opened the U.S. to immigrants \n3 from all over the world.  But Congress made no change to the public charge test. \n4 65.  In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (“IRCA”).  \n5 Congress again did not modify the “public charge” test.  But Congress did provide additional \n6 grounds for waivers allowing individuals deemed a public charge to overcome that determination.   \n7 66.  Consistent with prior agency interpretations, the Immigration and Naturalization \n8 Service (“INS”)—the previous federal agency tasked with administering immigration \n9 applications—explained in 1987 that applicants would not be subject to exclusion on public-\n10 charge grounds if “the applicant demonstrates a history of employment in the United States \n11 evidencing self-support without the receipt of public cash assistance.”  Adjustment of Status for \n12 Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205, 16,211 (May 1, 1987) (emphasis added).  The agency defined \n13 “public cash assistance” as “income or needs-based monetary assistance . . . designed to meet \n14 subsistence levels.”  Id. at 16,209 (emphasis added).  The agency specifically excluded “assistance \n15 in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits” from those benefits that \n16 would render an individual a public charge.  Id. \n17 67.  Congress again declined to alter the “public charge” test in the Immigration Act of \n18 1990, despite making a number of other changes to immigration-related statutes.   \n19 68.  In 1991, the State Department—an agency that also has primary responsibility for \n20 implementing the INA’s public charge provisions—recognized in its Foreign Affairs Manual that \n21 the essential issue in determining if an individual is a public charge within the meaning of INA \n22 212(a)(4) is “whether the purpose of the public program in which the individual is participating is \n23 specifically designed to support individuals unable to provide for themselves.”  It recognized that \n24 the purpose of the food stamp program is “to strengthen the agricultural economy and help achieve \n25 a fuller use of food abundances through improving levels of nutrition among low-income \n26 households.  It has thus a number of objectives of a general nature and is not simply a matter of \n27 welfare or relief as such . . . [A] program that is essentially supplementary in nature, in the sense \n28 of providing training, services, food, etc. to augment the standard of living, rather than to \n  -19-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 22 of 58\n \n1 undertake directly the support of the recipients does not fall within the scope of INA 212(a)(4).”  \n2 (emphasis added). \n3 69.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n4 Reconciliation Act of 1996 (“PRWORA”), which imposed restrictions on immigrant eligibility for \n5 certain public benefits.  But Congress did not alter the “public charge” test.  \n6 70.  Congress again declined to change the meaning of “public charge” one month later \n7 when it enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n8 (“IIRIRA”).  In fact, Congress considered but rejected an expanded definition of “public charge” \n9 that would have included food, health care, and housing assistance.   \n10 71.  Instead, IIRIRA codified the totality-of-the-circumstances test, which had been \n11 developed in case law and administrative policies.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  \n12 72.  IIRIRA also introduced the affidavit of support that could be used to help an \n13 immigrant overcome the public-charge barrier, so long as the sponsor pledged to maintain the \n14 sponsored immigrant at or above 125% of the FPL.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); \n15 1183a(a)(1)(A).  \n16 73.  Following IIRIRA, the INS issued guidance explaining that the statute “has not \n17 altered the standards used to determine the likelihood of an alien to become a public charge nor \n18 has it significantly changed the criteria to be considered in determining such a likelihood.”  \n19 Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Dep’t of Justice, Public Charge:  INA Sections 212(A)(4) \n20 and 237(A)(5)—Duration of Departure for LPRs and Repayment of Public Benefits (Dec. 16, \n21 1997).     \n22 74.  Similarly, in 1998, the State Department stated that IIRIRA did “not change[] the \n23 long-standing legal presumption that an able-bodied, employable individual will be able to work \n24 upon arrival in the United States” and thus not become a public charge.  Dep’t of State, I-864 \n25 Affidavit of Support:  Update No. 14—Commitment to Provide Assistance, Unclas State 102426 \n26 (Cable dated June 8, 1998).  The INS further stated “[t]he presumption that the applicant will find \n27 work coupled with the fact that the [affidavit of support] is a legally enforceable contract will \n28\n  -20-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 23 of 58\n \n1 provide in most cases a sufficient basis to accept a sponsor’s . . . technically sufficient [affidavit] \n2 as overcoming the public charge ground.”  Id.   \n3 75.  Although the INS and State Department recognized that IIRIRA made no changes \n4 to the longstanding meaning or interpretation of the term “public charge,” the INS was concerned \n5 that, because Congress passed both IIRIRA and PRWORA close in time, “confusion about the \n6 relationship between the receipt of public benefits and the concept of ‘public charge’ ha[d] \n7 deterred eligible [non-citizens] and their families, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking \n8 important health and nutrition benefits that they are legally entitled to receive.”  Field Guidance on \n9 Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689, 28,692 (May \n10 26, 1999) (“1999 Field Guidance”).  \n11 76.  The INS recognized that “[t]his reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact \n12 not just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare.”  Id., 64 Fed. Reg. \n13 at 28,692.  The uncertainty following IIRIRA and PRWORA was “undermining the Government \n14 policies of increasing access to health care and helping people to become self-sufficient.”  \n15 Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, 28,677 \n16 (proposed May 26, 1999) (“Public Charge Grounds”). \n17 77.  To alleviate that confusion and its deleterious effects, the INS published two \n18 documents in the 1999 Federal Register to confirm that the longstanding historic understanding of \n19 the term “public charge” remained operative.   \n20 78.  The first was a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) in which the INS \n21 confirmed that the term “public charge” meant an individual “who is likely to become . . . \n22 primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of \n23 public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at \n24 Government expense.”  Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,677.  The agency never issued \n25 a final rule. \n26 79.  The second was the INS Field Guide that aimed to “help alleviate public confusion \n27 over the meaning of the term ‘public charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt \n28 of Federal, State, and local public benefits” and to “provide aliens with better guidance as to the \n  -21-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 24 of 58\n \n1 types of public benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge determinations.”  \n2 1999 Field Guidance, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689.   \n3 80.  These documents dictated that agencies consider only receipt of cash assistance for \n4 income maintenance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security \n5 Income, and state equivalents) and publicly funded long-term institutionalization in making the \n6 public-charge determination. \n7 81.  In explaining its interpretation of “public charge,” the INS recognized that “federal, \n8 state, and local benefits are increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above \n9 the poverty level, reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health \n10 and nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of \n11 becoming self-sufficient.”  Id., 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692.  This meant that “participation in such non-\n12 cash programs is not evidence of poverty or dependence.”  Id. \n13 82.  The INS further observed that non-cash benefits “are by their nature supplemental \n14 and do not, alone or in combination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or \n15 family.”  Id.  By focusing only on cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term \n16 institutionalization, the INS could thus “identify those who are primarily dependent on the \n17 government for subsistence without inhibiting access to non-cash benefits that serve important \n18 public interests.”  Id. \n19 83.  The INS also explained that the focus on cash benefits for making the public charge \n20 determination was consistent with the advice provided by federal benefits agencies, including the \n21 Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and the Social \n22 Security Administration.  Each department had concurred that “receipt of cash assistance for \n23 income maintenance is the best evidence of primary dependence on the Government” because \n24 “non-cash benefits generally provide supplementary support . . . to low-income working families \n25 to sustain and improve their ability to remain self-sufficient.”  Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. \n26 Reg. at 28,677–78. \n27 84.  The INS reasoned further, based on input from the Department of Health and \n28 Human Services, that while as a general matter, it could not “conceive of a situation where an \n  -22-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 25 of 58\n \n1 individual . . . could support himself or his family solely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily \n2 dependent on the government,” it made one exception for long-term institutionalization at \n3 government expense, which should be considered in the public charge determination.  Id., 64 Fed. \n4 Reg. at 28,678. \n5 85.  In addition, under the 1999 Field Guidance, forms of cash not intended for income \n6 maintenance and cash benefits that have been earned, such as government pension benefits or \n7 veteran’s benefits, were not considered cash benefits for purposes of the public-charge \n8 determination and should not be taken into account.  Further, “[p]ast receipt of non-cash benefits \n9 [such as Medicaid, CHIP, nutrition programs, housing benefits, child care services, energy \n10 assistance, emergency disaster relief, foster care and adoption assistance, educational assistance, \n11 job training programs, and in-kind, community-based programs, as well as similar state and local \n12 programs] should be excluded from consideration for public charge purposes.”  64 Fed. Reg. at \n13 28,693. \n14 86.  The INS noted that the “primary dependence model of public assistance was the \n15 backdrop against which the ‘public charge’ concept in immigration law developed in the 1800s.”  \n16 Since then, legislators, judges, and executive officials have consistently understood the term to \n17 refer to those who are primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution.  This is of \n18 particular importance given the many times that Congress has sought to re-employ the term over \n19 the years including in 1891, 1903, 1907, 1917, 1952, 1990, and 1996.  At no time has Congress \n20 widened the concept of “public charge” to include nutrition, health care (other than \n21 institutionalization), housing, or other non-cash programs, even as public assistance programs \n22 expanded and changed over the years.       \n23 87.  Although the 1999 NPRM never became a final rule, the Field Guidance governed \n24 Defendants’ public charge policy until the new Regulation, at issue in this litigation, was finalized.   \n25 88.  Indeed, the Congressional Research Service explained that, until the new \n26 Regulation, Defendants’ position had been consistent and clear: “USCIS, in making public charge \n27 determination for aliens applying for adjustment to LPR status, only considers cash income-\n28 maintenance benefits and government-funded institutionalization for long-term care.  Cash \n  -23-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 26 of 58\n \n1 assistance for income maintenance . . . ‘includes Supplemental Security Income (SSI), cash \n2 assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and state or local \n3 cash assistance programs for income maintenance, often called “general assistance” \n4 programs’ . . . . [A]n alien’s past or current receipt of these benefits or of government funded long-\n5 term care does not automatically lead to a determination of inadmissibility, but instead only \n6 factors into the prospective analysis under the totality of the circumstances test.”  Congressional \n7 Research Service, Immigration: Frequently Asked Questions about “Public Charge” at 7 (Sept. 19, \n8 2018), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45313.pdf.      \n9 89.  In fact, Congress has expanded immigrants’ access to some of the benefits that had \n10 been explicitly excluded from the public charge determination.  In the 2002 Farm Bill, for \n11 example, Congress restored eligibility for food stamps (now known as “SNAP”) to immigrant \n12 children, immigrants receiving disability benefits, and adults who had lived in the United States in \n13 a “qualified” immigrant status for five years.  Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, \n14 Pub L. No. 107-171 (May 13, 2002).  Significantly, despite legislating in the exact space of \n15 benefits use and immigration, Congress did not undermine the Field Guidance’s explanation of the \n16 longstanding definition, and consistent interpretation, of “public charge.”  \n17 90.  Although Congress and administrative agencies have interpreted “public charge” \n18 consistently since the term was first used, altering the definition of “public charge” has been a \n19 clear priority from the early days of the Trump administration.  During the President’s first month \n20 in office, members of the administration drafted an executive order to reinterpret the term.  That \n21 executive order was leaked to the public.  The administration never issued the executive order.    \n22 91.  Instead, in 2017, the Trump Administration endorsed the Reforming American \n23 Immigration for Strong Employment (“RAISE”) Act.  That bill would have eliminated some of the \n24 family-based admission preferences created by the 1965 Act and established a point-based system \n25 for evaluating potential immigrants.  The system would have awarded points based on factors \n26 including age, formal education, English language proficiency, and highly-compensated \n27 employment.  The RAISE Act would have disadvantaged many groups of potential immigrants, \n28\n  -24-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 27 of 58\n \n1 including applicants who had family ties to U.S. citizens but who had limited formal education or \n2 employment history and middle-aged and older adults.   \n3 92.  In 2017, Congress once again rejected changes to the existing immigration system \n4 and declined to pass the RAISE Act.   \n5 93.  Subsequently, on October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security \n6 published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Regulation.  This Regulation incorporated \n7 many of the rejected changes from the RAISE Act under the guise of an expanded totality of \n8 circumstances test for determining whether an individual was likely to become a “public charge.” \n9 III.  Defendants’ New Public Charge Regulation \n10 94.  On August 14, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security published the \n11 Regulation. \n12 95.  The Regulation drastically redefines the term “public charge.”  Under the \n13 Regulation, “public charge” means a noncitizen “who receives one or more public benefits, as \n14 defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\n15 month period.”  Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292, 41,501 (Aug. 14, \n16 2019) (codified as 8 CFR § 212.21(a)).  Paragraph (b) defines “public benefit” to mean any receipt \n17 of federal, state, local, or tribal cash assistance for income maintenance and includes receipt of \n18 health assistance through Medicaid (with some exceptions); SNAP benefits; and housing \n19 assistance through Section 8 housing choice vouchers, project-based Section 8 rental assistance, or \n20 public housing.  Several of these non-cash benefits were not included in prior agency definitions \n21 of “public charge,” and were, in fact, specifically excluded.  The Regulation counts all benefits \n22 equally, regardless of the value of the benefit received.   \n23 96.  The Regulation next defines the term “likely at any time to become a public \n24 charge.”  Id. (codified as 8 CFR § 212.21(c)); see 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  Under the \n25 Regulation, “[l]ikely at any time to become a public charge means more likely than not at any time \n26 in the future to become a public charge, as defined [above], based on the totality of the alien’s \n27 circumstances.”   \n28\n  -25-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 28 of 58\n \n1 97.  Under the Regulation, the totality of the circumstances determination is prospective \n2 and looks to “all factors that are relevant to whether the alien is more likely than not at any time in \n3 the future [to receive one or more public benefit for 12 months over a 36-month period].”  84 Fed. \n4 Reg. at 41,502 (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(a)).  As prescribed by Section 1182(a)(4)(B), the \n5 determination must consider, at minimum, the individual’s “age; health, family status, education \n6 and skills, and assets, resources, and financial status.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,502 (codified as 8 CFR \n7 § 212.22(b)).   \n8 98.  As to age, the agency must consider whether the noncitizen is between 18 and the \n9 minimum retirement age for Social Security.  Id. (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(1)).   \n10 99.  With regard to health, the agency must consider whether the individual’s health, \n11 including any diagnosed medical conditions, makes the individual more or less likely to be a \n12 public charge.  Id. (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(2)).   \n13 100.  The Regulation next requires that the agency consider whether the individual’s \n14 household size makes the individual more or less likely to become a public charge.  Id. (codified \n15 as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(3)).   \n16 101.  As to assets, resources, and financial status, the Regulation requires the agency to \n17 consider, inter alia, whether the individual’s household’s annual gross income is at least 125% of \n18 the FPL (100% for active duty military personnel).  If it is under that amount, the agency must \n19 consider whether the individual has “significant assets.”  Id. (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(4)(i)).  \n20 The Regulation also requires the agency to examine whether the individual has sufficient assets \n21 and resources to cover “any reasonably foreseeable medical costs”; has any financial liabilities; \n22 and has applied for, been certified to receive, or received public benefits.  Id.  \n23 102.  As evidence, the agency must look to the noncitizen’s sources of income, other \n24 assets and resources, credit score, whether the noncitizen has private health insurance, and whether \n25 the noncitizen has applied for, been certified or approved for, disenrolled or requested to be \n26 disenrolled from, or received public benefits.  Id. at 41,503 (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(4)(ii)).   \n27 103.  Finally, as to education and skills, the agency is to look to whether the noncitizen \n28 “has adequate education and skills to either obtain or maintain lawful employment with an income \n  -26-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 29 of 58\n \n1 sufficient to avoid being more likely than not to become a public charge,” including evidence of \n2 past work history, education level, and English language proficiency.  Id. (codified as 8 CFR \n3 § 212.22(b)(5)).   \n4 104.  The Regulation selects a subset of factors to be “heavily weighted” in the \n5 determination.  Id. at 41,504 (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(1)).  The Regulation adopts the \n6 following “heavily weighted negative factors” under 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(1): \n7 (A)  The noncitizen is not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is \n8 unable to demonstrate current employment, recent employment history, or a \n9 reasonable prospect of future employment; \n10 (B)  The noncitizen has received, or been certified or approved to receive, public \n11 benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period; \n12 (C)  The noncitizen has been diagnosed with a medical condition that will \n13 interfere with the alien’s ability to support him or herself and the noncitizen \n14 is uninsured and has neither the prospect of receiving private insurance nor \n15 the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable expenses due to a \n16 medical condition; and \n17 (D)  The noncitizen has previously been found inadmissible or deportable on \n18 public charge grounds.  \n19 105.  The Regulation includes as “heavily weighted positive factors”:  \n20 (A)  The noncitizen’s “household has financial assets, resources, and support,” \n21 excluding illegal activities or public-benefit income, of at least 250% of \n22 FPL.  Id. (codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(2)(i)). That income threshold \n23 equates to over $64,000 a year for a family of four, more than the median \n24 household income for households of any size in the United States. \n25 (B)  The noncitizen is authorized to work and has a legal annual income of at \n26 least 250 percent of the FPL for her household size; and \n27\n28\n  -27-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 30 of 58\n \n1 (C)  The noncitizen has private health insurance, excluding health insurance \n2 subsidized by premium tax credits established by the Patient Protection and \n3 Affordable Care Act.    \n4 106.  The Regulation adds new, non-statutory factors for USCIS to consider in \n5 evaluating the affidavit of support.  USCIS must now also evaluate the sponsor’s annual income, \n6 the sponsor’s relationship to the applicant, the likelihood that the sponsor will actually provide the \n7 required financial support, “and any other related considerations.”  Id. (codified as 8 CFR \n8 § 212.22(b)(7)).    \n9 107.  The Regulation also requires applicants to compile extensive documentation of \n10 their finances and to fill out a newly developed 15-page form that the agency estimates will \n11 require 4.5 hours to complete. \n12 108.  The Regulation also applies a public charge test to an entirely new group of people: \n13 nonimmigrant visa holders seeking to extend or change their visas.  USCIS must evaluate whether \n14 the person has received the designated benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a \n15 36-month period since obtaining their status.  \n16 109.  During the notice and comment period, hundreds of thousands of comments were \n17 submitted, “the vast majority” opposing the proposed Regulation, as acknowledged by the agency.  \n18 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,304.  Commenters explained that the factors were not rationally related to \n19 predicting the likelihood of a noncitizen becoming a public charge, were arbitrary and vague, and \n20 would cause substantial negative effects.    \n21 110.  For example, commenters criticized the proposed Regulation’s threshold of 15% of \n22 the Federal Poverty Guidelines as the value of monetizable benefits a noncitizen could receive \n23 over a 12-month period without being a public charge.  According to several sets of commenters, \n24 the threshold was far too low to show dependency on benefits and did not account for the taxes \n25 that immigrants pay and the fact that they pay more into the healthcare system than they take out.  \n26 111.  Rather than engage with these criticisms, the Regulation instead moved the \n27 threshold from 15% to 0%, such that receipt of benefits of any value over the applicable time \n28 period qualifies a noncitizen as a public charge.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,357–58.  DHS did not \n  -28-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 31 of 58\n \n1 explain how comments indicating the 15% threshold was too low justified an even lower \n2 threshold, electing to simply call its final choice a better policy than its prior proposal. \n3 112.  The irrationality of this response is further compounded by the Regulation’s \n4 counting of each month of each individual benefit received separately, such that receipt of 2 \n5 benefits for 6 months or 3 benefits for 4 months, regardless of value, will meet the threshold.  \n6 Thus, in response to comments that one year at 15% utilization was too low to show dependency \n7 on benefits, the Regulation went lower as to both duration and percentage.   \n8 113.  In addition, Defendants failed to adequately respond to comments related to the \n9 potential retroactive application of the Regulation.  Although Defendants repeatedly assert that the \n10 Regulation will have no retroactive effect and implicates no reliance interests, Defendants failed to \n11 adequately respond to concerns that the new Form I-944 asks applicants to list all benefits that the \n12 applicant ever used and to list the dates of the use of those benefits even if they were used before \n13 the effective date of the Regulation.  If DHS does not intend to take past use of benefits into \n14 account, there is no reason to ask for this information, yet DHS also claims that Form I-944 \n15 requests information “about all the relevant factors” for the public charge determination.  \n16 Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,483.  Questions on the Form I-944 \n17 about past use of public benefits, which DHS simultaneously claims are relevant and not relevant \n18 to the public charge determination, creates internal inconsistency and ambiguity about the \n19 retroactive effect of the Regulation.   \n20 A.  Impact of the New Regulation on Immigrants and Non-White Communities \n21 114.  Defendants’ Regulation will label as a “public charge” a very large percentage of \n22 immigrants, including low-and moderate-income working families.  In fiscal year 2017, 83% of all \n23 immigrants who received green cards were subject to the public charge test.1  The remainder were \n24 exempt under the statute.     \n25\n26\n                                                 \n27 1 See Randy Capps, et al., Gauging the Impact of DHS’s Proposed Public-Charge Rule on U.S. \nImmigration, Migration Policy (Nov. 2018), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/impact-\n28 dhs-public-charge-rule-immigration. \n  -29-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 32 of 58\n \n1 115.  While only roughly 2–4% of the noncitizen population would have qualified as a \n2 public charge under the prior definition, the Regulation will now sweep in vast numbers of \n3 individuals who, like millions of working Americans, will receive one or more of the \n4 supplemental benefits listed in the Regulation over the course of a lifetime.  Under a similar \n5 definition of public charge, which applies to individuals seeking to enter the United States from \n6 abroad, State Department findings of ineligibility on the basis of public charge increased from \n7 1,076 in 2016 to 20,941 in 2019, a 946% increase.  The increases have disproportionately affected \n8 immigrants from predominantly non-white countries.  For instance, ineligibility findings on public \n9 charge grounds of intending immigrants from Mexico increased from 7 in 2016 to 5,343 in 2018.  \n10 Similarly, in 2018 the State Department denied 1,254 immigrant visas for Indian nationals after \n11 denying none in 2016.  And the State Department denied 1,109 immigrant visas to Haitian \n12 nationals in 2018, after denying none in 2016.  Meanwhile, only three Canadian nationals had \n13 immigrant visas denied in 2018.2     \n14 116.  In fact, the Regulation’s definition is so expansive that, if applied to U.S.-born \n15 citizens, roughly half of the population would be characterized as “public charges,” simply \n16 because they will receive one of the listed supplemental benefits at some point in their lifetimes.   \n17 117.  The Regulation will also affect an estimated 2.3 million nonimmigrants with \n18 temporary visas, including students and agricultural workers, who attempt to extend their visas or \n19 change their non-immigrant status over a five-year period.  The Regulation introduces an \n20 unprecedented public charge inquiry and potential barrier for these groups.  See DHS, RIN: 1615-\n21 AA22, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds 28–32 (Aug. 2019).   \n22 118.  The increase in denials for green cards will not be based solely on current or recent \n23 benefit use but will also be based on immigration officers’ determinations that individuals are \n24 likely to use benefits in the future considering the factors listed in the Regulation’s totality-of-the-\n25\n26                                                  \n2 See Ted Hesson, Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department, \n27 Politico (Aug. 6, 2019), https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-\ntrump-1637094. \n28\n  -30-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 33 of 58\n \n1 circumstances test.  This forward-looking aspect of the test is likely to reshape immigration, as the \n2 non-partisan Migration Policy Institute’s research indicated that based on recent legal permanent \n3 residents’ data, around 69% had at least one factor that would be construed negatively under the \n4 Regulation, 43% have at least two factors, and 17% had at least three.3  \n5 119.  Overall, the Regulation’s modification of the totality-of-the-circumstances test will \n6 disproportionately exclude women, children, and older adults and will serve to facilitate or \n7 prolong the separation of immigrant families, striking at the heart of the pro-family immigration \n8 policy conceived in 1965.  Under the Regulation, many citizens, both U.S. and foreign born, will \n9 encounter new barriers to uniting with their families.     \n10 120.  The majority of green card applications, especially in communities of color, are \n11 family-based petitions that allow U.S. citizens and LPRs to reunite with their immediate family \n12 members in the United States.  The Regulation’s negatively weighted factors disproportionately \n13 and detrimentally affect communities of color.    \n14 121.  According to a study of recently admitted lawful permanent residents that was \n15 submitted in comments, 60% of those from Mexico and Central America had at least two negative \n16 factors, compared with only 27% of those from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.  Forty-eight percent \n17 of recent LPRs from the Caribbean, 41% from Asia, 40% from South America, and 34% from \n18 Africa had at least two negative factors and thus would be excluded at a disproportionately higher \n19 rate than those from Europe, Canada, and Oceania. \n20 122.  Defendants do not dispute the disparate impact.  In fact, the previous purported \n21 acting director of USCIS Kenneth Cuccinelli has tacitly admitted its presence.  At a press briefing \n22 on the Regulation, when asked about the fact that the majority of those affected by the Regulation \n23 would likely be Latino, Cuccinelli responded that “if we had been having this conversation 100 \n24\n25\n26\n                                                 \n27 3 Randy Capps, Mark Greenberg, Michael Fix, & Jie Zong, Gauging the Impact of DHS’ Proposed \nPublic-Charge Rule on U.S. Immigration, Migration Policy Institute, Nov. 2018, at 2. \n28\n  -31-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 34 of 58\n \n1 years ago, [the Regulation] would have applied more to Italians” than to other groups.4  And a day \n2 later in an interview about the Regulation, Mr. Cuccinelli argued that “The New Colossus,” the \n3 136-year-old sonnet inscribed at the base of the Statute of Liberty that welcomes “poor” \n4 immigrants, referred to “people coming from Europe.”5  \n5 B.  The Discriminatory Impact Is the Intended Purpose of the New Regulation. \n6 123.  The Trump Administration has made numerous efforts to suppress immigration \n7 from non-white countries, including advocating an end to family-based immigration.  Curtailing \n8 immigration by people of color has been a thread uniting each of the Trump Administration’s \n9 numerous attempts to change existing immigration law and regulations.   \n10 124.  The Administration has promulgated numerous immigration-related executive \n11 actions since January 2017, most either exclusively or disproportionately harming immigrants \n12 from non-white-majority nations, including: \n13 (A)  Separating thousands of young children from their parents as a proclaimed \n14 deterrent to immigration at the southern border; \n15 (B)  Refusing refuge to immigrants seeking asylum, and criminally prosecuting \n16 asylum seekers for crossing the border between checkpoints; \n17 (C)  Initially suspending the refugee admission program and then slashing the \n18 number of refugees who may be admitted from 110,000 to 30,000 in 2019, \n19 and 20,000 in 2020; \n20 (D)  Ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; \n21 (E)  Terminating Temporary Protected Status for nationals of El Salvador, \n22 Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Sudan, and Nicaragua; \n23 (F)  Excluding nationals from several majority-Muslim countries; and \n24\n25\n                                                 \n26 4 Chris Rodrigo, White House: New immigration policy meant to promote ‘self-sufficiency and \npersonal responsibility’, The Hill (Aug. 12 2019), https://thehill.com/homenews/ \n27 administration/457093-white-house-defends-new-immigration-policy. \n5 Jacey Fortin, ‘Huddled Masses’ in Statue of Liberty Poem Are European, Trump Official Says, \n28 N.Y.

These attempted changes have occurred alongside a string of racist statements by \n4 the President predating his seeking office and continuing through to the final days before the \n5 Regulation’s promulgation, including:  \n6 (A)  Rising to political prominence based upon the racist false claim that \n7 President Obama was not born in the United States and/or had allegiance to \n8 Kenya;6  \n9 (B)  Running a campaign replete with racist aspersions about people of Mexican \n10 descent and of the Muslim faith;7 and \n11 (C)  Wrongly slurring countries of the African diaspora by declaring while in \n12 office that Haitians “all have AIDS”; that once Nigerians had seen the \n13 United States, they would never go “back to their huts”; and that America \n14 should not be a haven for “people from shithole countries,” allegedly \n15 referring to Haiti and African nations, while stating that the U.S. should \n16 instead have immigrants coming from places like Norway.8  \n17 126.

While the Regulation was in final review at the Office of Management and Budget, \n2 President Trump made statements linking his view of immigration and racial exclusion.  \n3 129.  Specifically, on July 14, 2019, the President claimed that four women of color \n4 serving in the United States Congress “originally came from countries whose governments are a \n5 complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they \n6 even have a functioning government at all)” and asked, “Why don’t they go back and help fix the \n7 totally broken and crime infested places from which they came . . . .” \n8 130.  The President and the White House have been actively involved in pressing for the \n9 Regulation.   \n10 131.  For example, Senior Adviser to the President Stephen Miller had a “singular \n11 obsession” with the public charge Regulation.  He took issue with the approach of then-head of \n12 USCIS, Francis Cissna, on changing the agency’s long-standing interpretation of public charge.  \n13 In a June 2018 email to Cissna, copying Chad Wolf (now the purported Acting Secretary of DHS), \n14 Miller said “the timing on public charge is unacceptable . . . I don’t care what you need to do to \n15 finish it on time.”  In response to an email from then-USCIS Chief Counsel Craig Symons on how \n16 USCIS will “do what we can to quickly move” the Regulation “back up to the Department and \n17 then OMB [Office of Management and Budget],” Miller said that the head of OMB “Mick \n18 [Mulvaney] promised the president.”13   \n19 132.  In March 2019, during a meeting with officials covering immigration policy \n20 priorities like the public charge Regulation and federal rules for detaining children, Miller told \n21 staff that “You ought to be working on this regulation all day every day,” and that “[i]t should be \n22\n23\n24\n                                                 \n25 13 Nick Miroff, et al., Trump to place Ken Cuccinelli at the head of the country’s legal \nimmigration system, Wash.

And it should be the last thought you have before \n2 you go to bed.  And sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed.”14    \n3 133.  When the Regulation came out in August 2019, the then-acting director of USCIS, \n4 Kenneth Cuccinelli, held press conferences on the Regulation and how “President Trump has once \n5 again delivered on his promise” regarding immigration.15  As noted above, in response to a \n6 question about how this new Regulation will target Latinos, Mr. Cuccinelli stated that “if we had \n7 been having this conversation 100 years ago, it would’ve applied to more Italians.” \n8 134.  After changing the words to Emma Lazarus’s sonnet at the Statute of Liberty, \n9 “Give me your tired and your poor,” by adding “who can stand on their own two feet and who will \n10 not become a public charge,” Mr. Cuccinelli defended his rewriting of history, explaining “that \n11 poem was referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies.”16   \n12 135.  This was not Mr. Cuccinelli’s first foray into discriminatory language related to \n13 immigration.  While running for Governor of Virginia as state Attorney General, it came out that \n14 during a radio interview, Mr. Cuccinelli had compared D.C.’s pest control policy to immigration \n15 policy, saying the former was “worse than our immigration policy.  You can’t break up rat \n16 families.”17 \n17\n18\n19\n20                                                  \n14 Eileen Sullivan & Michael D.

Mr. Cuccinelli also has echoed the President, referring to immigrants crossing the \n2 southern border as an “invasion” and suggesting states “don’t have to keep them, no catch-and-\n3 release, no nothing.  You just point them back across the river and let them swim for it.”18 \n4 137.  The Administration’s prior acting director of Immigration and Customs \n5 Enforcement (“ICE”), Mark Morgan (now acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border \n6 Protection), also dehumanized and engaged in blatant stereotyping and discrimination against \n7 immigrants, saying of unaccompanied children in immigration detention that “I’ve looked at them \n8 and I’ve looked at their eyes . . . and I’ve said that is a soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.  It’s \n9 unequivocal.”19 \n10 C.  Defendants’ Unlawful Appointments Related to the Regulation \n11 138.  In addition to the above pattern of overt discrimination, Defendants manipulated \n12 the leadership structure of DHS and USCIS in connection with their goal of issuing the \n13 Regulation, as well as to further their other immigration policies motived by racial animus.  These \n14 actions violated federal law.  In particular, Mr. Kevin McAleenan, purported Acting DHS \n15 Secretary at the time the Regulation was promulgated, was appointed in contravention of the rules \n16 established by the DHS statute and regulations governing the appointment of the Acting Director \n17 of DHS and the FVRA.  In addition, Mr. Kenneth Cuccinelli, purported Acting USCIS Director at \n18 the time the Regulation was promulgated, was appointed in violation of the FVRA, which governs \n19 the appointment of Acting USCIS Director.  The illegality of those appointments renders the \n20 Regulation invalid under the FVRA and makes it contrary to law under the APA. \n21\n22\n23\n24                                                  \n18 John Binder, Exclusive-Ken Cuccinelli: States Can Stop Migrant Caravan “Invasion” With \n25 Constitutional War Powers, Brietbart (Oct. 23, 2018), https://www.breitbart.com/politics/ \n2018/10/23/exclusive-ken-cuccinelli-statescan-stop-migrant-caravan-invasion-with-constitutional-\n26 war-powers/. \n27 19 Ted Hesson, Trump’s Pick for ICE Director: I Can Tell Which Migrant Children Will Become \nGang Members By Looking Into Their Eyes, Politico (May 16, 2019), https://www.politico.com/ \n28 story/2019/05/16/mark-morgan-eyes-ice-director-1449570. \n  -37-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 40 of 58\n \n1 1.  Statutory and Regulatory Regime for Appointment of DHS Acting \nOfficials \n2\n139.  As a general matter, the FVRA serves as the default rule for appointing acting \n3\nofficials.  But it can be superseded where “a statutory provision expressly authorizes the President, \n4\na court, or the head of an Executive department, to designate an officer or employee to perform the \n5\nfunctions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity; or designates an officer \n6\nor employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting \n7\ncapacity.”  5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)(1)(A)-(B).   \n8\n140.  The FVRA applies in full to the appointment of Mr. Cuccinelli, as there is no \n9\nstatutory provision designating an alternative order of succession to that prescribed by the FVRA \n10\nfor the position of Director of USCIS. \n11\n141.  Under the FVRA, vacancies in an office requiring Presidential nomination and \n12\nSenate confirmation can only be filled on an acting basis by certain individuals.  Specifically, such \n13\na vacancy can be filled by “the first assistant to the office of such officer,” by a person who has \n14\nalready been confirmed by the Senate for a different office, or by a person who, during the year \n15\nprior to the vacancy, served as an officer or employee in the same agency for at least 90 days.  5 \n16\nU.S.C. § 3345(a).   \n17\n142.  Unlike with the Director of USCIS, the DHS Organic Statute provides an \n18\nalternative approach that supersedes § 3345(a) for the Acting Director of DHS.  That statute states \n19\nthat “[n]otwithstanding [the FVRA],” the order of succession if the DHS Secretary position is \n20\nvacant is first the Deputy Secretary, see 6 U.S.C. § 133(a)(1)(A), and then the Under Secretary for \n21\nManagement, see id. § 133(g)(1).  It also states that “Notwithstanding chapter 33 of title 5, the \n22\nSecretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to \n23\nserve as Acting Secretary.”  Id. § 133(g)(2).  DHS’s Organic Statute does not otherwise supersede \n24\nany other provision of the FVRA. \n25\n26\n27\n28\n  -38-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 41 of 58\n \n1 143.  Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. § 133(g)(2), the DHS Secretary issued a Regulation adopting a \n2 further order of succession in 2016.20   \n3 144.  Under the APA, regulations may be challenged when adopted contrary to law, see 5 \n4 U.S.C. § 706, including, as relevant here, the FVRA or an agency’s organic succession statute.   \n5 2.  Mr. McAleenan’s Appointment \n6 145.  On April 7, 2019, then-Secretary of DHS Kirstjen Nielsen tendered her resignation \n7 effective the same day.  At that time, the next in line to become Secretary if that office was vacant, \n8 the Deputy Secretary position, was unfilled.  That same day, President Trump tweeted that Mr. \n9 Kevin McAleenan, the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, would assume the role \n10 of Acting Secretary. \n11 146.  But Mr. McAleenan was statutorily foreclosed from becoming Acting Secretary.  \n12 Rather, under the DHS Organic Statute, the Under Secretary for Management—then held by \n13 Claire Grady—was required to assume the acting role.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1). \n14 147.  Nielsen then announced that she would remain Secretary until April 10, 2019.  \n15 During that span, Under Secretary Grady resigned.   \n16 148.  But Ms. Grady’s resignation did not render Mr. McAleenan’s appointment valid \n17 under DHS’s organic statute.  When there is neither a Senate-confirmed Deputy Secretary nor \n18 Under Secretary for Management, DHS is required to abide by its self-prescribed Order of \n19 Succession if it has issued one.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) (providing that DHS may designate \n20 succession beyond the Under Secretary for Management). \n21 149.  Prior to April 10, the Order of Succession in effect was promulgated by then-\n22 Secretary Jeh Johnson on December 15, 2016.  Pursuant to that Order of Succession, Mr. \n23 McAleenan would have been eligible to serve as acting secretary only if DHS lacked a Senate-\n24\n25\n                                                 \n26 20 Letter to Comptroller General Dodaro from Reps. Thompson and Maloney and attachments \n(Nov. 15, 2019), available at, https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/ \n27 files/191115%20T%20Dodaro%20re%20Letter%20to%20GAO%20on%20Wolf-\nCuccinelli%20Appointment.pdf. \n28\n  -39-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 42 of 58\n \n1 confirmed officer in each of seven positions.21  Specifically, DHS would have to have vacancies in \n2 the offices of the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary for Management, Administrator of \n3 the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Under Secretary for National Protection \n4 and Programs, the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, and the Under Secretary for \n5 Intelligence and Analysis. \n6 150.  On April 10, 2019—the same day as Ms. Grady’s resignation—Secretary Nielsen \n7 amended that Order of Succession, but only for situations where the Secretary is incapable of \n8 acting “during a disaster or catastrophic emergency.”22   \n9 151.  Secretary Nielsen did not change the separate Order of Succession applicable “in \n10 case of the Secretary’s . . . resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the office.”  Id.  As \n11 a result, Secretary Nielsen’s actions did not change Mr. McAleenan’s position as eighth in line to \n12 the acting secretary position. \n13 152.  At the time of Secretary Nielsen’s second resignation date, Senate-confirmed \n14 appointees served as both the Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs and the \n15 Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis.  Mr. McAleenan was therefore third in line for the \n16 acting secretary position, and could not be lawfully appointed to that position. \n17 153.  Despite being ineligible to do so, Mr. McAleenan purported to assume the role of \n18 Acting Secretary on April 11, 2019.  While invalidly serving in that position, Mr. McAleenan \n19 issued the Regulation.23   \n20\n                                                 \n21 21 See https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/ \n191115%20T%20Dodaro%20re%20Letter%20to%20GAO%20on%20Wolf-\n22 Cuccinelli%20Appointment.pdf.   \n23 22 See Annex A, https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/ \n191115%20T%20Dodaro%20re%20Letter%20to%20GAO%20on%20Wolf-\n24 Cuccinelli%20Appointment.pdf. \n25 23 Because Mr. McAleenan was improperly appointed, his purported successor and current Acting \nSecretary Chad Wolf was also improperly appointed.  Although there is a 210-day statutory limit \n26 on acting secretary service, see 5 U.S.C. § 3346, Mr. McAleenan served past that 210-day \ndeadline.  On November 8, 2019, the 211th day of his invalid service, Mr. McAleenan purported \n27 to again amend the Order of Succession at DHS.  That succession amendment was necessarily \ninvalid both because Mr. McAleenan was never a valid Acting Secretary, and even if he had been, \n28 McAleenan purported to make the amendment after the 210-day period for acting-secretary \n  -40-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 43 of 58\n \n1 154.  Although the DHS Organic Statute superseded the FVRA’s provision regarding \n2 which officials can properly serve as Acting Secretary, see 5 U.S.C. § 3345(a), it does not \n3 supersede any other provision of the FVRA, including § 3348(d), which states that any action \n4 taken by an improperly appointed person “shall have no force or effect.”  \n5 155.  Because Mr. McAleenan was not properly appointed pursuant to the DHS’s \n6 Organic Statute and the regulation implementing it, his issuance of the Regulation was unlawful, \n7 and has no force or effect under the FVRA.  Additionally, it was consequently contrary to law \n8 under the APA. \n9 3.  Mr. Cuccinelli’s Appointment  \n10 156.  Mr. Cuccinelli was invalidly appointed as acting director of USCIS and his \n11 Department-head-level involvement with the Regulation’s promulgation as leader of USCIS is in \n12 violation of the FVRA and contrary to law under the APA.  \n13 157.  At roughly the same time that Mr. McAleenan improperly assumed the office of \n14 Acting DHS Secretary, President Trump’s principal advisor on immigration, Mr. Stephen Miller, \n15 had been urging the removal of Mr. Francis Cissna, then the Senate-confirmed Director of USCIS.  \n16 On information and belief, Mr. Miller’s desire to remove Mr. Cissna was due at least in part to Mr. \n17 Miller’s stance that Mr. Cissna was moving too slowly in implementing the Regulation, as noted \n18 above.24   \n19 158.  Mr. Cissna resigned effective June 1, 2019.  At that time, Mr. Cuccinelli was being \n20 considered by the Administration for a post within the Department of Homeland Security from \n21 which he would “coordinate the administration’s immigration policies.”25  Mr. Cuccinelli had a \n22\n23                                                  \nservice expired.  That same day, the Senate invoked cloture on the nomination of Defendant Chad \n24 Wolf to serve as the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans, which placed him next in line \nunder the new succession order.  On November 13, 2019, the Senate confirmed Mr. Wolf to that \n25 position.  Mr. McAleenan resigned the same day and Mr. Wolf purported to assume the Acting \nSecretary role. \n26\n24 Supra, n.13.  \n27\n25 Maggie Haberman & Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Trump Expected to Pick Ken Cuccinelli for \n28 Immigration Policy Role, N.Y.

In addition to his conduct described above, \n2 while Mr. Cuccinelli was a Virginia State Senator, he proposed bills to end birthright citizenship \n3 and to allow firing of employees and denying unemployment benefits to anyone speaking a \n4 language other than English at work. \n5 159.  On the date of Mr. Cissna’s resignation, June 1, 2019, Mr. Cuccinelli did not meet \n6 any of the FVRA’s criteria for appointment to Director of USCIS.  The position of first assistant \n7 was then held by Mr. Mark Koumans.  Mr. Koumans assumed the position of Acting Director of \n8 USCIS on June 2, 2019.  Shortly thereafter, the invalidly serving Acting Secretary McAleenan \n9 created a new position at USCIS: “Principal Deputy Director.”  Acting Secretary McAleenan \n10 issued an order amending the succession procedure at USCIS and placing the just-created \n11 Principal Deputy Director as second-in-command to the Director.  Acting Secretary McAleenan \n12 then appointed Mr. Cuccinelli to that purpose-made position—placing him above the Deputy \n13 Director—and declaring him to be the acting director of USCIS as a result.  Mr. Cuccinelli was \n14 thus never a first assistant to any office as the existence of his job and appointment to the same \n15 were simultaneous with his alleged elevation to the Acting Director role.  This rendered his \n16 appointment invalid under the FVRA.  See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, No. CV 19-2676 (RDM), 2020 \n17 WL 985376, at *15-19 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 2020) (“[T]he Court concludes that Cuccinelli was \n18 designated to serve as the acting Director of USCIS in violation of the FVRA.”). \n19 160.  Both Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment and the change in succession noted that they \n20 would terminate upon the appointment of a new Director of USCIS. \n21 161.  Mr. Cuccinelli was appointed before Acting Secretary McAleenan issued the \n22 Regulation, and, on information and belief, Mr. Cuccinelli played an important role in \n23 promulgating the Regulation as purported Acting Director of USCIS.26  Consistent with that \n24\n                                                 \n25 26 Ted Hesson & Anita Kumar, Cuccinelli Bores His Way Into Trump’s Inner Circle, Politico \n(July, 18, 2019), https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/cuccinelli-immigration-trump-\n26 1598325 (“At USCIS, the agency he runs, Cuccinelli has powered ahead with major Trump \nadministration initiatives such as the ‘public charge’ regulation, which could block immigrants \n27 from obtaining green cards if they use certain public benefits or are deemed likely to do so in the \nfuture.”); Brett Samuels, Unconfirmed by Senate, Cuccinelli Sees Power, Influence Grow on \n28 Immigration, The Hill (Sept. 1, 2019), https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/459474-\n  -42-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 45 of 58\n \n1 involvement, Mr. Cuccinelli was the one to announce the Regulation’s promulgation, holding a \n2 press conference the day it was promulgated and describing the Regulation as the President \n3 “delivering on his promise to the American people.”27 \n4 D.  Additional Harms Resulting from the Regulation \n5 162.  While the Regulation targets immigrants of color, it will have significantly broader \n6 consequences for the country’s public health and the economy as a whole. \n7 163.  Defendants admit that the proposed Regulation will create the following harms \n8 because individuals will be deterred from using important supplemental benefits: \n9 (A)  Worse health outcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and \n10 malnutrition, especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, or \n11 children, and reduced prescription adherence;  \n12 (B)  Increased use of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of \n13 primary health care due to delayed treatment;  \n14 (C)  Increased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among members \n15 of the U.S. citizen population who are not vaccinated;  \n16 (D)  Increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid \n17 for by an insurer or patient;  \n18 (E)  Increased rates of poverty and housing instability; and  \n19 (F)  Reduced productivity and educational attainment.

The proposed Regulation recognized that “reductions in federal and state transfers \n4 under federal benefit programs may have downstream and upstream impacts on state and local \n5 economies, large and small businesses, and individuals.”  Inadmissibility of Public Charge \n6 Grounds (NPRM), 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,118.  The final Regulation acknowledged that reduced \n7 program participation could result in higher poverty levels, reduced access to health care, and an \n8 increase in severe and chronic health issues.  See generally Inadmissibility of Public Charge \n9 Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,310–12 (detailing comments on effects of Regulation).  In other \n10 words, families will increasingly be poorer and less healthy.  \n11 165.  Rather than contest commenters’ assertions, Defendants simply stated that it would \n12 be “difficult to predict how this rule will affect aliens subject to the public charge ground of \n13 admissibility.”  Id., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,313.  DHS did not directly refute the numerous comments \n14 estimating such impacts, did not address the chilling effect which necessarily does not require \n15 estimating eligibility numbers, and conceded that it is not sure of the breadth of impact of the \n16 Regulation. \n17 166.  The Regulation will create confusion and fear in immigrant communities and will \n18 have a dramatic effect, potentially causing an estimated tens of millions of people to avoid seeking \n19 services or to disenroll from core public-health and general-welfare programs.  This includes \n20 individuals subject to the public charge inquiry and individuals who are not subject to the \n21 Regulation but who will nonetheless be dissuaded from applying for benefits for themselves and \n22 their families.  These harms defeat Defendants’ stated purpose of the Regulation because they \n23 make it harder to achieve self-sufficiency for immigrants and their families, including their U.S. \n24 citizen children.  As immigration policy experts note, “public assistance can make someone less \n25 likely to rely on government in the future” because “temporary use of public benefits can stabilize \n26\n27\n28\n  -44-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 47 of 58\n \n1 immigrants and families, putting them on a track to long-term financial stability and health.”28  \n2 While Defendants assert that altering the longstanding definition of “public charge” will save \n3 costs, the long-term effect will be the exact opposite. \n4 167.  Deterring people from enrolling or remaining in vital programs that support their \n5 health, food security, and ability to maintain housing will cause severe harm to the health and \n6 welfare of communities across the country.   \n7 168.  Reducing access to preventive care and vital health services will lead to a range of \n8 negative health outcomes, including increased costs and rates of preventable disease, late \n9 diagnoses, unmanaged chronic conditions, premature births, and early deaths.  These effects will \n10 reach far beyond the individuals who are subject to public charge determinations and will harm \n11 significant numbers of U.S. residents regardless of their national origin or immigration status.  \n12 169.  Deterring families from remaining in affordable housing will increase \n13 homelessness and housing instability, leading to negative health outcomes and higher health care \n14 costs.  Lack of access to affordable housing will also lead to job instability and loss. \n15 170.  Reduction in use of SNAP benefits will increase food insecurity, which will lead to \n16 negative health outcomes and correspondingly higher health-care costs. \n17 171.  U.S. citizen children living in mixed-status families are at particular risk.  Evidence \n18 shows that when parents lose access to health coverage, children are more likely to be uninsured.  \n19 The Regulation, therefore, is likely to increase the rates of uninsured children throughout the \n20 country. \n21 172.  Reducing access to housing benefits will also result in severe and irreparable harm \n22 to children, including impairment of cognitive development.  SNAP benefits are particularly \n23 important to mitigate the effects of poverty on children, and reducing access to these benefits will \n24 have a negative impact on school attendance and performance, emotional and physical \n25 development, and long-term health and achievement. \n26\n                                                 \n27 28 Matthew La Corte, The New ‘Public Charge’ Rule Will Harm the Rule of Law, Economic \nGrowth, and Public Health, Niskanen Center (Aug. 28, 2018), https://niskanencenter.org/blog/the-\n28 new-public-charge-rule-will-harm-the-rule-of-law-economic-growth-and-public-health/. \n  -45-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 48 of 58\n \n1 173.  In addition to the direct impact on immigrants, their families, and their \n2 communities, the new Regulation will have severely negative impacts on several sectors of the \n3 economy.  \n4 174.  For example, SNAP benefits have a high multiplier effect as they circulate through \n5 the economy.  Every dollar of SNAP translates to $1.79 in local economic activity.   \n6 175.  Businesses that accept SNAP will be disproportionately harmed and may need to \n7 close or cut back on carrying healthy, perishable foods that can be purchased with SNAP, which \n8 will reduce the healthy food options available in these communities.   \n9 176.  The direct health impacts of the new Regulation will create additional negative \n10 economic consequences because people who are uninsured miss more work, tend to be less \n11 productive when they are working, and are more likely to retire at younger ages because of health \n12 issues and disability.  Among working-age adults, there is a significant correlation between food \n13 insecurity and chronic disease, including conditions that can limit an individual’s ability to work.   \n14 177.  Moreover, Medicaid supports hospitals, health centers, and other community \n15 providers that are critical sources of care for low-income people and the broader community.  By \n16 reducing Medicaid enrollment, these providers will lose a primary source of funding, significantly \n17 increasing the risk that hospitals and other providers will close or offer fewer services.  When \n18 health centers and other community providers close or reduce services, individuals have to rely on \n19 more costly emergency care to address acute medical conditions.  \n20 178.  The impacts of hospital closures and reductions are far-reaching.  They push \n21 providers to leave in their wake, and will affect access to care for all residents of their service \n22 areas, particularly for rural communities, which generally have difficulty attracting health care \n23 providers.   \n24 179.  Hospital closures and cutbacks also harm local economies, as hospitals are major \n25 employers and purchasers of goods and services.  Moreover, communities without hospitals find it \n26 more difficult to attract new industries, companies, and job seekers and thus grow their economies. \n27 180.  The Regulation will also have destabilizing effects on several other critical sectors \n28 of the economy.  For example, the public charge Regulation will disadvantage farmworkers who \n  -46-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 49 of 58\n \n1 are adjusting to lawful permanent resident status, as these low-wage workers will find it difficult \n2 to satisfy the new public charge test.  Farmworker families will disproportionately have a number \n3 of factors negatively weighed against them, including their income, lack of credit history and \n4 health insurance, household-size, lack of education and skills, and lack of English proficiency.  \n5 The Regulation will also chill access to services for farmworkers who seek to apply for or extend \n6 their nonimmigrant H-2A visas, as well as their family members. \n7 181.  The public charge Regulation will also destabilize the health care workforce—a \n8 sector with a sizable immigrant population that relies on access to public programs.  For example, \n9 approximately 24% of direct care workers—comprising home health aides, personal care aides, \n10 and nursing assistants—are foreign-born, and approximately 40% of foreign-born direct care \n11 workers receive public benefits.29  The Regulation will force some workers to choose between \n12 securing benefits and potentially undermining their opportunity to extend or change their \n13 nonimmigrant visas or adjust their status.  Others who would not be subject to the Regulation will \n14 nonetheless refrain from seeking benefits to which they are entitled for fear of potential \n15 consequences.  If these individuals forgo access to benefits, and in particular health care benefits, \n16 they will miss more work days and burden the vulnerable population whom they serve—a \n17 population that consists overwhelmingly of older adults and U.S. citizens.  \n18 182.  The administrative and adjudicative burdens imposed by the new Regulation and \n19 the accompanying paperwork will cause significant delays in access to immigration benefits and \n20 work authorization for all applicants.  These delays will prevent affected individuals from being \n21 able to support themselves and their families.   \n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n                                                 \n27\n29 Robert Espinoza, Immigrants and the Direct Care Force, Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, \nJune 2017, at 4–5, available at https://phinational.org/wp-content/uploads/ \n28\n2017/06/immigrants_and_the_direct_care_workforce_-_phi_-_june_2017.pdf. \n  -47-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 50 of 58\n \n1 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n3 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS CONTRARY TO THE STATUTORY SCHEME \n4 ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS \n5 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n6 183.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n7 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8 184.  The Regulation is a final agency action and subject to judicial review. \n9 185.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “not in accordance with law” or is “in \n10 excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \n11 186.  The Regulation’s definition of “public charge” is contrary to the plain and well-\n12 established meaning of that phrase, and to how it has been interpreted and applied since 1882.  \n13 With knowledge of those interpretations and applications, Congress has repeatedly declined to \n14 change the longstanding definition of “public charge.” \n15 187.  The new public charge definition is an unreasonable interpretation of and contrary \n16 to the meaning of “public charge” in Section 1182.  The Regulation uses the public charge ground \n17 of inadmissibility to penalize the receipt of or likely use of certain public benefits even though \n18 Congress has repeatedly rejected efforts to do precisely that. \n19 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n21 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS OR \n22 OTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n23 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n24 188.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n25 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26 189.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n27 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n28\n  -48-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 51 of 58\n \n1 190.  The Regulation is arbitrary and capricious because it departs from decades of prior \n2 law and practice without adequate explanation.  \n3 191.  The changes in policy are substantive and highly consequential, and they require a \n4 showing that there are good reasons for the new policy, which Defendants have failed to provide.   \n5 192.  Defendants failed to consider all relevant factors and articulate a rational \n6 connection between the facts found and the decisions made.  In fact, Defendants have offered \n7 explanations for their decisions that run counter to the evidence before the agency.   \n8 193.  The Regulation sets forth a number of different factors, some weighted more than \n9 others, to determine whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge.  These weighted \n10 factors are not reasonably related to determining whether an individual is likely to become a \n11 public charge.  Indeed, even under Defendants’ expanded definition of “public charge,” these \n12 various considerations do not predict a likelihood that an individual will receive benefits.    \n13 194.  Defendants failed to consider that the factors are so vague they invite arbitrary or \n14 discriminatory enforcement.  \n15 195.  The Agency ignored or failed to adequately consider important aspects of the \n16 problem, including evidence that the Regulation would cause harm by penalizing the use of \n17 housing, health care, and nutritional assistance benefits. \n18 196.  The Agency failed to adequately consider the harms caused by the chilling effect of \n19 the Regulation. \n20 197.  The Agency failed to adequately consider the racially disparate impact of the \n21 policy. \n22 198.  In addition, although the Regulation provides several purported rationales for the \n23 changes it makes to the public charge inquiry, those purported rationales are arbitrary, irrational, \n24 not supported by the evidence in the record, and a pretext that conceal the true motivation, which \n25 is to dismantle the family-based immigration system and make it more difficult for non-white \n26 immigrants to remain in the United States.  Even on their own terms, the explanations for the \n27 Regulation are arbitrary and capricious.   \n28\n  -49-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 52 of 58\n \n1 199.  Defendants have also failed to adequately address the public comments that were \n2 submitted in response to the proposed Regulation.  \n3 200.  USCIS and DHS were improperly influenced in their rulemaking process by the \n4 political motivations of individuals within the Trump Administration. \n5 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n7 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS OR \n8 OTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n9 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n10 201.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n11 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n12 202.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n13 authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right” or “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n14 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n15 203.  Mr. McAleenan, who promulgated the Regulation, was serving in violation of \n16 DHS’s organic statute and DHS’s regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute at the time of \n17 the Regulation’s issuance.  As a result, the Regulation is not in accordance with law and without \n18 observance of procedure required by law under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n19 FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n20 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n21 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS OR \n22 OTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n23 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n24 204.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n25 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n26 205.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n27 authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right” or “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n28 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n  -50-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 53 of 58\n \n1 206.  Mr. Cuccinelli, who was the Acting Director of USCIS at the time the Regulation \n2 was promulgated and, on information and belief, was involved in the Regulation’s promulgation, \n3 was serving in violation of the FVRA.  As a result, the Regulation is not in accordance with law \n4 and without observance of procedure required by law under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n5 FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6 FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT,  \n7 5 U.S.C. § 3345 ET SEQ., \n8  AND DHS ORGANIC STATUTE,  \n9 6 U.S.C § 113 \n10 207.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n11 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n12 208.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act is the exclusive means for filling offices whose \n13 appointments are required to be made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate \n14 unless a statute provides otherwise.  It also provides that any action taken by an improperly \n15 appointed person has no force or effect.  \n16 209.  The DHS Organic Statute authorizes the Secretary of DHS to promulgate an order \n17 of succession other than that of the FVRA, notwithstanding the FVRA.  See 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1)-\n18 (2). \n19 210.  Since December 2016, DHS has adopted an order of succession different from the \n20 one in the FVRA.  DHS may not disregard its own regulations, including those governing the \n21 order of succession.  See generally United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 \n22 (1954). \n23 211.  Mr. McAleenan was not eligible to be appointed Acting Secretary under 6 U.S.C. \n24 § 113(g) and its implementing regulation.   \n25 212.  Under the FVRA, Mr. McAleenan’s promulgating the Public Charge Regulation \n26 constituted an action, see 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(1); see also id. § 551(13), and the performance of a \n27 “function or duty,” id. § 3348(a)(2). \n28\n  -51-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 54 of 58\n \n1 213.  As an invalid appointee, Mr. McAleenan’s actions have “no force or effect” and \n2 “may not be ratified.”  Id. § 3348(d).   \n3 SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4 FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT,  \n5 5 U.S.C. § 3345 ET SEQ., \n6 214.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n7 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8 215.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act is the exclusive means for filling offices whose \n9 appointments are required to be made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate \n10 unless a statute provides otherwise.  It also provides that any action taken by an improperly \n11 appointed person has no force or effect.  \n12 216.  Mr. Cuccinelli was not eligible to be appointed Acting Director of USCIS under 5 \n13 U.S.C. § 3345(a).  \n14 217.  Under the FVRA, Mr. Cuccinelli’s involvement, on information and belief, in the \n15 process of reviewing, finalizing, and promulgating the Public Charge Regulation constituted an \n16 action, see 5 U.S.C. § 3348(a)(1); see also id. § 551(13), and the performance of a “function or \n17 duty,” id. § 3348(a)(2). \n18 218.  As an invalid appointee, Mr. Cuccinelli’s actions have “no force or effect” and \n19 “may not be ratified.”  Id. § 3348(d).   \n20 SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21 FIFTH AMENDMENT (EQUAL PROTECTION) \n22 THE REGULATION DISCRIMINATES AGAINST NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS \n23 219.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n24 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n25 220.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \n26 invalidates any official action that reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose.  \n27 Classifications based on race, ethnicity, or national origin are subject to strict scrutiny, and even \n28 facially neutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern \n  -52-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 55 of 58\n \n1 unexplainable on grounds other than racial discrimination.  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 \n2 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n3 221.  Defendants acted with improper discriminatory intent and bias against non-white \n4 immigrants in promulgating the Regulation. \n5 222.  Multiple tweets, statements, speeches and other actions by President Trump and his \n6 administration demonstrate racial animus toward non-white immigrants that underlie the \n7 Regulation. \n8 223.  The Regulation is unconstitutional because its promulgation was motivated, at least \n9 in part, because of, and not merely in spite of, its adverse effects on non-white immigrants.  Pers. \n10 Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). \n11 224.  Defendants promulgated the Regulation with full knowledge that it would have a \n12 disproportionate impact on non-white immigrants’ ability to obtain green cards and extend non-\n13 immigrant visas. \n14 225.  The history and sequence of events leading up to the promulgation of the \n15 Regulation were irregular, indicate a predetermined outcome not based on an objective \n16 assessment, and reveal that the Trump Administration’s animus for non-white immigrants drove \n17 the decision to adopt the Regulation. \n18 226.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the implementation of the \n19 unconstitutional Regulation. \n20 EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21 DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT \n22 THE REGULATION IS INVALID BECAUSE IT WAS ISSUED BY AN UNLAWFULLY \n23 APPOINTED AGENCY DIRECTOR \n24 227.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the implementation of the \n25 unconstitutional Regulation. \n26 228.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n27 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n28\n  -53-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 56 of 58\n \n1 229.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. provides that “in a case of \n2 actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . , any court of the United States, upon the filing of an \n3 appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party \n4 seeking such declaration, whether or not such further relief is or could be sought.”  Id. § 2201(a). \n5 The Court has equitable jurisdiction to enjoin “violations of federal law by federal officials,” \n6 Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 (2015); Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. \n7 Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010) (there is an “implied private right of \n8 action directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action under the Appointments \n9 Clause”).  \n10 230.  Mr. McAleenan and Mr. Cuccinelli were appointed in violation of the \n11 Appointments Clause, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and DHS’s Organic Statute.  Plaintiffs \n12 are entitled to a declaration that the Regulation is invalid because both Mr. McAleenan’s \n13 designation as Acting Secretary and Mr. Cuccinelli’s designation as acting head of USCIS \n14 violated federal law and Mr. McAleenan promulgated the Regulation with, on information and \n15 belief, Mr. Cuccinelli’s involvement. \n16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n18 1.  Vacate the Regulation as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not \n19 in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure as required by law, in violation of \n20 the Administrative Procedure Act and the United States Constitution; \n21 2.  Declare the Regulation unconstitutional as violating the equal protection guarantee \n22 of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; \n23 3.  Declare that the Regulation has no force or effect under the Federal Vacancies \n24 Reform Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act; \n25 5.  Enjoin the Department and all its officers, employees and agents from \n26 implementing, applying, or enforcing the Regulation;  \n27\n28\n  -54-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 161   Filed 05/20/20   Page 57 of 58\n \n1 6.  Declare the appointments of Mr. McAleenan as Acting Secretary of DHS and \n2 Defendant Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS invalid under the Appointments Clause, the \n3 DHS Organic Statute, and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act; \n4 7.

ORDER GRANTING IN PART, \n  DENYING IN PART, AND DEFERRING \n10  DONALD J. TRUMP, et al.,  RULING IN PART ON MOTION TO \nDISMISS \n11  Defendants. \nRe: Dkt. No. 166 \n a  12     \ntruin  \noro 13   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Before the court is defendants Donald J. Trump, the Department of Homeland \niD tc 15  Security (“DHS”), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”), Chad Wolf,1 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  and Kenneth Cuccinelli’s (collectively “defendants”) motion to dismiss.  The matter is fully \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  briefed and suitable for decision without oral argument.  Having read the parties’ papers \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good \nN\n19  cause appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  This case involves a challenge to the implementation of the final rule entitled \n22  “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,” published by DHS on August 14, 2019.  See \n23  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“the \n24  Rule”).  On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rulemaking process to create a new \n25  framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed \n26 \n \n27 \n1 Kevin McAleenen was originally named in the complaint, (Dkt. 1, ¶ 48); however, the \nFAC reflects the fact that Chad Wolf has replaced McAleenan as acting Secretary of \n28 \nHomeland Security. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 2 of 38\n \n1  Rulemaking (“NPRM”).  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. \n2  51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018).  The Rule was originally set to become effective on October 15, \n3  2019. \n4  Publication of the Rule resulted in several complaints filed in federal district courts \n5  across the nation.  Three such complaints were filed in the Northern District of California \n6  and related before this court.  Dkt. 24.  The present motion involves one of the three \n7  cases: La Clínica de la Raza, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., Case No. 19-cv-04980-\n8  PJH, wherein the La Clínica De La Raza and California Primary Care Association (the \n9  two together are the “healthcare organizations”), Maternal and Child Health Access, \n10  Farmworker Justice, Council on American Islamic Relations–California, African \n11  Communities Together, Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, Central American \n a  12  Resource Center, and Korean Resource Center (the “legal organizations” and, together \ntruin\noro 13  with the healthcare organizations, the “organizational plaintiffs” or “plaintiffs”) filed a first \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  amended complaint (“FAC”) asserting eight causes of action: (1) Violation of the \niD tc 15  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law; (2) Violation of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; (3) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—\nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Arbitrary and Capricious; (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  (5) Violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., and \nN\n19  DHS Organic Statute, 6 U.S.C. § 113; (6) Violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, \n20  5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.; (7)  Violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (8) Declaratory \n21  Judgment Act—Unlawfully Appointed Agency Director.  Dkt. 161.   \n22  On October 11, 2019, this court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \n23  defendants from applying the Rule to any person residing in the City and County of San \n24  Francisco, Santa Clara County, the States of California, Oregon, or Maine, the \n25  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the District of Columbia.  Dkt. 131 at 92.  Defendants \n26  appealed the preliminary injunction on October 30, 2019.  Dkt. 129.  A three-judge panel \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 3 of 38\n \n1  of the Ninth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction on December 5, 2019.2  Dkt. 141; \n2  see City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 944 F.3d 773 \n3  (9th Cir. 2019).  On February 18, 2020, the Ninth Circuit panel voted to deny plaintiffs-\n4  appellees’ motions for reconsideration and for rehearing en banc.  Dkt. 153.  Other \n5  district courts also issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting enforcement of the Rule, but \n6  these were ultimately stayed by the Supreme Court.  See Dep’t of Homeland Security v. \n7  New York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020); Wolf v. Cook Cty., Illinois, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020).  \n8  Accordingly, the Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020.  Most recently, the district \n9  court for the Southern District of New York enjoined the Rule as long as the government \n10  has declared a public health emergency related to COVID-19.  See New York v. Dep’t of \n11  Homeland Sec., — F. Supp. 3d —, Nos. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD), 19 Civ. 7993 (GBD), 2020 \n a  12  WL 4347264, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2020). \ntruin\noro 13  A broader summary of the relevant statutory framework and the changes \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  implemented by the Rule may be found in the court’s preliminary injunction order.  Dkt. \niD tc 15  131 at 6–10.  To briefly summarize here, DHS promulgated the Rule pursuant to its \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  authority under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., which requires that all noncitizens \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become lawful permanent \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  residents prove they are not inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 1225(a).  A noncitizen may \nN\n19  be deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, including that they are “likely at any \n20  time to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  The statute directs \n21  immigration officials to form an opinion as to whether the applicant “is likely at any time to \n22  become a public charge.”  Id.  In forming that opinion, immigration officers must consider \n23  “at a minimum” five statutorily-defined factors: (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) \n24  assets, resources, and financial status; (5) education and skills.  8 U.S.C. \n25 \n \n26 \n2 The panel consolidated the three related cases before this court with a similar case \nfrom the Eastern District of Washington.  That court issued a nationwide injunction of the \n27 \nRule on the same day as this court’s geographically limited preliminary injunction order.  \nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1224 (E.D. \n28 \nWash. 2019). \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 4 of 38\n \n1  § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The Rule would define the term “public charge” and set out various \n2  criteria for government officials as part of their totality of the circumstances determination. \n3  DISCUSSION \n4  A.  Legal Standard \n5  1.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n6  A federal court may dismiss an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n7  12(b)(1) for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Rule \n8  12(h)(3) similarly provides that a court “must dismiss the action” if it “determines at any \n9  time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  “Federal courts are \n10  courts of limited jurisdiction” and the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction \n11  “rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n a  12  511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citations omitted). \ntruin\noro 13  A jurisdictional challenge may be facial or factual.  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004).  When the attack is facial, the court determines \niD tc 15  whether the allegations contained in the complaint are sufficient on their face to invoke \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  federal jurisdiction.  Id.  Where the attack is factual, however, “the court need not \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations.”  Id. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  When resolving a factual dispute about its federal subject matter jurisdiction, a \nN\n19  court may review extrinsic evidence beyond the complaint without converting a motion to \n20  dismiss into one for summary judgment.  McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 \n21  (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that a court “may review any evidence, such as affidavits and \n22  testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction”); see also \n23  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4 (1947) (“[W]hen a question of the District Court’s \n24  jurisdiction is raised . . . the court may inquire by affidavits or otherwise, into the facts as \n25  they exist.”).  “Once the moving party has converted the motion to dismiss into a factual \n26  motion by presenting affidavits or other evidence properly brought before the court, the \n27  party opposing the motion must furnish affidavits or other evidence necessary to satisfy \n28  its burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 5 of 38\n \n1  1039.   \n2  The Ninth Circuit has noted that “jurisdictional dismissals in cases premised on \n3  federal-question jurisdiction are exceptional, and must satisfy the requirements specified \n4  in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946).”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039 (quoting \n5  Sun Valley Gas., Inc. v. Ernst Enters., 711 F.2d 138, 140 (9th Cir. 1983)).  “In Bell, the \n6  Supreme Court determined that jurisdictional dismissals are warranted ‘where the alleged \n7  claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and \n8  made solely for the purpose of obtaining federal jurisdiction or where such claim is wholly \n9  insubstantial and frivolous.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 327 U.S. at 682–83). \n10  2.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n11  A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests for the \n a  12  legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  Ileto v. Glock Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, \ntruin\noro 13  1199–1200 (9th Cir. 2003).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  a complaint include a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \niD tc 15  entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), a complaint may be dismissed under Rule \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  12(b)(6) if the plaintiff fails to state a cognizable legal theory, or has not alleged sufficient \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  facts to support a cognizable legal theory.  Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 959 (9th \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Cir. 2013). \nN\n19  While the court is to accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint, \n20  legally conclusory statements, not supported by actual factual allegations, need not be \n21  accepted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678–79 (2009).  The complaint must proffer \n22  sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \n23  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 558–59 (2007).   \n24  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \n25  the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \n26  alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court \n27  to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it \n28  has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 6 of 38\n \n1  P. 8(a)(2)).  Where dismissal is warranted, it is generally without prejudice, unless it is \n2  clear the complaint cannot be saved by any amendment.  In re Daou Sys., Inc., 411 F.3d \n3  1006, 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). \n4  Review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, although the court can \n5  also consider documents “whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose \n6  authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the plaintiff’s \n7  pleading.”  Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting In re Silicon \n8  Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir. 1999), superseded by statute on \n9  other grounds as stated in In re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., 865 F.3d 1130 (9th Cir. \n10  2017)); see also Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[A] court can \n11  consider a document on which the complaint relies if the document is central to the \n a  12  plaintiff’s claim, and no party questions the authenticity of the document.” (citation \ntruin\noro 13  omitted)).  The court may also consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  notice (Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688–89 (9th Cir. 2001)), and exhibits \niD tc 15  attached to the complaint (Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989)). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  B.  Analysis \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  1.  Standing \nN\n19  Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, U.S. Const. \n20  art. III, § 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the law ought to be or \n21  affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. \n22  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937).  Article III’s “standing” requirements limit the court’s \n23  subject matter jurisdiction.  Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004) \n24  (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998)).  The \n25  burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the claim.  Renne v. Geary, \n26  501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (citing Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, \n27  546 n.8 (1986)).  “In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must have (1) \n28  suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 7 of 38\n \n1  defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  \n2  California v. Trump, 963 F.3d 926, 935 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n3  504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).  “[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . \n4  allege facts demonstrating’ each element.”  Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n5  (2016) (second alteration in original) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)). \n6  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested, \n7  and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with the manner \n8  and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  E. Bay \n9  Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (“E. Bay Sanctuary I”), 932 F.3d 742, 763–64 (9th Cir. \n10  2018) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  They “need only establish a risk \n11  or threat of injury to satisfy the actual injury requirement.”  Id.; see also Dep’t of \n a  12  Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019) (noting that future injuries to \ntruin\noro 13  states “may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  risk that the harm will occur” (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \niD tc 15  158 (2014))). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Organizations can demonstrate standing in two ways.  First, they can show “that \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the challenged ‘practices have perceptibly impaired [their] ability to provide the services \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  [they were] formed to provide.’”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 765 (alterations in \nN\n19  original) (quoting El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Office of Immigration Review, \n20  959 F.2d 742, 748 (9th Cir. 1991)).  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to \n21  establish organizational standing for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, \n22  independent of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization’s goals and \n23  requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise \n24  would spend in other ways.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n25  Second, organizations can also demonstrate that a government policy “will cause them to \n26  lose a substantial amount of funding.  ‘For standing purposes, a loss of even a small \n27  amount of money is ordinarily an injury.’”  Id. at 766–67 (internal quotation marks omitted) \n28  (quoting Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 137 U.S. 973, 983 (2017)). \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 8 of 38\n \n1  In the preliminary injunction order, the court found that the harm alleged by \n2  plaintiffs was sufficient to create standing.  Dkt. 131 at 85.  The court noted evidence \n3  from both the healthcare organizations and the legal organizations that the Rule would \n4  cause them to either divert resources from their core missions or would frustrate the \n5  purpose of the organization.  Id. at 84–85.  The court also found persuasive evidence that \n6  plaintiffs would have to divert funding because clients who may still be eligible for relief \n7  would require additional time and resources from plaintiffs thereby depleting funds that \n8  would be used elsewhere.  Id. at 85.  Some plaintiffs would have increased operational \n9  costs in order to address the impact of the Rule on their services.  Id.    \n10  In their present motion, defendants assert that plaintiffs have not demonstrated \n11  that they would have suffered some other injury if they had not diverted resources to \n a  12  counteracting the problem caused by the government action.  Mtn. at 6.  More \ntruin\noro 13  specifically, while plaintiffs allege that they have expended or will expend additional \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  resources, defendants contend that plaintiffs have not identified some other injury they \niD tc 15  will suffer if they do not divert resources towards addressing their concerns.  Id.  Plaintiffs \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  argue that they have sufficiently alleged that they have diverted and will divert resources \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to counteract the effects of the Rule.  Opp. at 4.  They also contend that they will face \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  direct financial consequences from the Rule because a decrease in the use of benefits \nN\n19  and plaintiffs’ services will reduce funding streams connected to provision of services.  Id.   \n20  Defendants’ renewed standing argument does not alter this court’s prior findings.  \n21  Defendants cite La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, \n22  624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010), for the proposition that an organization “must . . . \n23  show that it would have suffered some other injury if it had not diverted resources to \n24  counteracting the problem.”  Organizations “cannot manufacture the injury by incurring \n25  litigation costs or simply choosing to spending money fixing a problem that otherwise \n26  would not affect the organization at all.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs have adequately \n27  alleged that the Rule will cause them to divert resources that would otherwise be spent \n28  helping some clients and providing other core services and redirecting those resources to \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 9 of 38\n \n1  help clients who choose to apply for benefits and may be subject to the Rule.  First, \n2  plaintiffs demonstrate that they will be injured by the Rule if they do nothing.  For \n3  example, La Clínica produced evidence that the Rule would increase the organization’s \n4  no-show rate due to a decrease in patients seeking care.  Dkt. 35-5, ¶ 16.  La Clínica \n5  went on to explain that it receives a large portion of its revenue from Medi-Cal such that \n6  disenrollment or non-enrollment in Medi-Cal would negatively affect La Clínica’s revenue.  \n7  This harm is and will continue to occur regardless of whether plaintiffs divert resources to \n8  respond to the Rule.   \n9  Next, in response to the pending loss of resources, plaintiffs demonstrate that they \n10  diverted and will continue to divert resources.  For example, La Clínica presented \n11  evidence that it would have to retrain staff on a new enrollment process in response to \n a  12  the Rule, staff that would otherwise be treating patients.  Id. ¶ 21.  One of plaintiff \ntruin\noro 13  California Primary Care Association’s (“CPCA”)3 members, Asian Health Services, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  presented evidence that at the time of the Rule’s promulgation, it had spent $500,000 \niD tc 15  developing a national education campaign and expected to spend an additional $500,000 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  once the Rule was released.  Dkt. 35-11, ¶¶ 26–29.  This money would have been used \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to advance other community organizing priorities.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have sufficiently \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  demonstrated standing under a diversion of resources theory. \nN\n19  Separately, plaintiffs have also alleged that they will suffer direct financial \n20  consequences as a result of the Rule because the Rule will cause a decrease in the use \n21  of plaintiffs’ services and a corresponding reduction in funding streams connected to \n22  provision of those services.  See FAC ¶¶ 17, 21, 25, 33, 38, 40; Dkt. 35-5, ¶ 18 (La \n23  Clínica’s CEO stating “La Clínica expects to lose a significant amount of funding and \n24 \n \n3 Defendants challenge CPCA’s associational standing on the grounds that CPCA has \n25 \nneither alleged nor provided evidence of associational standing.  Mtn. at 5 n.2.  CPCA is \nan association of various organizations and is bringing suit on behalf of its members.  \n26 \nFAC ¶ 18.  In its prior order, the court determined that La Clínica and CPCA’s member, \nAsian Health Services, had diverted resources such that they had standing.  Dkt. 131 at \n27 \n84.  Other than citing a case for the requirements for associational standing, defendants \nput forward no further argument explaining why the court’s prior finding should not apply \n28 \nhere.   \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 10 of 38\n \n1  revenue if the Rule is implemented”).  As cited above, organizations “can demonstrate \n2  organizational standing by showing that the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial \n3  amount of funding.”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 766–67.  Defendants make no effort \n4  to challenge plaintiffs’ allegations or evidence that plaintiffs will suffer a loss in funding. \n5  Instead, defendants only argue that any loss in funding would be commensurate \n6  with a decrease in the quantity of services provided such that plaintiffs have not suffered \n7  any net financial harm.  Reply at 1–2.  Defendants’ argument contorts the injury-in-fact \n8  requirement beyond what is required by plaintiffs and cite no authority that a plaintiff not \n9  only has to show injury but also a “net” injury.  The Ninth Circuit rejected a similar \n10  argument that a hospice provider could only have standing to challenge a regulation if the \n11  provider suffered a net increase in its overpayment liability.  See L.A. Haven Hospice, \n a  12  Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 657 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Aluminum Co. of Am. v. \ntruin\noro 13  Bonneville Power Admin., 903 F.2d 585, 590 (9th Cir. 1989) (“There is harm in paying \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  rates that may be excessive, no what the California utilities may have saved.”).  Simply \niD tc 15  put, defendants’ argument is not the test for standing.  “[A]n organization that suffers a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  decreased ‘amount of business’ and ‘lost revenue’ due to a government policy ‘easily \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  satisf[ies] the injury in fact standing requirement.’”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 767 \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Constr. Indus. \nN\n19  Ass’n Sonoma Cty. v. City of Petaluma, 522 F.2d 897, 903 (9th Cir. 1975)).  By \n20  demonstrating a reduction in funding, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the Rule has and \n21  will continue to harm them. \n22  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to \n23  standing. \n24  2.  Ripeness \n25  “Ripeness is an Article III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live \n26  cases or controversies and do not ‘issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in \n27  hypothetical cases.’  A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential \n28  component.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty., 863 F.3d 1144, 1153 (9th Cir. 2017) \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 11 of 38\n \n1  (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d \n2  1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc)).   \n3  “For a case to be ripe, it must present issues that are definite and concrete, not \n4  hypothetical or abstract.  Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of \n5  standing because ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”  Id. \n6  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1138–39 \n7  (“Sorting out where standing ends and ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . . [I]n \n8  ‘measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather \n9  than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with \n10  standing.’” (citation omitted)).  Allegations that a “threat” to a “concrete interest is actual \n11  and imminent” are sufficient to allege “an injury in fact that meets the requirements of \n a  12  constitutional ripeness.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe, 863 F.3d at 1154.  Therefore, if plaintiffs \ntruin\noro 13  satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  addressed above, the action here is ripe.  See, e.g., Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 \niD tc 15  (“Whether the question is viewed as one of standing or ripeness, the Constitution \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  mandates that prior to our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  controversy,’ that the issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  abstract.’ . . . We need not delve into the nuances of the distinction between the injury in \nN\n19  fact prong of standing and the constitutional component of ripeness: in this case, the \n20  analysis is the same.” (citations omitted)). \n21  “In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, our analysis is guided by two \n22  overarching considerations: ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n23  hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Id. at 1141 (quoting Abbott \n24  Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. \n25  Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).  When the question presented “is ‘a purely legal one’” that \n26  “constitutes ‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA,” that suggests \n27  the issue is fit for judicial decision.  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. \n28  803, 812 (2003).  However, an issue may not be ripe for review if “further factual \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 12 of 38\n \n1  development would ‘significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues \n2  presented.’”  Id. (quoting Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, \n3  82 (1978)). \n4  In this case, the court has determined that plaintiffs have standing, therefore, it \n5  follows that the case is constitutionally ripe for adjudication.  See Thomas, 220 F.3d at \n6  1139.  The court has not previously addressed prudential ripeness.  Defendants contend \n7  that plaintiffs’ claims fail the prudential ripeness standard because the claims are \n8  premised on speculation about the Rule’s operation in practice and further factual \n9  development is required.  Mtn. at 7–8.  Plaintiffs assert that the prudential ripeness \n10  standard is met because the Rule is final and they are suffering injuries.  Opp. at 4.   \n11  “Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires [a \n a  12  court] to evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to \ntruin\noro 13  the parties of withholding court consideration.”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  (citing Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).  When considering whether issues are fit for \niD tc 15  review, the question should be a “purely legal one” and the agency action in question \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  should constitute a “‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA.”  Id. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  812 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  The second factor examines “the hardship to the parties of withholding court \nN\n19  consideration.”  Id. at 808.  Generally, a showing of hardship requires demonstrating that \n20  the regulation in question creates “adverse effects of a strictly legal kind.”  Id. at 809 \n21  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998)).  Such \n22  adverse effects do not arise if the regulation in question “do[es] not command anyone to \n23  do anything or to refrain from doing anything; [it] do[es] not grant, withhold, or modify any \n24  formal legal license, power, or authority; [it] do[es] not subject anyone to any civil or \n25  criminal liability; [and it] create[s] no legal rights or obligations.”  Id. (alterations in original) \n26  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 733).   \n27  Here, the challenge to the Rule in this case “is a purely legal one,” i.e., whether the \n28  INA was properly construed and implemented by DHS.  See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 13 of 38\n \n1  149 (noting that “whether the statute was properly construed by the Commissioner” to be \n2  a purely legal challenge).  Next, the Rule constitutes a “rule” as defined by the APA.  See \n3  5 U.S.C. § 551(4), (13) (defining “agency action” and “rule”).  The text of the Rule \n4  confirms that its promulgation was an agency action.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 (“This \n5  rule changes how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interprets and \n6  implements the public charge ground of inadmissibility.”).  This factor indicates the Rule \n7  is ripe for review. \n8  With respect to hardship, the Rule imposes potential adverse effects of a strictly \n9  legal kind.  If an alien falls within the Rule’s definition of a public charge as determined by \n10  an immigration officer, then he or she is inadmissible.  In other words, the Rule defines a \n11  legal right—admissibility to the United States.  Concurrently, it also defines the legal \n a  12  powers and authorities of federal government officials in evaluating whether an alien is \ntruin\noro 13  admissible.  The Rule does not define the legal rights of plaintiffs or create any legal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  obligations directly impacting them.  However, the potential adverse effects on individuals \niD tc 15  cause a direct harm to plaintiffs, as discussed above with regard to plaintiffs’ standing.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  For example, fewer individuals using plaintiffs’ services results in a corresponding \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  reduction in funding to plaintiffs. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are all premised on speculation about the \nN\n19  potential future effects of the Rule and disagreement with DHS’s predictions based on \n20  available evidence.  Mtn. at 7–8.  The Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020 after \n21  the Supreme Court stayed the final remaining preliminary injunction enjoining the Rule.  \n22  Plaintiffs’ FAC was filed May 20, 2020.  Thus, they have had a period of approximately \n23  three months to assess the impact of the Rule.  The FAC alleges current harms \n24  stemming from the Rule.  For example, plaintiff Farmworker Justice (“FJ”) alleges that \n25  “[b]eginning in March 2020, FJ has been addressing concerns that farmworkers have \n26  about the implications of the public charge Regulation when seeking to take action to \n27  prevent or treat COVID-19.”  FAC ¶ 31.  Plaintiff Maternal and Child Health Access \n28  (“MCHA”) alleges the “Regulation is frustrating MCHA’s mission by reducing access to \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 14 of 38\n \n1  nutrition, medical care, and adequate housing.  Immigrant families who MCHA serves are \n2  already disenrolling from public benefit programs, such as SNAP and Medicaid, based on \n3  fears that using those programs will affect their future immigration relief options.”  Id. ¶ 27 \n4  (emphasis added). \n5  Plaintiffs’ challenge is not speculative and further factual development of the \n6  Rule’s impact is not needed for purposes of ripeness.  Accordingly, the court DENIES \n7  defendants’ motion with respect to ripeness. \n8  3.  Zone of Interests \n9  In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of \n10  the statute that forms the basis of their challenge.  The zone of interests analysis asks \n11  “whether Congress created a private cause of action in legislation,” Organized Vill. of \n a  12  Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), such that “this \ntruin\noro 13  particular class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute,” Lexmark \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014).  It is “not a \niD tc 15  question of Article III standing” and “this inquiry . . . ‘does not implicate subject-matter \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  jurisdiction . . . .’”  Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964 (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  128 & n.4).  “[I]n the APA context, . . . the [zone of interests] test is not ‘especially \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  demanding.’”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130 (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of \nN\n19  Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225–26 (2012)). \n20  “Whether a plaintiff’s interest is ‘arguably . . . protected . . . by the statute’ within \n21  the meaning of the zone-of-interests test is to be determined not by reference to the \n22  overall purpose of the Act in question[,] . . . but by reference to the particular provision of \n23  law upon which the plaintiff relies.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997) (first \n24  and second alterations in original) (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. \n25  Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)).  Put differently, “the plaintiff must establish that the \n26  injury he complains of . . . falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected by the \n27  statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.”  Id. at 176 \n28  (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990); and \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 15 of 38\n \n1  citing Air Courier Conf. v. Postal Workers, 498 U.S. 517, 523–24 (1991); see also E. Bay \n2  Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 n.9 (“‘[W]e are not limited to considering the [specific] \n3  statute under which [plaintiffs] sued, but may consider any provision that helps us to \n4  understand Congress’[s] overall purposes in the [INA].’” (alterations in original) (quoting \n5  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 401 (1987))).  “[F]or APA challenges, a plaintiff \n6  can satisfy the test in either one of two ways: (1) ‘if it is among those [who] Congress \n7  expressly or directly indicated were the intended beneficiaries of a statute,’ or (2) ‘if it is a \n8  suitable challenger to enforce the statute—that is, if its interests are sufficiently congruent \n9  with those of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not more likely to frustrate \n10  than to further . . . statutory objectives.’”  California, 963 F.3d at 941–42 (second and third \n11  alterations in original) (quoting Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Dep’t of Def., 87 \n a  12  F.3d 1356, 1359 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). \ntruin\noro 13  i.  APA Zone of Interests \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In the preliminary injunction order, this court determined that the organizational \niD tc 15  plaintiffs did not fall within the zone of interests for three reasons.  First, the court \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  reasoned that simply being negatively affected by the Rule does not establish that the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  organizational plaintiffs fell within the INA’s zone of interest.  Dkt. 131 at 71.  Second, the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  organizational plaintiffs’ briefing failed to identify or explain what statutory provisions \nN\n19  supported their argument.  When plaintiffs later identified a statutory section at the \n20  hearing, 8 U.S.C. § 1611, they did not demonstrate how that section had any integral \n21  relationship with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) or explain how § 1611 was related to the \n22  organizational plaintiffs’ role.  Id. at 71–72.  Third, the court explained that the \n23  organizational plaintiffs “simply fail[ed] to explain how their interests related to \n24  § 1182(a)(4)’s purpose of excluding immigrants likely to become public charges.  Id. at \n25  72.   \n26  Defendants argue that the court should now dismiss plaintiffs’ claims because they \n27  do not fall within the zone of interests of the INA.  Mtn. at 8.  In particular, they argue that \n28  the INA’s zone of interest extends to aliens improperly determined to be inadmissible, not \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 16 of 38\n \n1  organizations seeking to assist those aliens.  Id. at 8–9.  In response, plaintiffs advance \n2  three reasons why they fall within the zone of interest of the INA.  First, one set of \n3  interests implicated by the public charge provision is to accurately identify which \n4  immigrants are likely to become a public charge and deny them admission.  Opp. at 7.  \n5  Plaintiffs allege that several of the legal organization plaintiffs represent individuals who \n6  fit their description.  Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 33–37, 39–40, 42–43).  Second, a second set of \n7  interests implicated by the public charge provision concerns the health and economic \n8  status of immigrants who are granted admission to the United States.  Id. at 9.  Plaintiffs \n9  allege that their missions, either in whole or in part, is to protect and improve the health \n10  and economic status of immigrant communities and they help immigrants avoid becoming \n11  public charges.  Id.  Third, the Rule itself presupposes impact on and the involvement of \n a  12  the organizational plaintiffs.  Id. at 9–10.   \ntruin\noro 13  The court begins with the three appellate opinions discussing the Rule.4  The Ninth \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Circuit’s opinion staying this court’s preliminary injunction noted that the organizational \niD tc 15  plaintiffs were not parties to the appeal and did not express any opinion on zone of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  interests more generally.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 784 n.7 & 786 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  n.8.  In its order affirming a preliminary injunction staying the Rule, the Seventh Circuit \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  succinctly framed the zone of interest issue concerning an immigrant aid organization \nN\n19  plaintiff: \n \n20  we accept that [the aid organization] helps immigrants navigate \nthe  INA’s various  requirements,  including  the public-charge \n21  rule, and it has an interest in ensuring that immigrants are not \nimproperly denied adjustment of status or removed from the \n22  country because of confusion over DHS’s Rule.  But the link \n23 \n \n4 The Fourth Circuit recently issued an opinion reversing a preliminary injunction \n24 \nenjoining the Rule.  Casa de Md., Inc. v. Trump, No. 19-2222, (4th Cir. Aug. 5, 2020).  \nThe court found that the organization plaintiff in that case did not have standing and, \n25 \ntherefore, did not address the zone of interests test.  The Fourth Circuit’s holding with \nregard to standing does not compel a different result here.  There, the court reasoned \n26 \nthat the organization’s voluntary “budgetary choice[]” like spending money on legal action \nis not a cognizable Article III injury.  Slip. op. at 23.  Here, plaintiffs have demonstrated \n27 \nloss in revenue due to disenrollment or non-utilization of services for which they are \nreimbursed.  In other words, because plaintiffs are harmed regardless of their voluntary \n28 \nbudgetary choices, they have standing. \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 17 of 38\n \nbetween these injuries and the purpose of the public-charge \n1  part of the statute is more attenuated, and thus it is harder to \nsay that the injury [the organization] has asserted meets the \n2  “zone-of-interests” test. \n3  Cook Cty., Illinois v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 221 (7th Cir. 2020).  The court declined to \n4  resolve the organization’s status since only one plaintiff was required to demonstrate it \n5  fell within the zone of interests and a different plaintiff, Cook County, met that criteria.  Id. \n6  at 220.  Most recently, the Second Circuit, in an opinion affirming a preliminary injunction \n7  enjoining the Rule, held that aid organizations were within the zone of interests.  New \n8  York v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., — F.3d —, Nos. 19-3591, 19-3595, 2020 WL 4457951, \n9  at *12 (2d Cir. Aug. 4, 2020).  The court reasoned that the organizations’  \n \n10  interests stem from their assorted missions to increase non-\ncitizen well-being and status, which they express in their work \n11  to  provide  legal  and  social  services  to  non-citizens.    An \noverbroad interpretation of the public charge ground, tipping \n a  12  the balance too far in the direction of exclusion at the expense \ntruin of admission in the interest of family unity and economic vitality, \noCrof 13  imperils both these interests.   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Id.   \niD tc 15  As an initial observation, the INA’s public charge provision does not directly \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  regulate the conduct of or benefit plaintiffs.  The observation is not dispositive because in \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  East Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit noted that aid organizations’ purpose in aiding \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  immigrants seeking asylum was consistent with the INA’s purpose to establish the \nN\n19  statutory procedure for granting asylum to refugees.  932 F.3d at 768.  In support of that \n20  statement, the court cited statutory sections in which “Congress took steps to ensure that \n21  pro bono legal services of the type that the [aid organizations] provide are available to \n22  asylum seekers.”  Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A)–(B)).  The court also cited other \n23  statutory provisions in the INA which “give institutions like the [aid organizations] a role in \n24  helping immigrants navigate the immigration process.”  Id. (citing, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n25  § 1101(i)(1)).  While plaintiffs here do not cite a mandate similar to § 1158(d)(4), they cite \n26  the same sections as in East Bay Sanctuary I as evidence of Congress’s intent that \n27  organizations have a role in helping immigrants navigate the immigration process. \n28  Unlike the preliminary injunction briefing and hearing, plaintiffs have now identified \n17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 18 of 38\n \n1  statutory provisions that bring them within the zone of interest.  Notably, the public charge \n2  provision excludes from its ambit any person who “is an applicant for, or is granted, \n3  nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(U).  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E)(ii).  In turn, \n4  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U) cross references § 1184(p) and § 1184(p)(3)(A) requires the \n5  Attorney General and other government officials, where appropriate, to refer potential U \n6  visa applicants to nongovernmental organizations.  Similarly, the public charge provision \n7  excludes persons who are “a qualified alien described in section 1641(c).”  8 U.S.C. \n8  § 1182(a)(4)(E)(iii).  In turn, 8 U.S.C. § 1641(c)(4) includes “an alien who has been \n9  granted nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T)” and § 1101(i)(1) requires “the \n10  Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and other Government officials, \n11  where appropriate, [to] provide the alien with a referral to a nongovernmental \n a  12  organization” for nonimmigrant aliens described in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(i).  Thus, \ntruin\noro 13  “[t]hese statutes, which directly rely on institutions like [plaintiffs] to aid immigrants, are a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  sufficient ‘indicator that the plaintiff[s] [are] peculiarly suitable challenger[s] of \niD tc 15  administrative neglect . . . support[ing] an inference that Congress would have intended \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  eligibility’ to bring suit.”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 769 (third through seventh \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  alterations in original) (quoting Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA, 861 F.2d \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). \nN\n19  Moreover, the injury that plaintiffs complain of is within the zone of interests.  \n20  Plaintiffs allege they have been harmed and will be harmed by a decrease in utilization of \n21  their services by aliens who are or believe they are subject to the Rule.  As discussed, \n22  the public charge provision references other statutory sections that require, where \n23  appropriate, government officials to refer aliens to nongovernmental organizations.   \n24  Additionally, plaintiffs can show they are suitable challengers if their “interests are \n25  sufficiently congruent with those of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not \n26  more likely to frustrate than to further . . . statutory objectives.”  California, 963 F.3d at \n27  942.  “The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to \n28  or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 19 of 38\n \n1  assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.”  Id. (internal quotation marks \n2  omitted) (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225).  In considering this \n3  prong of the zone of interests test, the court finds persuasive the Second Circuit’s opinion \n4  that determined the organizations there were among “‘those who in practice can be \n5  expected to police the interests that the statute protects[,]’ namely, the admission of non-\n6  citizens who will be self-sufficient and the exclusion of those who will not.”  New York, \n7  2020 WL 4457951, at *12 (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. Defs. of N.Y., Inc. v. Fed. \n8  Bureau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 2020); and citing Bank of Am. Corp. v. City \n9  of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1304 (2017)). \n10  Defendants quote an in chambers opinion issued by Justice O’Connor that \n11  determined that aid organizations were outside the zone of interests of the Immigration \n a  12  Reform and Control Act of 1986 (“IRCA”).  I.N.S. v. Legalization Assistance Proj. of L.A. \ntruin\noro 13  Cty. Fed’n of Labor, 510 U.S. 1301, 1302, 1305 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers).  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Justice O’Connor wrote “IRCA was clearly meant to protect the interests of \niD tc 15  undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations such as respondents.”  Id. at \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  1305.  Other district courts have distinguished this statement on the grounds that Justice \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  O’Connor’s opinion was non-precedential and predates the Court’s opinions in Match-E-\ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Be-Nash-She-Wish Band and Lexmark.  Cook Cty., Illinois v. McAleenan, 417 F. Supp. \nN\n19  3d 1008, 1021 (N.D. Ill. 2019); see Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coal. v. Trump, — F. \n20  Supp. 3d —, No. CV 19-2117 (TJK), 2020 WL 3542481, at *11 (D.D.C. June 30, 2020) \n21  (same).  While these reasons might be valid, more persuasive is the fact that Legalization \n22  Assistance Project dealt with IRCA, 8 U.S.C. § 1255a, and not the public charge \n23  provision.  As discussed above, the public charge provision incorporates other statutory \n24  sections providing for referrals by government officials to nongovernmental organizations \n25  thereby implicating their interests.  Legalization Assistance Project also reasoned “[t]he \n26  fact that the INS regulation may affect the way an organization allocates its resources . . . \n27  does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests the statute \n28  meant to protect.”  510 U.S. at 1305 (citation omitted).  Here, the injury is not just \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 20 of 38\n \n1  diversion of resources but also a loss of resources tied to decreased utilization of \n2  plaintiffs’ services.  This factual difference is such that, even if Legalization Assistance \n3  Project were precedential, it would not apply in this case. \n4  In sum, plaintiffs have put forward a more convincing argument than the one \n5  advanced at the preliminary injunction stage.  Critically, the Supreme Court “has \n6  repeatedly emphasized that the zone of interests test is ‘not especially demanding’ in the \n7  APA context.”  California, 963 F.3d at 941 (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130).  \n8  Accordingly, the court cannot say as a matter of law that plaintiffs fall outside the zone of \n9  interests with regard to their APA claims. \n10  ii.  Whether Zone of Interests Applies to Constitutional Claims \n11  Next, defendants contend that plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims fail the zone of \n a  12  interests test because the Supreme Court has suggested that there is a heightened zone \ntruin\noro 13  of interests requirement for implied causes of action such as plaintiffs’ constitutional \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  claim.  Mtn. at 8 n.2.  Yet, in the very case that defendants cite for this proposition, Clarke \niD tc 15  v. Securities Industry Association, 479 U.S. at 396, 400 n.16, the Court cautioned that \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “[w]hile inquiries into reviewability or prudential standing in other [non-APA] contexts may \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  bear some resemblance to a ‘zone of interest’ inquiry under the APA, it is not a test of \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  universal application.”  The Court went on to distinguish earlier dicta suggesting a zone of \nN\n19  interest inquiry was applicable to constitutional claims, stating “[w]e doubt, however, that \n20  it is possible to formulate a single inquiry that governs all statutory and constitutional \n21  claims.”  Id. (citing Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, \n22  153 (1970)).  As plaintiffs point out, the Ninth Circuit has also questioned whether a zone \n23  of interests test can be applied in light of the Court’s decision in Lexmark, which focused \n24  on Congress’s intent in creating statutory causes of action as opposed to causes of \n25  action that arise under the Constitution.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670, 701–02 \n26  (9th Cir. 2019) (“[W]e doubt that any zone of interests test applies to Plaintiffs’ equitable \n27  cause of action.”).  Accordingly, the court declines to apply a zone of interest test to \n28  plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.   \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 21 of 38\n \n1  In sum, the zone of interests test is not “especially demanding,” Lexmark, 572 U.S. \n2  at 130, and, “at the very least, the [states’] interests are ‘marginally related to’ and \n3  ‘arguably within’ the scope of the statute.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 \n4  F.3d 1242, 1270 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band, 520 U.S. at \n5  175–76).  The court, therefore, DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to zone of \n6  interests. \n7  4.  First and Second Claims—Contrary to Law and Arbitrary and \n8  Capricious \n9  Turning to defendants’ motion with regard to the individual claims, the court \n10  addresses plaintiffs’ first and second claims together as they present a related issue.  In \n11  its preliminary injunction order, the court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed \n a  12  on the merits of their claim that the Rule was not in accordance with the INA.  Dkt. 131 at \ntruin\noro 13  48.  After a lengthy review of the prior legislative, regulatory, and judicial history of the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  term “public charge,” the court determined that DHS’s interpretation of the term “public \niD tc 15  charge” was not reasonable at Chevron step two.  In its order staying the injunction, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Ninth Circuit determined that, at Chevron step one, the term “public charge” is not a term \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  of art and not self-defining—thus, it was ambiguous.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  F.3d at 792.  At step two, the court also reviewed the lengthy legislative history and case \nN\n19  law surrounding the term “public charge” and concluded that there has not been “one \n20  fixed understanding of ‘public charge’ that has endured since 1882.”  Id. at 796.  Instead, \n21  “[i]f anything has been consistent, it is the idea that a totality-of-the-circumstances test \n22  governs public-charge determinations.  But different factors have been weighted more or \n23  less heavily at different times, reflecting changes in the way in which we provide \n24  assistance to the needy.”  Id. In resolving the step two analysis, the Ninth Circuit \n25  determined that the Rule was a reasonable interpretation of the INA.  Id. at 799.   \n26  Also in its prior order, this court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on \n27  the merits that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider costs \n28  and benefits, including costs to state governments and health effects on state \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 22 of 38\n \n1  populations.  Dkt. 131 at 53.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit motions panel discussed both \n2  the cost-benefit issue and the public health effect issue.  With regard to the former, the \n3  court observed that DHS “addressed at length the costs and benefits associated with the \n4  Final Rule.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 801.  With respect to public health \n5  effects, the Ninth Circuit noted that “DHS not only addressed these concerns directly, it \n6  changed its Final Rule in response to the comments.”  Id.  The court determined that \n7  DHS could change its policy as long as DHS acknowledged the change and explained \n8  the reasons for it.  Id. at 805.  In sum, the court held that DHS demonstrated that it was \n9  likely to succeed on the merits of the arbitrary and capricious claim. \n10  As discussed more thoroughly in this court’s order in State of California, et al., v. \n11  U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., No. 19-cv-04975-PJH, Dkt. 180, the \n a  12  procedural posture of this case presents several issues.  For example, applying the \ntruin\noro 13  motions panel’s opinion would require the court to determine the extent to which the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  opinion is binding (or persuasive) as to each of plaintiffs’ claims that defendants now \niD tc 15  seek to dismiss.  Further, because the court has deferred ruling on defendants’ motion to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  dismiss in the related case, it is therefore appropriate to follow a similar course of action \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  here as plaintiffs’ substantive claims largely overlap with the related case. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Accordingly, the court DEFERS RULING ON defendants’ motion to dismiss \nN\n19  plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action until the Ninth Circuit issues an opinion on the \n20  preliminary injunction or otherwise disposes of the case. \n21  5.  Third, Fifth & Eighth Claims—McAleenan’s Appointment \n22  Plaintiffs’ third claim alleges that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because then \n23  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security McAleenan was serving in that role in violation of \n24  DHS’s organic statute and the APA.  FAC ¶ 203.  Similarly, plaintiffs’ fifth claim alleges \n25  that McAleenan was not lawfully appointed under the FVRA and DHS’s organic statute.  \n26  Id. ¶¶ 211–13.  Plaintiffs’ eighth claim alleges that McAleenan’s appointment violates the \n27  Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and DHS’s organic statute and, therefore, seek relief \n28  under the Declaratory Judgment Act.  Id. ¶ 230. \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 23 of 38\n \n1  Defendants argue that McAleenan was lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary \n2  because, after enactment of the FVRA, Congress permitted DHS to set its order of \n3  succession.  Mtn. at 17.  On April 9, 2019, then Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen established a \n4  new succession order that placed the Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) Commissioner \n5  third in the line of succession.  Id. at 18.  McAleenan was CBP Commissioner at the time, \n6  the positions above him were vacant, and, therefore, he was lawfully appointed.  Id.  \n7  Plaintiffs respond that then Secretary Nielsen’s amended order of succession only \n8  applied when the Secretary is “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n9  emergency.”  Opp. at 18.  Instead, plaintiffs contend that relevant DHS order required \n10  that, following the resignation of the Secretary, Executive Order 13753 governed the \n11  order of succession and provided an order of succession different than Nielsen’s order.  \n a  12  Id.  Under Executive Order 13753, McAleenan was seventh, not third, in line and there \ntruin\noro 13  were two Senate-confirmed appointees in front of him.  Id.  Defendants reply that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Secretary Nielsen’s order expressly “designate[d] the order of succession for the \niD tc 15  Secretary of Homeland Security[.]”  Reply at 14.  This order clearly defined the order of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  succession and controls over any previous version of the order of succession.  Id.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Resolving this issue requires examination of the FVRA, DHS’s organic statute, and \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the orders issued pursuant to the organic statute.  “Congress broadly designated the \nN\n19  [FVRA] to be the ‘exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform \n20  the functions and duties of any’ Executive office that would otherwise require Senate \n21  confirmation.”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 F.3d \n22  1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)).  “But there is an \n23  ‘unless’—Congress crafted exceptions to that exclusivity.”  Id.  DHS’s organic statute has \n24  two such exceptions that apply notwithstanding the FVRA.  First, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1) \n25  requires the Under Secretary for Management to serve as Acting Secretary if the \n26  Secretary or Deputy Secretary is unavailable to perform the duties of Secretary.  Second, \n27  § 113(g)(2) permits the Secretary to “designate such other officers of the Department in \n28  further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”   \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 24 of 38\n \n1  In December 2016, then Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson issued an \n2  order of succession, entitled DHS Delegation No. 00106, that stated in relevant part: \n \n3  II. Succession Order/Delegation \n \n4  A.  In  case  of  the  Secretary’s  death,  resignation,  or \ninability  to  perform  the  functions  of  the  Office,  the  orderly \n5  succession of officials is governed by Executive Order 13753, \namended on December 9, 2016. \n6   \nB.  I  hereby  delegate  to  the  officials  occupying  the \n7  identified positions in the order listed (Annex A), my authority \nto exercise the powers and perform the functions and duties of \n8  my office, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, in the \nevent I am unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n9  emergency. \n10  Dkt. 167-1, at 2.5  On April 9, 2019, Secretary Nielsen signed an order that approved an \n11  amendment to Delegation No. 00106.  That amendment invoked 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) \n a  12  and stated: “I hereby designate the order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland \ntruin\noro 13  Security as follows: Annex A of DHS Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby amended by striking the text of \niD tc 15  such Annex in its entirety and inserting the following in lieu thereof: . . . .”  Dkt. 166-3, at \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  3.  The amendment then listed the order of succession with the CBP Commissioner third \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  in line.  Id.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Thus far, the parties are in general agreement about the relevant authorities and \nN\n19  documents.  Where they depart is the effect of the April 9th order.  Defendants argue that \n20  the amendment designated the order of succession in all cases, regardless of whether it \n21  involved section II, subparagraph A of Delegation No. 00106 (i.e., in case of the \n22  Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office), or \n23  subparagraph B (i.e., when the Secretary is unavailable to act during a disaster or \n24 \n \n25 \n5 Plaintiffs attach a copy of Delegation No. 00106, dated as of April 10, 2019, to their \nopposition.  Additionally, defendants attach a copy of Secretary Nielsen’s order amending \n26 \nDelegation No. 00106 to their motion.  Dkt. 166-3.  While neither document was attached \nto the pleading, the court can consider documents “whose contents are alleged in a \n27 \ncomplaint and whose authenticity no party questions . . . .”  Knievel, 393 F.3d at 1076.  \nThe FAC references both documents and neither party challenges the authenticity of the \n28 \ndocuments in question.  FAC ¶¶ 149–50. \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 25 of 38\n \n1  catastrophic emergency).  In support of their argument, defendants quote the text of the \n2  April 9th order: “I hereby designate the order of succession for the Secretary of \n3  Homeland Security as follows . . . .”  Mtn. at 18; Reply at 14 (“Secretary Nielsen’s order, \n4  in no uncertain terms, expressly ‘designate[d] the order of succession for the Secretary of \n5  Homeland Security[.]’”).  This is an instance where the omitted material, signified by the \n6  ellipses in defendants’ motion and the bracket in their reply, is critical to understanding \n7  what exactly Secretary Nielsen ordered.  The order states, “I hereby designate the order \n8  of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security as follows:”  Dkt. 166-3 at 3 \n9  (emphasis added).  Here is what followed: “Annex A of DHS Orders of Succession and \n10  Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby \n11  amended by striking the text of such Annex in its entirety and inserting the following in \n a  12  lieu thereof: Annex A.  Order for Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of the \ntruin\noro 13  Department of Homeland Security.”  Id.  The order of succession is then laid out in the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  amended Annex A.  In other words, the April 9th order only replaced Annex A and made \niD tc 15  no other changes to Delegation No. 00106.  Thus, when Secretary Nielsen resigned “the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  orderly succession of officials [was] governed by Executive Order 13753, amended on \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  December 9, 2016,” but not the amended Annex A, which only applied when the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Secretary was unavailable due to disaster or catastrophic emergency.  Dkt. 167-1. \nN\n19  Had Secretary Nielsen intended to modify the order of succession applicable in \n20  case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the \n21  Office, then her order could have so stated.  In fact, plaintiffs cite a later amendment of \n22  Delegation No. 00106 by Acting Secretary McAleenan, which stated “Section II.A of DHS \n23  Delegation No. 00106, DHS Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for \n24  Named Positions, is amended hereby to state as follows: ‘In case of the Secretary’s \n25  death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office, the order of \n26  succession of officials is governed by Annex A.’”  Dkt. 167-2 at 2 (emphasis added).  The \n27  fact that McAleenan amended Delegation No. 00106 to modify section II.A to cross-\n28  reference Annex A but Nielsen did not, reinforces the conclusion that at the time of \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 26 of 38\n \n1  Nielsen’s resignation, Executive Order 13753 governed the order of succession. \n2  In turn, Executive Order 13753, amended December 9, 2016, provided: \n \n3  Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the \nofficers named in subsection (a) of this section, in the order \n4  listed, shall act as, and perform the functions and duties of the \noffice of, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), if \n5  they are eligible to act as Secretary under the provisions of the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 5 U.S.C. 3345 et seq. \n6  (Vacancies Act), during any period in which the Secretary has \ndied, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform the \n7  functions and duties of the office of Secretary. \n8  81 Fed. Reg. 90,667, 90,667.  The Executive Order then lists the order of succession and \n9  the CBP Commissioner is seventh in line.  Id.  Plaintiffs allege that, at the time of \n10  McAleenan’s elevation to Acting Secretary, the roles of both the Under Secretary for \n11  National Protection and Programs and the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis \n a  12  were filled by Senate-confirmed appointees such that McAleenan’s appointment was \ntruin\noro 13  invalid and any action by him was ultra vires.  FAC ¶¶ 152–53.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  This is not the end of the inquiry, however.  As quoted above, subsection (a) is \niD tc 15  “[s]ubject to the provisions of subsection (b).”  81 Fed. Reg. at 90,667.  Subsection (b) \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the President retains discretion, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to the extent permitted by the Vacancies Act, to depart from this order in designating an \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  acting Secretary.”  Id. at 90,668.  Thus, as long as McAleenan’s appointment was \nN\n19  permitted by the FVRA, the President had the discretion to appoint him as Acting \n20  Secretary.  Plaintiffs do not allege that McAleenan failed to meet one of the three options \n21  provided by the FVRA for the temporary appointment of officers.  See Guedes, 920 F.3d \n22  at 11 (discussing the three options).  Accordingly, the President had discretion to appoint \n23  McAleenan as Acting Secretary regardless of the order of succession outlined in \n24  subsection (a) of Executive Order 13753. \n25  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third, fifth, and \n26  eighth (pertaining to McAleenan) causes of action is GRANTED.   \n27  6.  Fourth, Sixth & Eighth Claims—Cuccinelli’s Appointment \n28  Plaintiffs’ fourth claim alleges that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 27 of 38\n \n1  then Acting Director of USCIS Cuccinelli was serving in that role in violation of the FVRA \n2  and the APA.  FAC ¶ 206.  Their sixth claim alleges that Cuccinelli was not eligible to be \n3  appointed as Acting Director of USCIS under the FVRA and, therefore, his actions have \n4  no force or effect.  Id. ¶¶ 216–18.  Plaintiffs’ eighth claim alleges that Cuccinelli’s \n5  appointment violates the Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and DHS’s organic statute \n6  and, therefore, seek relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act. \n7  Defendants argue that both claims against Cuccinelli should be dismissed \n8  because the Rule was promulgated under the authority and signature of Acting Secretary \n9  McAleenan and not Cuccinelli.  Mtn. at 18.  Plaintiffs respond that they allege that \n10  Cuccinelli’s pre-promulgation involvement likely entailed taking FVRA-defined action.  \n11  Opp. at 19.  They also argue that because Cuccinelli’s appointment violated FVRA, his \n a  12  substantial involvement in the promulgation of the Rule renders it not in accordance with \ntruin\noro 13  law.  Id. at 20.  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Plaintiffs advance two separate theories regarding Cuccinelli’s appointment.  Both \niD tc 15  theories advance from the same predicate, Cuccinelli’s appointment violated section \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  3345 of the FVRA.  The first theory is that because of the predicate FVRA violation, the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Rule was arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  The second theory is that because of \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the predicate violation, the Rule is rendered void by a separate FVRA provision.   \nN\n19  Under the APA, “an agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” must be \n20  held “unlawful and set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  “The FVRA renders any action taken in \n21  violation of the statute void ab initio: section 3348(d) declares that ‘[a]n action taken by \n22  any person who is not acting [in compliance with the FVRA] shall have no force or effect’ \n23  and ‘may not be ratified.’”  SW Gen., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 796 F.3d 67, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n24  (alterations in original) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1)–(2)).  Assuming for the sake of \n25  argument that plaintiffs are correct regarding their predicate FVRA violation,—i.e., \n26  Cuccinelli’s appointment violated FVRA—it does not follow that he took an action that can \n27  be remedied under either the APA or the FVRA. \n28  Title 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a) prescribes the powers and duties of the Secretary of \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 28 of 38\n \n1  Homeland Security including charging him or her “with the administration and \n2  enforcement” of immigration laws and establishing regulation as he or she deems \n3  necessary for carrying out his or her authority under the provisions of the INA.  8 U.S.C. \n4  § 1103(a)(1), (3).  Pursuant to that authority, DHS issued both the NPRM and the Rule.  \n5  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,116; 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295 (“DHS’s authority for making public \n6  charge inadmissibility determinations and related decisions is found in several statutory \n7  provisions.”).  The Rule was issued pursuant to then Acting Secretary McAleenan’s \n8  authority, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295–96, and under his signature, id. at 41,508.  The NPRM \n9  was issued pursuant to then Secretary Nielsen’s authority, 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,124, and \n10  signature, id. at 51,296.  Plaintiffs challenge the promulgation of that Rule, which was not \n11  issued pursuant to Cuccinelli’s authority (or even under USCIS’s authority).  For that \n a  12  reason, this case is unlike the only district court that determined Cuccinelli to be \ntruin\noro 13  unlawfully appointed and, as a remedy, set aside asylum directives there were issued by \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Cuccinelli.  L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. Supp. 3d 1, 11, 37 (D.D.C. 2020).  Even if \niD tc 15  plaintiffs were able to demonstrate that Cuccinelli was unlawfully appointed, they cannot \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  state a claim for violation under the FVRA or the APA with regard to promulgation of the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Rule.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ fourth, sixth, \nN\n19  and eighth (pertaining to Cuccinelli) causes of action is GRANTED.  Because the Rule \n20  was promulgated under the acting DHS Secretary’s authority, no additional factual \n21  allegations could state a claim and further amendment of these claims would be futile. \n22  7.  Seventh Claim—Equal Protection \n23  Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ seventh claim for violation of the Equal \n24  Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The Equal Protection Clause of the \n25  Fourteenth Amendment commands that no state shall “deny to any person within its \n26  jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, which amounts \n27  to a direction that all persons who are similarly situated should be treated alike.  City of \n28  Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The equal protection \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 29 of 38\n \n1  component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause imposes a similar obligation \n2  on the federal government.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499–500 (1954); see \n3  also I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 886 (1988) (considering “the possibility of a \n4  violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process \n5  Clause”). \n6  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims should be dismissed \n7  because the Rule is facially neutral, and plaintiffs cannot establish discriminatory intent.  \n8  Mtn. at 19.  Defendants contend that the court should apply a narrow standard of review, \n9  as required by Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2418 (2018), because this case implicates the \n10  Executive Branch’s authority over the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals.  Mtn. \n11  at 20.  According to defendants, the FAC contains no allegations suggesting that the Rule \n a  12  is not at least plausibly related to DHS’s stated objectives.  Id.  Defendants also contend \ntruin\noro 13  that the public statements by government officials upon which plaintiffs rely were not \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  made by DHS officials and have no express connection to the Rule.  Id. at 21. \niD tc 15  Plaintiffs respond that they have alleged sufficient facts to plausibly demonstrate \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  defendants acted with a discriminatory purpose.  Opp. at 21.  These allegations include: \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the Rule will bear more heavily on non-white immigrants, which DHS acknowledged in \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the Rule, (id.); statements by administration officials indicate that the Administration was \nN\n19  motivated in part by racial animus (id. at 22–23); and the sequence of events leading to \n20  the promulgation of the Rule indicate a substantive departure from the normal decision-\n21  making process, (id. at 23).  Plaintiffs next argue that Trump v. Hawaii is not applicable \n22  where, as here, DHS’s regulated activity applies to people already residing in the United \n23  States and national security concerns are not present.  Id. at 23–24.  \n24  In its order on defendants’ motion to dismiss in California, et al. v. Department of \n25  Homeland Security, et al., No. 19-cv-4975-PJH, Dkt. 180, the court discussed at length \n26  the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding initial entry cases and whether plaintiffs in \n27  that case could state a claim for an Equal Protection violation.  Rather than recapitulate \n28  that discussion in its entirety, the court summarizes a few main points.  To begin, the \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 30 of 38\n \n1  Court has long recognized that Congress’s power concerning the initial entry of aliens \n2  into the country is plenary.  See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (“This Court has \n3  repeatedly emphasized that ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of \n4  Congress more complete than it is over’ the admission of aliens.” (quoting Oceanic \n5  Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)).  However, once an alien arrives \n6  in the United States and begins establishing ties to the country, the Court has recognized \n7  certain constitutional protections extend to those persons, even if their presence is \n8  “unlawful, involuntary, or transitory.”  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (“There \n9  are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States.  The Fifth \n10  Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these persons \n11  from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” (citations \n a  12  omitted)).  It is therefore necessary to distinguish whether a government action involves \ntruin\noro 13  an initial entry into the United States or whether an alien has begun to establish ties with \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the United States such that his or her constitutional status changes accordingly.  See \niD tc 15  Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Trump v. Hawaii is best viewed as an initial entry case where Congress’s power is \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  at its height.  In that case, the Supreme Court examined an Equal Protection challenge to \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  an executive order issued by the President that restricted entry into the United States by \nN\n19  foreign nationals of select countries, nearly all majority-Muslim countries.  Hawaii, 138 S. \n20  Ct. at 2403–04.  The Court considered but ultimately did not apply the highly deferential \n21  standard of review articulated in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 756–57 (1972), \n22  noting that stating “Mandel’s narrow standard of review ‘has particular force’ in admission \n23  and immigration cases that overlap with ‘the area of national security.’”  Hawaii, 138 S. \n24  Ct. at 2419 (quoting Kerry v. Din, 576 U.S. 86, 104 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  \n25  Instead, the Court applied rational basis review and upheld the proclamation on those \n26  grounds.  Id. at 2420–21. \n27  Similar to Hawaii, the Rule applies to immigrants and nonimmigrants seeking initial \n28  admission to the United States.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295.  Unlike Hawaii, it also applies to \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 31 of 38\n \n1  aliens who are already physically present in the United States and seeking adjustment of \n2  status.  Id.  Because the Rules applies in part to aliens who are already in the United \n3  States, defendants cannot entirely rely on cases based on Congress’s plenary power \n4  over initial entry cases to uphold the Rule.  Moreover, aliens who are physically present \n5  in the United States can state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection component of \n6  the Fifth Amendment.  See Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 970–73 (9th \n7  Cir. 2004); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982) (“Indeed, we have clearly \n8  held that the Fifth Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful \n9  from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government.” (citing Mathews, 426 U.S. at \n10  77)). \n11  In Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, \n a  12  writing for a plurality with regard to an Equal Protection challenge to the Administration’s \ntruin\noro 13  revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, Chief Justice \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Roberts stated that “[t]o plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible inference that an \niD tc 15  ‘invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor’ in the relevant decision.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Possible evidence includes disparate impact on a particular group, ‘[d]epartures from the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  normal procedural sequence,’ and ‘contemporary statements by members of the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  decisionmaking body.’”  140 S. Ct. at 1915 (second alteration in original) (quoting \nN\n19  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68).  At no point did the plurality cite or apply Hawaii’s \n20  deferential standard of review.  This indicates that application of the Arlington Heights \n21  framework is appropriate to evaluate whether plaintiffs plead discriminatory animus.  \n22  Because this court has likewise determined that Trump v. Hawaii (and the plenary power \n23  doctrine more generally) does not apply to the Rule in its entirety, similar to Regents, it is \n24  appropriate to apply Arlington Heights to plaintiffs’ claim. \n25  Defendants cite a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) opinion for the proposition \n26  that “[i]t is a well established fact that an applicant for adjustment of status under Section \n27  245 of the Act is in the same posture as though he were an applicant before an American \n28  consular officer abroad seeking issuance of an immigrant visa for the purpose of gaining \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 32 of 38\n \n1  admission to the United States as a lawfully permanent resident.”  Reply at 17 (quoting \n2  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I.&N. Dec. 583, 589 (B.I.A. Feb. 28, 1974)).  The BIA’s opinion \n3  could be construed as stating that Congress’s plenary power applies even if an individual \n4  is inside the United States because an adjustment of status is formally the same as an \n5  overseas application for admission.   \n6  A few points are worth considering with regard to Matter of Harutunian.  First, the \n7  BIA did not cite a case for its proposition, which makes evaluating its statement of the law \n8  difficult.  Second, the statement appears to conflict with the proposition that “[a]liens, \n9  even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as \n10  ‘persons’ guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  \n11  Plyler, 457 U.S. at 210 (citations omitted).  Even assuming the BIA’s statement is true, \n a  12  the court is persuaded by the Court’s plurality opinion in Regents which did not apply \ntruin\noro 13  Hawaii to the DACA program, a program applicable to persons who were physically \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  present in the United States but otherwise had no lawful status under the immigration \niD tc 15  laws.  See Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1901. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “Under Arlington Heights, a plaintiff must ‘simply produce direct or circumstantial \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely that [sic] not motivated \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the defendant and that the defendant’s actions adversely affected the plaintiff in some \nN\n19  way.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504 (9th Cir. 2016) \n20  (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of Newport \n21  Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1158 (9th Cir. 2013)); see also Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  “A \n22  plaintiff does not have to prove that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of \n23  the challenged action, but only that it was a ‘motivating factor.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., (quoting \n24  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (9th Cir. 2015)).  While Arlington Heights describes \n25  an evidentiary framework rather than a pleading standard, the Ninth Circuit has used its \n26  factors in evaluating a district court’s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).6  \n27 \n \n6 While not directly applicable to Equal Protection claims, the Supreme Court and the \n28 \nNinth Circuit have held that, for employment discrimination cases, the McDonnell \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 33 of 38\n \n1  See id.   \n2  In Arlington Heights, the Court described a series of non-exhaustive factors that \n3  guides the inquiry into whether a defendant’s actions were motivated by a discriminatory \n4  purpose “by examining (1) statistics demonstrating a ‘clear pattern unexplainable on \n5  grounds other than’ discriminatory ones, (2) ‘[t]he historical background of the decision,’ \n6  (3) ‘[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,’ (4) the \n7  defendant’s departures from its normal procedures or substantive conclusions, and (5) \n8  relevant ‘legislative or administrative history.’”  Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1158–59 \n9  (alterations in original) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68; and citing Comm. \n10  Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, 703 (9th Cir. 2009)); \n11  see also Avenue 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 504 (applying Arlington Heights factors to an \n a  12  Equal Protection claim dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)). \ntruin\noro 13  i.  Disparate Impact \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Here, plaintiffs allege that the Rule’s “negatively weighted factors \niD tc 15  disproportionately and detrimentally affect communities of color.”  FAC ¶ 120.  The \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  complaint also cites the Rule, where DHS stated that it “recognizes that it is possible that \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the inclusion of benefits such as SNAP and Medicaid may impact in greater numbers \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  communities of color, including Latinos and [Asian-American, Pacific Islanders], as well \nN\n19  as those with particular medical conditions that require public benefits for treatment, and \n20  therefore may impact the overall composition of immigration with respect to these \n21  groups.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,369.  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Rule will \n22  impact certain racial groups more heavily than others. \n23 \n \n24 \nDouglas evidentiary framework is a useful touchstone to evaluate whether a claim \nsurvives a motion to dismiss; however, a plaintiff “is not required to plead a prima facie \n25 \ncase of discrimination in order to survive a motion to dismiss.”  Sheppard v. David Evans \n& Assoc., 694 F.3d 1045, 1050 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 \n26 \nU.S. 506, 508–11 (2002)).  Similar to McDonnell Douglas, the Arlington Heights \nframework is an evidentiary burden-shifting regime.  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion only requires \n27 \nplaintiffs to meet the requirements of Rule 8 and Twombly/Iqbal.  See Kwai Fun Wong, \n373 F.3d at 968 (applying Swierkiewicz to Equal Protection claim that immigration \n28 \nofficials discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her race). \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 34 of 38\n \n1  However, the court notes that the plurality opinion in Regents found that the \n2  disparate impact of the DACA rescission on Latinos was not sufficient to state a claim.  \n3  Writing for himself and three other justices, Chief Justice Roberts stated “because \n4  Latinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien population, one would expect \n5  them to make up an outsized share of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief \n6  program. . . . Were this fact sufficient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable \n7  immigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds.”  Regents, 140 S. \n8  Ct. at 1915.  This reasoning is persuasive and the Rule’s disparate impact, while notable, \n9  is not dispositive. \n10  ii.  Statements by Decisionmakers \n11  Next, plaintiffs cite evidence of potential bias exemplified by actions and \n a  12  statements of the President and his advisors.  With regard to the administration generally, \ntruin\noro 13  plaintiffs cite numerous immigration-related executive actions that they characterize as \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  either exclusively or disproportionately harming immigrants from non-white majority \niD tc 15  nations.  These actions include separating young children from their parents at the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  southern U.S. border, ending DACA and temporary protected status for El Salvador, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Sudan, and Nicaragua, and excluding nationals from majority-\ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Muslim countries.  FAC ¶ 124.  With respect to the President, plaintiffs allege that, as a \nN\n19  candidate, the President ran a campaign replete with racist aspersions about people of \n20  Mexican descent and Muslim faith.  Id. ¶ 125.  After his inauguration, the President stated \n21  that Haitians “all have AIDS,” that America should not be a haven for “people from \n22  shithole countries,” and that he preferred immigrants coming from places like Norway.  Id.  \n23  They also allege that on July 14, 2019, the President claimed that four congresswomen \n24  of color “originally came from countries whose government are a complete and total \n25  catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world . . .” and asked \n26  “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from \n27  which they came . . . .”  Id. ¶ 129 (second alteration in original). \n28  With respect to administration officials, plaintiffs allege that other senior \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 35 of 38\n \n1  administration officials made statements indicative of racial bias.  They cite statements at \n2  a press conference by then Acting Director of USCIS Cuccinelli who said that “President \n3  Trump has once again delivered on his promise” regarding immigration.  Id. ¶ 133.  When \n4  asked about how the Rule would target Latinos, Cuccinelli stated “if we had been having \n5  this conversation 100 years ago, it would’ve applied to more Italians.”  Id.  Cuccinelli also \n6  “rewrote” the words to Emma Lazarus’s sonnet on the Statue of Liberty “Give me your \n7  tired and your poor” by adding “who can stand on their own two feet and who will not \n8  become a public charge.”  Id. ¶ 134.  Cuccinelli explained that the poem was referring \n9  back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies.  Id.  Plaintiffs \n10  also cite a statement by the prior acting director of Immigration and Customs \n11  Enforcement Mark Morgan who said of unaccompanied children in detention centers, \n a  12  “I’ve looked at them and I’ve looked at their eyes . . . and I’ve said that is a soon-to-be \ntruin\noro 13  MS-13 gang member.  It’s unequivocal.”  Id. ¶ 137 (alteration in original). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916, Chief Justice Roberts’ plurality opinion found the \niD tc 15  President’s statements to be “unilluminating” and instead noted that “relevant actors were \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  most directly [the] Acting Secretary [of Homeland Security] and the Attorney General.”  \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  The opinion stated that “respondents did not ‘identif[y] statements by [either] that would \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  give rise to an inference of discriminatory motive.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (citation \nN\n19  omitted).  Next, Chief Justice Roberts found the President’s statements were “remote in \n20  time and made in unrelated contexts” and did not “qualify as ‘contemporary statements’ \n21  probative of the decision at issue.”  Id. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268).  \n22  While a plurality opinion, this reasoning suggests that the President’s statements, which \n23  have no direct connection to the Rule are not relevant to the Equal Protection analysis.   \n24  Applying here, plaintiffs allege both pre- and post-inauguration statements by the \n25  President.  The pre-inauguration statements, FAC ¶ 125, are similar to those in Regents \n26  that are more remote in time and not applicable to the agency action at issue.  The post-\n27  inaugurations statements pertain to the same time period as the beginning of the \n28  rulemaking process but are not connected to the Rule.  With regard to statements by \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 36 of 38\n \n1  other administration officials, plaintiffs cite statements by Cuccinelli that were made at a \n2  press conference discussing the Rule.  As discussed above, Cuccinelli was appointed \n3  two months before DHS promulgated the Rule and plaintiffs have not alleged Cuccinelli \n4  was involved in the rulemaking process.  Even assuming his statements plausibly \n5  demonstrate discriminatory intent, plaintiffs have not alleged he was a relevant actor in \n6  the rulemaking process.  This reasoning also applies to the statement by acting director \n7  Morgan, who has no apparent connection to the Rule.  Finally, plaintiffs’ citation of \n8  various executive actions is similar to their disparate impact argument.  It may be true \n9  that this administration’s action falls more heavily on immigrants and non-immigrants \n10  from non-White, non-European countries, but disparate impact by itself is insufficient to \n11  state a claim for an Equal Protection violation. \n a  12  In sum, plaintiffs have identified a few statements made in unrelated contexts by \ntruin\noro 13  the President and comments from a DHS official who is not alleged to have any \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  connection to the rulemaking process, other than defending it after it was promulgated.  \niD tc 15  They have not alleged sufficient factual matter concerning statements by decisionmakers. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  iii.  Departure from Normal Procedures \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Plaintiffs also contend that the Rule departed from normal procedures as \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  evidenced by the efforts of White House advisor Stephen Miller’s comments to fast-track \nN\n19  the Rule to completion.  Id. ¶ 131 (“[T]he timing on public charge is unacceptable . . . I \n20  don’t care what you need to do to finish it on time.”); see also id. ¶ 132.  Plaintiffs’ \n21  allegations barely raise an inference of an improper departure from the norm.  Cf. \n22  Regents, 908 F.3d at 519 (“DACA received reaffirmation by the agency as recently as \n23  three months before the rescission, only to be hurriedly cast aside on what seems to \n24  have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality).  This strange about-face, done at \n25  lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration within the agency was \n26  bypassed.”).  Plaintiffs’ allegations that the Rule was fast tracked do not raise an \n27  inference of discriminatory intent.  This rulemaking process was not a 3-month about-\n28  face; the NPRM began a year before the final Rule was published, received hundreds of \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 37 of 38\n \n1  thousands of comments, which prompted some changes to the Rule.  At most, they \n2  plausibly allege that defendants wanted to implement the Rule sooner rather than later. \n3  In light of the foregoing, plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient factual matter to state \n4  a claim for an Equal Protection violation.  The court GRANTS defendants’ motion to \n5  dismiss plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action.  Because plaintiffs could allege additional factual \n6  matter, the dismissal is with leave to amend.7 \n7  8.  Whether the President is a Proper Defendant \n8  Defendants also argue that the court should dismiss the President as a defendant \n9  because plaintiffs lack an express or implied equitable cause of action to sue the \n10  President.  Mtn. at 22.  Plaintiffs respond that courts routinely issue relief enjoining the \n11  official actions of a sitting President.  Opp. at 24.   \n a  12  Generally, courts lack “jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the \ntruin\noro 13  performance of his official duties.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802–03 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  (1992) (plurality opinion) (quoting Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall. ) 475, 501 \niD tc 15  (1866)).  In narrow circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that the President might \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  be subject to a judicial injunction.  For example, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  (1974), held that the President may be subject to a subpoena to provide information \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution.  Plaintiffs have not cited a specific case that \nN\n19  would authorize the court to depart from the general rule against enjoining the President. \n20  It does not follow, however, that the court should therefore dismiss the President \n21  as a defendant.  Franklin noted that “the President’s actions may still be reviewed for \n22  constitutionality,” though not under the APA because the President is not an “agency” for \n23  purposes of the APA.  505 U.S. at 800–01 (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. \n24  Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935)).  \n25 \n \n26 \n7 Other district courts have found that plaintiffs in those cases have alleged sufficient \nfactual allegations to state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection component of the \n27 \nFifth Amendment.  See New York, 2020 WL 4347264, at *6; Cook Cty., Ill., 2020 WL \n2542155, at *3–5.  These other cases suggest that plaintiffs could allege additional facts \n28 \nsuch that amendment of their complaint is not futile. \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 177   Filed 08/07/20   Page 38 of 38\n \n1  At this stage, the court declines to decide whether the President should be dismissed.  \n2  Defendants have not presented authority for the proposition that the President should \n3  dismissed from this action, as opposed to enjoined from taking a specific action.  At the \n4  same time, plaintiffs have not cited any authority authorizing the court to enjoin the \n5  President, assuming they are able to state a claim outside of the APA.  See also id. at \n6  828 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (“Review of the legality \n7  of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the officers \n8  who attempt to enforce the President’s directive . . . .” (citations omitted)).  Because this \n9  order dismisses all non-APA claims against defendants, the court need not opine further \n10  on this issue. \n11  CONCLUSION \n a  12  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss with \ntruin\noro 13  respect to their standing, ripeness, and zone of interest challenges.  Defendants’ motion \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to dismiss plaintiffs’ third through sixth and eighth causes of action for violation of the \niD tc 15  APA, FVRA, and Declaratory Judgment Act is GRANTED, and the claims are \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  DISMISSED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND; and defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  seventh cause of action for violation of the Fifth Amendment is GRANTED, and the claim \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  is DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.  Further, the court DEFERS RULING ON \nN\n19  defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action.8  Plaintiffs will \n20  be permitted to file an amended complaint after resolution of the deferred claims. \n21    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n22  Dated: August 7, 2020 \n23  /s/ Phyllis J. Hamilton   \nPHYLLIS J. HAMILTON \n24  United States District Judge \n25 \n26 \n \n8 On April 1, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs’ motion to compel \n27 \ndiscovery.  Dkt. 157.  The court also stayed discovery “until resolution of defendants’ \nforthcoming motion to dismiss.”  Id. at 31.  Because this order defers ruling on two of \n28 \nplaintiffs’ claims, the court’s prior stay order remains in effect. \n38 ",

Each of the plaintiffs in those actions moved for preliminary injunctive relief.  The \n27  motions came on for hearing before this court on October 2, 2019.   \n28  Plaintiff the City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) appeared through \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 2 of 93\n \n1  its counsel, Matthew Goldberg, Sara Eisenberg, and Yvonne Mere.  Plaintiff the County \n2  of Santa Clara (“Santa Clara” and together with San Francisco, the “Counties”) appeared \n3  through its counsel, Ravi Rajendra, Laura Trice, and Luke Edwards.  Plaintiffs the State \n4  of California, District of Columbia, State of Maine, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and \n5  State of Oregon (together, including D.C., the “States”) appeared through their counsel, \n6  Anna Rich, Lisa Cisneros, and Brenda Ayon Verduzco.  Plaintiffs La Clinica De La Raza \n7  and California Primary Care Association (the two together are the “Healthcare \n8  Organizations”), Maternal and Child Health Access, Farmworker Justice, Council on \n9  American Islamic Relations-California, African Communities Together, Legal Aid Society \n10  of San Mateo County, Central American Resource Center, and Korean Resource Center \n11  (the “Legal Organizations”) (the Legal Organizations and the Healthcare Organizations \n  12  together are the “Organizations”) appeared through their counsel, Alvaro Huerta, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Nicholas Espiritu, Joanna Cuevas Ingram, Kevin Herrera, Tanya Broder, Max Wolsen, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and Mayra Joachin. \niD tc 15  Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), Department of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Homeland Security (“DHS”), Kevin McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS, Kenneth T. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS, and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  States appeared through their counsel, Ethan Davis, Eric Soskin, and Kuntal Cholera. \nN\n19  Additionally, papers submitted by numerous amici curiae were before the court.  \n20  Prior to the hearing, the court granted motions to file amicus briefs on behalf of the \n21  following non-parties, all of which the court considered in its analysis:  American Public \n22  Health Association, et al.; Asian Americans Advancing Justice, et al.; City of Los Angeles, \n23  et al.; Justice in Aging, et al.; and Members of Congress.  A number of other requests to \n24  file amici briefs were denied due to the court’s insufficient time to consider them on this \n25  particular motion, given the already-voluminous filings from the parties, the briefing \n26  schedule, and the time-sensitive nature of plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief. \n27  Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their \n28  arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 3 of 93\n \n1  GRANTS CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS’ MOTIONS AND ISSUES A PRELIMINARILY \n2  INJUNCTION, the scope of which is discussed below, for the following reasons. \n3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n4    In 1883, Emma Lazarus penned the now-famous sonnet, The New Colossus.  \n5  Later affixed to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, the poem has been \n6  incorporated into the national consciousness as a representation of the country’s promise \n7  to would-be immigrants: \n \n8 \nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame, \n9  With conquering limbs astride from land to land; \nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand \n10 \nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame \n11  Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name \nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand \n  12 \ntru ain Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command \noro 13  The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. \nCf\n tila  \ncC\nirts fo 14  \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she \niD tc 15  With silent lips. \"Give me your tired, your poor, \n sir\net Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, \ns\ntaiD 16 \nt The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. \nS \nn\n dre 17  Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, \ne\nh\ntinrt I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" \nUo 18 \nN\n19  But whether one would prefer to see America’s borders opened wide and \n20  welcoming, or closed because the nation is full, laws—not poetry—govern who may \n21  enter.  And the year before Lazarus wrote The New Colossus, Congress had enacted its \n22  first comprehensive immigration law, barring entry to “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any \n23  person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge,” \n24  among others.  An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2. (1882).  \n25  Although various iterations of similar laws have since come and gone (the operative \n26  statute no longer refers to “lunatics” or “idiots”), since the very first immigration law in \n27  1882, this country has consistently excluded those who are likely to become a “public \n28  charge.” \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 4 of 93\n \n1  Although Congress has never authored an explicit definition of the term, courts \n2  and the executive branch have been considering its meaning as used in the statute for \n3  over one hundred and twenty years.  As interpretations from those two branches \n4  accreted toward a consistent understanding, Congress repeatedly enacted statutes \n5  adopting the identical phrase. \n6  In 1999, the executive branch reviewed its historical application of the term and \n7  issued formal guidance to executive employees, explaining that the public charge \n8  determination has historically, and should continue to, focus on whether an individual is \n9  primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. \n10  In 2018, DHS published a new rule (scheduled to take effect October 15, 2019) \n11  that proposed to dramatically expand the definition of “public charge.”  Rather than \n  12  include only those who primarily depend on the government for subsistence, DHS now \n a\ntruin\noro 13  proposes for the first time to categorize as a public charge every person who receives 12 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  months of public benefits (including many in-kind benefits, like Medicaid and SNAP/Food \niD tc 15  Stamps) over any 36-month period, regardless of how valuable those benefits are, or \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  how much they cost the government to provide (receiving two types of benefits in one \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  month would count as receiving benefits for two months).   \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Today, the court is presented with a challenge to DHS’s new definition.  The \nN\n19  plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from implementing it before this court can consider \n20  this case on the merits.  The plaintiffs argue that the new definition will lead to \n21  widespread disenrollment1 from public benefits by those who fear being labeled a public \n22  charge (and by those confused that they may be swept up in the rule), which will cause \n23  plaintiffs to lose a substantial amount funding (for example, the federal government \n24  heavily subsidizes state expenses for those enrolled in Medicaid). \n25  The court finds that the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits, for numerous \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n1 When plaintiffs refer to harms caused by those who will disenroll from public benefits in \naddition to those who will forego enrollment.  This order considers the two categories \n28 \ntogether, and refers to them interchangeably. \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 5 of 93\n \n1  reasons.  DHS’s new definition of “public charge” is likely to be outside the bounds of a \n2  reasonable interpretation of the statute.  Moreover, plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their \n3  entirely independent arguments that defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously during \n4  the legally-required process to implement the changes they propose.  Because plaintiffs \n5  are likely to prevail and will be irreparably harmed if defendants are permitted to \n6  implement the rule as planned on October 15, this court will enjoin implementation of the \n7  rule in the plaintiff states until this case is resolved on the merits, as discussed in more \n8  detail below. \n9  BACKGROUND \n10  In each of the actions before the court, the plaintiffs challenge and seek to \n11  preliminarily enjoin implementation of a proposed rule entitled “Inadmissibility on Public \n  12  Charge Grounds,” proposed by DHS and published in the Federal Register on August 14, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  2019.  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (August 14, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  2019) (“the Rule”).  The Rule is scheduled to take effect nationwide on October 15, 2019. \niD tc 15  A.  The Three Actions \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, San Francisco and Santa Clara (together, the “Counties”) \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  filed a complaint naming as defendants USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of \nN\n19  DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS.  The complaint asserts two causes of \n20  action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”):  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n21  § 706(2)(A)—Not in Accordance with Law; and (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n22  § 706(2)(A)—Arbitrary, Capricious, and Abuse of Discretion.  The Counties filed the \n23  present motion for preliminary injunction on August 28, 2019. \n24  In State of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Case No. 19-cv-\n25  04975-PJH, the States filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties:  \n26  USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director \n27  of USCIS.  The complaint asserts six causes of action:  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n28  § 706—Contrary to Law, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Illegal Immigration \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 6 of 93\n \n1  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary \n2  to Law, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the \n3  “Rehabilitation Act”); (3) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, State \n4  Healthcare Discretion; (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; \n5  (5) Violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause requiring Equal Protection \n6  based on race; (6) Violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause, based on a \n7  violation of Equal Protection principles based on unconstitutional animus.  The States \n8  filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on August 26, 2019.  On August 27, \n9  2019, this court ordered the action brought by the States related to the action brought by \n10  the Counties.   \n11  In La Clinica De La Raza v. Trump, Case No. 19-cv-04980-PJH, the Organizations \n  12  filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties, and also added Donald J. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Trump:  USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Director of USCIS; and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States.  The \niD tc 15  complaint asserts four causes of action:  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  to the Statutory Scheme; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary, Capricious, or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  otherwise not in accordance with law; (3) Violation of the Fifth Amendment based on \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Equal Protection for discriminating against non-white immigrants; (4) under the \nN\n19  Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking a determination that the Rule is invalid because it \n20  was issued by an unlawfully-appointed agency director.  On August 30, 2019, this court \n21  ordered the action brought by the Organizations related to the action brought by the \n22  Counties.  The Organizations filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on \n23  September 4, 2019.   \n24  B.  The Dispute \n25  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq. (“INA”), requires \n26  that all noncitizens seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become \n27  lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”) prove they are not inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. § 1361; 8 \n28  U.S.C. § 1225(a).  A noncitizen may be deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 7 of 93\n \n1  including that they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. \n2  § 1182(a)(4)(A).   \n3  The specific INA provision relating to whether an alien is likely to become a “public \n4  charge” at issue in this litigation provides, in relevant part:   \n \n5  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are \ninadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to \n6  receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States:   \n. . . .  \n7  (4) Public charge \n \n8  (A) In general \n \n9  Any  alien  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the  consular \nofficer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n10  the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of \napplication for admission or adjustment of status, \n11  is likely at any time to become a public charge is \ninadmissible. \n a  12   \ntruin (B) Factors to be taken into account \noCrof 13   \n tila (i)  In  determining  whether  an  alien  is \ncC\nirts fo 14  icnoandsmuliassr ibolfefi ceurn doer r ththei sA tptoarrnaegyr aGphe,n ethrael  \niD s tcir 15  shall at a minimum consider the alien’s— \net (I) age; \ns\ntaiD 16  (II) health; \nt\nS \nn (III) family status; \n dere 17  (IV) assets, resources, and \nh\nt\ninrt financial status; and \nUoN 18  (V) education and skills. \n \n19  (ii) In addition to the factors under clause \n(i),  the  consular  officer  or  the  Attorney \n20  General may also consider any affidavit of \nsupport under section 1183a[2] of this title \n21  for  purposes  of  exclusion  under  this \nparagraph. \n22   \n23  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4). \n24  The statute directs a “consular officer” or “the Attorney General” to form an opinion \n25  as to whether the applicant “is likely at any time to become a public charge.”  Id.  In \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n2 Section 1183a is titled “Requirements for sponsor’s affidavit of support” and sets forth \nthe requirements of an “affidavit of support . . . to establish that an alien is not excludable \n28 \nas a public charge under section 1182(a)(4) of this title[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1). \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 8 of 93\n \n1  forming that opinion, immigration officers must consider “at a minimum” five statutorily-\n2  defined factors:  (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and financial \n3  status; (5) education and skills.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).   \n4  An officer may additionally consider an affidavit of support, which is a legally-\n5  enforceable contract between the sponsor of the applicant and the Federal Government.  \n6  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a).  The sponsor pledges to accept \n7  financial responsibility for the applicant and to maintain the applicant at an income of “not \n8  less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the period in which the affidavit is \n9  enforceable[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A).   \n10  Certain groups of noncitizens, such as asylum seekers and refugees, are not \n11  subject to exclusion based on an assessment that they are likely to become a public \n  12  charge.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1157 (refugee); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c) \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (refugee). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  An alien found to be inadmissible as a public charge may “be admitted in the \niD tc 15  discretion of the Attorney General . . . upon the giving of a suitable and proper bond or \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  undertaking approved by the Attorney General, in such amount and containing such \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  conditions as he may prescribe . . . holding the United States and all States . . . harmless \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  against such alien becoming a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1183. \nN\n19  The public charge ground may arise when, inter alia, an alien seeks LPR status, or \n20  when noncitizens apply for visas.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).  Aliens “to \n21  whom a permit to enter the United States has been issued to enter the United States” are \n22  also subject to an inadmissibility determination by DHS at ports of entry when they enter \n23  and re-enter the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1185(d).   \n24  Immigrants with LPR status may also be subject to the public charge analysis.  For \n25  example, an LPR is considered to be “seeking admission” under various circumstances, \n26  for example when returning to the United States after being “absent from the United \n27  States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days” or after engaging in any “illegal \n28  activity after having departed the United States[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)–(iii).  \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 9 of 93\n \n1  LPRs can also be denied citizenship and/or placed in removal proceedings if DHS \n2  determines retrospectively that they were inadmissible as a public charge at the time of \n3  their adjustment.  8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A); 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,328 & n.176 (discussing \n4  possible impact on naturalizations). \n5  Under a separate provision in the INA, an alien can be deported upon a \n6  determination that he has in fact become a public charge since his admission, from \n7  causes “not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry[.]”  8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5).3 \n8  On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rule-making process to create a new \n9  framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed \n10  Rulemaking.  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. \n11  10, 2018) (the notice of proposed rulemaking is the “NPRM”).  The NPRM provided a 60-\n  12  day public comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected.  See 84 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Fed. Reg. at 41,297.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Register.  Id. at 41,292.  It is set to become effective on October 15, 2019.  On October 2, \niD tc 15  2019—the morning of the hearing on the pending motions for preliminary injunction—\n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  DHS published a 25-page list of “corrections” to the proposed final rule.4  See Case No. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  19-cv-04717-PJH, Dkt. 106, Ex. A.  DHS stated that its October 2 amendments to the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  rule would not delay its planned implementation on October 15. \nN\n19  The Rule sets out what the parties have referred to as the “12/36 standard.”  That \n20  is, the Rule “redefines the term ‘public charge’ to mean an alien who receives one or \n21  more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\n22 \n                                            \n23 \n3 Confusingly, DHS’s Rule would use completely distinct definitions for the term “public \ncharge” when assessing whether an alien “has become a public charge” (8 U.S.C. \n24 \n1227(a)(5)) and whether an alien “is likely at any time to become a public charge” (8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(A). \n25 \n4 Although defendants described the changes as fixes to “technical and typographical \n26 \nerrors” (Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, Dkt. 106, Ex. A at 2), the States argued at the \nhearing that upon their limited review of the corrections (a review that was necessarily \n27 \nlimited given the eleventh-hour disclosure of DHS’s changes to the rule), the \namendments mooted at least one issue underlying the States’ motion, regarding \n28 \ntreatment of military families. \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 10 of 93\n \n1  month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two \n2  months).  This Rule defines the term ‘public benefit’ to include cash benefits for income \n3  maintenance, SNAP, most forms of Medicaid, Section 8 Housing Assistance under the \n4  Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, \n5  and certain other forms of subsidized housing.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. \n6  Because the INS directs immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien “is \n7  likely at any time to become a public charge,” the Rule’s new definition requires \n8  immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien is likely to receive certain public \n9  benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any future 36-month period to \n10  determine whether he is likely to become a public charge.  The rule sets out a number of \n11  positive, negative, heavily-weighted, and normally-weighted factors to assist in making \n  12  that determination, and those factors are considered as part of a “totality of the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  circumstances” assessment of whether an alien is likely to use more than 12 months’ \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  worth of benefits in any future 36-month period. \niD tc 15  DISCUSSION \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  A.  Legal Standard \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 provides federal courts with the authority to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  issue preliminary injunctions.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a).  Generally, the purpose of a \nN\n19  preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a \n20  final judgment on the merits can be rendered.  See U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V., \n21  590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010). \n22  An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an extraordinary remedy \n23  that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  \n24  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008); see also Munaf v. Geren, \n25  553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008).  A preliminary injunction “should not be granted unless the \n26  movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, \n27  520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam).  \n28  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [1] he is likely to \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 11 of 93\n \n1  succeed on the merits, that [2] he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n2  preliminary relief, that [3] the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that [4] an \n3  injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n4  Alternatively, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship balance that \n5  tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other \n6  two elements of the Winter test are also met.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 \n7  F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011).  “That is, ‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a \n8  balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a \n9  preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of \n10  irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 1135; see also \n11  Disney Enterprises, Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017). \n  12  If a plaintiff satisfies its burden to demonstrate that a preliminary injunction should \n a\ntruin\noro 13  issue, “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \niD tc 15  (1979). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Separately, the APA permits this court to “postpone the effective date of action . . . \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  pending judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 705;  Bakersfield City Sch. Dist. of Kern Cty. v. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Boyer, 610 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1979) (“The agency or the court may postpone or stay \nN\n19  agency action pending such judicial review.”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 705).  Any such \n20  postponement must be made “[o]n such conditions as may be required and to the extent \n21  necessary to prevent irreparable injury[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The factors considered when \n22  issuing such a stay substantially overlap with the Winter factors for a preliminary \n23  injunction.  See, e.g., Bauer v. DeVos, 325 F. Supp. 3d 74, 104–07 (D.D.C. 2018). \n24  B.  Analysis \n25  In considering plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction, the court considers the \n26  Winter factors (and the alternative All. for the Wild Rockies) factors in turn.  First, the \n27  court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to succeed on the \n28  merits of their claims, or alternatively whether they have demonstrated serious questions \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 12 of 93\n \n1  going to the merits.  Because a plaintiff must be within a statute’s “zone of interest” to \n2  succeed on an APA challenge based on the underlying statute, the court considers \n3  whether each plaintiff is within the relevant statute’s zone of interests when assessing its \n4  likelihood of success on the merits.   \n5  Second, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to \n6  suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.  Because plaintiffs’ alleged \n7  irreparable harms are also their alleged bases for standing, the court considers whether \n8  each plaintiff has standing to bring a ripe claim when assessing its irreparable harms.   \n9  Third, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that the balance of \n10  equities tip in their favor, and whether the balance of hardships tip sharply in their favor.   \n11  Fourth, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that an injunction \n  12  is in the public interest.   \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Fifth, the court addresses the scope of injunctive relief necessary and capable of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  providing complete relief to the harms plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to \niD tc 15  suffer prior to a determination on the merits, absent such relief. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  1.  The State and County Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  and Have Raised Serious Questions \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on three of their causes of action, \nN\n19  each alleging a violation of the APA:  (1) that the Rule violates the APA because it is not \n20  in accordance with the term “public charge” as used in the INA; (2) that the Rule violates \n21  the APA because it is not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act § 504; and (3) that the \n22  Rule violates the APA because it is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.5 \n23  Under the APA, “the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, \n24  interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or \n25 \n                                            \n5 Although some of the arguments supporting these claims are likely to overlap with other \n26 \nclaims plaintiffs assert, plaintiffs have made clear that they are not moving for a \npreliminarily injunction based on any other claim, including, inter alia, the claim that the \n27 \nRule violates the APA because it is contrary to laws giving the States discretion with \nrespect to the provision of healthcare, the claim under the declaratory judgment act that \n28 \nCuccinelli was unlawfully appointed, or any of the asserted Constitutional claims. \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 13 of 93\n \n1  applicability of the terms of an agency action.  The reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful \n2  and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, \n3  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]”  5 U.S.C. \n4  § 706. \n5  “In the usual course, when an agency is authorized by Congress to issue \n6  regulations and promulgates a regulation interpreting a statute it enforces, the \n7  interpretation receives deference if the statute is ambiguous and if the agency’s \n8  interpretation is reasonable.  This principle is implemented by the two-step analysis set \n9  forth in Chevron.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2124 (2016) \n10  (citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)).  \n11  “At the first step, a court must determine whether Congress has ‘directly spoken to the \n  12  precise question at issue.’  If so, ‘that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.’  If not, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  then at the second step the court must defer to the agency's interpretation if it is \niD tc 15  ‘reasonable.’”  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2124–25 (citations omitted) (quoting \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–44). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  “[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible \nN\n19  construction of the statute.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843; see also Michigan v. E.P.A., 135 \n20  S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015) (“Even under this deferential standard, however, agencies must \n21  operate within the bounds of reasonable interpretation.”) (internal quotation marks \n22  omitted).   \n23  The Chevron analysis calls upon the court to “employ[] traditional tools of statutory \n24  construction” to fulfill its role as “the final authority on issues of statutory construction[.]”  \n25  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9; accord Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1630 \n26  (2018). \n27  “Chevron deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is \n28  ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.  To begin with, the rule must be \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 14 of 93\n \n1  promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.”  Gonzales v. \n2  Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 258 (2006).  “The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the \n3  language of the delegation provision itself.  In many cases authority is clear because the \n4  statute gives an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.”  Id. (drawing \n5  a distinction between delegation of authority to carry out the act generally, and authority \n6  to execute the functions assigned to the agency). \n7  First, the court assesses whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims \n8  under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \n9  § 1182(a)(4).  Second, the court assesses whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \n10  claims under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in the \n11  Rehabilitation Act § 504.  Third, the court assess whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed \n  12  on their claims under the APA, that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  Fourth, the court \n a\ntruin\noro 13  assesses whether each plaintiff is within the relevant zone of interests, which is required \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to succeed on an APA claim. \niD tc 15  a.  Not in Accordance with Law—8 U.S. Code § 1182(a)(4) \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Plaintiffs argue that the Rule is not in accordance with the definition of “public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge” as used in 8 U.S. Code § 1182(a)(4) for three reasons:  (1) DHS’s interpretation \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  should not be accorded any deference, and the Rule’s definition is inconsistent with the \nN\n19  statute; (2) even if the term is accorded deference, the term plainly and unambiguously \n20  means “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence,” and the Rule conflicts \n21  with that definition; and (3) the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is not reasonable or \n22  based on a permissible construction of the statute. \n23  The court did not understand plaintiffs to have raised the first argument in their \n24  moving papers, although the Counties may have raised it obliquely in their reply.  But the \n25  court and defendants were surprised to learn at the hearing that plaintiffs were advancing \n26  an argument that DHS’s promulgation of the Rule was wholly outside of Congressionally-\n27  delegated authority.  Cf. Counties’ Reply at 8–9 (“Counties do not contest DHS’s \n28  authority to issue rational regulations governing the case-by-case application of the \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 15 of 93\n \n1  statutory standard, so long as they do not misconstrue the term ‘public charge.’”); States’ \n2  Reply at 9–10 (“the States have never disputed the commonsense point that Congress in \n3  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A) assigned responsibility to Defendants to make individual public \n4  charge determinations”); Organizations’ Reply at 9 (“even if Defendants were correct, \n5  Congress could delegate to DHS the power only to adopt reasonable interpretations of \n6  the statute”).  Nevertheless, plaintiffs have not sufficiently supported, or even explained, \n7  their argument to satisfy their burden to show likelihood of success on the merits based \n8  on it.6  Accordingly, the court analyzes the Rule pursuant to the framework set out by \n9  Chevron.  \n10  The second and third arguments concern a challenge under Chevron’s framework \n11  to the meaning of “public charge” as used in § 1182(a)(4).  Plaintiffs’ second argument \n  12  requires the court to determine whether the Rule contravenes the statute’s unambiguous \n a\ntruin\noro 13  meaning, and their third argument requires the court to determine whether defendants’ \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  chosen definition is reasonable and based on a permissible construction of the statute.  \niD tc 15  Both questions require a discussion of the long usage of the term by Congress, as well \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  as the expansive evaluation of the term by courts and executive agencies.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  As preface to that discussion, a brief outline helps set the stage.  The phrase \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “public charge” was used in this country’s first-ever general immigration statute in 1882.  \nN\n19  The immigration statutes have been interpreted and modified many time since then, and \n20  although many other excluded categories of persons came and went, with each \n21  modification through today the phrase “public charge” remained intact.  As a result, the \n22  meaning that the persistent term had when first used is relevant to understanding the \n23  meaning Congress ascribed to it with each subsequent statutory revision, including the \n24  now-operative statute, which most recently saw changes to the relevant provisions in \n25  1990 and 1996.   \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n6 However, the court notes that whether DHS’s promulgation of the Rule falls within the \nrulemaking authority delegated to it by Congress may benefit from more attention in the \n28 \nparties’ future briefing on the merits.  See generally 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a). \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 16 of 93\n \n1  Ultimately, this dispute concerns the meaning of a statutory term passed in 1990—\n2  with clarifying language passed in 1996.  As such, the court considers the meaning \n3  ascribed to the term by Congress at that time, but in doing so it must afford due \n4  consideration to Congress’s understanding of the term given the long historical context it \n5  was operating within, which the court presently endeavors to describe.  See Forest Grove \n6  Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239–40 (2009) (“Congress is presumed to be aware of \n7  an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation \n8  when it re-enacts a statute without change.”) (quoting Lorillard v.

See \n27  An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214 (1882) (the “1882 Act”).  That statute \n28  provided, in part: \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 17 of 93\n \n \n1  That the Secretary of the Treasury . . . shall have power to . . . \nprovide for the support and relief of such immigrants therein \n2  landing as may fall into distress or need public aid . . . and it \nshall be the duty of such State . . . to examine into the condition \n3  of  passengers  arriving  at  the  ports  .  .  .  and  if  on  such \nexamination there shall be found among such passengers any \n4  convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of \nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge . . . such \n5  persons shall not be permitted to land. \n6  22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2. \n7  Legislative debate on the 1882 Act shows that at least one member of Congress \n8  sought to prevent foreign nations from “‘send[ing] to this country blind, crippled, lunatic, \n9  and other infirm paupers, who ultimately become life-long dependents on our public \n10  charities.’” 13 Cong. Rec. 5108-10 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep.

Thus we speak of . . . a pauper being chargeable to the parish or \n9  town.”  Stewart; Lawrence Rapalje, Robert L., Dictionary of American and English Law, \n10  with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws (1888), at 196.   \n11  Prior to the 1882 Act’s enactment, states had played a larger role in immigration \n  12  than they do today, and state governments had used and interpreted the term “public \n a\ntruin\noro 13  charge,” although of course not in relation to any Congressional act.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, when interpreting a statute \niD tc 15  concerning the procedures to remove an individual from a township in New Jersey, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  considered whether a pauper was “either chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the township of Princeton.”  Overseers of Princeton Twp. v. Overseers of S. Brunswick \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Twp., 23 N.J.L. 169, 170 (Sup. Ct. 1851).  Although the case does not make clear what \nN\n19  precise relief is necessary to qualify as a public charge, it contemplated that one became \n20  a public charge upon seeking such relief from “the church wardens or overseers of the \n21  poor[.]”  Id. at 173.  The concurrence clarified that an “application for relief” is distinct from \n22  being “chargeable,” although “[t]he probability of his becoming chargeable is sufficiently \n23  shown by his application for relief.”  Id. at 179 (Carpenter, J. concurring).  The case does \n24 \n                                            \n7 Defendants cite Frederic Jesup Stimson, Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and \n25 \nMaxims of the Common Law (1881), but that source does not provide a relevant \ndefinition.  The first-listed definition is the most plausibly-relevant:  “A burden, \n26 \nincumbrance, or lien; as when land is charged with a debt.”  Id. at 56.  But that definition \nconcerns how the word charge relates to real property, which makes sense because at \n27 \nthe time, “[m]ore frequently, however, charge is applied to property” as “a general term[.]”  \nStewart; Lawrence Rapalje, Robert L., Dictionary of American and English Law, with \n28 \nDefinitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws (1888), at 196. \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 19 of 93\n \n1  not explain the type or quantum of relief necessary to constitute one’s status as a \n2  “charge.” \n3  Another state court opinion, People ex rel. Durfee v. Commissioners of Emigration, \n4  27 Barb. 562, 1858 WL 7084 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1858), addressed a statute which \n5  contemplated bonds being paid on behalf of immigrants, and required the commissioners \n6  of immigration who held those bonds to “indemnify so far as may be the several cities, \n7  towns and counties of the state, for any expense or charge which may be incurred for the \n8  maintenance and support of the” immigrants.  27 Barb. at 570.  The court held that the \n9  statute required indemnification of all expenses made on behalf of the immigrants—\n10  whether temporary or permanent—so long as the expenses were lawfully made.  Id.  \n11  However, the case did not draw a clean line holding that any expense spent on an \n  12  individual makes him a public charge.  Rather, an equally-plausible reading of the opinion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  is that the statute requires immunity of all expenses paid to support immigrants for whom \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  bonds have been paid, regardless of whether they are formally considered public \niD tc 15  charges.8 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  City of Bos. v. Capen, 61 Mass. 116, 121 (1851) concerned a statute which \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  required a bond for someone likely to become a public charge.  The court explained that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  the statute described various categories of people identified as being at risk of becoming \nN\n19  a public charge, and for whom bond may be required.  However, what assistance or \n20  payment qualified one as a \"public charge” was not addressed.9   \n21  As a whole, the statutory language and authority underlying the 1882 Act provide \n22 \n                                            \n8 The latter reading would be in accordance with the current interpretation of “public \n23 \ncharge” as used elsewhere in the INA, which requires an alien to be presented with a bill \nand prove unable or unwilling to pay it to be deemed a public charge.  E.g., Matter of B-, \n24 \n3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (A.G. 1948); Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999); 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. \n25 \n9 The opinion also suggested that those who were “paupers in a foreign land” must have \n26 \nbeen “a public charge in another country,” and then stated without explanation that “the \nword ‘paupers’ being used in this connection in its legal, technical sense.”  Capen, 61 \n27 \nMass. at 121.  Even looking past the confusion, the court might be interpreted as finding \nthat all paupers have been public charges, but from that the conclusion cannot be drawn \n28 \nthat all public charges must have been paupers. \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 20 of 93\n \n1  some clear guidance as to the definition of public charge.  For example, the 1882 Act \n2  contemplated that admitted aliens (not excluded on public charge grounds) would receive \n3  some assistance from the state.  That is made clear by the same statute’s establishment \n4  of a fund “for the care of immigrants arriving in the United States, for the relief of such as \n5  are in distress[.]”  22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376, § 1.  Although the quantum of state support \n6  necessary to render one a public charge is less clear, the 1882 Act did not consider an \n7  alien a public charge for simply receiving some assistance from the state.  Also, it \n8  appears that contemporary uses of the term would deem one a public charge after taking \n9  on a particular, chargeable debt from the state and failing to repay it. \n10  2.  1891 \n11  In 1891, Congress amended the 1882 Act.  That amended statute provided, in \n  12  part: \n a\ntruin  \noCrof 13  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \n tila admission into the United States . . . :  All idiots, insane persons, \ncC\nirts fo 14  psuafufepreinrsg  ofrro pme ras olonast hliskoemlye t oo rb ae cdoamngee aro puusb cloicn ctahgairogues,  dpiesresaosnes,  \niD s tcir 15  persons who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous \net crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polygamists, \ns\ntaiD 16  and . . . . \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Aliens Under Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 (“1891 \nN\n19  Act”) § 1 (1891). \n20  The 1891 amendment also provided that “any alien who becomes a public charge \n21  within one year after his arrival in the United States from causes existing prior to his \n22  landing therein shall be deemed to have come in violation of law and shall be returned” \n23  pursuant to the procedures outline in the statute regarding aliens entering unlawfully.  \n24  1891 Act § 11.  So, the 1891 Act set out the now-familiar practice of subjecting aliens to \n25  two “public charge” assessments—one in which the government is called on to make a \n26  forward-looking prediction, and another in which the government is called on to make a \n27  backward-looking assessment.  The first asks at the time of entry whether the alien is \n28  likely to become a public charge.  The second asks whether, after some period of time, \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 21 of 93\n \n1  the alien has in fact become a public charge due to causes existing before he arrived.  \n2  Although the relevant time periods of the assessments have grown, this scheme \n3  generally remains in place today. \n4  The 1891 Act made a notable change to the law by adding the category “pauper,” \n5  and including the term pauper with “persons likely to become a public charge” to form a \n6  single entry in an expanded list of excluded categories of people. \n7  An early case interpreting the act considered whether “the act of 1891 confers \n8  upon the inspection officer power to detain and send back an alien immigrant as being a \n9  person liable to become a public charge, in the absence of any evidence whatever \n10  tending to establish that fact.”  In re Feinknopf, 47 F. 447, 448 (E.D.N.Y. 1891).  Although \n11  it did not define the term “public charge” in the abstract, the court provided an explanation \n  12  given the facts before it that essentially laid out a totality-of-the-circumstances test.  It \n a\ntruin\noro 13  held that “[o]f course” the following facts, “if believed, would not warrant the conclusion \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  that the petitioner was a person likely to become a public charge,” and that the case is \niD tc 15  “devoid of any evidence whatever of any fact upon which to base a determination that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  petitioner is likely to become a public charge”: \nt\nS \nn  \n dere 17  the petitioner is 40 years old; that he is a native of Austria; that \nh\nt\ninrt he is a cabinet-maker by trade, and has exercised that trade for \nUoN 18  25 years; that he has no family; that he has baggage with him, \nworth $20, and 50 cents in cash; that he is a man who can find \n19  employment in his trade, and is willing to exercise the same. . . .  \n[I]n addition, that the immigrant has not been an inmate of an \n20  almshouse, and has not received public aid or support, and has \nnot been convicted of crime. \n21   \n22  Id. at 447–48.  A fair reading suggests that each of the enumerated facts could be \n23  relevant to predicting whether someone is likely to become a public charge. \n24  A subsequent court provided even more guidance.  In United States v. Lipkis, 56 \n25  F. 427 (S.D.N.Y. 1893), a man had arrived in America before his wife and child.  The wife \n26  and child were required to pay a bond because the superintendent of immigration \n27  deemed them “likely to become a public charge” based on “the poverty and character of \n28  the husband,” whose residence gave the appearance of “extreme poverty.”  Id. at 427.  \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 22 of 93\n \n1  However, that poverty alone did not mean he or the family was a public charge—rather, it \n2  meant the family was likely to become a public charge.  “About six months after the \n3  arrival of the mother she became insane, and was sent to the public insane asylum of the \n4  city under the direction of the commissioners of charities and correction, where only poor \n5  persons unable to pay for treatment are received, and she was there attended to for a \n6  considerable period at the expense of the municipality.”  Id. at 428.  Thus, the mother \n7  became a public charge only when she was committed to the public insane asylum with \n8  “no effort to provide for her at his [the husband’s] own expense[.]”  Id.   \n9  But the court did not require commitment to an institution to make one a public \n10  charge.  It reasoned in dicta that the family’s financial condition generally subjected the \n11  family to the risk of becoming “a public charge under the ordinary liabilities to sickness, or \n  12  as soon as any other additional charges arose beyond the barest needs of existence. . . .  \n a\ntruin\noro 13  The liability of his family to become a public charge through any of the ordinary \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  contingencies of life existed when the bond was taken, because of his poverty and \niD tc 15  inefficiency.”  Id.  So, a number of different financial shocks could have rendered the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  family a public charge. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  The court’s analysis drew a distinction between being a public charge (in this case, \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  someone committed to an insane asylum with no effort to cover the expense), and \nN\n19  someone likely to become a public charge (in this case, someone who can pay for “the \n20  barest needs of existence,” yet whom an extreme illness could ruin). \n21  The parties cite to state court decisions published during this time using the term \n22  public charge, which are informative of what the term generally meant at the time.  Those \n23  opinions address the duration of benefits that render one a public charge rather than the \n24  quantum, and they tend to suggest that temporary relief did not make one a public charge \n25  as the term was understood at the time.  However, they do not address whether longer-\n26  term receipt of a small amount of public benefits qualifies one as a public charge (as the \n27  Rule would do).  See Yeatman v. King, 2 N.D. 421 (1892) (state loaning seed grain to \n28  farmer using the general tax fund, with obligation of repayment, is designed to prevent \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 23 of 93\n \n1  farmers “from becoming a public charge by affording them temporary relief”); Cicero v. \n2  Falconberry, 14 Ind. App. 237 (1895) (“The mere fact that a person may occasionally \n3  obtain assistance from the county does not necessarily make such person a pauper or a \n4  public charge.”).10 \n5  Following the 1891 Act, two points are relatively clear.  First, reaffirming the best \n6  interpretation of the 1882 Act, the term was not used at the time to include short-term or \n7  temporary relief from the state, as the case law continued to demonstrate.  Second, \n8  Lipkis could be read to support either of two non-controversial points:  either state-funded \n9  institutionalization constitutes becoming a public charge, or state-funded \n10  institutionalization with “no effort” to pay the expense after being billed does so.  Simply \n11  being able to pay for the barest needs of existence and nothing more does not render \n  12  one a public charge (although it may make one likely to become a public charge).  A third \n a\ntruin\noro 13  point begins to materialize in the case law, which is that absent some particularly-\nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  identified negative factor, an employable individual is not a public charge.  E.g., In re \niD tc 15  Feinknopf, 47 F. at 447–48 (40-year-old man willing to exercise his trade); Lipkis, 56 F. at \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  428 (notwithstanding poverty, working man’s family is not a public charge until financial \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  calamity strikes); Yeatman, 2 N.D. at 421 (public aid to working farmer). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  3.  1903 \nN\n19  In 1903, Congress passed a revised version of the act.  That amended statute \n20  provided, in part: \n \n21  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States:  All idiots, insane persons, \n22  epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years \nprevious; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity \n23  at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a \npublic charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a \n24  loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons \nwho  have  been  convicted  of  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \n25 \n                                            \n26 \n10 The parties also cite Edenburg Borough Poor Dist. v. Strattanville Borough Poor Dist., \n5 Pa. Super. 516, 528 (1897), but that case concerns an individual who appears to have \n27 \nformally registered as a pauper by seeking public assistance under state or local law.  It \ndoes not concern any immigration statutes, nor does the opinion use the word “charge” or \n28 \nthe phrase “public charge.” \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 24 of 93\n \nmisdemeanor  involving  moral  turpitude;  polygamists; \n1  anarchists, or . . . .” \n2  An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 32 Stat. 1213, \n3  Chap. 1012 § 2 (1903). \n4  This change separated out “paupers” from “persons likely to become a public \n5  charge,” which the previous act had grouped together as a single item in the list. \n6  The 1903 amendment also provided that any alien who “shall be found a public \n7  charge . . . from causes existing prior to landing, shall be deported . . . at any time within \n8  two years after arrival[.]”  Id. § 20. \n9  4.  1907  \n10  In 1907, Congress passed a revised version of the act.  That amended statute \n11  provided, in part: \n \n a  12  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \ntruin admission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\noCrof 13  minded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who \n tila have been insane within five years previous; persons who have \ncC\nirts fo 14  hpaadup tewrso;  orp emrsooren sa ttalikceksly  oft oin sabneictyo maet  anay  tpimubel icp revcihoaursgley;;  \niD s tcir 15  professional beggars; persons afflicted with tuberculosis or with \net a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not \ns\ntaiD 16  comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \nt\nS \nn who are . . . mentally or physically defective, such mental or \n dere 17  physical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of \nh\nt\ninrt such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted \nUoN 18  of  or  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \nmisdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . .” \n19 \nAn Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 34 Stat. 898, Chap. \n20 \n1134 § 2 (1907). \n21 \nNothing relevant to the present action appears to have been changed by this \n22 \nrevision.11 \n23 \n5.  1910 \n24 \nIn 1910, Congress amended the 1907 act.  The new statute provided, in part: \n25   \n26 \n                                            \n11 The only notable change is the introduction of an exclusion for individuals not otherwise \n27 \ncaptured by the categories who cannot earn a living based on mental or physical defect.  \nThat suggests that earlier-listed categories also include such people, but not all such \n28 \npeople. \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 25 of 93\n \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \n1  admission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\nminded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who \n2  have been insane within five years previous; persons who have \nhad two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; \n3  paupers;  persons  likely  to  become  a  public  charge; \nprofessional beggars; persons afflicted with tuberculosis or with \n4  a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not \ncomprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \n5  who are . . . mentally or physically defective, such mental or \nphysical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of \n6  such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted \nof  or  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \n7  misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . .” \n8  An Act to Amend an Act entitled An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the \n9  United States, 36 Stat. 263, Chap. 128 § 2 (1910). \n10    Nothing relevant to the present action appears to have been changed by this \n11  revision. \n  12  In 1915, the Supreme Court addressed the 1910 act in Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (1915).  “The single question” in that case was “whether an alien can be declared likely to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the city of his \niD tc 15  immediate destination is overstocked.”  Id. at 9–10.  The immigration commissioners in \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that action determined that the immigrants were “bound for Portland, Oregon, where the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  reports of industrial conditions show that it would be impossible for these aliens to obtain \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  employment[.]”  Id. at 8. \nN\n19  The court held that “[t]he statute deals with admission to the United States, not to \n20  Portland . . . .  It would be an amazing claim of power if commissioners decided not to \n21  admit aliens because the labor market of the United States was overstocked.”  Id. at 10.  \n22  Because the immigration authorities could not consider labor conditions in a single \n23  location to determine whether immigrants would be able to obtain employment, the \n24  factual findings that the immigrants could not find work in Portland was insufficient to \n25  support a determination that they were likely to become public charges. \n26  The court also reasoned that, because the “public charge” ground for exclusion \n27  was “mentioned between paupers and professional beggars, and along with idiots, \n28  persons dangerously diseased, persons certified by the examining surgeon to have a \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 26 of 93\n \n1  mental or physical defect of a nature to affect their ability to earn a living,” the term should \n2  be construed as similar with the rest.  Id.  Under that construction, the court held that \n3  those likely to become public charges “are to be excluded on the ground of permanent \n4  personal objections accompanying them irrespective of local conditions[.]”  Id.12  That \n5  is, the court focused on an alien’s general ability and willingness to work and earn a \n6  living, rather than the particular wages or labor conditions that existed in the alien’s \n7  destination. \n8  A court in 1916 considered “whether the fact that petitioner entered the United \n9  States as a gambler, and as one having no other permanent means of support, actual or \n10  contemplated, makes him a person ‘likely to become a public charge’ within the meaning \n11  of the Immigration Act.”  Lam Fung Yen v. Frick, 233 F. 393, 396 (6th Cir. 1916): \n \n a  12  It seems clear that the term ‘persons likely to become a public \ntruin charge’ is not limited to paupers or those liable to become such; \noCrof 13  ‘paupers‘ are mentioned as in a separate class.  In United \n tila States v. Williams (D.C.) 175 Fed. 274, 275, the term ‘persons \ncC\nirts fo 14  loiknellyy  ttoh obesceo mpeer sao pnusb liwc hchoa rtghero‘ ius gcho nmstrisufeodr tausn ien clcuadninngo, t‘ nboet  \niD s tcir 15  self-supporting,  but  also  those  who  will  not  undertake \net honest pursuits, and who are likely to become periodically \ns\ntaiD 16  the  inmates  of  prisons.’    We  think  this  a  reasonable \nt\nS \nn construction. . . .  Inmates of jails and prisons are for the time \n dere 17  being public charges, and we think it open to conclusion by \nh\nt\ninrt reasonable minds that those who will not work for a living, but \nUoN 18  rely  for  that  purpose  upon  gambling,  are  more  likely  than \ncitizens following the ordinary pursuits of industry to become, \n19  at least intermittently, public charges.   \n20  Id. at 396–97 (emphasis added). \n21  The court reasoned that because the alien was a gambler and gambling is \n22  regarded “within the domain of police supervision and public security,” the petitioner is \n23  reasonably likely to become periodically an inmate of a prison.  Id. at 397.  Under the \n24  court’s reasoning, someone in a prison is a public charge, akin to someone in an \n25  almshouse or insane asylum.  Id.; see also United States v. Williams, 175 F. 274, 275 \n26 \n                                            \n12 The Gegiow opinion was subject to some skepticism following a later amendment to \n27 \nthe statute, but the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that its reasoning remained \ncontrolling.  See Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913 (9th Cir. 1922); see also Ex \n28 \nparte Mitchell, 256 F. 229 (N.D.N.Y. 1919). \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 27 of 93\n \n1  (S.D.N.Y. 1910) (“They are surely public charges, at least during the term of their \n2  incarceration.”).   \n3  In 1917, the Second Circuit relied on Gegiow’s statutory analysis when deciding a \n4  case under the 1910 statute.  Howe v. United States, 247 F. 292 (2d Cir. 1917).  In \n5  Howe, a Canadian who had allegedly “drawn a check . . . which proved bad,” among \n6  other things, entered the United States, and an immigration inspector “believed him guilty \n7  of dishonest practice in Canada.”  Id. at 293–94.  Because the plaintiff had not admitted \n8  to or been convicted of a felony, the provision excluding criminals did not apply to him.  \n9  The court reasoned that (1) the term “public charge” needed to be read in context of its \n10  position in the statute’s list, and (2) it cannot be interpreted to overlap with other items in \n11  the list (e.g., idiots, imbeciles, insane persons, criminals).  As such, “[i]f the words \n  12  covered jails, hospitals, and insane asylums, several of the other categories of exclusion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  would seem to be unnecessary.”  Id. at 294.  Instead, “Congress meant the act to exclude \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  persons who were likely to become occupants of almshouses for want of means with \niD tc 15  which to support themselves in the future.”  Id.  The Howe court provided a very specific, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  restrictive, and clear definition of the term.  This also demonstrates an early split in the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  case law as to whether prison inmates are considered public charges. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  By 1917, the Supreme Court, the Second Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit had all \nN\n19  published opinions construing the term as used in the 1910 act.  These are precisely the \n20  sorts of constructions Congress is presumed knowledgeable of when reenacting statutory \n21  language.  See Forest Grove, 557 U.S. at 239–40.  The Supreme Court held that \n22  predicting whether someone will become a public charge requires consideration of \n23  “permanent personal objections accompanying them irrespective of local conditions[.]”  \n24  Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10.  The two Circuit decisions are more difficult to reconcile.  First, \n25  they directly contradicted one another with respect to whether jail inmates were public \n26  charges.  Second, Howe broke with the weight of prior authority in holding that the term \n27  was limited to those occupying almshouses for want of a means of support. \n28  6.  1917 \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 28 of 93\n \n1  In 1917, Congress amended the Act.  That amended statute provided, in part: \n \n2  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\n3  minded persons, epileptics, insane persons; persons who have \nhad one or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; \n4  persons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority; persons with \nchronic alcoholism; paupers; professional beggars; vagrants; \n5  persons  afflicted  with  tuberculosis  in  any  form  or  with  a \nloathsome  or  dangerous  contagious  disease;  persons  not \n6  comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \nwho are . . . mentally or physically defective, such physical \n7  defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of such \nalien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted of or \n8  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \nmisdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . . ; \n9  persons likely to become a public charge . . . .” \n10  An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens to, and the Residence of Aliens in, the \n11  United States, 39 Stat. 874, Chap. 29 § 3 (1917). \n  12    The statute also provided for the deportability of “any alien who within five years \n a\ntruin\noro 13  after entry becomes a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  subsequent to landing[.]”  Id. § 19. \niD tc 15  The “public charge” language remains unchanged, although moved within the list.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The Congressional Record suggests that Congress intentionally moved the category of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  “persons likely to become a public charge” later in the list in response to Gegiow.  See 70 \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Cong. Rec. 3560 (1929) (“persons likely to become a public charge (this clause excluding \nN\n19  aliens on the ground likely to become a public charge has been shifted from its position in \n20  section 2 of the immigration act of 1907 to its present position in section 3 of this act in \n21  order to indicate the intention of Congress that aliens shall be excluded upon said ground \n22  for economic as well as other reasons and with a view to overcoming the decision of the \n23  Supreme Court in Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U. S. 3”); see also 80 Cong. Rec. 5829 (1936) \n24  (same). \n25  A district court in 1919 reasoned that although the exact same phrase was shifted \n26  within the list, “I am unable to see that this change of location of these words in the act \n27  changes the meaning that is to be given them.  A ‘person likely to become a public \n28  charge’ is one who for some cause or reason appears to be about to become a charge \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 29 of 93\n \n1  on the public, one who is to be supported at public expense, by reason of poverty, \n2  insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, idiocy and poverty, or, it might be, by reason \n3  of having committed a crime which, on conviction, would be followed by imprisonment.”  \n4  Ex parte Mitchell, 256 F. 229, 230 (N.D.N.Y. 1919).  In that case, there was “no evidence \n5  whatever that the alien at any time has relied in any degree on the charity of others,” but \n6  rather the alien “is able to earn her own living and always has done so[.]”  Id.  \n7  The court then stated that mere speculation about the possibility of becoming a \n8  public charge does not make one likely to become a public charge:  “The alien may \n9  become sick; she may lose her house by fire; she may lose her personal property by bad \n10  investments.  All this is possible, but not probable.  There is no claim that this alien is \n11  suffering, or that she has suffered at any time, from any mental or physical defect.  It is \n  12  not claimed this alien has been convicted, or even charged with the commission, of any \n a\ntruin\noro 13  crime, or that she came to the United States, or is in the United States, for any immoral or \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  improper purpose.”  Id. at 231. \niD tc 15  The Ninth Circuit agreed in 1922, holding that the 1917 Amendment’s movement \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  of the “public charge” exclusion “does not change the meaning that should be given” the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  exclusion.  Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913, 916 (9th Cir. 1922).  The court \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  recognized the legislative change and that Gegiow’s reliance on the phrase’s relative \nN\n19  position in the statute was compromised, yet it held: \n \n20  Although  in  the  act  of  February  5,  1917,  under  which  the \npresent case is to be determined, the location of the words \n21  ‘persons likely to become a public charge‘ is changed, we agree \nwith Judge Ray in Ex parte Mitchell (D.C.) 256 Fed. 229, that \n22  this  change  of  location  of  the  words  does  not  change  the \nmeaning that should be given them, and that it is still to be held \n23  that a person ‘likely to become a public charge’ is one who, \nby reason of poverty, insanity, or disease or disability, will \n24  probably become a charge on the public. \n25  Id. (emphasis added).13 \n26 \n                                            \n13 In 1923 a district court in Washington state did not cite these precedents and held \n27 \ninstead that Congress’s shift was an effective modification in response to Gegiow.  Ex \nparte Horn, 292 F. 455 (W.D. Wash. 1923).  Interpreting the phrase anew based on its \n28 \nplain meaning, the court reasoned that “a public charge” is “a person committed to the \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 30 of 93\n \n1  A 1921 Second Circuit opinion relying on Howe and Ex parte Mitchell held that “A \n2  person likely to become a public charge is one whom it may be necessary to support at \n3  public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, idiocy \n4  and poverty.  We think that the finding by the administrative authorities, showing a \n5  physical defect of a nature that may affect the ability of the relator and appellee to earn a \n6  living, is sufficient ground for exclusion.  His physical condition, together with his financial \n7  condition, having but $100 with him, justified the conclusion of the administrative \n8  authorities in finding that he and his children were aliens likely to become public \n9  charges.”  Wallis v. U.S. ex rel. Mannara, 273 F. 509, 511 (2d Cir. 1921) (citation \n10  omitted). \n11  A number of courts around this time also held that imprisonment was one way to \n  12  become a public charge.  E.g., Ex parte Fragoso, 11 F.2d 988, 989 (S.D. Cal. 1926) \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (“The fact is this petitioner did become a public charge. He was confined in a jail for a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  period of nine months.”); U.S. ex rel. Lehtola v. Magie, 47 F.2d 768, 770 (D. Minn. 1931) \niD tc 15  (noting a circuit split as to whether “dependency rather than imprisonment” is grounds for \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  finding a public charge); Ex parte Horn, 292 F. 455, 458 (W.D. Wash. 1923). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  In 1933, the third edition of Black’s Law Dictionary was the first to define “public \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  charge.”  The definition relied upon many of the above-cited cases, so for that reason it is \nN\n19  derivative of and less probative than those cases themselves.  Nevertheless, the \n20  definition is instructive.  It defined the term as:  “A person whom it is necessary to support \n21  at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or \n22  idiocy and poverty. . . .  As used in [the 1917 Act], one who produces a money charge on, \n23  or an expense to, the public for support and care.”  See Black’s Law Dictionary 311 (3d \n24  Ed. 1933).  The term includes paupers as well as those who will not undertake honest \n25  pursuits or who are likely to go to prison. \n26  In 1948, the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) issued an order, which the \n27 \n                                            \ncustody of a department of the government by due course of law,” and that committing \n28 \nsomeone to prison makes him a public charge.  Id. at 457. \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 31 of 93\n \n1  acting Attorney General thereafter issued an order approving.  The order set out a very \n2  explicit test for the term “public charge” as used elsewhere in the act, which concerned \n3  deportation proceedings of aliens who are later determined to have actually become a \n4  public charge during their time in the country.  Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (A.G. \n5  1948). \n6  When interpreting the term as used in the deportation context, the BIA set out a 3-\n7  part test requiring (1) an individualized bill for charges incurred, that is (2) presented to \n8  the alien (or a family member) by the government, and (3) which the alien (or family \n9  member) fails to pay.   \n \n10  the following test must be applied to determine whether an alien \nhas become a public charge within the reach of the 1917 act:  \n11  (1) The State or other governing body must, by appropriate law, \nimpose a charge for the services rendered to the alien.  In other \n a  12  words, the State must have a cause of action in contract against \ntruin either the person taking advantage of the State services or \noCrof 13  other  designated  relatives  or friends.  If  there  is  no  charge \n tila made, and if the State does not have a cause of action, the \ncC\nirts fo 14  amliuesnt  cmaankneo t dbeem saanidd  tofo rb ep aay pmuebnlitc  ocfh athrgee c. h (a2r)g Tesh eu apuotnh othriotisees  \niD s tcir 15  persons made liable under State law.  And (3) there must be a \net failure to pay for the charges. If there is a failure to pay either \ns\ntaiD 16  because of lack of demand or because the State authorities do \nt\nS \nn not perform their duty to collect the charges, the alien cannot \n dere 17  be said to have become a public charge. \nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Id. at 326 (footnote omitted). \nN\n19  The BIA also reasoned that the same definition would apply to the identical term \n20  used earlier in the statute with respect to predicting whether an alien is likely to become a \n21  public charge—i.e., the provision at issue in the present action: \n \n22  First, we wish to make the following preliminary observation for \nthe purpose of clarifying the issue.  The acceptance by an alien \n23  of services provided by a State or by a subdivision of a State to \nits residents, services for which no specific charge is made, \n24  does not in and of itself make the alien a public charge within \nthe  meaning  of  the  1917  act.    To  illustrate,  an  alien  who \n25  participates, without cost to him, in an adult education program \nsponsored by the State does not become a public charge.  \n26  Similiarly [sic] with respect to an alien child who attends public \nschool, or alien child who takes advantage of the free-lunch \n27  program  offered  by  schools.    We  could  go  on ad \ninfinitum setting  forth  the  countless  municipal  and  State \n28  services which are provided to all residents, alien and citizen \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 32 of 93\n \nalike, without specific charge of the municipality or the State, \n1  and which are paid out of the general tax fund.  The fact that \nthe State or the municipality pays for the services accepted by \n2  the alien is not, then, by itself, the test of whether the alien has \nbecome a public charge. . . .  [I]f it were to be held that all aliens \n3  became public charges by accepting such services, such a \nholding  would  necessarily  result  in  making  aliens  seeking \n4  admission to the United States excludable under that clause of \nsection 3 of the act of February 5, 1917, which bars aliens likely \n5  to become public charges from entering the United States, \nprovided  it  were  shown  the  alien  would  accept  the  free \n6  municipal and State services. \n7  Id. at 324–25 & n.1. \n8  District courts had independently adopted the same meaning under the 1917 Act.  \n9  E.g., Ex parte Orzechowska, 23 F. Supp. 428, 429 (D. Or. 1938) (individual not a public \n10  charge so long as they will “pay the full amount of the cost of keeping the girl at the \n11  Oregon State Hospital”); Ex parte Kichmiriantz, 283 F. 697, 698 (N.D. Cal. 1922) (same). \n  12  This three-part test is still used for determining whether to deport those who in fact \n a\ntruin\noro 13  become public charges currently, and DHS proposes to continue doing is in the Rule.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14    Prior to the 1952 Act’s passage, at least one principle had seemingly coalesced in \niD tc 15  the case law.  The reasoning in Gegiow was reaffirmed, and multiple circuits (also \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  recognized by Black’s Law Dictionary) agreed that someone likely to become a public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge is one whom it may be necessary to support at public expense by reason of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or idiocy and poverty.  Although that \nN\n19  oft-used definition (or a close derivative) is not particularly descriptive as to what quantum \n20  of support qualifies as “necessary to support” someone at public expense, it reaffirms the \n21  principle expressed in Gegiow and prior cases that the inquiry is focused on the \n22  individual’s inherent ability to support himself.  This definition also accords with prior \n23  interpretations generally finding that, absent some particularly-identified negative factor, \n24  those who appear generally capable and willing to work are not likely to become public \n25  charges.  And unlike the Howe case, it allows reading the definition of public charge in \n26  light of the surrounding categories of excluded persons, such that someone who is \n27  excluded due to his disease alone may also be excluded because his disease, in \n28  combination with another factor like poverty, is likely to render him a public charge.  This \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 33 of 93\n \n1  remains in line with other historically-supported, consistent principles described above, \n2  namely that temporary assistance does not render one a public charge and that actual \n3  incursion of debt to the state and refusal to pay could render one a public charge. \n4    The Attorney General’s order in 1948 for the first time offered a single, clear \n5  definition of the term “public charge” to be applied consistently throughout the Act.  And it \n6  also specifically ruled that acceptance of publicly-funded services “for which no specific \n7  charge is made” does not make one a public charge.  The three-part test requiring \n8  presentation of a bill and inability or refusal to pay was certainly in accordance with a line \n9  of precedential caselaw, but it was by no means the only or even dominant line at that \n10  time.  Nevertheless, this Attorney-General-issued order was controlling as administrative \n11  law between its issuance in 1948 and at least Congress’s next codification of the \n  12  immigration statutes in 1952. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  7.  1952 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In 1952, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised \niD tc 15  statute provided, in part: \n sir\net  \ns\ntaiD 16  Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the following classes \nt\nS \nn of  aliens  shall  be  ineligible  to  receive  visas  and  shall  be \n dere 17  excluded from admission into the United States: \nh\nt\ninrt (1) Aliens who are feeble-minded; \nUoN 18  (2) Aliens who are insane; \n(3) Aliens who have had one or more attacks of insanity; \n19  . . . \n(7)  Aliens  not  comprehended  within  any  of  the  foregoing \n20  classes . . . having a physical defect, disease, or disability . . . \nto be of such a nature that it may affect the ability of the alien \n21  to earn a living, unless the alien affirmatively establishes that \nhe will not have to earn a living; \n22  (8) Aliens who are paupers, professional beggars, or vagrants;  \n. . . \n23  (15) Aliens who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time \nof  application  for  a  visa,  or  in  the  opinion  of  the  Attorney \n24  General at the time of application for admission, are likely at \nany time to become public charges” \n25   \n26  An Act to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality; and \n27  for Other Purposes, 66 Stat. 163, 183, Title 2, Chap. 2 (“1952 Act”) § 212 (1952). \n28  The 1952 Act also provided for deportation of any alien who, “in the opinion of the \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 34 of 93\n \n1  Attorney General, has within five years after entry become a public charge from causes \n2  not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry[.]”  Id., Chap. 5  § 241(a)(8). \n3  The changes appear to be relatively minor for the purposes of this dispute.  \n4  Notably, Congress added the phrase “at any time” to specify the scope of time the public \n5  charge determination is meant to consider.  But no alteration to the phrase “public \n6  charge” appears in the statute. \n7  The 1951 edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, like the 3rd edition in 1933, assembled \n8  its definition based on precedent discussed above: \n \n9  A person whom it is necessary to support at public expense by \nreason of poverty, insanity and poverty, or idiocy and poverty.  \n10  As used in [the 1917 Act] . . ., one who produces a money \ncharge on, or an expense to, the public for support and care.  \n11  As so used, the term is not limited to paupers or those liable to \nbecome such, but includes those who will not undertake honest \n a  12  pursuits, or who are likely to become periodically the inmates \ntruin of prison.   \noCrof 13   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Charge, Public Charge, Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) (citations omitted). \niD tc 15  BIA dispositions following the passage of the 1952 Act addressed the term.  One \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  such disposition surveyed caselaw interpreting the term and held “the statute requires \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will require public support.  Some \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  specific circumstance, such as mental or physical disability, advanced age, or other fact \nN\n19  reasonably tending to show that the burden of supporting the alien is likely to be cast on \n20  the public, must be present.  A healthy person in the prime of life cannot ordinarily \n21  be considered likely to become a public charge, especially where he has friends or \n22  relatives in the United States who have indicated their ability and willingness to \n23  come to his assistance in case of emergency.”  Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. \n24  Dec. 409, 421–22 (BIA 1962) (emphasis added) (collecting cases). \n25  In that case, the agency held that the individual at issue was not likely to become a \n26  public charge given his characteristics, which essentially showed he was able to perform \n27  honest work: \n \n28  When respondent applied for a visa he was 22 years of age. \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 35 of 93\n \nHe was sound of body and had about ten years of farming \n1  experience. He had no specialized training, but had five years \nof schooling and apparently planned to seek work for which he \n2  was qualified. He spoke no English, but this was no handicap \nfor he would work among people who spoke Spanish. He had \n3  about $50 in assets. He had a brother gainfully employed in the \nUnited  States  and  he  had  other  close  relations  who  were \n4  interested in his welfare and who worked to bring him to the \nUnited  States.  The  brother  was  making  $85  a  week  in \n5  permanent  employment;  he  was  unmarried;  he  had  been \nsending money to his family in Mexico, and he was interested \n6  in helping his brother. Respondent had previous experience in \nthe United States, having spent about three months here as a \n7  contract worker. At that time he worked both in the fields and in \na cannery. His services appear to have been satisfactory for he \n8  was  retained  here  until  his  contract  was  completed. \nRespondent had no criminal record. \n9   \n10  Id. at 411. \n11  A 1974 BIA decision emphasized that the public charge determination must \n  12  consider the totality of the circumstances, and that prior welfare use alone cannot be \n a\ntruin\noro 13  determinative.  Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974) (“The respondent's \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  reliance on welfare for support is a condition which she herself can remedy.”). \niD tc 15  Another 1974 BIA decision confused matters.  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Dec. 583, 584 (BIA 1974).  The decision outlined “[t]he stages in decisional \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interpretations of the deportation statute, culminating in Matter of B-\": \ne\nh\nt\ninrt  \nUoN 18  1. The words “public charge” had their ordinary meaning, that \nis to say, a money charge upon or an expense to the public for \n19  support and care, the alien being destitute. \n \n20  2. The alien had not yet become a public charge, even though \nhe personally was destitute and his care and support were \n21  being paid for by public funds, if there existed close relatives, \nready,  willing  and  able  to  pay  the  bill,  but  the  appropriate \n22  government agency had failed to submit any bill. \n \n23  3. The alien had not become a public charge where the alien's \nmother had offered to make reimbursement, but under state \n24  law  payment  could  not  be  accepted  for  maintenance  and \ntreatment of the institutionalized alien. \n25   \n4.  The  alien  had  not  become  a  public  charge  where  the \n26  circumstances were like those described in 3, above, except \nthat no one had offered reimbursement. \n27   \n28  Id. at 586 (citations omitted). \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 36 of 93\n \n1  However, it reasoned that the Attorney General’s opinion in Matter of B- “is not \n2  necessarily controlling in relation to the provisions for exclusion.”  Id. at 585.  The BIA \n3  reasoned that “[w]hile it may normally be assumed that identical words used in different \n4  parts of the same statute are intended to have an identical meaning, this assumption \n5  readily yields when the legislative intent requires variant meanings in different contexts.”  \n6  Id. at 586.  The BIA then discussed legislative history in search of congressional intent.  \n7  Id.  The decision notes that the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed that courts had \n8  given different definitions to the term, and ultimately it decided not to define the term, “but \n9  rather [decided] to establish the specific qualification that the determination of whether an \n10  alien falls into that category rests within the discretion of the consular officers or the \n11  Commissioner.”  Id. at 588 (citing S. Rep. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., April 20, 1950, p. \n  12  349). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  The BIA stated that the phrase “public charge” must be “strictly construed” in the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  deportation context, but not in the exclusion context.  Id.  It then reasoned that the old-\niD tc 15  age benefits at issue in the case were “individualized public support to the needy, as \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  distinguished from essentially supplementary benefits, directed to the general welfare of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the public as a whole.”  Id. at 589.  Even though the state would never ask for repayment \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  of those old-age benefits—and therefore they could not constitute assistance qualifying \nN\n19  one as a public charge under the Matter of B- test—the court reasoned that it would not \n20  consider “the element of reimbursement” when determining whether someone is likely to \n21  become a public charge.  Id. \n22  So, the BIA rejected the Matter of B- test and constructed alternate definitions for \n23  the same term depending on whether the executive is predicting whether someone is \n24  likely to become a public charge or deciding whether someone has already become a \n25  public charge.  “Therefore, in our opinion any alien who is incapable of earning a \n26  livelihood, who does not have sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and \n27  has no person in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not need public \n28  support is excludable as likely to become a public charge whether or not the public \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 37 of 93\n \n1  support which will be available to him is reimbursable to the state.”  Id. at 589–90. \n2  These BIA decisions are useful to understand the administrative practices and \n3  interpretations operating when Congress reenacted the same language.  Although this \n4  period saw confusion within the agency about the proper way to interpret the phrase as \n5  used in different contexts, each of the discussed decisions support the now-consistent \n6  theme that a healthy person in the prime of life who can work cannot be considered likely \n7  to become a public charge, absent some particularly-identified circumstance evaluated \n8  under a totality of the circumstances.  E.g., Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. at \n9  422 (collecting cases); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. at 589 (“alien who is \n10  incapable of earning a livelihood”); Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. at 137 (totality of \n11  circumstances). \n  12  8.  1987 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  In 1987, the INS issued a final rule, effective May 1, 1987, following notice and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  comment.  See Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205 (May 1, \niD tc 15  1987).  The rule implemented section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act as \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  amended by section 201 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  Id. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  16,205.  So, the 1987 rule concerned the term “public charge” as used elsewhere in the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  INA, specifically for aliens adjusting their status to that of aliens lawfully admitted for \nN\n19  temporary residence.  The “key issues” subject to comments “were the public charge and \n20  special rule for determination of public charge[.]”  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,206.   \n21  That rule provided:  “An applicant . . . is subject to the provisions of section \n22  212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to become public charges \n23  unless the applicant demonstrates a history of employment in the United States \n24  evidencing self-support without receipt of public cash assistance. . . .  If the alien's \n25  period(s) of residence in the United States include significant gaps in employment or if \n26  there is reason to believe that the alien may have received public assistance while \n27  employed, the alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received \n28  public cash assistance.”  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,211.   \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 38 of 93\n \n1  Essentially, this provision exempted aliens who had been working domestically \n2  from the normal public charge analysis, so long as they could prove a work history and \n3  that they had not relied on public cash assistance.  The rule defined cash assistance to \n4  exclude in-kind benefits.  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,209 (“‘Public cash assistance’ means \n5  income or needs-based monetary assistance, to include but not limited to supplemental \n6  security income, received by the alien or his or her immediate family members through \n7  federal, state, or local programs designed to meet subsistence levels.  It does not include \n8  assistance in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits, nor \n9  does it include work-related compensation or certain types of medical assistance \n10  (Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or children \n11  under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public health).”). \n  12  This use of the term is somewhat of an aberration given that it essentially \n a\ntruin\noro 13  concerned an exception to the statute at issue here—and it did not define the term.  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  However, it did reinforce the long-standing principle underlying the construction of the \niD tc 15  term that, when considering whether someone should be admitted to the country, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  concept of “public charge” concerns primarily the prospect of gainful employment or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  some other private source of support. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  9.  1990 \nN\n19  In 1990, Congress revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised statute \n20  provided, in part: \n \n21  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Act,  the  following \ndescribes classes of excludable aliens who are ineligible to \n22  receive visas and who shall be excluded from admission into \nthe United States: \n23   \n(1) Health-Related Grounds \n24  . . . \n(2) Criminal and Related Grounds \n25  . . .  \n(3) Security and Related Grounds \n26  . . .  \n(4) Public  Charge.—Any  alien  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the \n27  consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the \nopinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for \n28  admission  or  adjustment  of  status,  is  likely  at  any  time  to \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 39 of 93\n \nbecome a public charge is excludable. \n1   \n2  Immigration Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4978, Title 6 § 601 (1990). \n3  This version of the bill removed language referring to the feeble-minded, paupers, \n4  professional beggars, and vagrants.  There is a suggestion in the Congressional Record \n5  that the removed terms were meant to be consolidated within the public charge category: \n \n6  The  bill  removes  some  of  the  antiquated  and  unused \nexclusions that have been in our law since the early 1900's, \n7  such as the exclusions based on illiteracy, and the exclusions \nfor  aliens  who  are  \"paupers,  professional  beggars,  or \n8  vagrants.\" These relics have been replaced by one generic \nstandard which exclude aliens who are \"likely to become a \n9  public charge.\"   \n10  136 Cong. Rec. 36797, 36844 (1990). \n11  In 1990, Black’s Law Dictionary defined “public charge” as “an indigent.  A person \n  12  whom it is necessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty alone or illness \n a\ntruin\noro 13  and poverty.”  Charge, Public Charge, Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Although a statutory term is not defined by reference to one preferred \niD tc 15  interpretation memorialized in the Congressional Record, that interpretation is consistent \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  with the courts’ and executive’s general treatment of the term since Gegiow.  That is, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  following Gegiow and later cases applying it to the 1917 Act, courts had read the term \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  public charge in context of those surrounding terms rather than in exclusion of them, and \nN\n19  focused on the alien’s ability to work or otherwise provide for himself, which each of the \n20  omitted surrounding terms also ultimately spoke to.  But see Howe, 247 F. at 294. \n21  10.  1996 \n22  In 1996, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised \n23  statute provided, in part: \n \n24  (4) PUBLIC CHARGE.— \n \n25  (A) IN GENERAL.—Any alien who, in the opinion of the \nconsular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n26  the  opinion  of  the  Attorney  General  at  the  time  of \napplication  for  admission  or  adjustment  of  status,  is \n27  likely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge  is \nexcludable. \n28   \n39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 40 of 93\n \n(B) FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.— \n1   \n(i) In determining whether an alien is excludable \n2  under this paragraph, the consular officer or the \nAttorney General shall at a minimum consider the \n3  alien's— \n \n4  (I) age; \n(II) health; \n5  (III) family status; \n(IV)  assets,  resources,  and  financial \n6  status; and \n(V) education and skills. \n7   \n(ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i), the \n8  consular officer or the Attorney General may also \nconsider any affidavit of support under section \n9  213A  for  purposes  of  exclusion  under  this \nparagraph. \n10   \n11  Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 110 Stat. 3009, Title 5 § 531 (1996).  This act \n  12  is often referred to as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (“IIRIRA”).  Elsewhere, the Act provided that “Any alien who, within five years after the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have \niD tc 15  arisen since entry is deportable.”  8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(5) (effective April 24, 1996). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The revised law used the same relevant language as all previous versions—public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge.  However, the statute then listed five factors that Congress instructed must be \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  considered when determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge, and it \nN\n19  identified another factor that “may also” be considered. \n20  Contemporaneously, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n21  Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), Pub. L. 104-193, restricted most aliens from accessing \n22  many public support programs for a period of time. \n23  During legislative efforts that ultimately resulted in the IIRIRA, a group of \n24  legislators proposed to define “public charge” with particularity in the statute to include \n25  “any alien who receives benefits described in subparagraph (D) for an aggregate period \n26  of at least 12 months” (or 36 months in the case of a battered spouse or child).  142 \n27  Cong. Rec. 24313, 24425 (1996).  The benefits listed in subparagraph D (that would \n28  qualify an alien as a public charge) included “means-tested public benefits,” but it’s not \n40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 41 of 93\n \n1  entirely clear what specific benefits that section refers to.14  That definition was not \n2  enacted into law. \n3  11.  1999 \n4  The INS attempted in 1999 to engage in rulemaking to guide immigration officers, \n5  aliens, and the public in understanding the public charge determinations.  No final rule \n6  was ever issued.  Instead, the agency published Field Guidance addressing the issue.  \n7  See Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 \n8  Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999) (the “1999 Field Guidance”).  \n9  The notice was published prior to final rulemaking because it was deemed \n10  “necessary to help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of the term ‘public charge’ \n11  in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, State, and local public \n  12  benefits.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  “The Department decided to publish a proposed rule \n a\ntruin\noro 13  defining ‘public charge’ in order to reduce the negative public health consequences \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  generated by the existing confusion and to provide aliens with better guidance as to the \niD tc 15  types of public benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  determinations.”  Id.  The notice “both summarizes longstanding law with respect to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  public charge and provides new guidance on public charge determinations in light of the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  recent changes in law,” notably the “Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nN\n19  Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) and welfare reform laws.”  Id. \n20  The notice proposed “that ‘public charge’ means an alien who has become (for \n21  deportation purposes) or who is likely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) \n22  ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the \n23  receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for \n24  long-term care at government expense.’  Institutionalization for short periods of \n25  rehabilitation does not constitute such primary dependence.”  Id. \n26 \n                                            \n14 The record refers to Section 213A(e)(1), which appears to have been codified at 8 \n27 \nU.S.C § 1183a(e), but that does not describe means-tested benefits.  The currently-\noperative version of 8 U.S. Code § 1183a(a)(1)(B) also appears to errantly refer to \n28 \nsubsection (e) for a list of means-tested benefits, so this error is not unique. \n41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 42 of 93\n \n1  Following the implementation of that interpretation, “officers should not place any \n2  weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits (other than institutionalization) or the \n3  receipt of cash benefits for purposes other than for income maintenance with respect to \n4  determinations of admissibility or eligibility for adjustment on public charge grounds.”  Id. \n5  Summarizing current agency practice, the memo explained: \n \n6  The  standard  for  adjudicating  inadmissibility  under  section \n212(a)(4) has been developed in several Service, BIA, and \n7  Attorney  General  decisions  and  has  been  codified  in  the \nService regulations implementing the legalization provisions of \n8  the  Immigration  Reform  and  Control  Act  of  1986.  These \ndecisions and regulations, and section 212(a)(4) itself, create a \n9  “totality of the circumstances” test. \n \n10  In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public \ncharge,  Service  officers  should  assess  the  financial \n11  responsibility of the alien by examining the “totality of the alien's \ncircumstances at the time of his or her application * * * The \n a  12  existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the \ntruin sole criterion for determining if an alien is likely to become a \noCrof 13  public  charge.  The  determination  of  financial  responsibility \n tila should be a prospective evaluation based on the alien's age, \ncC\nirts fo 14  heedaulctha,t iofanm, ailny ds tsaktiullss,,  aamssoentsg,  orethseoru fraccetso rasn. d  Afnin aanliceina l msatayt ubse,  \niD s tcir 15  considered likely to become a public charge even if there is no \net legal obligation to reimburse the benefit-granting agency for the \ns\ntaiD 16  benefits or services received, in contrast to the standards for \nt\nS \nn deportation, discussed below. \n dere 17   \nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Id. at 28,690 (footnotes omitted). \nN\n19  The 1999 Field Guidance then explained that the three-part test for paying back \n20  public debt continues to apply, but only as an additional test on top of the totality of the \n21  circumstances test for deportation decisions: \n \n22  Repayment  is  relevant  to  the  public  charge  inadmissibility \ndetermination only in very limited circumstances.  If at the time \n23  of application for admission or adjustment of status the alien is \ndeportable on public charge grounds under section 237(a)(5) \n24  of the INA due to an outstanding public debt for a cash benefit \nor the costs of institutionalization, then the alien is inadmissible.  \n25  Only a debt that satisfies the three-part [Matter of B-] test under \nsection  237(a)(5),  described  below,  will  render  an  alien \n26  deportable  as  a  public  charge  and  therefore  ineligible  for \nadmission or adjustment. If the debt is paid, then the alien will \n27  no longer be inadmissible based on the debt, and the usual \ntotality of the circumstances test would apply. \n28   \n42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 43 of 93\n \n1  Id. \n2  The Feld Guidance explained that a compelling reason to limit the public charge \n3  definition to those receiving cash is that “certain federal, state, and local benefits are \n4  increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, \n5  reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health and \n6  nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of \n7  becoming self-sufficient.  Thus, participation in such non-cash programs is not evidence \n8  of poverty or dependence.”  Id. at 28,692 \n9  12.  2013 \n10  In 2013, the Senate voted down two amendments to a never-passed bill regarding \n11  immigration.  The first amendment proposed “expanding the criteria for ‘public charge,’ \n  12  such that applicants would have to show they were not likely to qualify even for non-cash \n a\ntruin\noro 13  employment supports such as Medicaid, the SNAP program, or the Children's Health \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Insurance Program (CHIP). . . .  [T]he amendment was rejected by voice vote.”  S. Rep. \niD tc 15  No. 113-40, at 42 (2013). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The second amendment “would have expanded the definition of ‘public charge’ \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  such that people who received non-cash health benefits could not become legal \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  permanent residents.  This amendment would also have denied entry to individuals \nN\n19  whom the Department of Homeland Security determines are likely to receive these types \n20  of benefits in the future.  The amendment was not agreed to by a voice vote.”  S. Rep. \n21  No. 113-40, at 63 (2013). \n22  13.  2019—The Rule \n23  On October 10, 2018, DHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the \n24  Federal Register.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114.  The NPRM provided a 60-day public \n25  comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n26  41,297.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal Register. \n27  The Rule supersedes the 1999 Field Guidance’s definition of “public charge,” \n28  establishing a new definition based on a minimum time threshold for the receipt of public \n43 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 44 of 93\n \n1  benefits.  Under the newly-proposed “12/36 standard,” a public charge is defined as an \n2  individual who receives designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the \n3  aggregate within a 36-month period, although a single month where multiple types of \n4  benefits are received is counted as multiple months of receiving aid.  84 Fed. Reg. at \n5  41,295.  The “public benefits” included are extended by the Rule to include many non-\n6  cash benefits, for example Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”), Section \n7  8 Housing Programs, Medicaid, and Public Housing.  Id. at 41,501.  Receipt of two \n8  categories of benefits in the same months counts as two months of receipt for benefits, \n9  so some will qualify as public charges without receiving benefits for 12 months.  \n10  Moreover, the rule is agnostic to the value (or cost to the government) of the benefits.  To \n11  take a plausible example, someone receiving $182 over 36 months—or an average of \n  12  less than 17 cents a day—in SNAP benefits is a public charge under the Rule.  See \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Shing Decl. ¶ 17. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The Rule does not change the definition of public charge in the context of \niD tc 15  deportability, described elsewhere in the INA.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295 (“This rule does \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  not interpret or change DHS’s implementation of the public charge ground of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  deportability.”).  Rather, DHS will continue to enforce the 1999 Field Guidance in the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  deportation context.  Id. at 41,304 (“DHS currently makes public charge determinations in \nN\n19  accordance with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance. . . .  This guidance explains how the \n20  agency determines . . . whether a person has become a public charge within five years of \n21  entry”).  The 1999 Field Guidance, which will continue to govern, provided that “the \n22  definition of public charge is the same for both admission/adjustment and deportation,” \n23  although “the standards applied to public charge adjudications in each context are \n24  significantly different” because one is forward-looking and one is backward-looking.  64 \n25  Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  As such, following the implementation of the Rule, “public charge” \n26  will continue to be defined in the deportation context as “an alien who has become . . . \n27  ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the \n28  receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for \n44 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 45 of 93\n \n1  long-term care at government expense.’”  Id.  To assess whether an alien qualifies under \n2  that definition in the deportability context, the 1999 Field Guidance prescribes the 3-part \n3  test established in Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323. \n4  So, the Rule proposes to simultaneously apply multiple definitions for the term \n5  public charge.  First, its new definition will be used to predict whether an alien is likely at \n6  any time to become a public charge.  Second, the 1999 Field Guidance’s “primary \n7  dependence” definition is left unaltered in the deportation context, and it is evaluated \n8  pursuant to the well-known 3-part Matter of B- test. \n9  Each step in the Chevron analysis requires the court to consider the terms of the \n10  statute in context.  The court first looks to the statutory text, in light of prior agency and \n11  judicial interpretation—as explained at length above, although the court notes that judicial \n  12  and agency interpretation following the most-recent 1996 revision is not particularly \n a\ntruin\noro 13  relevant to understanding the meaning of the text as enacted in 1996.  Cf. Sec'y of the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 375 n.36 (1984) (the “view of a subsequent Congress \niD tc 15  . . . is not without persuasive value”). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The analysis is also informed to some degree by what Congress decided not to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  pass, in addition to what it specifically rejected.  “Congress does not intend sub silentio to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.”  \nN\n19  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 442–43; Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U.S. at 414 n.8 \n20  (rejecting construction of statute that would implement provision Conference Committee \n21  rejected); Bob Jones Univ., 461 U.S. at 600–01 (interpretation of statute informed by the \n22  fact that Congress had a “prolonged and acute awareness” of an established agency \n23  interpretation of a statute, considered the precise issue, and rejected bills to overturn the \n24  prevailing interpretation); see also Merrill Lynch, 456 U.S. at 381–82 (interpretation of \n25  statute informed by the fact that Congress amended large portions of statute, but not \n26  provision at issue). \n27  Of particular relevance here, parts of Congress have explicitly and repeatedly \n28  rejected efforts to define “public charge” to include those who receive certain in-kind \n45 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 46 of 93\n \n1  benefits for a period of 12 months—efforts that are strikingly similar to the definition now \n2  adopted for the first time by the executive in the Rule.  E.g., 142 Cong. Rec. 24313, \n3  24425 (1996); S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013); S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 63 (2013).  \n4  Congress’s rejection in 1996 is particularly instructive.  As described above, Congress at \n5  that time considered a scheme similar to the Rule, wherein use of means-tested benefits \n6  for 12 months would qualify one as a public charge.  On September 24, 1996, the \n7  conference committee recommended passage of a version of the bill with that definition.  \n8  See 142 Cong. Rec. 24389 (conference committee recommendation), 24425 (public \n9  charge definition).  President Clinton had previously praised the legislation generally, but \n10  specifically criticized that bill’s disincentive to obtain public benefits.  He called for \n11  revision of the statute.  He said “it still goes too far in denying legal immigrants access to \n  12  vital safety net programs which could jeopardize public health and safety.  Some work \n a\ntruin\noro 13  still needs to be done.  I urge the Congress to move quickly to finalize and send me this \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  key legislation.”  Statement on Senate Action on the “Immigration Control and Financial \niD tc 15  Responsibility Act of 1996”, President William J. Clinton, Weekly Compilation of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Presidential Documents Volume 32, Issue 18 (May 6, 1996) at p. 783.  On September 30, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  1996, the bill was signed into law, following the removal of the definition of public charge \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  that included use of means-tested public benefits.  This exchange, which deals with the \nN\n19  precise issue presented by this litigation, is particularly instructive not because of the \n20  president’s words but because of Congress’s response to those words—it intentionally \n21  considered and rejected a definition similar to what the Rule now proposes.  Afterall it is \n22  Congress, not the President, who is responsible for writing legislation. \n23  Given the term’s long-standing focus on the individual’s ability and willingness to \n24  work or otherwise support himself, and its longstanding allowance for short-term aid, and \n25  the legislative history of the 1996 revision, it is likely that the Rule’s interpretation defining \n26  anyone who receives any quantity of benefits for 12 months (or fewer) out of a floating \n27  36-month window as a public charge is not a permissible or reasonable construction of \n28  the statute.  For example, defendants do not contest that someone receiving less than 50 \n46 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 47 of 93\n \n1  cents per day—which is a standard SNAP benefit amount for recipients at the higher end \n2  of income eligibility, Shing Decl. ¶ 17—would be deemed a public charge under the Rule.  \n3  That could also be calculated as $182 over 36 months—or an average of less than 17 \n4  cents a day.  At no point over the long history described above could that have qualified \n5  one as a public charge, unless the bill for those charges was presented to the recipient \n6  and he refused to pay.  Moreover, the Rule’s double-counting of months where multiple \n7  benefits are received raises serious questions with respect to whether the Rule \n8  impermissibly considers temporary or short-term relief, receipt of which has never been \n9  sufficient to qualify someone as a public charge (absent repayment, following \n10  presentation of an invoice). \n11  Deciding otherwise would put this court at odds with persuasive Supreme Court \n  12  and Ninth Circuit precedent.  The Supreme Court has defined the term to allow exclusion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  only “on the ground of permanent personal objections accompanying them [the excluded \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  aliens] irrespective of local conditions[.]”  Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10.  In that case, “the \niD tc 15  aliens came from a remote province of Russia. They knew no trade. They knew no \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  language but their own. Only one could read or write in his own language. They had \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  sums aggregating slightly more than $25 each. They were not employed, and had no \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  promise of employment. They were ticketed through to Portland, Or., where, owing to \nN\n19  depressed labor conditions, the prospect of their obtaining work ‘was most unfavorable.’”  \n20  Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. at 916 (citing Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10).  Still, they \n21  were not likely to become public charges within the meaning of the statute.  The Ninth \n22  Circuit reaffirmed that definition following reorganization of the statute.  Id. (“change of \n23  location of the words does not change the meaning that should be given them”).  Since \n24  Gegiow and Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, Congress has not altered the term “public \n25  charge,” which the Ninth Circuit has defined standing alone, irrespective of its placement \n26  or context within the list of excluded persons in the statute.  The court therefore sees no \n27  good reason to depart from those precedential opinions, which suggest that an able-\n28  bodied, working-age individual who is willing to engage in honest work is not excludable \n47 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 48 of 93\n \n1  based on a prediction that he will become a public charge unless a particular reason can \n2  be articulated to exclude him.  This reasoning does not allow for exclusion based on the \n3  increasing generosity of society’s public assistance to provide for more than the barest \n4  requirements of subsistence.  Gegiow, in fact, explicitly precludes consideration of local \n5  labor conditions.  \n6  The likely unreasonableness of the rule is further demonstrated by just how \n7  expansive the definition is.  The history of the term, evidenced by its repeated verbatim \n8  reenactment, excluded those who were likely to become public charges based on \n9  poverty, or idiocy and poverty, or disease and poverty, etc.  But plaintiffs demonstrate \n10  that in a single year, roughly a quarter U.S.-born citizens receive one or more benefits \n11  used to define who is a public charge under the Rule.  And plaintiffs demonstrate that, \n  12  over the course of their lifetimes, about 40% of U.S.-born citizens are expected to receive \n a\ntruin\noro 13  one or more of those benefits.  Although these figures do not indicate what percent of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  U.S.-born citizens would actually be deemed public charges under the Rule (that would \niD tc 15  require determining how many individuals receive multiple benefits per month, in addition \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  to how many months benefits are received over any 3-year period), it suggests that the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Rule is substantially outside the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of the statute. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  With regard to plaintiffs’ claim that the Rule is not in accordance with law, for the \nN\n19  foregoing reasons, and given the above discussion of the term’s long-standing use and \n20  evolution in the immigration statutes, this court finds that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \n21  the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule’s definition of public charge is \n22  unreasonable and not based on a permissible construction of the statute, under the \n23  second prong of the Chevron analysis.15  Alternatively, plaintiffs have raised at least \n24  serious questions with respect to whether “the statute, read in context, unambiguously \n25  forecloses” the precise question at issue, namely DHS’s expansive interpretation of the \n26  term to include individuals willing and able work productively in the national economy, \n27 \n                                            \n15 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this question, they have \n28 \nundoubtedly raised serious questions with respect to it. \n48 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 49 of 93\n \n1  under the first prong of the Chevron analysis.  See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 137 S. \n2  Ct. 1562, 1572 (2017); see also Whitman v. Am. Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457, \n3  471 (2001) (finding a particular construction “unambiguously bar[red]” when “interpreted \n4  in its statutory and historical context”). \n5  b.  Not in Accordance with Law—Rehabilitation Act \n6  The Rehabilitation Act prohibits “any program or activity receiving federal financial \n7  assistance” or “any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency,” from \n8  excluding, denying benefits to, or discriminating against persons with disabilities.  29 \n9  U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n10  “To establish a violation of § 504 of the RA [Rehabilitation Act], a plaintiff must \n11  show that (1) she is handicapped within the meaning of the RA; (2) she is otherwise \n  12  qualified for the benefit or services sought; (3) she was denied the benefit or services \n a\ntruin\noro 13  solely by reason of her handicap; and (4) the program providing the benefit or services \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  receives federal financial assistance.”  Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. \niD tc 15  2002); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  solely by reason of her or his disability, be . . . subjected to discrimination under . . . any \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  program or activity conducted by any Executive agency”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  The States argue that the Rule will exclude some individuals solely based on \nN\n19  disability because a disability will predictably be responsible for a number of negative \n20  factors in some individuals:  (1) a negative health factor because the Rule adopts a \n21  definition of “health” that strongly overlaps with disability; (2) a negative factor if the \n22  applicant lacks private insurance; and (3) a negative factor if the applicant has received \n23  Medicaid for 12 of the last 36 months, even though use of Medicaid is common for the \n24  disabled because it covers services that no other insurer provides. \n25  Defendants first argue that the Rule’s multi-factor test means the Rehabilitation \n26  Act is not violated because disability cannot be the “sole” determinative factor.  Second, \n27  they argue that even if the statutes are in conflict, a specific, later statutory command—\n28  such as the INA’s requirement that the agency consider health—supersedes section \n49 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 50 of 93\n \n1  504’s general proscription. \n2  First, the Rehabilitation Act requires that a plaintiff show that a disabled person \n3  was denied services “solely” by reason of her disability.  The Rule does not deny any \n4  alien admission into the United States, or adjustment of status, “solely by reason of” \n5  disability.  All covered aliens, disabled or not, are subject to the same inquiry:  whether \n6  they are likely to use one or more covered federal benefits for the specified period of \n7  time.  Even though a disability is likely to be an underlying cause of some individuals \n8  qualifying for additional negative factors, it will not be the sole cause.  As such, disability \n9  is one non-dispositive factor.16   \n10  Second, the INA explicitly lists “health” as a factor that an officer “shall . . . \n11  consider” in making a public charge determination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  “Health” \n  12  includes an alien’s disability and whatever impact the disability may have on the alien’s \n a\ntruin\noro 13  expenses and ability to work.  Congress, not the Rule, requires DHS to take this factor \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  into account, and the caselaw has long considered this factor.  See, e.g., Knutzen v. \niD tc 15  Eben Ezer Lutheran Hous. Ctr., 815 F.2d 1343, 1353 (10th Cir. 1987) (section 504 may \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  not “revoke or repeal . . . a much more specific statute . . . absent express language by \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Congress”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  As such, plaintiffs have not demonstrated even serious questions going the merits \nN\n19  with respect to this claim. \n20  c.  Arbitrary and Capricious \n \n21  Section 4 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, prescribes a three-step \nprocedure  for  so-called  “notice-and-comment  rulemaking.”  \n22  First, the agency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of proposed rule \nmaking,”  ordinarily  by  publication  in  the  Federal \n23  Register.  § 553(b).  Second, if “notice [is] required,” the agency \nmust “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in \n24 \n                                            \n25 \n16 Plaintiffs’ citation to Lovell is unavailing.  They claim the case found a multi-factor test \nviolated the Act, “notwithstanding other factors” unrelated to disability.  But in Lovell, \n26 \ndefendants asked the court to look at a multifactored system, but the court declined and \ninstead looked at treatment of the disabled under a single program.  It was “undisputed \n27 \nthat disabled people who, but for their disability, were eligible for healthcare benefits from \nthe State under” that single program “were denied coverage because of the categorical \n28 \nexclusion of the disabled from” that program.  Lovell, 303 F.3d at 1053. \n50 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 51 of 93\n \nthe rule making through submission of written data, views, or \n1  arguments.”  § 553(c).  An agency must consider and respond \nto significant comments received during the period for public \n2  comment.  Third, when the agency promulgates the final rule, \nit must include in the rule's text “a concise general statement of \n3  [its] basis and purpose.”  § 553(c).  Rules issued through the \nnotice-and-comment  process  are  often  referred  to  as \n4  “legislative rules” because they have the “force and effect of \nlaw.”  Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281 (1979). \n5 \nPerez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1203 (2015) (citations omitted). \n6 \n“‘[A]rbitrary and capricious’ review under the APA focuses on the reasonableness \n7 \nof an agency’s decision-making processes.”  CHW W. Bay v. Thompson, 246 F.3d 1218, \n8 \n1223 (9th Cir. 2001).  Agency action is invalid if the agency fails to give adequate \n9 \nreasons for its decisions, fails to examine the relevant data, or offers no “rational \n10 \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \n11 \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see also Encino \n  12 \n a\ntruin Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125.  A rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has \noro 13 \nCf\n tila “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for \ncC\nirts fo 14  its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that \niD tc 15 \n seirt it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id. \ns\ntaiD 16 \nt\nS n Agencies are required to “reflect upon the information contained in the record and \n dre 17 \ne\nh\ntinrt grapple with contrary evidence.”  Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v. NLRB, 865 F.3d 630, 638 \nUo 18 \nN\n(D.C. Cir. 2017).  Where “the agency has failed to ‘examine the relevant data’ or failed to \n19 \n‘articulate a rational explanation for its actions,’” its decision is arbitrary and capricious. \n20 \nGenuine Parts Co. v. EPA, 890 F.3d 304, 311–12 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  And where an \n21 \nagency is uncertain about the effects of agency action, it may not rely on “‘substantial \n22 \nuncertainty’ as a justification for its actions.”  Greater Yellowstone Coal., Inc. v. Servheen, \n23 \n665 F.3d 1015, 1028 (9th Cir. 2011).  Instead, it must “rationally explain why the \n24 \nuncertainty” supports the chosen approach.  Id. (“Otherwise, we might as well be \n25 \ndeferring to a coin flip.”).  “[A]n internally inconsistent analysis is arbitrary and capricious.”  \n26 \nNat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. E.P.A., 788 F.3d 1134, 1141 (9th Cir. 2015). \n27 \nBut “[t]he scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow \n28 \n51 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 52 of 93\n \n1  and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \n2  Ass’n, 463 U.S. at 43; San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 581, \n3  601 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Although our inquiry must be thorough, the standard of review is \n4  highly deferential; the agency's decision is ‘entitled to a presumption of regularity,’ and \n5  we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.”).  An agency’s obligation to \n6  respond to comments on a proposed rulemaking is “not ‘particularly demanding.’”  Ass’n \n7  of Private Sector Colls. & Univs. v. Duncan, 681 F.3d 427, 441–42 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  \n8  “[T]he agency’s response to public comments need only ‘enable [courts] to see what \n9  major issues of policy were ventilated . . . and why the agency reacted to them as it did.’”  \n10  Pub. Citizen, Inc. v. FAA, 988 F.2d 186, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \n11  Rule changes face a higher burden when departing from prior policy:  \n \n a  12  Agencies are free to change their existing policies as long as \ntruin they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.  When an \noCrof 13  agency changes its existing position, it need not always provide \n tila a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new \ncC\nirts fo 14  pdoislpiclya yc raewaateredn oens sa  tbhlaatn kit  sisla cteh.a  nBguint gth peo asgiteionnc ya nmdu ssth oawt l ethaastt  \niD s tcir 15  there are good reasons for the new policy.  In explaining its \net changed  position,  an  agency  must  also  be  cognizant  that \ns\ntaiD 16  longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance \nt\nS \nn interests that must be taken into account.  In such cases it is \n dere 17  not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of \nh\nt\ninrt policy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for \nUoN 18  disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \nengendered by the prior policy.  It follows that an unexplained \n19  inconsistency  in  agency  policy  is  a  reason  for  holding  an \ninterpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from \n20  agency practice.  An arbitrary and capricious regulation of this \nsort is itself unlawful and receives no Chevron deference.  \n21   \n22  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125–26 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); \n23  accord F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (agency must \n24  “provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on \n25  a blank slate . . . when, for example, its new policy rests upon factual findings that \n26  contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered \n27  serious reliance interests that must be taken into account”). \n28  Plaintiffs raise numerous procedural challenges to the Rule.  The court addresses \n52 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 53 of 93\n \n1  them in two general categories.  First, the court considers plaintiffs arguments that DHS \n2  failed to adequately consider and address the Rule’s costs and benefits.  Second, the \n3  court considers plaintiffs’ remaining procedural challenges. \n4  i.  DHS Failed to Adequately Consider Costs and Benefits \n5  Plaintiffs argue that DHS failed to consider costs and benefits in three ways.  First, \n6  DHS failed to adequately consider significant costs to local and state governments raised \n7  in comments, as well as the related issue of DHS’s failure to consider evidence when \n8  estimating disenrollment figures.  Second, DHS failed to consider concerns about health \n9  effects like disease outbreaks.  Third, DHS acted impermissibly with respect to the \n10  burden the I-944 form would impose. \n11  Based on plaintiffs’ first and second arguments, discussed presently, this court \n  12  finds that they are likely to succeed on the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule \n a\ntruin\noro 13  is arbitrary and capricious.17   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  A.  Local and State Government Costs and \niD tc 15  Disenrollment Rates \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Plaintiffs argue that commenters documented the dangers to individuals and public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  health generally that stem from disenrollment in public benefits, and explained that local \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  and state governments will face higher costs because of this disenrollment.  See 84 Fed. \nN\n19  Reg. at 41,310-12 (explaining that “[m]any commenters particularly emphasized that \n20  disenrollment or foregoing enrollment would be detrimental to the financial stability and \n21  economy of communities, States, local organizations, hospitals, safety net providers, \n22  foundations, and healthcare centers”); id. at 41,469–70; Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, \n23  Dkt. 44, Exs. C–E (letters submitted in response to NPRM).  Numerous comments \n24  included specific cost calculations.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,475 (citing specific cost \n25  estimates from comments); Cho Decl., Ex. C at 22–23 (estimating losses to California at \n26  $1.76 billion in revenue from federal government and 17,700 jobs), Ex. J at 11 \n27 \n                                            \n17 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this claim, they have \n28 \nundoubtedly raised serious questions with respect to it. \n53 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 54 of 93\n \n1  (estimating that the Rule would cost hospitals more than $17 billion in uncompensated \n2  care), Ex. K at 5–7 (detailing expected costs to hospitals). \n3  Plaintiffs relatedly argue that DHS under-estimated disenrollment figures and the \n4  accompanying effects, including the effects on state and local governments.18  For \n5  example, despite its concession that the Rule will cause members of mixed-status \n6  households (i.e., those including U.S. citizens) to disenroll from benefits, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n7  41,300, DHS refused to consider the costs associated with such disenrollment, stating:  \n8  “DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens exempt from \n9  public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or forego \n10  enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule.  \n11  DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.”  Id. at 41,313.  \n  12  Defendants correctly argue that they are not required to quantify every potential \n a\ntruin\noro 13  cost and benefit and precisely weigh them out.  They respond to these challenges both in \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the Rule and before the court with three essential points.  First, DHS read the comments, \niD tc 15  but the forward-looking economic impact to states, cities, hospitals, and others was too \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  difficult to assess.  Second, with respect to the disenrollment of those who will not be \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  subject to a public charge assessment in the future, the Rule’s effect was too difficult to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  assess.  Third, even if DHS had assessed those costs, they would be outweighed by the \nN\n19  benefits of excluding aliens who would rely on public assistance, and of promoting self-\n20  sufficiency of aliens already in the United States.  Those benefits are in line with \n21  Congressional statements of policy. \n22  DHS was required to a certain extent to grapple with estimates and credible data \n23 \n                                            \n24 \n18 DHS argues that it’s 2.5% figure is not part of the regulatory analysis and cannot be \nchallenged because it was calculated pursuant to an executive order.  The court \n25 \ndisagrees.  See Council of Parent Attorneys & Advocates, Inc. v. DeVos, 365 F. Supp. 3d \n28, 54 n.11 (D.D.C. 2019) (“The government contended . . . that because its regulatory \n26 \nimpact analysis was conducted pursuant to Executive Orders, it is not subject to judicial \nreview. . . .  These arguments are contrary to D.C. Circuit precedent.  Because the \n27 \ngovernment relied on its cost-benefit analysis . . . a flaw in that analysis can render the \nregulation arbitrary and capricious.”).  \n28 \n \n54 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 55 of 93\n \n1  explained in the comments, and in turn explain why DHS chose not to credit them.  See \n2  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Zinke, 900 F.3d 1053, 1068–69 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding \n3  agency action arbitrary and capricious where the agency did not explain why it did not \n4  credit available data that did not support its action).  Defendants are correct that DHS \n5  was not required to parse costs and benefits precisely.  But to the extent the exact harms \n6  are unknown or difficult to predict, that does not justify “disregarding the effect entirely.” \n7  Pub. Citizen v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 374 F.3d 1209, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \n8  Here, even under the deferential APA analysis, DHS appears to have wholly failed \n9  to engage with this entire category of comments.  DHS failed to grapple with the Rule’s \n10  predictable effects on local governments, and instead concluded that the harms—\n11  whatever they may be—are an acceptable price to pay.  At minimum, the APA requires \n  12  more than reading public comments and responding with a general statement that, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  however correct the comments may be, the agency declines to consider the issues and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  costs identified because doing so would contravene the government’s favored policy. \niD tc 15  For example, under the heading “Increased Costs to Health Care Providers, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  States, and Localities,” the government summarized the comments it was responding to:   \nt\nS \nn  \n dere 17  Many commenters particularly emphasized that disenrollment \nh\nt\ninrt or foregoing enrollment would be detrimental to the financial \nUoN 18  stability  and  economy  of  communities,  States,  local \norganizations, hospitals, safety net providers, foundations, and \n19  healthcare  centers.  Commenters  offering  estimates  on  the \nnumber of people who would disenroll from Medicaid under the \n20  proposed  rule  warned  that  the  costs  associated  with  the \nresultant rise in uncompensated care would be borne by health \n21  systems, hospitals, and insured patients. \n22  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312.   \n23  The government’s response, in part, was: \n \n24  Response: With respect to the rule's potential “chilling effects” \nor  disenrollment  impacts,  DHS  notes  that  (1)  the  rule's \n25  overriding consideration, i.e., the Government's interest as set \nforth in PRWORA, is a sufficient basis to move forward; (2) it is \n26  difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts with respect \nto the regulated population, although DHS has attempted to do \n27  so in the accompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis; and \n(3) it is also difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts \n28  with  respect  to  people  who  are  not  regulated  by  this rule, \n55 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 56 of 93\n \nalthough,  again,  DHS  has  attempted  to  do  so  in  the \n1  accompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. \n \n2  First, as discussed above, this rule is rationally related to the \nGovernment's  interest,  as  set  forth  in  PRWORA,  to:  (1) \n3  Minimize the incentive of aliens who attempt to immigrate to, or \nadjust status in the United States due to the availability of public \n4  benefits; and (2) Promote the self-sufficiency of aliens within \nthe United States.  DHS has defined public benefits by focusing \n5  on cash assistance programs for income maintenance, and an \nexhaustive  list  of  non-cash  food,  housing,  and  healthcare, \n6  designed to meet basic living needs. This definition does not \ninclude benefits related exclusively to emergency response, \n7  immunization, education, or social services, nor does it include \nexclusively  state  and  local  non-cash  aid  programs.  DHS \n8  acknowledges that individuals subject to this rule may decline \nto enroll in, or may choose to disenroll from, public benefits for \n9  which they may be eligible under PRWORA, in order to avoid \nnegative consequences as a result of this final rule.  However, \n10  DHS has authority to take past, current, and likely future receipt \nof public benefits into account, even where it may ultimately \n11  result in discouraging aliens from receiving public benefits. \n \n a  12  Although  individuals  may  reconsider  their  receipt  of  public \ntruin benefits as defined by this rule in light of future immigration \noCrof 13  consequences,  this  rule  does  not  prohibit  an  alien  from \n tila obtaining a public benefit for which he or she is eligible. DHS \ncC\nirts fo 14  enxopneimctms itghraatn at lsietantsu sse ienk tihneg  Ulanwitfeudl p Setramteasn ewniltl  rmesaikdee nptu srtpaotusse fourl  \niD s tcir 15  and  well-informed  decisions  commensurate  with  the \net immigration  status  they  are  seeking.  But  regardless, DHS \ns\ntaiD 16  declines  to  limit  the  effect  of  the  rulemaking  to  avoid  the \nt\nS \nn possibility that individuals subject to this rule may disenroll or \n dere 17  choose not to enroll, as self-sufficiency is the rule's ultimate \nh\nt\ninrt aim. \nUoN 18   \nSecond, DHS finds it difficult to predict how this rule will affect \n19  aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, \nbecause data limitations provide neither a precise count nor \n20  reasonable estimate of the number of aliens who are both \nsubject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and are \n21  eligible for public benefits in the United States.  This difficulty is \ncompounded by the fact that most applicants subject to the \n22  public charge ground of inadmissibility and therefore this rule \nare  generally  unlikely  to  suffer  negative  consequences \n23  resulting from past receipt of public benefits because they will \nhave been residing outside of the United States and therefore, \n24  ineligible to have ever received public benefits. \n \n25  . . . .  \n \n26  Third, DHS finds it difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment \nimpacts with respect to people who are not regulated by this \n27  rule, such as people who erroneously believe themselves to be \naffected. . . . This rule does not prohibit or otherwise discourage \n28  individuals  who  are  not  subject  to  the  public  charge \n56 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 57 of 93\n \ninadmissibility from receiving any public benefits for which they \n1  are eligible. \n \n2  . . . .  \n \n3  Because DHS will not consider the receipt of public benefits by \nU.S.  citizens  and  aliens  not  subject  to  public  charge \n4  inadmissibility,  the  receipt  of  public  benefits  by  these \nindividuals will not be counted against or made attributable to \n5  immigrant  family  members  who  are  subject  to  this  rule. \nAccordingly, DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for \n6  U.S.  citizens  and  aliens  exempt  from  public  charge \ninadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or \n7  forego enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals \nare not subject to this rule. DHS will not alter this rule to account \n8  for such unwarranted choices. \n \n9  DHS appreciates the potential effects of confusion regarding \nthe rule's scope and effect, as well as the potential nexus \n10  between  public  benefit  enrollment  reduction  and  food \ninsecurity,  housing  scarcity,  public health and  vaccinations, \n11  education  health-based  services,  reimbursement  to  health \nproviders,  and  increased  costs  to  states  and  localities.  In \n a  12  response to comments, DHS will also issue clear guidance that \ntruin identifies the groups of individuals who are not subject to this \noCrof 13  rule,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  U.S.  citizens,  lawful \n tila permanent residents returning from a trip abroad who are not \ncC\nirts fo 14  c onsidered applicants for admission, and refugees. \niD s tcir 15  . . . .  \net  \ns\ntaiD 16  In sum, DHS does not believe that it is sound policy to ignore \nt\nS \nn the longstanding self-sufficiency goals set forth by Congress or \n dere 17  to admit or grant adjustment of status applications of aliens who \nh\nt\ninrt are likely to receive public benefits designated in this rule to \nUoN 18  meet their basic living needs in an [sic] the hope that doing so \nmight  alleviate food and  housing  insecurity,  improve  public \n19  health,  decrease  costs  to  states  and  localities,  or  better \nguarantee health care provider reimbursements. . . .  DHS \n20  believes that it will ultimately strengthen public safety, health, \nand  nutrition  through  this  rule  by  denying  admission  or \n21  adjustment of status to aliens who are not likely to be self-\nsufficient. \n22   \n23  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312–14 (footnotes omitted). \n24  That answer entirely fails to discuss costs being borne by the states, hospitals, or \n25  others, other than to say DHS will issue guidance in an effort to mitigate confusion.  The \n26  answer discusses disenrollment rates being difficult to measure, but flatly refuses to \n27  account for certain types of disenrollment (for example those who “erroneously believe \n28  themselves to be affected” and make “unwarranted choices”).  DHS’s response \n57 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 58 of 93\n \n1  constitutes a thinly-veiled abdication of the responsibility to consider the issue.  Rather \n2  than engage, the response simply elides the issue that the APA requires consideration of. \n3  Ending the analysis with the conclusion that “DHS believes that it will ultimately \n4  strengthen public safety, health, and nutrition through this rule” fails to show that DHS \n5  “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action \n6  including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Encino \n7  Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 43); \n8  Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. F.C.C., 755 F.3d 702, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“Though an \n9  agency’s predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule are entitled to \n10  deference, deference to such judgments must be based on some logic and evidence, not \n11  sheer speculation.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  DHS fails to explain \n  12  how those benefits will come about with any evidentiary support.  In fact, ample evidence \n a\ntruin\noro 13  cited in the comments shows exactly the opposite—that use of public benefits improves \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  public health and welfare.  DHS’s bare assertion to the contrary simply is not enough to \niD tc 15  satisfy its obligations.  Even ignoring the fact that the conclusion lacks a reasoned \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  explanation of how it was reached, DHS also fails to address why the supposed benefits \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  will outweigh the likely costs (DHS had at this point already declined to discuss what the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  likely costs are in fact are).  Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that, with respect to \nN\n19  consideration of costs imposed on states and localities by the Rule, DHS offers no “path \n20  [that] may reasonably be discerned” in its reasoning.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n, 463 U.S. \n21  at 43. \n22  Moreover, DHS may not discount an undisputed impact of the Rule simply \n23  because DHS believes it is “unwarranted.”  See Michigan, 135 S. Ct. at 2707 \n24  (“reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the \n25  disadvantages of agency decisions”).  DHS flatly refused to consider the costs associated \n26  with predicted, likely disenrollment of those not subject to the public charge determination \n27  by stating:  “DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens \n28  exempt from public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or \n58 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 59 of 93\n \n1  forgo enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule.  \n2  DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n3  41,313.  But DHS’s disagreement with the source of a cost does not make it go away, \n4  and it does not discharge DHS’s obligation to consider it.  DHS must consider the costs \n5  of widespread disenrollment that it anticipates—it cannot ignore costs by calling their \n6  causes “unwarranted.”  Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that DHS understood that \n7  individuals would disenroll even though they are not subject to the public charge \n8  determination, yet DHS refused to consider that cost entirely.  Doing so would have been \n9  arbitrary and capricious.  Michigan, 135 S. Ct. at 2707 (“‘cost’ includes more than the \n10  expense of complying with regulations; any disadvantage could be termed a cost. . . .  \n11  Consideration of cost reflects the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily \n  12  requires paying attention to the advantages and the disadvantages of agency \n a\ntruin\noro 13  decisions.”); accord Metlife, Inc. v.

Health Effects \n22  Plaintiffs argue that DHS ignored comments describing how loss of benefits would \n23  trigger negative health consequences, including the spread of disease and aggravation of \n24  chronic illness.  DHS received ample commentary regarding this issue.  See, e.g., 84 \n25  Fed. Reg. at 41,384 (summarizing certain comments); Cho Decl., Ex. M at 4 (Kaiser \n26  Permanente comment linking the rule’s impacts on prescription adherence with increased \n27  chance of outbreaks of communicable disease), Ex. N at 9 (Pub. Health Inst. Comment:  \n28  “We cannot achieve universally agreed upon public health goals, such as reducing \n59 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 60 of 93\n \n1  chronic diseases throughout the U.S., when we directly or indirectly deny large segments \n2  of our population the very building blocks they need for good health”), Ex. O at 4 (Nat’l \n3  Assoc. Ped. Nurse Practitioners comment discussing “worse health outcomes”), P at 7 \n4  (Children’s HealthWatch comment warning of “increased prevalence of communicable \n5  diseases”). \n6  Defendants offer the same general defenses in response.  First, DHS read the \n7  comments, but the forward-looking impact to health was too difficult to assess.  Second, \n8  even if DHS had assessed those costs, they would be outweighed by the benefits of \n9  excluding aliens who would rely on public benefits and promoting self-sufficiency of aliens \n10  already in the United States.  Those benefits are in line with Congressional statements of \n11  policy. \n  12  Relevantly here, similar negative health outcomes were a key rationale for prior \n a\ntruin\noro 13  agency action.  When issuing the 1999 guidance, INS described its primary motivation “to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  reduce the negative public health consequences generated by the existing confusion.”  \niD tc 15  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689; see also id. at 28,692 (adopting regulation on an interim basis \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  because “confusion . . . has deterred eligible [immigrants] and their families, including \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits,” and that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, \nN\n19  but on public health and the general welfare”).  In reversing the 1999 guidance, \n20  defendants must “‘display awareness that it is changing position’ and ‘show that there are \n21  good reasons for the new policy.’”  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (quoting FCC v. \n22  Fox, 556 U.S. at 515).  Moreover, where the prior policy engendered reliance, “a \n23  reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay \n24  or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. \n25  Under the heading “Vaccinations,” the government summarized the comments it \n26  was responding to:   \n \n27  Commenters indicated that the public charge rule would make \nimmigrant  families  afraid  to  seek  health-care,  including \n28  vaccinations against communicable diseases, and therefore, \n60 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 61 of 93\n \nendanger the U.S. population. . . . .  The commenter indicated \n1  that engaging  with the public health system was critical to \nensuring robust immunization to protect the population overall; \n2  if a subset of the community were fearful to access government \nhealthcare services, regardless of whether a specific type of \n3  service  qualified  for  a  narrow  exception,  it  would  have  a \nsignificant impact on the country's ability to protect and promote \n4  the public health.  Another commenter indicated that its health \ndepartment anticipated that promulgation of the rule, as written \n5  in the NPRM, will result in decreased utilization of children's \nhealthcare, including vaccinations, which will increase the risk \n6  for vaccine preventable diseases . . . increasing the likelihood \nof an outbreak.   \n7   \nSome commenters stated that since many immigrants live in \n8  communities  alongside  people  of  the  same  national  origin, \nreduced vaccinations could result in unvaccinated or under-\n9  vaccinated clusters of individuals.  Commenters warned that \nresearch shows that uninsured individuals are much less likely \n10  to be vaccinated.  One commenter stated that a recent study \nfound that even a five percent reduction in vaccine coverage \n11  could trigger a significant measles outbreak. . . .  Another \ncommenter stated that the rule would increase the incidence of \n a  12  childhood  diseases  like  chickenpox,  measles,  mumps  and \ntruin rubella and deter parents from vaccinating their children. \noCrof 13   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384. \niD tc 15  The government’s response was: \n sir\net  \ns\ntaiD 16  With this rulemaking, DHS does not intend to restrict the access \nt\nS \nn of  vaccines  for  children  or  adults  or  intend  to  discourage \n dere 17  individuals from obtaining the necessary vaccines to prevent \nh\nt\ninrt vaccine-preventable diseases.  The purpose of this rulemaking \nUoN 18  is to ensure that those seeking admission to the United States \nare self-sufficient and rely on themselves or family and friends \n19  for  support  instead  of  relying  on  the  government  for \nsubsistence.  As noted above, this final rule does not consider \n20  receipt of Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a person's \npregnancy, to constitute receipt of public benefits.  This should \n21  address a substantial portion, though not all, of the vaccinations \nissue. \n22   \nVaccinations obtained through public benefits programs are not \n23  considered public benefits under 8 CFR 212.21(b), although if \nan  alien  enrolls  in  Medicaid  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining \n24  vaccines, the Medicaid itself qualifies as a public benefit.  DHS \nalso  notes  that  free  or  low  cost  vaccines  are  available  to \n25  children  who  are  not  insured  or  underinsured  through  the \nVaccines for Children (VFC) Program.  In addition, local health \n26  centers  and  state  health  departments  provide  preventive \nservices that include vaccines that may be offered on a sliding \n27  scale fee based on income.  Therefore, DHS believes that \nvaccines would still be available for children and adults even if \n28  they disenroll from Medicaid. \n61 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 62 of 93\n \n1  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384–85 (footnotes omitted). \n2  DHS’s response to the comments was essentially that it understood that fewer \n3  people would get vaccines following the Rule, which would present a risk, but there are \n4  ways to get vaccines without Medicaid.  As a result, DHS acknowledged that fewer \n5  people will get vaccines, but it failed engage at all in the consequences of that fact.   \n6  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success based upon this argument.  \n7  This change departs from a longstanding prior policy, as explained in the 1999 Field \n8  Guidance, that is likely to have engendered reliance.  That guide explained that certain \n9  rules were needed because uncertainty had “deterred eligible aliens and their families, \n10  including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits[, \n11  which] . . . has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but on public \n  12  health and the general welfare.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692 (emphasis added).  Given that \n a\ntruin\noro 13  the 1999 Field Guidance was both longstanding precedent and specifically concerned \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  benefits supporting general public health (not simple health of the aliens—e.g., vaccines), \niD tc 15  DHS must provide “a reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  FCC v. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515–16; \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  accord Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (“an unexplained inconsistency in agency \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  policy is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change \nN\n19  from agency practice”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n20  Although DHS acknowledged departure from the 1999 Field Guidance as a \n21  general matter (e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,307–08), DHS simply declined to engage with \n22  certain, identified public-health consequences of the Rule.  It made no attempt, \n23  whatsoever, to investigate the type or magnitude of harm that would flow from the reality \n24  which it admittedly recognized would result—fewer people would be vaccinated.  Instead, \n25  and just as with its refusal to consider “unwarranted” choices to disenroll from Medicaid \n26  discussed above, DHS responded only that it “believes that vaccines would still be \n27  available” through some other channels.  The response is devoid of rationale, but \n28  additionally it fails entirely to provide a reasoned explanation for disregarding the facts \n62 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 63 of 93\n \n1  and circumstances underlying the prior policy. \n2  C.  Form I-944 \n3  Plaintiffs argue that defendants’ estimate of the time and cost burden that the new \n4  Form I-944, entitled Declaration of Self Sufficiency, will have on applicants is implausible.  \n5  They argue that the Rule provides too-low of an estimate for the time required to fill out \n6  the form, based on its estimate about the time it takes to fill out another related form.  \n7  They argue that DHS did not adequately consider the differences between the forms \n8  when arriving at their estimate.  Yet DHS considered and responded to comments \n9  regarding the time commitment required by Form I-944.  In response DHS modified the \n10  form, removed some duplicative questions, and explained that it is important to be filed \n11  separately because it is filed by the immigrant himself.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,484.  Plaintiffs \n  12  have not demonstrated a likelihood of success or serious questions with respect to this \n a\ntruin\noro 13  argument. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  ii.  Other Challenges \niD tc 15  Plaintiffs raise a number of other procedural challenges under the APA.  The court \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  finds that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or serious \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  questions with respect to any, and it will address some of them briefly. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs argue that the Rule stops treating sponsors’ affidavits of support as \nN\n19  sufficient assurance that immigrant applicants will not become overly dependent on \n20  public benefits, yet Congress specified in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii) that the executive \n21  simply “may also” consider such affidavits.  Although plaintiffs argue that in practice \n22  USCIS has accepted affidavits of support as conclusive, the controlling statute and 1999 \n23  Field Guidance make clear that this is not a change in policy.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at \n24  28,690 (“Where such an AOS has been filed on an alien's behalf, it should be considered \n25  along with the statutory factors in the public charge determination.”). \n26  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because DHS included an exemption for \n27  individuals under the age of 21 who receive Medicaid benefits, but did not include a \n28  similar exemption for individuals under the age of 21 who receive SNAP benefits.  DHS \n63 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 64 of 93\n \n1  considered this issue and provided a reasoned explanation for providing Medicaid to \n2  children, including that it can provide funding for “in-school health services and serve as \n3  an important way to ensure that children receive the vaccines needed to protect public \n4  health and welfare.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,380.   \n5  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because the statute requires consideration \n6  of “education and skills” and “health,” but the Rule requires a much more searching \n7  inquiry into health than education and skills.  For example, the Rule considers details \n8  about an individual’s health insurance, benefits receipt, and financial status of household \n9  members, but inconsistently fails to take into account admission or attendance in a \n10  college or trade school.  But the Rule in fact allows for consideration of admission or \n11  attendance in a college or trade school, and DHS adequately addressed these issues in \n  12  response to comments.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,436 (“the exact nature of the education \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (or lack thereof) and employment would have to be considered”). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because it considers past immigration-\niD tc 15  related fee waivers, which may be submitted before a noncitizen is legally eligible to work \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  and as a result punish that individual for applying to work legally.  DHS adequately \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  responded, noting that “[s]ince fee waivers are based on an inability to pay, seeking or \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  obtaining a fee waiver for an immigration benefit suggests an inability to be self-\nN\n19  sufficient.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,424–25. \n20  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because Medicaid use by pregnant women \n21  or children (who are not penalized for using Medicaid under the rule) is counted against \n22  them, because Medicaid is not counted as an asset that could offset the negative factor \n23  of their illness that Medicaid is paying to treat.  Plaintiffs argue that is not consistent, \n24  because private insurance is considered an asset.  Defendants argue that the Rule does \n25  not count a severe medical condition as a heavily weighed negative factor if the alien has \n26  “the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to such \n27  medical condition,” and such “financial resources” can include Medicaid benefits for those \n28  pregnant or under 21.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,504 (“resources . . . to pay for reasonably \n64 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 65 of 93\n \n1  foreseeable medical costs” includes “health insurance not designated as a public benefit \n2  under 8 CFR 212.21(b)”). \n3  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because an income of 125% of the federal \n4  poverty guideline rate counts as a positive factor, yet individuals whose incomes exceed \n5  that qualify for non-cash benefits considered under the Rule.  But not all factors in a \n6  multifactor test are required to align in outcome to be rational. \n7  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because while it considers large family size as \n8  a negative factor in a public charge assessment, DHS’s own data indicates that non-cash \n9  benefit is higher among families of three than families of four, and that noncitizens’ use of \n10  cash benefits decreases as family size grows.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,395.  The parties \n11  appear to disagree about which studies are “good studies” here, but DHS’s response \n  12  explained its interpretation of the studies and concluded that “the data properly reflects \n a\ntruin\noro 13  that receipt of noncash benefits generally increases with an increase in family size.”  Id. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it considers the mere application for \niD tc 15  benefits in the public charge determination.  Plaintiffs argue that an application for \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  benefits does not indicate a noncitizen is actually financially and otherwise eligible for the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  benefit or will decide to use the benefit.  DHS reasonably explained that an “application \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  for a public benefit is not the same as receipt but is indicative of an alien's intent to \nN\n19  receive such a benefit.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422.   \n20  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it is ultimately a vague and entirely \n21  unpredictable framework for weighing the statutorily-authorized and newly-added factors, \n22  which results in limitless discretion.  The precise nature of the procedural challenge is \n23  unclear here, but the underlying statute requires consideration of “at minimum” five \n24  factors, and then specifically mentions another factor that “may” be considered.  \n25  Moreover, the statute specifically targets those who are likely to be a public charge “in the \n26  opinion of the Attorney General,” who as DHS recognized has long been given discretion \n27  to make such determinations under the statute.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,398 (“DHS notes that \n28  officer discretion is not a new concept in USCIS immigration benefits adjudications.”). \n65 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 66 of 93\n \n1  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because some factors are actually \n2  determinative, and impossible to overcome because the factors significantly overlap.  As \n3  a result, the Rule funnels officials’ decision-making towards favoring high-income \n4  individuals at the expense of the poor and other marginalized groups.  To the extent \n5  plaintiffs challenge the Rule favoring admission of the wealthy over the poor, the plaintiffs’ \n6  appropriate target is the underlying statute rather than the Rule implementing it.  The \n7  statute itself calls for consideration of a number of factors, ultimately aimed at excluding \n8  from the country a group comprised of those who are more likely to be poor than rich. \n9  d.  Zone of Interests \n10  In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of \n11  the statute that forms the basis of their challenge.  The zone of interests analysis asks \n  12  “whether Congress created a private cause of action in legislation” (Organized Vill. of \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Kake v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015)), such that “this particular \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute” (Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. \niD tc 15  Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014)).  It is “not a question of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Article III standing” (Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964), but rather is more \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  appropriately assessed with plaintiffs’ likelihood of success.19   \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “[A] person suing under the APA must satisfy not only Article III's standing \nN\n19  requirements, but an additional test:  The interest he asserts must be ‘arguably within the \n20  zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute’ that he says was \n21  violated.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v.

In the APA context, “[t]he ‘zone of interest’ test is a \n24  guide for deciding whether, in view of Congress’ evident intent [when enacting the APA] \n25  to make agency action presumptively reviewable, a particular plaintiff should be heard to \n26 \n                                            \n19 The “zone of interests” requirement was formerly referred to as an assessment of \n27 \n“prudential standing,” but “prudential standing is a misnomer as applied to the zone-of-\ninterests analysis[.]”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord \n28 \nOrganized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964 (9th Cir. 2015). \n66 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 67 of 93\n \n1  complain of a particular agency decision.  In cases where the plaintiff is not itself the \n2  subject of the contested regulatory action, the test denies a right of review if the plaintiff’s \n3  interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \n4  statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.  \n5  The test is not meant to be especially demanding; in particular, there need be no \n6  indication of congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”  Clarke v. Sec. \n7  Indus. Ass'n, 479 U.S. 388, 399–400 (1987) (footnote omitted); see also Pottawatomi \n8  Indians, 567 U.S. at 225–26 (2012). \n9  “Whether a plaintiff comes within the ‘zone of interests’ is an issue that requires us \n10  to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively \n11  conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. \n  12  at 127.  “In answering this question, we recognize that ‘the breadth of the [applicable] \n a\ntruin\noro 13  zone of interests varies according to the provisions of law at issue.’”  Sierra Club v. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Trump, 929 F.3d 670, 700 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130).  “When the \niD tc 15  [Supreme] Court has applied the zone of interests test in APA actions, however, it has \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  analyzed the zone of interests of the statute the agency is alleged to have violated, not \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  any zone of interests of the APA itself.”  Id. at 702; accord Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  1002, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  Nevertheless, “when analyzing whether a plaintiff falls \nN\n19  within the zone of interests of a particular statute, courts should be particularly lenient if a \n20  violation of that statute is being asserted through an APA claim.”  Id. at 703 n.26; accord \n21  Pottawatomi Indians, 567 U.S. at 225  (“we have always conspicuously included the word \n22  ‘arguably’ in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes to the plaintiff”); Pit \n23  River Tribe v.

Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997).  Put differently, “the \n8  plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of ... falls within the ‘zone of interests' \n9  sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for \n10  his complaint.”  Id. at 176 (quoting Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990)) \n11  (citing Air Courier Conference v. Postal Workers, 498 U.S. 517, 523–24 (1991)).  For \n  12  example, an allegation that § 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act was violated \n a\ntruin\noro 13  considers whether plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of § 4 itself, not “the overall \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act of 1962[.]”  Id.

Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529–\n27  30 (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 886) (citing Clarke, 479 U.S. at 388).  For example, when \n28  the challenged statutory section operates as an enumerated exception to another \n68 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 69 of 93\n \n1  section, the court may consider both sections when determining whether a plaintiff falls \n2  within the zone of interests of the challenged section.  Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401 \n3  (considering related statutory section to which challenged statute was an exception); \n4  accord Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529 (recognizing the exception in Clarke as \n5  limited:  “This statement [that the court may look beyond the specific challenged section], \n6  like all others in our opinions, must be taken in the context in which it was made.  In the \n7  next paragraph of the opinion, the Court pointed out that 12 U.S.C. § 36, which the \n8  plaintiffs in that case claimed had been misinterpreted by the Comptroller, was itself ‘a \n9  limited exception to the otherwise applicable requirement of [12 U.S.C.] § 81,’ . . . .  Thus \n10  the zone-of-interests test was to be applied not merely in the light of § 36, which was the \n11  basis of the plaintiffs' claim on the merits, but also in the light of § 81, to which § 36 was \n  12  an exception.”). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  i.  The County and State Plaintiffs \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The County and State plaintiffs’ interests are squarely within the challenged \niD tc 15  statute’s zone of interests.  For example, that statute allows the Attorney General to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  consider an affidavit of support under 8 U.S. Code § 1183a when determining whether to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  exclude an alien as a likely public charge.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).  Although \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  distinct, Section 1183a is specifically referred to and incorporated into the public charge \nN\n19  analysis set out in the challenged statute.  As a result, § 1183a has an integral \n20  relationship with § 1182(a)(4), such that it should be considered when determining \n21  whether plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of the challenged statute. \n22  Section 1183a explains that someone can sponsor an alien by guaranteeing to \n23  financially support him, and thereby alleviate the concern that he may become a public \n24  charge.  That statute also provides that any such sponsorship can only be considered in \n25  the public charge analysis if it is supported by an affidavit that is “legally enforceable \n26  against the sponsor by . . . any State (or any political subdivision of such State), or by any \n27  other entity that provides any means-tested public benefit[.]”  § 1183a(a)(1)(B); see also \n28  § 1183a(b)(1)(A) (“Upon notification that a sponsored alien has received any means-\n69 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 70 of 93\n \n1  tested public benefit, the . . .  appropriate entity of the Federal Government, a State, or \n2  any political subdivision of a State shall request reimbursement by the sponsor in an \n3  amount which is equal to the unreimbursed costs of such benefit.”).  Moreover, the \n4  sponsor must agree to submit to jurisdiction in state courts for actions to compel \n5  reimbursement of benefits those states paid to the alien.  §§ 1183a(a)(1)(C), (e)(2). \n6  By recognizing that states (and political subdivisions of states) would be paying \n7  means-tested public benefits to those subject to a public charge analysis, requiring that \n8  states and their subdivisions have legally-enforceable rights to recover those expenses \n9  when an alien is admitted based on consideration of an affidavit of support, and \n10  guaranteeing state-court jurisdiction for such enforcement actions, Congress clearly \n11  intended to protect states and their political subdivisions with the challenged statute.   \n  12  Moreover, given the attention paid to states’ rights to recover payment of “any \n a\ntruin\noro 13  means-tested public benefit” from affiants in § 1183a, it is also more than arguable that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Congress intended to protect states and their political subdivisions’ coffers when \niD tc 15  providing for the exclusion of any alien “likely at any time to become a public charge” in \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  the first place.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  So, the State and County plaintiffs’ financial \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interests are also at least arguably protected by the statute for this independent reason. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Therefore, the States’ and Counties’ interests are more than arguably related to \nN\n19  the challenged statute’s purpose, and they satisfy the zone-of-interests requirement.  \n20  ii.  The Organizations \n21  The Organizations move for an injunction based on one claim that the Rule \n22  violates the APA because it is substantively contrary to the term “public charge” as used \n23  in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), and a related procedural APA claim based on the same \n24  underlying statute.  As such, the Organizations must be within that statute’s zone of \n25  interest. \n26  Their papers argue that they are within the statute’s zone of interests for three \n27  reasons.  First, the Rule itself counts health care providers and nonprofit organizations \n28  among those who will be affected by it.  Second, plaintiffs’ interests in serving low-\n70 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 71 of 93\n \n1  income, immigrant communities by providing medical or legal services and advice are \n2  related to and consistent with the statute’s purpose to provide procedures and policies for \n3  immigration relief.  Third, and relatedly, the Ninth Circuit has recently held that similar \n4  plaintiffs are within the INA’s zone of interests. \n5  First, the Organizations argue the Rule itself contemplates that organizations like \n6  them will be adversely affected by it.  But being negatively affected by a rule \n7  implementing a statute is not sufficient to establish that the statute conferred a cause of \n8  action encompassing that plaintiff’s claim.  The Organizations’ argument that they will be \n9  hurt by the Rule speaks to their standing to challenge it, rather than whether they are \n10  within the statute’s zone of interest.  See Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 524 (“injury \n11  in fact does not necessarily mean one is within the zone of interests to be protected by a \n  12  given statute”); see also Lujan, 497 U.S. at 883 (“for example, the failure of an agency to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  comply with a statutory provision requiring ‘on the record’ hearings would assuredly have \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  an adverse effect upon the company that has the contract to record and transcribe the \niD tc 15  agency's proceedings; but since the provision was obviously enacted to protect the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  interests of the parties to the proceedings and not those of the reporters, that company \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would not be ‘adversely affected within the meaning’ of the statute”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Second, the Organizations argue that their interests align with the statute.  Yet \nN\n19  their briefing failed to identify or explain what statutory provisions support their argument.  \n20  That failure is fatal given the Supreme Court’s direction that the zone of interests analysis \n21  “requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a \n22  legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  \n23  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127.  When asked at the hearing what specific statutory provisions \n24  they are relying upon, the Organizations for the first time identified 8 U.S.C. § 1611.  That \n25  section outlines the federal public benefits for which aliens are eligible.  But the \n26  Organizations do not assert a challenge based on a violation of § 1611, and it is not at all \n27  clear that § 1611 has “any integral relationship with” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) such that it is \n28  proper for the court to consider it in the zone of interests inquiry.  See Air Courier \n71 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 72 of 93\n \n1  Conference, 498 U.S. at 529 (without a particular reason to suggest otherwise, sections \n2  within the same act are not sufficiently related); cf. Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401 (considering \n3  related statutory section to which challenged statute was an exception).   \n4  Even if the court were to consider § 1611, the Organizations leave the court to \n5  guess at what connection those statutory provisions share, much less how 8 U.S.C. \n6  § 1182(a)(4) is related to the Organizations’ purposes in light of § 1611.  Finally, the \n7  Organizations do not even explain how their interests are more than marginally related to \n8  § 1611 itself—which does not even “give institutions like the Organizations a role[.]”  E. \n9  Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 769.   \n10  At this stage of litigation, the Organizations have not met their burden to \n11  demonstrate that there are serious questions concerning whether they are within the \n  12  challenged statute’s zone of interest, and certainly they have failed to demonstrate a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  likelihood that they are able to bring the APA actions underlying their present motion. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Taking a step back, the Organizations simply fail to explain how their interests \niD tc 15  relate to § 1182(a)(4)’s purpose of excluding immigrants likely to become public charges.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  This may be because the Organizations identify, without explanation, the statute’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  purpose as providing “procedures and policies for immigration relief.”  That may be based \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  on an argument about the INA’s overall statutory purpose, untethered to the statutory \nN\n19  challenge underlying this motion.  In support of that argument, the Organizations rely on \n20  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771.  But the statute at issue in that action concerned \n21  asylum seekers, and the very statute underlying that challenge contained a provision \n22  requiring the Attorney General to refer asylum seekers to pro bono legal aid \n23  organizations, such as the plaintiff entities in that action.  The court identified specific \n24  references to the role of pro bono legal organizations within the challenged statute itself, \n25  and it found that was sufficient.  That is very different from the facts presented here.  See \n26  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 (“Within the asylum statute [underlying the \n27  preliminary injunction, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)], Congress took steps to ensure that pro \n28  bono legal services of the type that the Organizations provide are available to asylum \n72 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 73 of 93\n \n1  seekers.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A)–(B)”).20   \n2  2.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm \n3  The three distinct issues of (i) standing, (ii) ripeness, and (iii) irreparable harm in \n4  the absence of an injunction are supported by the same factual analysis for each plaintiff.  \n5  Although each of the three requirements is independent for plaintiffs to succeed on this \n6  motion, a finding that plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an \n7  injunction here is sufficient to establish standing and ripeness.  For the Organizations, the \n8  court assesses only standing and ripeness. \n9  The court first addresses the legal standards, and then assesses each plaintiff’s \n10  demonstrated harms. \n11  a.  Legal Standards \n  12  i.  Standing \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, see U.S. Const. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Art. III, § 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the law ought to be or \niD tc 15  affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937).  Article III's “standing” requirements limit the court’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  subject matter jurisdiction.  See Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  2004).  The burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the claim.  \nN\n19  Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991).   \n20  The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.  First, \n21  the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected \n22  interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not \n23  conjectural or hypothetical.  Second, there must be a causal connection between the \n24  injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the \n25 \n                                            \n20 To the extent the Organizations argue that E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771 allows \n26 \nthis court to look to unrelated provisions in the INA for a section justifying their interest in \nthe action, the court is at a loss as how to how reconcile that interpretation with Bennett, \n27 \n520 U.S. at 175–76, Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529, and Pit River Tribe, 793 \nF.3d at 1157.

Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, \n3  that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v.

Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). \n6  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief \n7  requested, and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with \n8  the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \n9  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 763–64 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n10  At this preliminary stage, plaintiffs “may rely on the allegations in their Complaint and \n11  whatever other evidence they submitted in support of their” motion to meet their \n  12  burden.  Id. at 764.  They “need only establish a risk or threat of injury to satisfy the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  actual injury requirement.”  Id. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Organizations can establish standing two different ways. \niD tc 15  First, “Organizations can demonstrate organizational standing by showing that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  challenged ‘practices have perceptibly impaired [their] ability to provide the services [they \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  were] formed to provide.’”  Id. at 765.  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  establish organizational standing for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, \nN\n19  independent of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization's goals and \n20  requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise \n21  would spend in other ways.”  Id.

Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs established \n a\ntruin\noro 13  organizational standing by declaring that enforcement of a regulation “frustrated their \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  mission of providing legal aid” to asylum applicants by “significantly discourage[ing] a \niD tc 15  large number of those individuals from seeking asylum given their ineligibility.”  932 F.3d \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  at 766.  That regulation would require plaintiffs “to partially convert their affirmative \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  asylum practice into a removal defense program, an overhaul that would require \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  ‘developing new training materials’ and ‘significant training of existing staff.’”  Id.  “Finally, \nN\n19  the [plaintiff] Organizations have each undertaken, and will continue to undertake, \n20  education and outreach initiatives regarding the new rule, efforts that require the \n21  diversion of resources away from other efforts to provide legal services to their local \n22  immigrant communities.”  Id. \n23  Second, “Organizations can demonstrate organizational standing by showing that \n24  the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding.

Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs established \n2  organizational standing by declaring that they received a large portion of their funding \n3  based on the number of asylum applications they pursue, and that if their prospective \n4  clients “became categorically ineligible for asylum, East Bay would lose a significant \n5  amount of business and suffer a concomitant loss of funding.”  Id. at 767. \n6  ii.  Ripeness \n7    “Ripeness is an Article III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live \n8  cases or controversies and do not ‘issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in \n9  hypothetical cases.’  A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential \n10  component.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe v.

Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  standing because ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”  Id. \niD tc 15  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Comm'n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138–39 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Sorting out where standing ends and \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . .  .  [I]n ‘measuring whether the litigant has \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather than speculative and hypothetical, the \nN\n19  ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with standing.’”).  Allegations that a “threat” to \n20  a “concrete interest is actual and imminent” are sufficient to allege “an injury in fact that \n21  meets the requirements of constitutional ripeness.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe, 863 F.3d at \n22  1154.  Therefore, if plaintiffs satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. \n23  Defs. of Wildlife, addressed above, the action here is ripe.  In this case, the analysis for \n24  both requirements is the same.  See, e.g., Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 (“Whether the \n25  question is viewed as one of standing or ripeness, the Constitution mandates that prior to \n26  our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or controversy,’ that the \n27  issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’ . . .  We need \n28  not delve into the nuances of the distinction between the injury in fact prong of standing \n76 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 77 of 93\n \n1  and the constitutional component of ripeness:  in this case, the analysis is the same.”). \n2  “In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, our analysis is guided by two \n3  overarching considerations:  ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n4  hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1141.  \n5  When the question presented “is ‘a purely legal one’” that “constitutes ‘final agency \n6  action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA,” that suggests the issue is fit for judicial \n7  decision.  Nat'l Park Hosp. Ass'n v. Dep't of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 812 (2003).  However, \n8  an issue may not be ripe for review if “further factual development would ‘significantly \n9  advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented.’”  Id. \n10  iii.  Irreparable Harm \n11  “A plaintiff seeking preliminary relief must ‘demonstrate that irreparable injury is \n  12  likely in the absence of an injunction.’”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  2018) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  1023 (9th Cir. 2016) (“A threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant \niD tc 15  preliminary injunctive relief if the plaintiff ‘is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  decision on the merits can be rendered.’”) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22)).   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  “There must be a ‘sufficient causal connection’ between the alleged irreparable \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  harm and the activity to be enjoined, and showing that ‘the requested injunction would \nN\n19  forestall’ the irreparable harm qualifies as such a connection.”  Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l \n20  Marine Fisheries Serv., 886 F.3d 803, 819 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Perfect 10, Inc. v. \n21  Google, Inc., 653 F.3d 976, 981–82 (9th Cir. 2011)).  “However, a plaintiff ‘need not \n22  further show that the action sought to be enjoined is the exclusive cause of the injury.’” Id. \n23  (quoting M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 728 (9th Cir. 2012)). \n24  The irreparable harm “analysis focuses on irreparability, ‘irrespective of the \n25  magnitude of the injury.’”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (quoting Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175 \n26  F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999)).  “[T]he temporary loss of income, ultimately to be \n27  recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury.”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. \n28  61, 90 (1974).  But the general rule that “[e]conomic harm is not normally considered \n77 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 78 of 93\n \n1  irreparable” does not apply where there is no adequate remedy to recover those \n2  damages, such as in APA cases.  Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702). \n3  b.  The Plaintiffs’ Harms \n4    First, the court assesses the Counties’ and States’ standing, the ripeness of their \n5  claims, and whether they have demonstrated irreparable harm in absence of an \n6  injunction.  Second, the court assesses the Organizations’ standing and the ripeness of \n7  their claims. \n8  i.  The States and Counties \n9  The States and Counties argue that they will suffer five categories of irreparable \n10  harm:  (A) loss of federal funds, mostly in Medicaid reimbursement; (B) increased \n11  operational costs; (C) increased costs to their own healthcare operations  (D) public \n  12  health problems and resulting increased costs; and (E) reduced economic activity due to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  a decrease in federal funds in the community. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  A.  Loss of Federal Funds \niD tc 15  The Counties argue that they will lose millions of dollars in federal Medicaid \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  reimbursement funds.  Each provides a broad array of health services to low-income \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  residents, many of which are at least partially reimbursed with federal Medicaid dollars.  \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  DHS itself estimates that 2.5% of individuals in households with a noncitizen will disenroll \nN\n19  from Medicaid, which would translate to a roughly $7.5 million loss in Medicaid \n20  reimbursement funds.   \n21  The States similarly argue that DHS itself estimates that the Rule will cause a \n22  reduction in payments from the federal government due to disenrollment or foregone \n23  enrollment by eligible individuals to be over $1.5 billion, nationwide.  83 Fed. Reg. at \n24  51,267–69. \n25  Defendants argue the harm is too speculative, caused only by third-party actions, \n26  and not imminent because the merits can be resolved quickly on summary judgment.  \n27  Defendants argue that even assuming a 2.5% rate of disenrollment, plaintiffs fail to show \n28  that the States and Counties will be harmed, rather than individuals residing within their \n78 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 79 of 93\n \n1  boundaries.  Defendants argue that harm individual citizens will suffer cannot support the \n2  States and Counties claims of irreparable harm.  Finally, defendants argue that any \n3  financial harms the States and Counties identify are not sufficiently large to establish \n4  irreparable harm.   \n5  First, regarding the speculative nature of the harm, defendants themselves predict \n6  a 2.5% disenrollment rate when assessing the Rule, subject to the procedural \n7  requirements of the APA.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463.  The Rule itself also estimated that it \n8  will cause a reduction in payments from the federal government due to disenrollment or \n9  foregone enrollment by eligible individuals of over $1.5 billion.  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,267–\n10  69; see also Cisneros Decl. A at 98-99, Table 18 (annual estimates of $1.46 billion to \n11  $4.37 billion in reduced payments).  Those figures, which underlie DHS’s analysis in \n  12  support of the Rule pursuant to the APA’s requirements, are not speculative conjectures \n a\ntruin\noro 13  as to what might possibly occur.  They are meant to be serious efforts by an agency to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  assess the impact of a proposed rule, and it is difficult to fathom how defendants can \niD tc 15  argue otherwise.  And plaintiffs offer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that disenrollment \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  or non-enrollments will reach at least that level.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463; Wong Decl. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ¶¶ 18-45; Shing Decl. ¶ 30; Weisberg Decl. ¶12; Ponce Decl. ¶¶ 4–11, 25.  This type of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  predictable result from a broad policy, although not precise to the level of the individual \nN\n19  actor, is sufficiently-specific to allege irreparable harm.  See Dep’t of Commerce v. New \n20  York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019).  Moreover, plaintiffs offer evidence showing that \n21  disenrollment due to the public charge rulemaking has already begun.  See, e.g., Cody \n22  Decl. ¶ 8; Newstrom Decl. ¶ 43; Weisberg Decl. ¶¶ 12–14; Shing Decl. ¶¶ 23–24; Chawla \n23  Decl. ¶ 13; Fanelli Decl. ¶ 38; Neville-Morgan Decl. ¶ 16; Ruiz Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12; Kofman \n24  Decl. ¶ 6; Medina Decl. ¶¶ 18–22.  Plaintiffs offer strong evidence that disenrollment is \n25  likely to continue between now and the resolution of this issue on the merits, absent an \n26  injunction. \n27  Plaintiffs also adequately demonstrate that the loss of Medicaid reimbursement is \n28  sure to be immediate, once individuals disenroll.  That is apparent from the very \n79 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 80 of 93\n \n1  mechanics of the harm.  Today, the States and Counties are partially reimbursed by the \n2  federal government for care provided to Medicaid enrollees.  As individuals disenroll, the \n3  plaintiffs will no longer be reimbursed for treating them.  This will have obvious adverse \n4  budgetary consequences.  For one, there will indisputably be fewer individuals covered \n5  by Medicaid seeking treatment.  So, the States and Counties will not be reimbursed for \n6  treating those disenrolled individuals (whether they treat them or not).  The States and \n7  Counties would experience this terminated revenue stream even if they turned away \n8  patients without medical insurance (which they will not).  Put differently, there will be \n9  fewer people on Medicaid to treat and get reimbursed for.  \n10  To the extent defendants argue that the mechanics will work out as a budgetary \n11  boon to plaintiffs, the argument is not plausible in the context of this preliminary injunction \n  12  motion.  Although it could potentially work out as a total budgetary savings for the plaintiff \n a\ntruin\noro 13  entities if they reconfigured their operations, reduced staff, reduced provision of services, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and undertook other cost-savings measures, such savings could not plausibly be realized \niD tc 15  prior to the determination of this action’s merits.  See, e.g., Lorenz Decl. ¶¶ 19–22.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Instead, the plaintiffs will be continuing to operate with most of the costs and expectations \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  associated with the status quo, with one change—no reimbursements. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Second, the States and Counties’ argument regarding loss of Medicaid funding \nN\n19  does not rely on harms to their citizens.  Rather, the arguments concern the plaintiffs’ \n20  own loss of funds. \n21  Third, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm, but \n22  they need not establish a particular quantum of harm to satisfy the requirement.  Azar, \n23  911 F.3d at 581 (irreparable harm “analysis focuses on irreparability, ‘irrespective of the \n24  magnitude of the injury’”).  Nor do defendants explain why San Francisco’s likely loss of \n25  $7.5 million in Medicaid reimbursements (based on a 2.5% disenrollment rate) is not \n26  sufficiently large even under their theory of the requirement.  See Wagner Decl. ¶ 5.  \n27  Santa Clara similarly estimates $4.6 million in foregone Medicaid funds due to more \n28  conservative 1.9% decline in enrollment.  Shing Decl. ¶ 32 (estimating $4.6 million in \n80 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 81 of 93\n \n1  Medicaid fund losses due to 1.9% decline in enrollment).  The States similarly \n2  demonstrate the harms they are likely to suffer from the loss of Medicaid \n3  reimbursements.  See Cantwell Decl. ¶¶ 6, 14 (2.5 million noncitizen Medicaid \n4  beneficiaries in California); Ferrer Decl. ¶ 19 (predicted disenrollment figures in L.A. \n5  County); Lucia Decl. ¶ 23 (estimates of $957 million in lost funding in California, \n6  assuming 15% disenrollment rate); Buhrig I Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8, 10, 27 (330,000 Pennsylvania \n7  Medicaid beneficiaries are part of a household with a noncitizen); Allen Decl. ¶¶ 10, 18, \n8  36-40 (63,000 noncitizens participate in the Oregon Health Plan system, a federal/state \n9  partnership program; other participants are citizen children part of a household with a \n10  noncitizen); Byrd Decl. ¶¶ 18–20 & Ex. A at 2, 4 (16,000 children in the District of \n11  Columbia receive Medicaid assistance, and 28% of the District’s children are part of a \n  12  household with a noncitizen; 9,800 immigrants enrolled in Medicaid reside in the District); \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Probert Decl. ¶¶ 4–8, 15 (13,918 noncitizens enrolled in Medicaid in Maine). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  B.  Increased Operational Costs \niD tc 15  The States argue that the Rule will impose burdens on their ongoing operations.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Defendants argue that such costs are self-imposed and not cognizable.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Governmental administrative costs caused by changes in federal policy are \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  cognizable injuries.  See Cal. v. Trump, 267 F. Supp. 3d 1119, 1126 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \nN\n19  (states’ “administrative costs” caused by a disruption to healthcare exchanges they \n20  administer were sufficient to demonstrate standing) (collecting cases); see also Azar, 911 \n21  F.3d at 573–74.21 \n22  The Counties have submitted evidence of cognizable, irreparable costs.  Santa \n23  Clara explains that they have already spent over 1,000 hours answering questions about \n24  the Rule, processing disenrollment, analyzing the impact of the rule on their services and \n25  undertaking community education and outreach—and these activities are likely to \n26 \n                                            \n21 The government relies on inapposite case law, most notably Crane v. Johnson, 783 \n27 \nF.3d 244, 253-54 (5th Cir. 2015), which addressed individual public employee claims (not \nclaims by the public entity itself) that they might have to change their job practices \n28 \nbecause of a policy change. \n81 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 82 of 93\n \n1  continue to be necessary.  E.g., Shing Decl. ¶¶ 8, 11–12; see also Lorenz Decl. ¶ 19; \n2  Márquez Decl. ¶¶ 9–10.  San Francisco has submitted evidence of similar measures it \n3  has already taken and will continue to take in direct response to the Rule.  See Pon Decl. \n4  ¶¶ 13–16; Rhorer Decl. ¶ 11; Smith Decl. ¶¶ 4–9.  California and Oregon have submitted \n5  evidence showing they are likely to imminently suffer similar harms absent an injunction.  \n6  Ruiz Decl. ¶ 19 (California); Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 34–36 (California); Fanelli Decl. ¶ 40 \n7  (California); Salazar Decl. ¶ 37 (Oregon).  Other states submit declarations regarding \n8  these issues, but they are too vague or speculative to support issuance of an injunction.  \n9  E.g., Byrd Decl. ¶¶ 22–23 (discussing past efforts in D.C., and stating the District will \n10  generally “need to train staff” on the issue); Probert Decl. ¶ 16 (speculation concerning \n11  costs Maine may face). \n  12  Additionally, certain plaintiff states use Medicaid and SNAP enrollment to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  automatically certify children into school lunch programs, meaning that those states \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  would face higher administrative costs to certify student eligibility for free lunch following \niD tc 15  disenrollment caused by the Rule.  To the extent states’ administrative costs increase to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  assess eligibility for free lunch as children disenroll from the federal programs (as \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  opposed to merely an increased burden on the applicants), that administrative cost \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  increase is cognizable harm.  California and D.C. submit competent evidence \nN\n19  demonstrating that their costs in administering school lunch programs will increase.  See \n20  Palmer Decl. ¶ 16 (declaring D.C.’s costs would go up to process school lunch \n21  applications); Fernandez Decl. ¶ 30 (declaring California’s “administrative streamlining \n22  and efficiency” will suffer when enrolling students for free lunch); see generally Neville-\n23  Morgan Decl. ¶ 22 (in California, “paperwork is more burdensome for those without an \n24  automatic qualification through Medi-Cal or SNAP, and immigrant eligible families are \n25  less likely to obtain school lunch benefits in this way”). \n26  These costs that the States and Counties have identified are predictable, likely, \n27  and imminent.  In fact, DHS specifically contemplated certain of these costs when \n28  formulating the Rule.  E.g., 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,260 (“The primary sources of the \n82 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 83 of 93\n \n1  consequences and indirect impacts of the proposed rule would be costs to various \n2  entities that the rule does not directly regulate, such as hospital systems, state agencies, \n3  and other organizations that provide public assistance to aliens and their households. \n4  Indirect costs associated with this rule include familiarization with the rule for those \n5  entities that are not directly regulated but still want to understand the changes in federal \n6  and state transfer payments due to this rule.”) (emphasis added); see also 84 Fed. Reg. \n7  at 41,389 (“DHS agrees that some entities, such as State and local governments or other \n8  businesses and organizations would incur costs related to the changes commenters \n9  identify.”). \n10  Because the States and Counties have each demonstrated sufficient likely \n11  irreparable injury in the form of loss of federal funds to support a preliminary injunction, \n  12  and the Counties, California, D.C., and Oregon have demonstrated additional irreparable \n a\ntruin\noro 13  injury in the form of operational costs, the court need not address the remaining three \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  categories of irreparable harm plaintiffs argue they will imminently suffer. \niD tc 15  ii.  The Organizations \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “[C]ourts have an ‘independent obligation’ to police their own subject matter \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  jurisdiction, including the parties' standing.  Accordingly, we must assure ourselves that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and \nN\n19  likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Animal Legal Def. Fund v. United \n20  States Dep't of Agric., 935 F.3d 858, 866 (9th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). \n21  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to establish organizational standing \n22  for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, independent of the litigation, the \n23  challenged policy frustrates the organization's goals and requires the organization to \n24  expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways.”  E. \n25  Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 765 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n26  Defendants argue that the Organizations fail to identify any injury they will suffer if \n27  they do not divert resources towards addressing their concerns, apart from harm to the \n28  health care they are able to provide to low income communities.  For example, if they \n83 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 84 of 93\n \n1  failed to divert resources, they would not face staff shortages or provide worse health \n2  services. \n3  In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the court found standing based on an organization partially \n4  converting an asylum practice into a removal defense program, a prediction that \n5  applications filed on behalf of the organizations’ clients would become more difficult and \n6  reduce available funds for other activities, and education and outreach initiatives \n7  regarding the new rule.  932 F.3d at 766; see also, e.g., El Rescate Legal Services, 959 \n8  F.2d at 748 (standing where legal services groups had expended “resources in \n9  representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways”); Fair Hous.

The Rule plainly \n5  hinders their clients’ ability to obtain immigration relief and/or public benefits. \n6  Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged that they will have to divert funding \n7  because those who may still be eligible for relief or choose to apply for benefits will \n8  require additional time and resources from plaintiffs to address the effects of the Rule, \n9  and this additional time and rising ineligibility or disenrollment means that plaintiffs will be \n10  able to file fewer cases and help fewer clients.

Here, it is enough for plaintiffs to allege that their goals of providing healthcare \n25  and legal services to low-income immigrants are frustrated, and that the challenged \n26  policy has stimulated the organizations into spending money on things they would not \n27  otherwise have spent money on.  Plaintiffs’ public education efforts, changes to their \n28  programs, increased costs of assisting clients, and other diversions of resources qualify \n85 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 86 of 93\n \n1  under the Ninth Circuit’s requirements.22   \n2  3.  The Balance of Equities and Hardships Tip Sharply in Plaintiffs’ Favor \n3  “A court must ‘balance the interests of all parties and weigh the damage to each’ in \n4  determining the balance of the equities.”  CTIA - The Wireless Ass'n v. City of Berkeley, \n5  928 F.3d 832, 852 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, \n6  1138 (9th Cir. 2009)). \n7  There is little question that the balance of equities and hardships tip sharply in \n8  favor of the States and Counties.  Defendants have been operating under a consistent \n9  definition of “public charge” since at least 1999, when the INS issued Field Guidance \n10  specifying “that ‘public charge’ means an alien . . .  who is likely to become (for \n11  admission/adjustment purposes) ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, \n  12  as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income \n a\ntruin\noro 13  maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.’”  64 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  That standard is specific and workable, and defendants have been \niD tc 15  administering it for decades.  In fact, defendants conceded that do not argue that they \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  would suffer any hardship in the face of an injunction prohibiting them from replacing \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  those standards with the new Rule until resolution of this case on the merits.  Defendants’ \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  only argument with respect to the balance of equities or hardships and the public interest \nN\n19  is that Congress has made a policy judgment that aliens should be self-sufficient, and the \n20  executive should not be prevented from implementing a rule that advances that policy. \n21  On the other hand, implementing the change defendants propose would upend \n22  state and local governments’ operations as they support immigrants while determining \n23  how to adjust to the new Rule and provide services that the federal government once \n24  predictably assisted with.  To the extent this factor is merged with the public interest and \n25  considers the effects on non-parties, the most severely affected individuals are the aliens \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n22 As the issue was not meaningfully addressed by the parties, the court does not decide \nat this time whether California Primary Care Association satisfies the requirements for \n28 \nassociational standing. \n86 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 87 of 93\n \n1  seeking LPR status themselves, who would face uncertainty regarding their access to \n2  healthcare and subsidized nutrition as they learn to adapt to and attempt to navigate the \n3  Rule’s deterrents. \n4  In short, implementing the Rule after decades of a consistent policy prior to a \n5  determination of this action on the merits—which defendants argue will be accomplished \n6  in short order—does little to advance the defendants’ interests, and it would entirely \n7  upend the plaintiffs’ (and the non-party aliens’) interests.   \n8  4.  An Injunction Is in the Public’s Interest \n9  “When the government is a party, the last two factors merge.”  Azar, 911 F.3d at \n10  575.  Therefore, the public interest analysis is subsumed in the balance of equities and \n11  hardships, addressed above, and the public interest therefore favors and injunction. \n  12  Even though the public’s interest generally merges with the balance of equities, it \n a\ntruin\noro 13  can be “appropriate to consider the factors separately,” for example when intervenors \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  present distinct interests.  League of Wilderness Defs./Blue Mountains Biodiversity \niD tc 15  Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014).  In those instances, “[t]he \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  public interest inquiry primarily addresses impact on non-parties rather than parties.”  Id. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Here, the public interest cuts sharply in favor of an injunction.  Specifically, the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  public interest supports continuing the provision of medical services through Medicaid to \nN\n19  those who would predictably disenroll absent an injunction, for numerous reasons.  \n20  Although the court has not reached the issue as to whether plaintiffs’ arguments \n21  regarding the impacts on public health support their argument for imminent harm, the \n22  parties and numerous amici have explained that the predictable disenrollment from \n23  Medicaid absent an injunction would have adverse health consequences not only to \n24  those who disenroll, but to the entire populations of the plaintiff states, for example, in the \n25  form of decreased vaccination rates.  The public certainly has an interest in decreasing \n26  the risk of preventable contagion. \n27  As such, the public interest supports preserving the long-standing status quo \n28  pending final, coherent resolution on the merits. \n87 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 88 of 93\n \n1  5.  Scope of the Injunction Necessary to Redress Plaintiffs’ Imminent \n2  Harms \n3  a.  Legal Standard \n4  When a plaintiff satisfies its burden to demonstrate that a preliminary injunction \n5  should issue, “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \n6  necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Califano, 442 U.S. at 702; accord \n7  L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) (injunction \n8  “should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \n9  relief to the plaintiffs before the court”) (internal quotation mark omitted); Lamb-Weston, \n10  Inc. v. McCain Foods, Ltd., 941 F.2d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1991) (“Injunctive relief . . . must \n11  be tailored to remedy the specific harm alleged.”).  “‘The purpose of such interim \n  12  equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties but to balance the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  equities as the litigation moves forward.’”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 582. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  But “[t]here is no general requirement that an injunction affect only the parties in \niD tc 15  the suit.”  Bresgal v.

That is because, even though courts have the \n4  authority to issue nationwide preliminarily injunctions, doing so still requires “an \n5  articulated connection to a plaintiff’s particular harm[.]”  Id. (“nationwide injunction is [not] \n6  appropriate simply because this case presents a rule that applies nationwide”); see also \n7  Azar, 911 F.3d at 582–84.  That requirement is not lifted in the immigration context.  E.g., \n8  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029 (“Under our case law, however, all injunctions—\n9  even ones involving national policies—must be ‘narrowly tailored to remedy the specific \n10  harm shown.’”); E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 779 (nationwide scope appropriate \n11  where it “is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress” and district \n  12  court could not “have crafted a narrower remedy that would have provided complete relief \n a\ntruin\noro 13  to the [plaintiffs]”) (quoting Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 908 F.3d at 512) (internal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  quotation mark omitted).23 \niD tc 15  The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that any preliminary injunction must be \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  supported by evidence in the record identifying the likely effect the enjoined conduct \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would have on the particular plaintiffs.  E.g., San Francisco v.

It \n2  would prevent the economic harm extensively detailed in the record.  Indeed, while the \n3  record before the district court was voluminous on the harm to the plaintiffs, it was not \n4  developed as to the economic impact on other states.”).  “District judges must require a \n5  showing of nationwide impact or sufficient similarity to the plaintiff states to foreclose \n6  litigation in other districts, from Alaska to Puerto Rico to Maine to Guam.”  Azar, 911 F.3d \n7  at 584. \n8  Finally, although the scope of the injunction in this action is governed by the \n9  controlling Ninth Circuit law explained above, the court notes that the Ninth Circuit and \n10  the Supreme Court have both credited prudential considerations supporting their \n11  admonition that nationwide preliminary injunctions are appropriate only in “exceptional \n  12  cases.”  See San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244; E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at \n a\ntruin\noro 13  1029.  First, nationwide injunctions unconnected to a plaintiff’s particular harm \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  “unnecessarily ‘stymie novel legal challenges and robust debate’ arising in different \niD tc 15  judicial districts.”  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029; see also Azar, 911 F.3d at 583 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  (“The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that nationwide injunctions have \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  detrimental consequences to the development of law and deprive appellate courts of a \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  wider range of perspectives.”).  That consideration is relevant here, where actions raising \nN\n19  similar changes are also currently pending in district courts in New York, Maryland, and \n20  Washington, and perhaps more.  Second, nationwide injunctions may fail to adequately \n21  recognize “the equities of non-parties who are deprived the right to litigate in other \n22  forums,” who “are essentially deprived of their ability to participate[.]”  Azar, 911 F.3d at \n23  583.  Third, “[n]ationwide injunctions are also associated with forum shopping, which \n24  hinders the equitable administration of laws.”  Id. \n25  b.  Analysis \n26  Here, the Counties and the States have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable \n27  harm based on their loss of Medicaid funding from the federal government and increased \n28 \n90 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 91 of 93\n \n1  operational costs they are likely to carry.24  Those harms stem directly from disenrollment \n2  of individuals seeking medical care in their jurisdictions, residing in their jurisdictions, and \n3  enrolling in certain other public benefits in their jurisdictions (for example, school lunch \n4  programs).  Those harms, and the supporting record, are discussed in detail above.  In \n5  order to preserve the status quo pending resolution on the merits and to prevent certain \n6  of these irreparable harms, it is necessary to enjoin implementation of the Rule with \n7  respect to those who reside in the States and Counties any time following the date of this \n8  order, until this action is resolved on the merits.  Moreover, defendants must be \n9  additionally enjoined from applying the Rule to any individual who is part of a household \n10  (as defined in the Rule, 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(d)) that includes a person who has resided in a \n11  plaintiff State or County any time following the date of this order, until this action is \n  12  resolved on the merits. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Defendants may, of course, continue to process applications and otherwise \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  operate pursuant to the standards employed prior to October 15, 2019—that is, pursuant \niD tc 15  to the status quo. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The plaintiffs request a nationwide injunction based primarily on what they argue \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would be the inadministrability of an immigration policy that is not administered uniformly \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  nationally.  But a nationwide injunction is not “appropriate simply because this case \nN\n19  presents a rule that applies nationwide.”  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029; accord \n20  San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244 (record must also be independently \n21  “developed on the nationwide impact” and the statewide impact). \n22  Plaintiffs also argue that a nationwide injunction is necessary to provide certainty \n23  to the public and quell confusion about the implementation of the Rule.  They argue that \n24  general, nationwide confusion will cause disenrollment even in the States and Counties, \n25 \n                                            \n26 \n24 Because the Organizations have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on—or \nserious questions going to—the merits of their APA causes of action (the only claims \n27 \nunderlying their motion for preliminary injunction), they have not demonstrated that an \ninjunction should issue to prevent the harms they are likely to suffer, so the court does \n28 \nnot consider their alleged harms in determining the scope of the injunction. \n91 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 131   Filed 10/11/19   Page 92 of 93\n \n1  causing the above-discussed harms.  Plaintiffs have certainly demonstrated that \n2  confusion about the nation’s immigration policies is a cause of disenrollment, even for \n3  those who will not be subject to the public charge assessment.  However, plaintiffs have \n4  not demonstrated the marginal effect a nationwide injunction would have on curing that \n5  confusion for their residents over and above an injunction limited to their own borders.  \n6  Although it is conceivable that a nationwide injunction pending resolution on the merits \n7  would lead to less disenrollment due to confusion within California than this injunction \n8  covering all of California (and the other States), it is plaintiffs’ obligation to demonstrate \n9  the necessity of such relief.  This court does not suggest that no evidence could support \n10  such an injunction.  Nor does the court suggest that the record evidence is necessarily \n11  insufficient.  Rather plaintiffs, by devoting only a few cursory paragraphs in their briefs to \n  12  the scope the injunction, have failed to sufficiently tie that evidence to the need for an \n a\ntruin\noro 13  injunction beyond their borders in order to remedy the specific harms alleged and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  accepted by the court as likely, imminent, and irreparable. \niD tc 15  CONCLUSION \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16    For the foregoing reasons, the States and Counties’ motion for a preliminary \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  injunction is GRANTED, as explained above.  The Organizations’ motion is DENIED, \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  because they do not fall within the zone of interests of the statute forming the basis of \nN\n19  their APA claims. \n20  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n21  Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland \n22  Security, Kevin McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS, Kenneth T.

Having read the parties’ papers \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  and carefully considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good \nN\n19  cause appearing, the court hereby rules as follows. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  This case involves a challenge to the implementation of the final rule entitled \n22  “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,” published by DHS on August 14, 2019.  See \n23  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“the \n24  Rule”).  On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rulemaking process to create a new \n25  framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed \n26 \n \n27 \n1 Kevin McAleenen was originally named in the complaint, (Dkt. 1, ¶ 48); however, the \nFAC reflects the fact that Chad Wolf has replaced McAleenan as acting Secretary of \n28 \nHomeland Security. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 2 of 39\n \n1  Rulemaking (“NPRM”).  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. \n2  51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018).  The Rule was originally set to become effective on October 15, \n3  2019. \n4  Publication of the Rule resulted in several complaints filed in federal district courts \n5  across the nation.  Three such complaints were filed in the Northern District of California \n6  and related before this court.  Dkt. 24.  The present motion involves one of the three \n7  cases: La Clínica de la Raza, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al., Case No. 19-cv-04980-\n8  PJH, wherein the La Clínica De La Raza and California Primary Care Association (the \n9  two together are the “healthcare organizations”), Maternal and Child Health Access, \n10  Farmworker Justice, Council on American Islamic Relations–California, African \n11  Communities Together, Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, Central American \n a  12  Resource Center, and Korean Resource Center (the “legal organizations” and, together \ntruin\noro 13  with the healthcare organizations, the “organizational plaintiffs” or “plaintiffs”) filed a first \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  amended complaint (“FAC”) asserting eight causes of action: (1) Violation of the \niD tc 15  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law; (2) Violation of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; (3) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—\nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Arbitrary and Capricious; (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  (5) Violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq., and \nN\n19  DHS Organic Statute, 6 U.S.C. § 113; (6) Violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, \n20  5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq.; (7)  Violation of the Fifth Amendment; and (8) Declaratory \n21  Judgment Act—Unlawfully Appointed Agency Director.  Dkt. 161.   \n22  On October 11, 2019, this court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \n23  defendants from applying the Rule to any person residing in the City and County of San \n24  Francisco, Santa Clara County, the States of California, Oregon, or Maine, the \n25  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the District of Columbia.  Dkt. 131 at 92.  Defendants \n26  appealed the preliminary injunction on October 30, 2019.  Dkt. 129.  A three-judge panel \n27 \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 3 of 39\n \n1  of the Ninth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction on December 5, 2019.2  Dkt. 141; \n2  see City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 944 F.3d 773 \n3  (9th Cir. 2019).  On February 18, 2020, the Ninth Circuit panel voted to deny plaintiffs-\n4  appellees’ motions for reconsideration and for rehearing en banc.  Dkt. 153.  Other \n5  district courts also issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting enforcement of the Rule, but \n6  these were ultimately stayed by the Supreme Court.  See Dep’t of Homeland Security v. \n7  New York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020); Wolf v. Cook Cty., Illinois, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020).  \n8  Accordingly, the Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020.  Most recently, the district \n9  court for the Southern District of New York enjoined the Rule as long as the government \n10  has declared a public health emergency related to COVID-19.  See New York v. Dep’t of \n11  Homeland Sec., — F. Supp. 3d —, Nos. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD), 19 Civ. 7993 (GBD), 2020 \n a  12  WL 4347264, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2020). \ntruin\noro 13  A broader summary of the relevant statutory framework and the changes \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  implemented by the Rule may be found in the court’s preliminary injunction order.  Dkt. \niD tc 15  131 at 6–10.  To briefly summarize here, DHS promulgated the Rule pursuant to its \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  authority under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., which requires that all noncitizens \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become lawful permanent \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  residents prove they are not inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 1225(a).  A noncitizen may \nN\n19  be deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, including that they are “likely at any \n20  time to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  The statute directs \n21  immigration officials to form an opinion as to whether the applicant “is likely at any time to \n22  become a public charge.”  Id.  In forming that opinion, immigration officers must consider \n23  “at a minimum” five statutorily-defined factors: (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) \n24  assets, resources, and financial status; (5) education and skills.  8 U.S.C. \n25 \n \n26 \n2 The panel consolidated the three related cases before this court with a similar case \nfrom the Eastern District of Washington.  That court issued a nationwide injunction of the \n27 \nRule on the same day as this court’s geographically limited preliminary injunction order.  \nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1224 (E.D. \n28 \nWash. 2019). \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 4 of 39\n \n1  § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The Rule would define the term “public charge” and set out various \n2  criteria for government officials as part of their totality of the circumstances determination. \n3  DISCUSSION \n4  A.  Legal Standard \n5  1.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n6  A federal court may dismiss an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n7  12(b)(1) for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Rule \n8  12(h)(3) similarly provides that a court “must dismiss the action” if it “determines at any \n9  time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  “Federal courts are \n10  courts of limited jurisdiction” and the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction \n11  “rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n a  12  511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citations omitted). \ntruin\noro 13  A jurisdictional challenge may be facial or factual.  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004).  When the attack is facial, the court determines \niD tc 15  whether the allegations contained in the complaint are sufficient on their face to invoke \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  federal jurisdiction.  Id.  Where the attack is factual, however, “the court need not \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations.”  Id. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  When resolving a factual dispute about its federal subject matter jurisdiction, a \nN\n19  court may review extrinsic evidence beyond the complaint without converting a motion to \n20  dismiss into one for summary judgment.  McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 \n21  (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that a court “may review any evidence, such as affidavits and \n22  testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction”); see also \n23  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4 (1947) (“[W]hen a question of the District Court’s \n24  jurisdiction is raised . . . the court may inquire by affidavits or otherwise, into the facts as \n25  they exist.”).  “Once the moving party has converted the motion to dismiss into a factual \n26  motion by presenting affidavits or other evidence properly brought before the court, the \n27  party opposing the motion must furnish affidavits or other evidence necessary to satisfy \n28  its burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 5 of 39\n \n1  1039.   \n2  The Ninth Circuit has noted that “jurisdictional dismissals in cases premised on \n3  federal-question jurisdiction are exceptional, and must satisfy the requirements specified \n4  in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946).”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039 (quoting \n5  Sun Valley Gas., Inc. v. Ernst Enters., 711 F.2d 138, 140 (9th Cir. 1983)).  “In Bell, the \n6  Supreme Court determined that jurisdictional dismissals are warranted ‘where the alleged \n7  claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and \n8  made solely for the purpose of obtaining federal jurisdiction or where such claim is wholly \n9  insubstantial and frivolous.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 327 U.S. at 682–83). \n10  2.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n11  A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests for the \n a  12  legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  Ileto v. Glock Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, \ntruin\noro 13  1199–1200 (9th Cir. 2003).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  a complaint include a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \niD tc 15  entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), a complaint may be dismissed under Rule \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  12(b)(6) if the plaintiff fails to state a cognizable legal theory, or has not alleged sufficient \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  facts to support a cognizable legal theory.  Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 959 (9th \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Cir. 2013). \nN\n19  While the court is to accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint, \n20  legally conclusory statements, not supported by actual factual allegations, need not be \n21  accepted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678–79 (2009).  The complaint must proffer \n22  sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \n23  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 558–59 (2007).   \n24  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \n25  the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \n26  alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court \n27  to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it \n28  has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 6 of 39\n \n1  P. 8(a)(2)).  Where dismissal is warranted, it is generally without prejudice, unless it is \n2  clear the complaint cannot be saved by any amendment.  In re Daou Sys., Inc., 411 F.3d \n3  1006, 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). \n4  Review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, although the court can \n5  also consider documents “whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose \n6  authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the plaintiff’s \n7  pleading.”  Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting In re Silicon \n8  Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir. 1999), superseded by statute on \n9  other grounds as stated in In re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., 865 F.3d 1130 (9th Cir. \n10  2017)); see also Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[A] court can \n11  consider a document on which the complaint relies if the document is central to the \n a  12  plaintiff’s claim, and no party questions the authenticity of the document.” (citation \ntruin\noro 13  omitted)).  The court may also consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  notice (Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688–89 (9th Cir. 2001)), and exhibits \niD tc 15  attached to the complaint (Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989)). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  B.  Analysis \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  1.  Standing \nN\n19  Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, U.S. Const. \n20  art. III, § 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the law ought to be or \n21  affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. \n22  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937).  Article III’s “standing” requirements limit the court’s \n23  subject matter jurisdiction.  Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004) \n24  (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998)).  The \n25  burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the claim.  Renne v. Geary, \n26  501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (citing Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, \n27  546 n.8 (1986)).  “In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must have (1) \n28  suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 7 of 39\n \n1  defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  \n2  California v. Trump, 963 F.3d 926, 935 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n3  504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).  “[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . \n4  allege facts demonstrating’ each element.”  Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n5  (2016) (second alteration in original) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)). \n6  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested, \n7  and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with the manner \n8  and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  E. Bay \n9  Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (“E. Bay Sanctuary I”), 932 F.3d 742, 763–64 (9th Cir. \n10  2018) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  They “need only establish a risk \n11  or threat of injury to satisfy the actual injury requirement.”  Id.; see also Dep’t of \n a  12  Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019) (noting that future injuries to \ntruin\noro 13  states “may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  risk that the harm will occur” (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \niD tc 15  158 (2014))). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Organizations can demonstrate standing in two ways.  First, they can show “that \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the challenged ‘practices have perceptibly impaired [their] ability to provide the services \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  [they were] formed to provide.’”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 765 (alterations in \nN\n19  original) (quoting El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Office of Immigration Review, \n20  959 F.2d 742, 748 (9th Cir. 1991)).  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to \n21  establish organizational standing for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, \n22  independent of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization’s goals and \n23  requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise \n24  would spend in other ways.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n25  Second, organizations can also demonstrate that a government policy “will cause them to \n26  lose a substantial amount of funding.  ‘For standing purposes, a loss of even a small \n27  amount of money is ordinarily an injury.’”  Id. at 766–67 (internal quotation marks omitted) \n28  (quoting Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 137 U.S. 973, 983 (2017)). \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 8 of 39\n \n1  In the preliminary injunction order, the court found that the harm alleged by \n2  plaintiffs was sufficient to create standing.  Dkt. 131 at 85.  The court noted evidence \n3  from both the healthcare organizations and the legal organizations that the Rule would \n4  cause them to either divert resources from their core missions or would frustrate the \n5  purpose of the organization.  Id. at 84–85.  The court also found persuasive evidence that \n6  plaintiffs would have to divert funding because clients who may still be eligible for relief \n7  would require additional time and resources from plaintiffs thereby depleting funds that \n8  would be used elsewhere.  Id. at 85.  Some plaintiffs would have increased operational \n9  costs in order to address the impact of the Rule on their services.  Id.    \n10  In their present motion, defendants assert that plaintiffs have not demonstrated \n11  that they would have suffered some other injury if they had not diverted resources to \n a  12  counteracting the problem caused by the government action.  Mtn. at 6.  More \ntruin\noro 13  specifically, while plaintiffs allege that they have expended or will expend additional \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  resources, defendants contend that plaintiffs have not identified some other injury they \niD tc 15  will suffer if they do not divert resources towards addressing their concerns.  Id.  Plaintiffs \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  argue that they have sufficiently alleged that they have diverted and will divert resources \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to counteract the effects of the Rule.  Opp. at 4.  They also contend that they will face \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  direct financial consequences from the Rule because a decrease in the use of benefits \nN\n19  and plaintiffs’ services will reduce funding streams connected to provision of services.  Id.   \n20  Defendants’ renewed standing argument does not alter this court’s prior findings.  \n21  Defendants cite La Asociacion de Trabajadores de Lake Forest v. City of Lake Forest, \n22  624 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2010), for the proposition that an organization “must . . . \n23  show that it would have suffered some other injury if it had not diverted resources to \n24  counteracting the problem.”  Organizations “cannot manufacture the injury by incurring \n25  litigation costs or simply choosing to spending money fixing a problem that otherwise \n26  would not affect the organization at all.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs have adequately \n27  alleged that the Rule will cause them to divert resources that would otherwise be spent \n28  helping some clients and providing other core services and redirecting those resources to \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 9 of 39\n \n1  help clients who choose to apply for benefits and may be subject to the Rule.  First, \n2  plaintiffs demonstrate that they will be injured by the Rule if they do nothing.  For \n3  example, La Clínica produced evidence that the Rule would increase the organization’s \n4  no-show rate due to a decrease in patients seeking care.  Dkt. 35-5, ¶ 16.  La Clínica \n5  went on to explain that it receives a large portion of its revenue from Medi-Cal such that \n6  disenrollment or non-enrollment in Medi-Cal would negatively affect La Clínica’s revenue.  \n7  This harm is and will continue to occur regardless of whether plaintiffs divert resources to \n8  respond to the Rule.   \n9  Next, in response to the pending loss of resources, plaintiffs demonstrate that they \n10  diverted and will continue to divert resources.  For example, La Clínica presented \n11  evidence that it would have to retrain staff on a new enrollment process in response to \n a  12  the Rule, staff that would otherwise be treating patients.  Id. ¶ 21.  One of plaintiff \ntruin\noro 13  California Primary Care Association’s (“CPCA”)3 members, Asian Health Services, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  presented evidence that at the time of the Rule’s promulgation, it had spent $500,000 \niD tc 15  developing a national education campaign and expected to spend an additional $500,000 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  once the Rule was released.  Dkt. 35-11, ¶¶ 26–29.  This money would have been used \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to advance other community organizing priorities.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have sufficiently \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  demonstrated standing under a diversion of resources theory. \nN\n19  Separately, plaintiffs have also alleged that they will suffer direct financial \n20  consequences as a result of the Rule because the Rule will cause a decrease in the use \n21  of plaintiffs’ services and a corresponding reduction in funding streams connected to \n22  provision of those services.  See FAC ¶¶ 17, 21, 25, 33, 38, 40; Dkt. 35-5, ¶ 18 (La \n23  Clínica’s CEO stating “La Clínica expects to lose a significant amount of funding and \n24 \n \n3 Defendants challenge CPCA’s associational standing on the grounds that CPCA has \n25 \nneither alleged nor provided evidence of associational standing.  Mtn. at 5 n.2.  CPCA is \nan association of various organizations and is bringing suit on behalf of its members.  \n26 \nFAC ¶ 18.  In its prior order, the court determined that La Clínica and CPCA’s member, \nAsian Health Services, had diverted resources such that they had standing.  Dkt. 131 at \n27 \n84.  Other than citing a case for the requirements for associational standing, defendants \nput forward no further argument explaining why the court’s prior finding should not apply \n28 \nhere.   \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 10 of 39\n \n1  revenue if the Rule is implemented”).  As cited above, organizations “can demonstrate \n2  organizational standing by showing that the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial \n3  amount of funding.”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 766–67.  Defendants make no effort \n4  to challenge plaintiffs’ allegations or evidence that plaintiffs will suffer a loss in funding. \n5  Instead, defendants only argue that any loss in funding would be commensurate \n6  with a decrease in the quantity of services provided such that plaintiffs have not suffered \n7  any net financial harm.  Reply at 1–2.  Defendants’ argument contorts the injury-in-fact \n8  requirement beyond what is required by plaintiffs and cite no authority that a plaintiff not \n9  only has to show injury but also a “net” injury.  The Ninth Circuit rejected a similar \n10  argument that a hospice provider could only have standing to challenge a regulation if the \n11  provider suffered a net increase in its overpayment liability.  See L.A. Haven Hospice, \n a  12  Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 657 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Aluminum Co. of Am. v. \ntruin\noro 13  Bonneville Power Admin., 903 F.2d 585, 590 (9th Cir. 1989) (“There is harm in paying \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  rates that may be excessive, no what the California utilities may have saved.”).  Simply \niD tc 15  put, defendants’ argument is not the test for standing.  “[A]n organization that suffers a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  decreased ‘amount of business’ and ‘lost revenue’ due to a government policy ‘easily \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  satisf[ies] the injury in fact standing requirement.’”  E.

City of Petaluma, 522 F.2d 897, 903 (9th Cir. 1975)).  By \n20  demonstrating a reduction in funding, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the Rule has and \n21  will continue to harm them. \n22  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to \n23  standing. \n24  2.  Ripeness \n25  “Ripeness is an Article III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live \n26  cases or controversies and do not ‘issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in \n27  hypothetical cases.’  A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential \n28  component.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty., 863 F.3d 1144, 1153 (9th Cir. 2017) \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 11 of 39\n \n1  (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d \n2  1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc)).   \n3  “For a case to be ripe, it must present issues that are definite and concrete, not \n4  hypothetical or abstract.  Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of \n5  standing because ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”  Id. \n6  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1138–39 \n7  (“Sorting out where standing ends and ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . . [I]n \n8  ‘measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather \n9  than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with \n10  standing.’” (citation omitted)).  Allegations that a “threat” to a “concrete interest is actual \n11  and imminent” are sufficient to allege “an injury in fact that meets the requirements of \n a  12  constitutional ripeness.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe, 863 F.3d at 1154.  Therefore, if plaintiffs \ntruin\noro 13  satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  addressed above, the action here is ripe.  See, e.g., Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 \niD tc 15  (“Whether the question is viewed as one of standing or ripeness, the Constitution \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  mandates that prior to our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  controversy,’ that the issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  abstract.’ . . . We need not delve into the nuances of the distinction between the injury in \nN\n19  fact prong of standing and the constitutional component of ripeness: in this case, the \n20  analysis is the same.” (citations omitted)). \n21  “In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, our analysis is guided by two \n22  overarching considerations: ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n23  hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Id. at 1141 (quoting Abbott \n24  Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. \n25  Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).  When the question presented “is ‘a purely legal one’” that \n26  “constitutes ‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA,” that suggests \n27  the issue is fit for judicial decision.  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. \n28  803, 812 (2003).  However, an issue may not be ripe for review if “further factual \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 12 of 39\n \n1  development would ‘significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues \n2  presented.’”  Id. (quoting Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, \n3  82 (1978)). \n4  In this case, the court has determined that plaintiffs have standing, therefore, it \n5  follows that the case is constitutionally ripe for adjudication.  See Thomas, 220 F.3d at \n6  1139.  The court has not previously addressed prudential ripeness.  Defendants contend \n7  that plaintiffs’ claims fail the prudential ripeness standard because the claims are \n8  premised on speculation about the Rule’s operation in practice and further factual \n9  development is required.  Mtn. at 7–8.  Plaintiffs assert that the prudential ripeness \n10  standard is met because the Rule is final and they are suffering injuries.  Opp. at 4.   \n11  “Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires [a \n a  12  court] to evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to \ntruin\noro 13  the parties of withholding court consideration.”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  (citing Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).  When considering whether issues are fit for \niD tc 15  review, the question should be a “purely legal one” and the agency action in question \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  should constitute a “‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA.”  Id. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  812 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  The second factor examines “the hardship to the parties of withholding court \nN\n19  consideration.”  Id. at 808.  Generally, a showing of hardship requires demonstrating that \n20  the regulation in question creates “adverse effects of a strictly legal kind.”  Id. at 809 \n21  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998)).  Such \n22  adverse effects do not arise if the regulation in question “do[es] not command anyone to \n23  do anything or to refrain from doing anything; [it] do[es] not grant, withhold, or modify any \n24  formal legal license, power, or authority; [it] do[es] not subject anyone to any civil or \n25  criminal liability; [and it] create[s] no legal rights or obligations.”  Id. (alterations in original) \n26  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 733).   \n27  Here, the challenge to the Rule in this case “is a purely legal one,” i.e., whether the \n28  INA was properly construed and implemented by DHS.  See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 13 of 39\n \n1  149 (noting that “whether the statute was properly construed by the Commissioner” to be \n2  a purely legal challenge).  Next, the Rule constitutes a “rule” as defined by the APA.  See \n3  5 U.S.C. § 551(4), (13) (defining “agency action” and “rule”).  The text of the Rule \n4  confirms that its promulgation was an agency action.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 (“This \n5  rule changes how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interprets and \n6  implements the public charge ground of inadmissibility.”).  This factor indicates the Rule \n7  is ripe for review. \n8  With respect to hardship, the Rule imposes potential adverse effects of a strictly \n9  legal kind.  If an alien falls within the Rule’s definition of a public charge as determined by \n10  an immigration officer, then he or she is inadmissible.  In other words, the Rule defines a \n11  legal right—admissibility to the United States.  Concurrently, it also defines the legal \n a  12  powers and authorities of federal government officials in evaluating whether an alien is \ntruin\noro 13  admissible.  The Rule does not define the legal rights of plaintiffs or create any legal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  obligations directly impacting them.  However, the potential adverse effects on individuals \niD tc 15  cause a direct harm to plaintiffs, as discussed above with regard to plaintiffs’ standing.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  For example, fewer individuals using plaintiffs’ services results in a corresponding \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  reduction in funding to plaintiffs. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims are all premised on speculation about the \nN\n19  potential future effects of the Rule and disagreement with DHS’s predictions based on \n20  available evidence.  Mtn. at 7–8.  The Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020 after \n21  the Supreme Court stayed the final remaining preliminary injunction enjoining the Rule.  \n22  Plaintiffs’ FAC was filed May 20, 2020.  Thus, they have had a period of approximately \n23  three months to assess the impact of the Rule.  The FAC alleges current harms \n24  stemming from the Rule.  For example, plaintiff Farmworker Justice (“FJ”) alleges that \n25  “[b]eginning in March 2020, FJ has been addressing concerns that farmworkers have \n26  about the implications of the public charge Regulation when seeking to take action to \n27  prevent or treat COVID-19.”  FAC ¶ 31.  Plaintiff Maternal and Child Health Access \n28  (“MCHA”) alleges the “Regulation is frustrating MCHA’s mission by reducing access to \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 14 of 39\n \n1  nutrition, medical care, and adequate housing.  Immigrant families who MCHA serves are \n2  already disenrolling from public benefit programs, such as SNAP and Medicaid, based on \n3  fears that using those programs will affect their future immigration relief options.”  Id. ¶ 27 \n4  (emphasis added). \n5  Plaintiffs’ challenge is not speculative and further factual development of the \n6  Rule’s impact is not needed for purposes of ripeness.  Accordingly, the court DENIES \n7  defendants’ motion with respect to ripeness. \n8  3.  Zone of Interests \n9  In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of \n10  the statute that forms the basis of their challenge.  The zone of interests analysis asks \n11  “whether Congress created a private cause of action in legislation,” Organized Vill. of \n a  12  Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), such that “this \ntruin\noro 13  particular class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute,” Lexmark \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014).  It is “not a \niD tc 15  question of Article III standing” and “this inquiry . . . ‘does not implicate subject-matter \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  jurisdiction . . . .’”  Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964 (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  128 & n.4).  “[I]n the APA context, . . . the [zone of interests] test is not ‘especially \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  demanding.’”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130 (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of \nN\n19  Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225–26 (2012)). \n20  “Whether a plaintiff’s interest is ‘arguably . . . protected . . . by the statute’ within \n21  the meaning of the zone-of-interests test is to be determined not by reference to the \n22  overall purpose of the Act in question[,] . . . but by reference to the particular provision of \n23  law upon which the plaintiff relies.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997) (first \n24  and second alterations in original) (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. \n25  Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)).  Put differently, “the plaintiff must establish that the \n26  injury he complains of . . . falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected by the \n27  statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.”  Id. at 176 \n28  (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990); and \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 15 of 39\n \n1  citing Air Courier Conf. v. Postal Workers, 498 U.S. 517, 523–24 (1991)); see also E. Bay \n2  Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 n.9 (“‘[W]e are not limited to considering the [specific] \n3  statute under which [plaintiffs] sued, but may consider any provision that helps us to \n4  understand Congress’[s] overall purposes in the [INA].’” (alterations in original) (quoting \n5  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 401 (1987))).  “[F]or APA challenges, a plaintiff \n6  can satisfy the test in either one of two ways: (1) ‘if it is among those [who] Congress \n7  expressly or directly indicated were the intended beneficiaries of a statute,’ or (2) ‘if it is a \n8  suitable challenger to enforce the statute—that is, if its interests are sufficiently congruent \n9  with those of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not more likely to frustrate \n10  than to further . . . statutory objectives.’”  California, 963 F.3d at 941–42 (second and third \n11  alterations in original) (quoting Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Dep’t of Def., 87 \n a  12  F.3d 1356, 1359 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). \ntruin\noro 13  i.  APA Zone of Interests \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In the preliminary injunction order, this court determined that the organizational \niD tc 15  plaintiffs did not fall within the zone of interests for three reasons.  First, the court \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  reasoned that simply being negatively affected by the Rule does not establish that the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  organizational plaintiffs fell within the INA’s zone of interest.  Dkt. 131 at 71.  Second, the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  organizational plaintiffs’ briefing failed to identify or explain what statutory provisions \nN\n19  supported their argument.  When plaintiffs later identified a statutory section at the \n20  hearing, 8 U.S.C. § 1611, they did not demonstrate how that section had any integral \n21  relationship with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) or explain how § 1611 was related to the \n22  organizational plaintiffs’ role.  Id. at 71–72.  Third, the court explained that the \n23  organizational plaintiffs “simply fail[ed] to explain how their interests related to \n24  § 1182(a)(4)’s purpose of excluding immigrants likely to become public charges.  Id. at \n25  72.   \n26  Defendants argue that the court should now dismiss plaintiffs’ claims because they \n27  do not fall within the zone of interests of the INA.  Mtn. at 8.  In particular, they argue that \n28  the INA’s zone of interest extends to aliens improperly determined to be inadmissible, not \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 16 of 39\n \n1  organizations seeking to assist those aliens.  Id. at 8–9.  In response, plaintiffs advance \n2  three reasons why they fall within the zone of interest of the INA.  First, one set of \n3  interests implicated by the public charge provision is to accurately identify which \n4  immigrants are likely to become a public charge and deny them admission.  Opp. at 7.  \n5  Plaintiffs allege that several of the legal organization plaintiffs represent individuals who \n6  fit their description.  Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 33–37, 39–40, 42–43).  Second, a second set of \n7  interests implicated by the public charge provision concerns the health and economic \n8  status of immigrants who are granted admission to the United States.  Id. at 9.  Plaintiffs \n9  allege that their missions, either in whole or in part, is to protect and improve the health \n10  and economic status of immigrant communities and they help immigrants avoid becoming \n11  public charges.  Id.  Third, the Rule itself presupposes impact on and the involvement of \n a  12  the organizational plaintiffs.  Id. at 9–10.   \ntruin\noro 13  The court begins with the three appellate opinions discussing the Rule.4  The Ninth \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Circuit’s opinion staying this court’s preliminary injunction noted that the organizational \niD tc 15  plaintiffs were not parties to the appeal and did not express any opinion on zone of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  interests more generally.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 784 n.7 & 786 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  n.8.  In its order affirming a preliminary injunction staying the Rule, the Seventh Circuit \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  succinctly framed the zone of interest issue concerning an immigrant aid organization \nN\n19  plaintiff: \n \n20  we accept that [the aid organization] helps immigrants navigate \nthe INA’s various requirements, including the public-charge \n21  rule, and it has an interest in ensuring that immigrants are not \nimproperly denied adjustment of status or removed from the \n22  country because of confusion over DHS’s Rule.  But the link \n23 \n \n4 The Fourth Circuit recently issued an opinion reversing a preliminary injunction \n24 \nenjoining the Rule.  Casa de Md., Inc. v. Trump, 971 F.3d 220 (4th Cir. 2020).  The court \nfound that the organization plaintiff in that case did not have standing and, therefore, did \n25 \nnot address the zone of interests test.  The Fourth Circuit’s holding with regard to \nstanding does not compel a different result here.  There, the court reasoned that the \n26 \norganization’s voluntary “budgetary choice[]” like spending money on legal action is not a \ncognizable Article III injury.  Id. at 238.  Here, plaintiffs have demonstrated loss in \n27 \nrevenue due to disenrollment or non-utilization of services for which they are reimbursed.  \nIn other words, because plaintiffs are harmed regardless of their voluntary budgetary \n28 \nchoices, they have standing. \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 17 of 39\n \nbetween these injuries and the purpose of the public-charge \n1  part of the statute is more attenuated, and thus it is harder to \nsay that the injury [the organization] has asserted meets the \n2  “zone-of-interests” test. \n3  Cook Cty., Illinois v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 221 (7th Cir. 2020).  The court declined to \n4  resolve the organization’s status since only one plaintiff was required to demonstrate it \n5  fell within the zone of interests and a different plaintiff, Cook County, met that criteria.  Id. \n6  at 220.  Most recently, the Second Circuit, in an opinion affirming a preliminary injunction \n7  enjoining the Rule, held that aid organizations were within the zone of interests.  New \n8  York v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 63 (2d Cir. 2020).  The court reasoned that \n9  the organizations’  \n \n10  interests stem from their assorted missions to increase non-\ncitizen well-being and status, which they express in their work \n11  to  provide  legal  and  social  services  to  non-citizens.    An \noverbroad interpretation of the public charge ground, tipping \n a  12  the balance too far in the direction of exclusion at the expense \ntruin of admission in the interest of family unity and economic vitality, \noCrof 13  imperils both these interests.   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Id.   \niD tc 15  As an initial observation, the INA’s public charge provision does not directly \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  regulate the conduct of or benefit plaintiffs.  The observation is not dispositive because in \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  East Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit noted that aid organizations’ purpose in aiding \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  immigrants seeking asylum was consistent with the INA’s purpose to establish the \nN\n19  statutory procedure for granting asylum to refugees.  932 F.3d at 768.  In support of that \n20  statement, the court cited statutory sections in which “Congress took steps to ensure that \n21  pro bono legal services of the type that the [aid organizations] provide are available to \n22  asylum seekers.”  Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A)–(B)).  The court also cited other \n23  statutory provisions in the INA which “give institutions like the [aid organizations] a role in \n24  helping immigrants navigate the immigration process.”  Id. (citing, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n25  § 1101(i)(1)).  While plaintiffs here do not cite a mandate similar to § 1158(d)(4), they cite \n26  the same sections as in East Bay Sanctuary I as evidence of Congress’s intent that \n27  organizations have a role in helping immigrants navigate the immigration process. \n28  Unlike the preliminary injunction briefing and hearing, plaintiffs have now identified \n17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 18 of 39\n \n1  statutory provisions that bring them within the zone of interest.  Notably, the public charge \n2  provision excludes from its ambit any person who “is an applicant for, or is granted, \n3  nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(U).  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E)(ii).  In turn, \n4  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U) cross references § 1184(p) and § 1184(p)(3)(A) requires the \n5  Attorney General and other government officials, where appropriate, to refer potential U \n6  visa applicants to nongovernmental organizations.  Similarly, the public charge provision \n7  excludes persons who are “a qualified alien described in section 1641(c).”  8 U.S.C. \n8  § 1182(a)(4)(E)(iii).  In turn, 8 U.S.C. § 1641(c)(4) includes “an alien who has been \n9  granted nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(T)” and § 1101(i)(1) requires “the \n10  Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and other Government officials, \n11  where appropriate, [to] provide the alien with a referral to a nongovernmental \n a  12  organization” for nonimmigrant aliens described in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(i).  Thus, \ntruin\noro 13  “[t]hese statutes, which directly rely on institutions like [plaintiffs] to aid immigrants, are a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  sufficient ‘indicator that the plaintiff[s] [are] peculiarly suitable challenger[s] of \niD tc 15  administrative neglect . . . support[ing] an inference that Congress would have intended \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  eligibility’ to bring suit.”  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 769 (third through seventh \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  alterations in original) (quoting Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA, 861 F.2d \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  277, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). \nN\n19  Moreover, the injury that plaintiffs complain of is within the zone of interests.  \n20  Plaintiffs allege they have been harmed and will be harmed by a decrease in utilization of \n21  their services by aliens who are or believe they are subject to the Rule.  As discussed, \n22  the public charge provision references other statutory sections that require, where \n23  appropriate, government officials to refer aliens to nongovernmental organizations.   \n24  Additionally, plaintiffs can show they are suitable challengers if their “interests are \n25  sufficiently congruent with those of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not \n26  more likely to frustrate than to further . . . statutory objectives.”  California, 963 F.3d at \n27  942.  “The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to \n28  or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 19 of 39\n \n1  assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.”  Id. (internal quotation marks \n2  omitted) (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225).  In considering this \n3  prong of the zone of interests test, the court finds persuasive the Second Circuit’s opinion \n4  that determined the organizations there were among “‘those who in practice can be \n5  expected to police the interests that the statute protects[,]’ namely, the admission of non-\n6  citizens who will be self-sufficient and the exclusion of those who will not.”  New York, \n7  2020 WL 4457951, at *12 (alteration in original) (quoting Fed. Defs. of N.Y., Inc. v. Fed. \n8  Bureau of Prisons, 954 F.3d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 2020); and citing Bank of Am. Corp. v. City \n9  of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1304 (2017)). \n10  Defendants quote an in chambers opinion issued by Justice O’Connor that \n11  determined that aid organizations were outside the zone of interests of the Immigration \n a  12  Reform and Control Act of 1986 (“IRCA”).

While these reasons might be valid, more persuasive is the fact that Legalization \n22  Assistance Project dealt with IRCA, 8 U.S.C. § 1255a, and not the public charge \n23  provision.  As discussed above, the public charge provision incorporates other statutory \n24  sections providing for referrals by government officials to nongovernmental organizations \n25  thereby implicating their interests.  Legalization Assistance Project also reasoned “[t]he \n26  fact that the INS regulation may affect the way an organization allocates its resources . . . \n27  does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests the statute \n28  meant to protect.”  510 U.S. at 1305 (citation omitted).  Here, the injury is not just \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 20 of 39\n \n1  diversion of resources but also a loss of resources tied to decreased utilization of \n2  plaintiffs’ services.  This factual difference is such that, even if Legalization Assistance \n3  Project were precedential, it would not apply in this case. \n4  In sum, plaintiffs have put forward a more convincing argument than the one \n5  advanced at the preliminary injunction stage.  Critically, the Supreme Court “has \n6  repeatedly emphasized that the zone of interests test is ‘not especially demanding’ in the \n7  APA context.”  California, 963 F.3d at 941 (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130).  \n8  Accordingly, the court cannot say as a matter of law that plaintiffs fall outside the zone of \n9  interests with regard to their APA claims. \n10  ii.  Whether Zone of Interests Applies to Constitutional Claims \n11  Next, defendants contend that plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims fail the zone of \n a  12  interests test because the Supreme Court has suggested that there is a heightened zone \ntruin\noro 13  of interests requirement for implied causes of action such as plaintiffs’ constitutional \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  claim.  Mtn. at 8 n.2.  Yet, in the very case that defendants cite for this proposition, Clarke \niD tc 15  v. Securities Industry Association, 479 U.S. at 396, 400 n.16, the Court cautioned that \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “[w]hile inquiries into reviewability or prudential standing in other [non-APA] contexts may \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  bear some resemblance to a ‘zone of interest’ inquiry under the APA, it is not a test of \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  universal application.”  The Court went on to distinguish earlier dicta suggesting a zone of \nN\n19  interest inquiry was applicable to constitutional claims, stating “[w]e doubt, however, that \n20  it is possible to formulate a single inquiry that governs all statutory and constitutional \n21  claims.”  Id. (citing Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, \n22  153 (1970)).  As plaintiffs point out, the Ninth Circuit has also questioned whether a zone \n23  of interests test can be applied in light of the Court’s decision in Lexmark, which focused \n24  on Congress’s intent in creating statutory causes of action as opposed to causes of \n25  action that arise under the Constitution.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670, 701–02 \n26  (9th Cir. 2019) (“[W]e doubt that any zone of interests test applies to Plaintiffs’ equitable \n27  cause of action.”).  Accordingly, the court declines to apply a zone of interest test to \n28  plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.   \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 21 of 39\n \n1  In sum, the zone of interests test is not “especially demanding,” Lexmark, 572 U.S. \n2  at 130, and, “at the very least, the [states’] interests are ‘marginally related to’ and \n3  ‘arguably within’ the scope of the statute.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 \n4  F.3d 1242, 1270 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band, 520 U.S. at \n5  175–76).  The court, therefore, DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to zone of \n6  interests. \n7  4.  First and Second Claims—Contrary to Law and Arbitrary and \n8  Capricious \n9  Turning to defendants’ motion with regard to the individual claims, the court \n10  addresses plaintiffs’ first and second claims together as they present a related issue.  In \n11  its preliminary injunction order, the court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed \n a  12  on the merits of their claim that the Rule was not in accordance with the INA.  Dkt. 131 at \ntruin\noro 13  48.  After a lengthy review of the prior legislative, regulatory, and judicial history of the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  term “public charge,” the court determined that DHS’s interpretation of the term “public \niD tc 15  charge” was not reasonable at Chevron step two.  In its order staying the injunction, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Ninth Circuit determined that, at Chevron step one, the term “public charge” is not a term \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  of art and not self-defining—thus, it was ambiguous.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  F.3d at 792.  At step two, the court also reviewed the lengthy legislative history and case \nN\n19  law surrounding the term “public charge” and concluded that there has not been “one \n20  fixed understanding of ‘public charge’ that has endured since 1882.”  Id. at 796.  Instead, \n21  “[i]f anything has been consistent, it is the idea that a totality-of-the-circumstances test \n22  governs public-charge determinations.  But different factors have been weighted more or \n23  less heavily at different times, reflecting changes in the way in which we provide \n24  assistance to the needy.”  Id. In resolving the step two analysis, the Ninth Circuit \n25  determined that the Rule was a reasonable interpretation of the INA.  Id. at 799.   \n26  Also in its prior order, this court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on \n27  the merits that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider costs \n28  and benefits, including costs to state governments and health effects on state \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 22 of 39\n \n1  populations.  Dkt. 131 at 53.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit motions panel discussed both \n2  the cost-benefit issue and the public health effect issue.  With regard to the former, the \n3  court observed that DHS “addressed at length the costs and benefits associated with the \n4  Final Rule.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 801.  With respect to public health \n5  effects, the Ninth Circuit noted that “DHS not only addressed these concerns directly, it \n6  changed its Final Rule in response to the comments.”  Id.  The court determined that \n7  DHS could change its policy as long as DHS acknowledged the change and explained \n8  the reasons for it.  Id. at 805.  In sum, the court held that DHS demonstrated that it was \n9  likely to succeed on the merits of the arbitrary and capricious claim. \n10  As discussed more thoroughly in this court’s order in State of California, et al., v. \n11  U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., No. 19-cv-04975-PJH, Dkt. 180, the \n a  12  procedural posture of this case presents several issues.  For example, applying the \ntruin\noro 13  motions panel’s opinion would require the court to determine the extent to which the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  opinion is binding (or persuasive) as to each of plaintiffs’ claims that defendants now \niD tc 15  seek to dismiss.  Further, because the court has deferred ruling on defendants’ motion to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  dismiss in the related case, it is therefore appropriate to follow a similar course of action \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  here as plaintiffs’ substantive claims largely overlap with the related case. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Accordingly, the court DEFERS RULING ON defendants’ motion to dismiss \nN\n19  plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action until the Ninth Circuit issues an opinion on the \n20  preliminary injunction or otherwise disposes of the case. \n21  5.  Third, Fifth & Eighth Claims—McAleenan’s Appointment \n22  Plaintiffs’ third claim alleges that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because then \n23  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security McAleenan was serving in that role in violation of \n24  DHS’s organic statute and the APA.  FAC ¶ 203.  Similarly, plaintiffs’ fifth claim alleges \n25  that McAleenan was not lawfully appointed under the FVRA and DHS’s organic statute.  \n26  Id. ¶¶ 211–13.  Plaintiffs’ eighth claim alleges that McAleenan’s appointment violates the \n27  Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and DHS’s organic statute and, therefore, seek relief \n28  under the Declaratory Judgment Act.  Id. ¶ 230. \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 23 of 39\n \n1  Defendants argue that McAleenan was lawfully appointed as Acting Secretary \n2  because, after enactment of the FVRA, Congress permitted DHS to set its order of \n3  succession.  Mtn. at 17.  On April 9, 2019, then Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen established a \n4  new succession order that placed the Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) Commissioner \n5  third in the line of succession.  Id. at 18.  McAleenan was CBP Commissioner at the time, \n6  the positions above him were vacant, and, therefore, he was lawfully appointed.  Id.  \n7  Plaintiffs respond that then Secretary Nielsen’s amended order of succession only \n8  applied when the Secretary is “unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n9  emergency.”  Opp. at 18.  Instead, plaintiffs contend that relevant DHS order required \n10  that, following the resignation of the Secretary, Executive Order 13753 governed the \n11  order of succession and provided an order of succession different than Nielsen’s order.  \n a  12  Id.  Under Executive Order 13753, McAleenan was seventh, not third, in line and there \ntruin\noro 13  were two Senate-confirmed appointees in front of him.  Id.  Defendants reply that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Secretary Nielsen’s order expressly “designate[d] the order of succession for the \niD tc 15  Secretary of Homeland Security[.]”  Reply at 14.  This order clearly defined the order of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  succession and controls over any previous version of the order of succession.  Id.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Resolving this issue requires examination of the FVRA, DHS’s organic statute, and \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the orders issued pursuant to the organic statute.  “Congress broadly designated the \nN\n19  [FVRA] to be the ‘exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official to perform \n20  the functions and duties of any’ Executive office that would otherwise require Senate \n21  confirmation.”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 F.3d \n22  1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3347(a)).  “But there is an \n23  ‘unless’—Congress crafted exceptions to that exclusivity.”  Id.  DHS’s organic statute has \n24  two such exceptions that apply notwithstanding the FVRA.  First, 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(1) \n25  requires the Under Secretary for Management to serve as Acting Secretary if the \n26  Secretary or Deputy Secretary is unavailable to perform the duties of Secretary.  Second, \n27  § 113(g)(2) permits the Secretary to “designate such other officers of the Department in \n28  further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.”   \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 24 of 39\n \n1  In December 2016, then Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson issued an \n2  order of succession, entitled DHS Delegation No. 00106, that stated in relevant part: \n \n3  II. Succession Order/Delegation \n \n4  A.  In  case  of  the  Secretary’s  death,  resignation,  or \ninability  to  perform  the  functions  of  the  Office,  the  orderly \n5  succession of officials is governed by Executive Order 13753, \namended on December 9, 2016. \n6   \nB.  I  hereby  delegate  to  the  officials  occupying  the \n7  identified positions in the order listed (Annex A), my authority \nto exercise the powers and perform the functions and duties of \n8  my office, to the extent not otherwise prohibited by law, in the \nevent I am unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic \n9  emergency. \n10  Dkt. 167-1, at 2.5  On April 9, 2019, Secretary Nielsen signed an order that approved an \n11  amendment to Delegation No. 00106.  That amendment invoked 6 U.S.C. § 113(g)(2) \n a  12  and stated: “I hereby designate the order of succession for the Secretary of Homeland \ntruin\noro 13  Security as follows: Annex A of DHS Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby amended by striking the text of \niD tc 15  such Annex in its entirety and inserting the following in lieu thereof: . . . .”  Dkt. 166-3, at \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  3.  The amendment then listed the order of succession with the CBP Commissioner third \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  in line.  Id.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Thus far, the parties are in general agreement about the relevant authorities and \nN\n19  documents.  Where they depart is the effect of the April 9th order.  Defendants argue that \n20  the amendment designated the order of succession in all cases, regardless of whether it \n21  involved section II, subparagraph A of Delegation No. 00106 (i.e., in case of the \n22  Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office), or \n23  subparagraph B (i.e., when the Secretary is unavailable to act during a disaster or \n24 \n \n25 \n5 Plaintiffs attach a copy of Delegation No. 00106, dated as of April 10, 2019, to their \nopposition.  Additionally, defendants attach a copy of Secretary Nielsen’s order amending \n26 \nDelegation No. 00106 to their motion.  Dkt. 166-3.  While neither document was attached \nto the pleading, the court can consider documents “whose contents are alleged in a \n27 \ncomplaint and whose authenticity no party questions . . . .”  Knievel, 393 F.3d at 1076.  \nThe FAC references both documents and neither party challenges the authenticity of the \n28 \ndocuments in question.  FAC ¶¶ 149–50. \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 25 of 39\n \n1  catastrophic emergency).  In support of their argument, defendants quote the text of the \n2  April 9th order: “I hereby designate the order of succession for the Secretary of \n3  Homeland Security as follows . . . .”  Mtn. at 18; Reply at 14 (“Secretary Nielsen’s order, \n4  in no uncertain terms, expressly ‘designate[d] the order of succession for the Secretary of \n5  Homeland Security[.]’”).  This is an instance where the omitted material, signified by the \n6  ellipses in defendants’ motion and the bracket in their reply, is critical to understanding \n7  what exactly Secretary Nielsen ordered.  The order states, “I hereby designate the order \n8  of succession for the Secretary of Homeland Security as follows:”  Dkt. 166-3 at 3 \n9  (emphasis added).  Here is what followed: “Annex A of DHS Orders of Succession and \n10  Delegations of Authorities for Named Positions, Delegation No. 00106, is hereby \n11  amended by striking the text of such Annex in its entirety and inserting the following in \n a  12  lieu thereof: Annex A.  Order for Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of the \ntruin\noro 13  Department of Homeland Security.”  Id.  The order of succession is then laid out in the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  amended Annex A.  In other words, the April 9th order only replaced Annex A and made \niD tc 15  no other changes to Delegation No. 00106.  Thus, when Secretary Nielsen resigned “the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  orderly succession of officials [was] governed by Executive Order 13753, amended on \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  December 9, 2016,” but not the amended Annex A, which only applied when the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Secretary was unavailable due to disaster or catastrophic emergency.  Dkt. 167-1. \nN\n19  Had Secretary Nielsen intended to modify the order of succession applicable in \n20  case of the Secretary’s death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the \n21  Office, then her order could have so stated.  In fact, plaintiffs cite a later amendment of \n22  Delegation No. 00106 by Acting Secretary McAleenan, which stated “Section II.A of DHS \n23  Delegation No. 00106, DHS Orders of Succession and Delegations of Authorities for \n24  Named Positions, is amended hereby to state as follows: ‘In case of the Secretary’s \n25  death, resignation, or inability to perform the functions of the Office, the order of \n26  succession of officials is governed by Annex A.’”  Dkt. 167-2 at 2 (emphasis added).  The \n27  fact that McAleenan amended Delegation No. 00106 to modify section II.A to cross-\n28  reference Annex A but Nielsen did not, reinforces the conclusion that at the time of \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 26 of 39\n \n1  Nielsen’s resignation, Executive Order 13753 governed the order of succession. \n2  In turn, Executive Order 13753, amended December 9, 2016, provided: \n \n3  Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the \nofficers named in subsection (a) of this section, in the order \n4  listed, shall act as, and perform the functions and duties of the \noffice of, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary), if \n5  they are eligible to act as Secretary under the provisions of the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 5 U.S.C. 3345 et seq. \n6  (Vacancies Act), during any period in which the Secretary has \ndied, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform the \n7  functions and duties of the office of Secretary. \n8  81 Fed. Reg. 90,667, 90,667.  The Executive Order then lists the order of succession and \n9  the CBP Commissioner is seventh in line.  Id.  Plaintiffs allege that, at the time of \n10  McAleenan’s elevation to Acting Secretary, the roles of both the Under Secretary for \n11  National Protection and Programs and the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis \n a  12  were filled by Senate-confirmed appointees such that McAleenan’s appointment was \ntruin\noro 13  invalid and any action by him was ultra vires.  FAC ¶¶ 152–53.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  This is not the end of the inquiry, however.  As quoted above, subsection (a) is \niD tc 15  “[s]ubject to the provisions of subsection (b).”  81 Fed. Reg. at 90,667.  Subsection (b) \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the President retains discretion, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  to the extent permitted by the Vacancies Act, to depart from this order in designating an \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  acting Secretary.”  Id. at 90,668.  Thus, as long as McAleenan’s appointment was \nN\n19  permitted by the FVRA, the President had the discretion to appoint him as Acting \n20  Secretary.  Despite this discretion, defendants aver that the President did not appoint \n21  McAleenan pursuant to the FVRA.  Dkt. 184 at 2.  If the President did not exercise his \n22  authority6 under the FVRA to depart from the order of succession outlined in section (a) \n23  of Executive Order 13753, then that Executive Order controlled the order of succession.  \n24  Plaintiffs allege McAleenan assumed the position of Acting Secretary when there were \n25 \n \n6 As discussed in this court’s order granting plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, (Dkt. \n26 \n188), the FAC alleges that President Trump tweeted on April 7, 2019, that McAleenan \nwould assume the rule of Acting Secretary.  FAC ¶ 145.  It is an open question, therefore, \n27 \nwhether the President’s tweet constituted a designation sufficient to depart from the order \nof succession outlined in Executive Order 13753.  This question is a factual one not \n28 \nsuitable for resolution on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 27 of 39\n \n1  other officers above him in the order of succession and McAleenan was ineligible to \n2  assume the role of Acting Secretary.  FAC ¶¶ 152–53.  This plausibly states a claim that \n3  McAleenan was unlawfully appointed as Acting Secretary and his approval of the Rule \n4  was unlawful. \n5  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third, fifth, and \n6  eighth (pertaining to McAleenan) causes of action is DENIED.   \n7  6.  Fourth, Sixth & Eighth Claims—Cuccinelli’s Appointment \n8  Plaintiffs’ fourth claim alleges that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because \n9  then Acting Director of USCIS Cuccinelli was serving in that role in violation of the FVRA \n10  and the APA.  FAC ¶ 206.  Their sixth claim alleges that Cuccinelli was not eligible to be \n11  appointed as Acting Director of USCIS under the FVRA and, therefore, his actions have \n a  12  no force or effect.  Id. ¶¶ 216–18.  Plaintiffs’ eighth claim alleges that Cuccinelli’s \ntruin\noro 13  appointment violates the Appointments Clause, the FVRA, and DHS’s organic statute \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and, therefore, seek relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act. \niD tc 15  Defendants argue that both claims against Cuccinelli should be dismissed \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  because the Rule was promulgated under the authority and signature of Acting Secretary \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  McAleenan and not Cuccinelli.  Mtn. at 18.  Plaintiffs respond that they allege that \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Cuccinelli’s pre-promulgation involvement likely entailed taking FVRA-defined action.  \nN\n19  Opp. at 19.  They also argue that because Cuccinelli’s appointment violated FVRA, his \n20  substantial involvement in the promulgation of the Rule renders it not in accordance with \n21  law.  Id. at 20.  \n22  Plaintiffs advance two separate theories regarding Cuccinelli’s appointment.  Both \n23  theories advance from the same predicate, Cuccinelli’s appointment violated section \n24  3345 of the FVRA.  The first theory is that because of the predicate FVRA violation, the \n25  Rule was arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  The second theory is that because of \n26  the predicate violation, the Rule is rendered void by a separate FVRA provision.   \n27  Under the APA, “an agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” must be \n28  held “unlawful and set aside.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  “The FVRA renders any action taken in \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 28 of 39\n \n1  violation of the statute void ab initio: section 3348(d) declares that ‘[a]n action taken by \n2  any person who is not acting [in compliance with the FVRA] shall have no force or effect’ \n3  and ‘may not be ratified.’”  SW Gen., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 796 F.3d 67, 78 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n4  (alterations in original) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1)–(2)).  Assuming for the sake of \n5  argument that plaintiffs are correct regarding their predicate FVRA violation,—i.e., \n6  Cuccinelli’s appointment violated FVRA—it does not follow that he took an action that can \n7  be remedied under either the APA or the FVRA. \n8  Title 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a) prescribes the powers and duties of the Secretary of \n9  Homeland Security including charging him or her “with the administration and \n10  enforcement” of immigration laws and establishing regulation as he or she deems \n11  necessary for carrying out his or her authority under the provisions of the INA.  8 U.S.C. \n a  12  § 1103(a)(1), (3).  Pursuant to that authority, DHS issued both the NPRM and the Rule.  \ntruin\noro 13  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,116; 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295 (“DHS’s authority for making public \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  charge inadmissibility determinations and related decisions is found in several statutory \niD tc 15  provisions.”).  The Rule was issued pursuant to then Acting Secretary McAleenan’s \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  authority, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295–96, and under his signature, id. at 41,508.  The NPRM \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  was issued pursuant to then Secretary Nielsen’s authority, 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,124, and \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  signature, id. at 51,296.  Plaintiffs challenge the promulgation of that Rule, which was not \nN\n19  issued pursuant to Cuccinelli’s authority (or even under USCIS’s authority).  For that \n20  reason, this case is unlike the only district court that determined Cuccinelli to be \n21  unlawfully appointed and, as a remedy, set aside asylum directives there were issued by \n22  Cuccinelli.  L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. Supp. 3d 1, 11, 37 (D.D.C. 2020).  Even if \n23  plaintiffs were able to demonstrate that Cuccinelli was unlawfully appointed, they cannot \n24  state a claim for violation under the FVRA or the APA with regard to promulgation of the \n25  Rule.   \n26  For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ fourth, sixth, \n27  and eighth (pertaining to Cuccinelli) causes of action is GRANTED.  Because the Rule \n28  was promulgated under the acting DHS Secretary’s authority, no additional factual \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 29 of 39\n \n1  allegations could state a claim and further amendment of these claims would be futile. \n2  7.  Seventh Claim—Equal Protection \n3  Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ seventh claim for violation of the Equal \n4  Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  The Equal Protection Clause of the \n5  Fourteenth Amendment commands that no state shall “deny to any person within its \n6  jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, which amounts \n7  to a direction that all persons who are similarly situated should be treated alike.  City of \n8  Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The equal protection \n9  component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause imposes a similar obligation \n10  on the federal government.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499–500 (1954); see \n11  also I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 886 (1988) (considering “the possibility of a \n a  12  violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process \ntruin\noro 13  Clause”). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims should be dismissed \niD tc 15  because the Rule is facially neutral, and plaintiffs cannot establish discriminatory intent.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Mtn. at 19.  Defendants contend that the court should apply a narrow standard of review, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  as required by Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2418 (2018), because this case implicates the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Executive Branch’s authority over the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals.  Mtn. \nN\n19  at 20.  According to defendants, the FAC contains no allegations suggesting that the Rule \n20  is not at least plausibly related to DHS’s stated objectives.  Id.  Defendants also contend \n21  that the public statements by government officials upon which plaintiffs rely were not \n22  made by DHS officials and have no express connection to the Rule.  Id. at 21. \n23  Plaintiffs respond that they have alleged sufficient facts to plausibly demonstrate \n24  defendants acted with a discriminatory purpose.  Opp. at 21.  These allegations include: \n25  the Rule will bear more heavily on non-white immigrants, which DHS acknowledged in \n26  the Rule, (id.); statements by administration officials indicate that the Administration was \n27  motivated in part by racial animus (id. at 22–23); and the sequence of events leading to \n28  the promulgation of the Rule indicate a substantive departure from the normal decision-\n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 30 of 39\n \n1  making process, (id. at 23).  Plaintiffs next argue that Trump v. Hawaii is not applicable \n2  where, as here, DHS’s regulated activity applies to people already residing in the United \n3  States and national security concerns are not present.  Id. at 23–24.  \n4  In its order on defendants’ motion to dismiss in California, et al. v. Department of \n5  Homeland Security, et al., No. 19-cv-4975-PJH, Dkt. 180, the court discussed at length \n6  the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding initial entry cases and whether plaintiffs in \n7  that case could state a claim for an Equal Protection violation.  Rather than recapitulate \n8  that discussion in its entirety, the court summarizes a few main points.  To begin, the \n9  Court has long recognized that Congress’s power concerning the initial entry of aliens \n10  into the country is plenary.  See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (“This Court has \n11  repeatedly emphasized that ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of \n a  12  Congress more complete than it is over’ the admission of aliens.” (quoting Oceanic \ntruin\noro 13  Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)).  However, once an alien arrives \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  in the United States and begins establishing ties to the country, the Court has recognized \niD tc 15  certain constitutional protections extend to those persons, even if their presence is \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “unlawful, involuntary, or transitory.”  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (“There \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States.  The Fifth \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these persons \nN\n19  from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” (citations \n20  omitted)).  It is therefore necessary to distinguish whether a government action involves \n21  an initial entry into the United States or whether an alien has begun to establish ties with \n22  the United States such that his or her constitutional status changes accordingly.  See \n23  Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982). \n24  Trump v. Hawaii is best viewed as an initial entry case where Congress’s power is \n25  at its height.  In that case, the Supreme Court examined an Equal Protection challenge to \n26  an executive order issued by the President that restricted entry into the United States by \n27  foreign nationals of select countries, nearly all majority-Muslim countries.  Hawaii, 138 S. \n28  Ct. at 2403–04.  The Court considered but ultimately did not apply the highly deferential \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 31 of 39\n \n1  standard of review articulated in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 756–57 (1972), \n2  noting that stating “Mandel’s narrow standard of review ‘has particular force’ in admission \n3  and immigration cases that overlap with ‘the area of national security.’”  Hawaii, 138 S. \n4  Ct. at 2419 (quoting Kerry v. Din, 576 U.S. 86, 104 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  \n5  Instead, the Court applied rational basis review and upheld the proclamation on those \n6  grounds.  Id. at 2420–21. \n7  Similar to Hawaii, the Rule applies to immigrants and nonimmigrants seeking initial \n8  admission to the United States.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295.  Unlike Hawaii, it also applies to \n9  aliens who are already physically present in the United States and seeking adjustment of \n10  status.  Id.  Because the Rules applies in part to aliens who are already in the United \n11  States, defendants cannot entirely rely on cases based on Congress’s plenary power \n a  12  over initial entry cases to uphold the Rule.  Moreover, aliens who are physically present \ntruin\noro 13  in the United States can state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection component of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the Fifth Amendment.  See Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 970–73 (9th \niD tc 15  Cir. 2004); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982) (“Indeed, we have clearly \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  held that the Fifth Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government.” (citing Mathews, 426 U.S. at \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  77)). \nN\n19  In Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, \n20  writing for a plurality with regard to an Equal Protection challenge to the Administration’s \n21  revocation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, Chief Justice \n22  Roberts stated that “[t]o plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible inference that an \n23  ‘invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor’ in the relevant decision.  \n24  Possible evidence includes disparate impact on a particular group, ‘[d]epartures from the \n25  normal procedural sequence,’ and ‘contemporary statements by members of the \n26  decisionmaking body.’”  140 S. Ct. at 1915 (second alteration in original) (quoting \n27  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68).  At no point did the plurality cite or apply Hawaii’s \n28  deferential standard of review.  This indicates that application of the Arlington Heights \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 32 of 39\n \n1  framework is appropriate to evaluate whether plaintiffs plead discriminatory animus.  \n2  Because this court has likewise determined that Trump v. Hawaii (and the plenary power \n3  doctrine more generally) does not apply to the Rule in its entirety, similar to Regents, it is \n4  appropriate to apply Arlington Heights to plaintiffs’ claim. \n5  Defendants cite a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) opinion for the proposition \n6  that “[i]t is a well established fact that an applicant for adjustment of status under Section \n7  245 of the Act is in the same posture as though he were an applicant before an American \n8  consular officer abroad seeking issuance of an immigrant visa for the purpose of gaining \n9  admission to the United States as a lawfully permanent resident.”  Reply at 17 (quoting \n10  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I.&N. Dec. 583, 589 (B.I.A. Feb. 28, 1974)).  The BIA’s opinion \n11  could be construed as stating that Congress’s plenary power applies even if an individual \n a  12  is inside the United States because an adjustment of status is formally the same as an \ntruin\noro 13  overseas application for admission.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  A few points are worth considering with regard to Matter of Harutunian.  First, the \niD tc 15  BIA did not cite a case for its proposition, which makes evaluating its statement of the law \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  difficult.  Second, the statement appears to conflict with the proposition that “[a]liens, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  ‘persons’ guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  \nN\n19  Plyler, 457 U.S. at 210 (citations omitted).  Even assuming the BIA’s statement is true, \n20  the court is persuaded by the Court’s plurality opinion in Regents which did not apply \n21  Hawaii to the DACA program, a program applicable to persons who were physically \n22  present in the United States but otherwise had no lawful status under the immigration \n23  laws.  See Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1901. \n24  “Under Arlington Heights, a plaintiff must ‘simply produce direct or circumstantial \n25  evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely that [sic] not motivated \n26  the defendant and that the defendant’s actions adversely affected the plaintiff in some \n27  way.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504 (9th Cir. 2016) \n28  (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of Newport \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 33 of 39\n \n1  Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1158 (9th Cir. 2013)); see also Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  “A \n2  plaintiff does not have to prove that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of \n3  the challenged action, but only that it was a ‘motivating factor.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., (quoting \n4  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (9th Cir. 2015)).  While Arlington Heights describes \n5  an evidentiary framework rather than a pleading standard, the Ninth Circuit has used its \n6  factors in evaluating a district court’s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).7  \n7  See id.   \n8  In Arlington Heights, the Court described a series of non-exhaustive factors that \n9  guides the inquiry into whether a defendant’s actions were motivated by a discriminatory \n10  purpose “by examining (1) statistics demonstrating a ‘clear pattern unexplainable on \n11  grounds other than’ discriminatory ones, (2) ‘[t]he historical background of the decision,’ \n a  12  (3) ‘[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,’ (4) the \ntruin\noro 13  defendant’s departures from its normal procedures or substantive conclusions, and (5) \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  relevant ‘legislative or administrative history.’”  Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1158–59 \niD tc 15  (alterations in original) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68; and citing Comm. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, 703 (9th Cir. 2009)); \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  see also Avenue 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 504 (applying Arlington Heights factors to an \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Equal Protection claim dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)). \nN\n19  i.  Disparate Impact \n20  Here, plaintiffs allege that the Rule’s “negatively weighted factors \n21  disproportionately and detrimentally affect communities of color.”  FAC ¶ 120.  The \n22 \n \n23 \n7 While not directly applicable to Equal Protection claims, the Supreme Court and the \nNinth Circuit have held that, for employment discrimination cases, the McDonnell \n24 \nDouglas evidentiary framework is a useful touchstone to evaluate whether a claim \nsurvives a motion to dismiss; however, a plaintiff “is not required to plead a prima facie \n25 \ncase of discrimination in order to survive a motion to dismiss.”  Sheppard v. David Evans \n& Assoc., 694 F.3d 1045, 1050 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 \n26 \nU.S. 506, 508–11 (2002)).  Similar to McDonnell Douglas, the Arlington Heights \nframework is an evidentiary burden-shifting regime.  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion only requires \n27 \nplaintiffs to meet the requirements of Rule 8 and Twombly/Iqbal.  See Kwai Fun Wong, \n373 F.3d at 968 (applying Swierkiewicz to Equal Protection claim that immigration \n28 \nofficials discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her race). \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 34 of 39\n \n1  complaint also cites the Rule, where DHS stated that it “recognizes that it is possible that \n2  the inclusion of benefits such as SNAP and Medicaid may impact in greater numbers \n3  communities of color, including Latinos and [Asian-American, Pacific Islanders], as well \n4  as those with particular medical conditions that require public benefits for treatment, and \n5  therefore may impact the overall composition of immigration with respect to these \n6  groups.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,369.  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Rule will \n7  impact certain racial groups more heavily than others. \n8  However, the court notes that the plurality opinion in Regents found that the \n9  disparate impact of the DACA rescission on Latinos was not sufficient to state a claim.  \n10  Writing for himself and three other justices, Chief Justice Roberts stated “because \n11  Latinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien population, one would expect \n a  12  them to make up an outsized share of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief \ntruin\noro 13  program. . . . Were this fact sufficient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  immigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds.”  Regents, 140 S. \niD tc 15  Ct. at 1915.  This reasoning is persuasive and the Rule’s disparate impact, while notable, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  is not dispositive. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ii.  Statements by Decisionmakers \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Next, plaintiffs cite evidence of potential bias exemplified by actions and \nN\n19  statements of the President and his advisors.  With regard to the administration generally, \n20  plaintiffs cite numerous immigration-related executive actions that they characterize as \n21  either exclusively or disproportionately harming immigrants from non-white majority \n22  nations.  These actions include separating young children from their parents at the \n23  southern U.S. border, ending DACA and temporary protected status for El Salvador, \n24  Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Sudan, and Nicaragua, and excluding nationals from majority-\n25  Muslim countries.  FAC ¶ 124.  With respect to the President, plaintiffs allege that, as a \n26  candidate, the President ran a campaign replete with racist aspersions about people of \n27  Mexican descent and Muslim faith.  Id. ¶ 125.  After his inauguration, the President stated \n28  that Haitians “all have AIDS,” that America should not be a haven for “people from \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 35 of 39\n \n1  shithole countries,” and that he preferred immigrants coming from places like Norway.  Id.  \n2  They also allege that on July 14, 2019, the President claimed that four congresswomen \n3  of color “originally came from countries whose government are a complete and total \n4  catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world . . .” and asked \n5  “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from \n6  which they came . . . .”  Id. ¶ 129 (second alteration in original). \n7  With respect to administration officials, plaintiffs allege that other senior \n8  administration officials made statements indicative of racial bias.  They cite statements at \n9  a press conference by then Acting Director of USCIS Cuccinelli who said that “President \n10  Trump has once again delivered on his promise” regarding immigration.  Id. ¶ 133.  When \n11  asked about how the Rule would target Latinos, Cuccinelli stated “if we had been having \n a  12  this conversation 100 years ago, it would’ve applied to more Italians.”  Id.  Cuccinelli also \ntruin\noro 13  “rewrote” the words to Emma Lazarus’s sonnet on the Statue of Liberty “Give me your \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  tired and your poor” by adding “who can stand on their own two feet and who will not \niD tc 15  become a public charge.”  Id. ¶ 134.  Cuccinelli explained that the poem was referring \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies.  Id.  Plaintiffs \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  also cite a statement by the prior acting director of Immigration and Customs \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Enforcement Mark Morgan who said of unaccompanied children in detention centers, \nN\n19  “I’ve looked at them and I’ve looked at their eyes . . . and I’ve said that is a soon-to-be \n20  MS-13 gang member.  It’s unequivocal.”  Id. ¶ 137 (alteration in original). \n21  In Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916, Chief Justice Roberts’ plurality opinion found the \n22  President’s statements to be “unilluminating” and instead noted that “relevant actors were \n23  most directly [the] Acting Secretary [of Homeland Security] and the Attorney General.”  \n24  The opinion stated that “respondents did not ‘identif[y] statements by [either] that would \n25  give rise to an inference of discriminatory motive.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (citation \n26  omitted).  Next, Chief Justice Roberts found the President’s statements were “remote in \n27  time and made in unrelated contexts” and did not “qualify as ‘contemporary statements’ \n28  probative of the decision at issue.”  Id. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268).  \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 36 of 39\n \n1  While a plurality opinion, this reasoning suggests that the President’s statements, which \n2  have no direct connection to the Rule are not relevant to the Equal Protection analysis.   \n3  Applying here, plaintiffs allege both pre- and post-inauguration statements by the \n4  President.  The pre-inauguration statements, FAC ¶ 125, are similar to those in Regents \n5  that are more remote in time and not applicable to the agency action at issue.  The post-\n6  inaugurations statements pertain to the same time period as the beginning of the \n7  rulemaking process but are not connected to the Rule.  With regard to statements by \n8  other administration officials, plaintiffs cite statements by Cuccinelli that were made at a \n9  press conference discussing the Rule.  As discussed above, Cuccinelli was appointed \n10  two months before DHS promulgated the Rule and plaintiffs have not alleged Cuccinelli \n11  was involved in the rulemaking process.  Even assuming his statements plausibly \n a  12  demonstrate discriminatory intent, plaintiffs have not alleged he was a relevant actor in \ntruin\noro 13  the rulemaking process.  This reasoning also applies to the statement by acting director \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Morgan, who has no apparent connection to the Rule.  Finally, plaintiffs’ citation of \niD tc 15  various executive actions is similar to their disparate impact argument.  It may be true \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that this administration’s action falls more heavily on immigrants and non-immigrants \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  from non-White, non-European countries, but disparate impact by itself is insufficient to \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  state a claim for an Equal Protection violation. \nN\n19  In sum, plaintiffs have identified a few statements made in unrelated contexts by \n20  the President and comments from a DHS official who is not alleged to have any \n21  connection to the rulemaking process, other than defending it after it was promulgated.  \n22  They have not alleged sufficient factual matter concerning statements by decisionmakers. \n23  iii.  Departure from Normal Procedures \n24  Plaintiffs also contend that the Rule departed from normal procedures as \n25  evidenced by the efforts of White House advisor Stephen Miller’s comments to fast-track \n26  the Rule to completion.  Id. ¶ 131 (“[T]he timing on public charge is unacceptable . . . I \n27  don’t care what you need to do to finish it on time.”); see also id. ¶ 132.  Plaintiffs’ \n28  allegations barely raise an inference of an improper departure from the norm.  Cf. \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 37 of 39\n \n1  Regents, 908 F.3d at 519 (“DACA received reaffirmation by the agency as recently as \n2  three months before the rescission, only to be hurriedly cast aside on what seems to \n3  have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality).  This strange about-face, done at \n4  lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration within the agency was \n5  bypassed.”).  Plaintiffs’ allegations that the Rule was fast tracked do not raise an \n6  inference of discriminatory intent.  This rulemaking process was not a 3-month about-\n7  face; the NPRM began a year before the final Rule was published, received hundreds of \n8  thousands of comments, which prompted some changes to the Rule.  At most, they \n9  plausibly allege that defendants wanted to implement the Rule sooner rather than later. \n10  In light of the foregoing, plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient factual matter to state \n11  a claim for an Equal Protection violation.  The court GRANTS defendants’ motion to \n a  12  dismiss plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action.  Because plaintiffs could allege additional factual \ntruin\noro 13  matter, the dismissal is with leave to amend.8 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  8.  Whether the President is a Proper Defendant \niD tc 15  Defendants also argue that the court should dismiss the President as a defendant \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  because plaintiffs lack an express or implied equitable cause of action to sue the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  President.  Mtn. at 22.  Plaintiffs respond that courts routinely issue relief enjoining the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  official actions of a sitting President.  Opp. at 24.   \nN\n19  Generally, courts lack “jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the \n20  performance of his official duties.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802–03 \n21  (1992) (plurality opinion) (quoting Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall. ) 475, 501 \n22  (1866)).  In narrow circumstances, the Supreme Court has held that the President might \n23  be subject to a judicial injunction.  For example, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 \n24  (1974), held that the President may be subject to a subpoena to provide information \n25 \n \n26 \n8 Other district courts have found that plaintiffs in those cases have alleged sufficient \nfactual allegations to state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection component of the \n27 \nFifth Amendment.  See New York, 2020 WL 4347264, at *6; Cook Cty., Ill., 2020 WL \n2542155, at *3–5.  These other cases suggest that plaintiffs could allege additional facts \n28 \nsuch that amendment of their complaint is not futile. \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 38 of 39\n \n1  relevant to an ongoing criminal prosecution.  Plaintiffs have not cited a specific case that \n2  would authorize the court to depart from the general rule against enjoining the President. \n3  It does not follow, however, that the court should therefore dismiss the President \n4  as a defendant.  Franklin noted that “the President’s actions may still be reviewed for \n5  constitutionality,” though not under the APA because the President is not an “agency” for \n6  purposes of the APA.  505 U.S. at 800–01 (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. \n7  Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935)).  \n8  At this stage, the court declines to decide whether the President should be dismissed.  \n9  Defendants have not presented authority for the proposition that the President should \n10  dismissed from this action, as opposed to enjoined from taking a specific action.  At the \n11  same time, plaintiffs have not cited any authority authorizing the court to enjoin the \n a  12  President, assuming they are able to state a claim outside of the APA.

Because this \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  order dismisses all non-APA claims against defendants, the court need not opine further \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  on this issue. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  CONCLUSION \nN\n19  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss with \n20  respect to their standing, ripeness, and zone of interest challenges and with respect to \n21  plaintiffs’ third, fifth, and eighth causes of action pertaining to McAleenan’s appointment.  \n22  Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ fourth, sixth, and eighth causes of action \n23  pertaining to Cuccinelli’s appointment in violation of the APA, FVRA, and Declaratory \n24  Judgment Act is GRANTED, and the claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT LEAVE TO \n25  AMEND; and defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action for \n26  violation of the Fifth Amendment is GRANTED, and the claim is DISMISSED WITH \n27  LEAVE TO AMEND.  Further, the court DEFERS RULING ON defendants’ motion to \n28 \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 189   Filed 11/25/20   Page 39 of 39\n \n1  dismiss plaintiffs’ first and second causes of action.9  Plaintiffs will be permitted to file an \n2  amended complaint after resolution of the deferred claims. \n3    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n4  Dated: November 25, 2020 \n5  /s/ Phyllis J.

Dkt. 157.  The court also stayed discovery “until resolution of defendants’ \nforthcoming motion to dismiss.”  Id. at 31.  Because this order defers ruling on two of \n28 \nplaintiffs’ claims, the court’s prior stay order remains in effect. \n39 ",

President Donald J. Trump is determined to prevent immigrants of color from \n3 coming to and remaining in the United States.  As part of this broad effort, the administration has \n4 promulgated a “public charge” regulation, which erects hurdles to family-based immigration that \n5 Congress has not authorized.  This unlawful regulation harms and specifically targets immigrants \n6 of color. \n7 2.  Defendants’ “public charge” regulation (“Regulation”) violates the Administrative \n8 Procedure Act (“APA”) and the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n9 Constitution.  The Regulation is squarely at odds with the language of the statute, its century-long \n10 interpretation, and Congress’s purpose in enacting the statute.  It is arbitrary and capricious and \n11 motivated by animus toward non-white immigrants.  \n12 3.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) bars an individual from obtaining a \n13 green card or from obtaining certain visas if the person is “likely at any time to become a public \n14 charge.”  Since Congress first introduced the term in the immigration context in 1882, “public \n15 charge” has been understood to mean only someone who is primarily dependent on the \n16 government to avoid destitution (i.e., someone who is effectively a “charge” or ward of the state).  \n17 From its first use in the immigration laws, “public charge” was included alongside other grounds \n18 of inadmissibility that necessitate reliance on the government to avoid destitution, such as \n19 “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “insane persons.”  Congress has never altered the long-\n20 standing meaning of “public charge” as articulated by the courts and administrative agencies.  \n21 “Public charge” has never been understood to reach immigrants who, like the majority of citizens \n22 in the United States, may at some point in their lives receive supplemental health care, nutrition, or \n23 housing assistance to improve their lives and those of their families.   \n24 4.  Acting unilaterally and without congressional approval, Defendants now deviate \n25 from the established meaning of the term public charge, dramatically expanding it to effect a sea-\n26 change in immigration law.  The Regulation treats as a public charge any immigrant found to be \n27 more likely than not, at any time over his or her lifetime, to receive any amount of benefits from a \n28 wide range of supplemental public benefits programs.  \n  -1-  Case No. 19-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 4 of 45\n \n1 5.  The targeted benefits include health care coverage (non-emergency Medicaid for \n2 non-pregnant adults), housing assistance (Section 8 and public housing), and food assistance \n3 (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or “SNAP”).  Indeed, one in four U.S. citizens (over \n4 70 million individuals) participate in one or more of these programs in any given year.  Moreover, \n5 about one half of U.S. citizens can be expected to use one of the programs at some point in their \n6 lifetime.  Those who rely on these programs include low- and moderate-income working families \n7 who depend primarily on income from employment, but who receive supplemental benefits that \n8 improve their quality of life and their communities.  These non-cash programs help millions of \n9 citizens and immigrants alike, enabling them to remain healthy and productive in communities \n10 where rents and other costs of living are high.  \n11 6.  In addition, the Regulation fundamentally distorts the totality-of-the-circumstances \n12 test that the public-charge statute prescribes.  The Regulation sets forth a series of arbitrary factors \n13 that are not reasonably related to whether a person is likely to become a public charge—including \n14 English proficiency and credit scores.  Most of the factors enumerated in the Regulation are \n15 negatively weighted, significantly and arbitrarily tipping the scale in favor of finding an applicant \n16 to be a public charge.  \n17 7.  The Regulation also introduces a public charge determination against an entirely \n18 new group—nonimmigrants seeking a change of status or an extension of their stay—making \n19 those nonimmigrants who have received certain designated benefits generally ineligible for a \n20 change of status or extension, despite the agency’s acknowledgement that the public charge statute \n21 does not apply to this group. \n22 8.  This Regulation fits squarely within a consistent pattern of racial discrimination in  \n23 this Administration’s immigration policies—including separating thousands of Central American \n24 children from their mothers and fathers; refusing refuge to non-white immigrants seeking asylum; \n25 attempting to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; terminating Temporary \n26 Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure for nationals of several predominantly non-\n27 white countries; excluding individuals from majority Muslim countries; proposing a rule that \n28 would bar families from housing programs if any family member is without eligible immigration \n  -2-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 5 of 45\n \n1 status; and proposing a Regulation that would apply the same overbroad definition to the “public-\n2 charge” deportability ground.          \n3 9.  Defendants fail to provide adequate reasons for their dramatic changes to the \n4 public-charge policy, and they fail to explain how those changes are consistent with the statutory \n5 language and the well-settled interpretation of that language.  Defendants have acted in total \n6 disregard of the Regulation’s effects on families, communities, and the nation.  And the agency \n7 has failed to respond adequately to the myriad concerns expressed in the over 260,000 comments \n8 submitted.   \n9 10.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to enjoin the implementation of Defendants’ new public \n10 charge Regulation in order to prevent irreparable harm to themselves and their communities.  \n11 Plaintiffs represent health care providers and other nonprofit organizations that seek to protect \n12 access to health care, nutrition, housing, and other public benefits for immigrants, including \n13 immigrants of color, regardless of their immigration status or financial means.  The Regulation has \n14 and will continue to divert Plaintiffs’ resources, both to address the harmful effects of the \n15 Regulation and to educate immigrant families about those effects, preventing Plaintiffs from \n16 carrying out other aspects of their missions and ensuring that their patients, members, and clients \n17 do not forgo critical services to lead healthy, productive, and successful lives.   \n18 11.  The Regulation is also impermissibly vague and complex, inviting arbitrary and \n19 discriminatory enforcement by immigration officials.  As a result, the regulation will cause \n20 immigrant families, including those with U.S. citizen members, to disenroll from programs or to \n21 forgo benefits for which they are eligible.  Many of these immigrant families will not in fact be \n22 subject to the public charge inquiry but will nonetheless disenroll due to fear or lack of \n23 understanding as to how the Regulation operates.  The impacts of this chilling effect are far-\n24 reaching.  The Regulation not only will jeopardize the health of the affected immigrants, their \n25 children, and other family members, but will also endanger public health by, among other things, \n26 increasing the likelihood of untreated communicable disease, depriving essential community \n27 health providers of Medicaid revenue, and creating food and housing instability.  The Regulation \n28 will produce negative health and economic outcomes nationwide over generations.    \n  -3-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 6 of 45\n \n1 12.  Plaintiffs request that this Court hold unlawful and set aside the Regulation under \n2 the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to \n3 the U.S. Constitution and that it enter an injunction barring Defendants from implementing the \n4 Regulation.  \n5 PARTIES \n6 I.  Plaintiffs \n7 13.  Plaintiff LA CLÍNICA DE LA RAZA (“LA CLÍNICA”) is a Federally Qualified \n8 Health Center whose mission is to improve the quality of life of the diverse communities it serves \n9 by providing culturally appropriate, high-quality, and accessible health care for all.  LA CLÍNICA \n10 serves more than 86,000 patients annually in the San Francisco Bay Area and is one of the largest \n11 community health centers in California, with a total of 35 clinical service and \n12 support/administrative sites across three Bay Area counties.  \n13 14.  LA CLÍNICA serves patients who may seek to extend or adjust their immigration \n14 status, and whose immigration applications will be subject to Defendants’ Regulation.  Many LA \n15 CLÍNICA patients receive Medicaid and other public benefits.  A significant number of LA \n16 CLÍNICA’s patients are low-income, have limited English proficiency, and/or have limited skills \n17 and education.  Many LA CLÍNICA patients also reside in large households.  LA \n18 CLÍNICA’s patients are predominantly people of color.   \n19 15.  Defendants’ new Regulation will frustrate LA CLÍNICA’s ability to provide \n20 accessible health care to the thousands of patients it treats each year.  Because of the Regulation’s \n21 chilling effect, many of LA CLÍNICA’s patients—and their families—are likely to avoid using \n22 public benefits, including seeking health care services.  Many of LA CLÍNICA’s patients will \n23 either disenroll themselves and/or their family members from Medicaid based on the fear that \n24 using these benefits will hinder their ability to adjust status in the future.  Other LA CLÍNICA \n25 patients will cancel or refrain from scheduling medical appointments for fear that using health care \n26 services could affect their ability to adjust status.  This will harm immigrant patients and their \n27 communities.  It will also severely harm LA CLÍNICA by significantly reducing LA \n28 CLÍNICA’s funding stream while imposing substantial unbudgeted costs. \n  -4-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 7 of 45\n \n1 16.  Plaintiff CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION (“CPCA”) brings this \n2 action on behalf of its members. Formed in 1994, CPCA has become the statewide leader and a \n3 recognized voice in representing the interests of California community health centers and their \n4 patients.  CPCA represents Regional Clinic Associations and 1,330 nonprofit community health \n5 centers (“CHCs”) that provide comprehensive primary and preventive health services to low-\n6 income and uninsured patients in California.  CPCA’s members include community and free \n7 health centers, some federally funded and federally designated health centers, rural and urban \n8 clinics, large and small clinic corporations, and clinics dedicated to special needs and special \n9 populations.   \n10 17.  CPCA’s members serve diverse populations and ensure that everyone has access to \n11 health care regardless of their ability to pay, their immigration status, or their individual \n12 circumstances.  The CHCs serve 6.9 million California residents every year.  Approximately 72% \n13 of the CHCs’ patients are Latino, Asian Pacific Islander, or Black.  CHCs serve patients of various \n14 immigrant statuses, including immigrants who will be subject to the public charge admission test \n15 when they seek to extend or change their nonimmigrant visas or apply for lawful permanent \n16 residence \n17 18.  Sixty percent of the patients served by CPCA’s members are enrolled in Medi-Cal, \n18 the Medicaid program in California.  This means that CHCs serve more than 4 million Medi-Cal \n19 enrollees.  \n20 19.  CPCA’s members will face significant financial harm as a result of the Rule.  \n21 CPCA expects CHCs’ patients will disenroll from public benefits, including Medi-Cal, because of \n22 the changes to the public charge test.  Specifically, CPCA predicts that hundreds of thousands of \n23 its members’ patients will disenroll from Medi-Cal as a result of the Rule, causing the CHCs to \n24 lose millions of dollars annually in Medi-Cal reimbursements.  This will lead to an increase in \n25 uninsured patients. CPCA anticipates that a number of these patients will continue seeking \n26 services at CHCs, forcing the CHCs to incur increased costs serving uninsured patients while \n27 experiencing a dramatic drop in revenue.  \n28\n  -5-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 8 of 45\n \n1 20.  One of CPCA’s members, Asian Health Services (“AHS”), is a nonprofit \n2 community health center headquartered in Oakland, California.  AHS provides health services at \n3 more than a dozen locations in Oakland and San Leandro, California and has 28,000 active \n4 patients of all ages.  AHS is a member in good standing of CPCA and has been a member since \n5 1994, when CPCA was formed.  \n6 21.  Founded in 1974, AHS’s mission is to serve and advocate for the medically \n7 underserved, including the immigrant and refugee Asian community, and to ensure equal access to \n8 health care for all, regardless of income, insurance status, immigration status, language, or culture. \n9 As a federally qualified health center, AHS offers services to uninsured patients on a sliding fee \n10 scale. Individuals with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level receive most services at \n11 no cost.  Approximately 93% of AHS patients are Asian; 2% are Latino; and 2% are Black. In \n12 addition, approximately 58 % of AHS patients are not yet United States citizens. For 73% of \n13 patients, English is not their primary language.  Roughly two-thirds of AHS patients are enrolled \n14 in Medi-Cal, which is the Medicaid program in California.  \n15 22.  The Regulation will cause irreparable harm to many AHS patients and to AHS.  \n16 The Regulation will have a substantial chilling effect on AHS patients’ access to health care \n17 and/or use of their health coverage.  Some patients will stop receiving services altogether based on \n18 fears about the effect on their or their children’s immigration status.  Other AHS patients will \n19 continue to receive services from AHS, but will decline to enroll in or will disenroll from Medi-\n20 Cal due to the Rule. \n21 23.  As a result of the Regulation, AHS will incur significant financial loss. Medi-Cal \n22 reimbursements account for 52% of AHS’s annual budget.  AHS estimates that as its patients \n23 disenroll from or decline to enroll in Medi-Cal, it will lose as much as $5.2 million in Medi-Cal \n24 reimbursements every year.  AHS will have no way to recoup the cost of the services provided to \n25 those patients who disenroll but continue to receive services.  In addition to losing Medi-Cal \n26 funding, AHS will have to divert considerable resources to responding to the Regulation.  For \n27 example, AHS expects staff to spend time responding to individual patients’ questions and \n28 concerns about enrolling in or remaining enrolled in Medi-Cal and/or CalFresh given the \n  -6-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 9 of 45\n \n1 Regulation.  These efforts will leave staff members with less time to help patients enroll in health \n2 coverage and SNAP, schedule appointments, and provide case management, referrals and care \n3 coordination.   \n4 24.  Plaintiff Maternal and Child Health Access (“MCHA”) works to ensure access to \n5 quality and comprehensive health care for all, with a focus on perinatal care and child health.  \n6 MCHA works with low-income immigrant families who access services through California’s \n7 SNAP program, California’s Medicaid program, and Section 8 housing.  Since the 1990s, \n8 MCHA’s purpose has been to support women and their families so they can be healthy and \n9 financially independent.  MCHA offers enrollment assistance programs to help people of all \n10 genders and ages secure and navigate SNAP and health-care coverage, training and education for \n11 organizations and individuals about eligibility for benefit programs for low-income and immigrant \n12 families, plus home visits, weekly classes, and mental health supports to help families succeed.   \n13 25.  The Regulation will frustrate MCHA’s mission by reducing access to nutrition, \n14 medical care, and adequate housing.  Immigrant families who MCHA serves are already \n15 disenrolling from public benefit programs, such as SNAP and Medicaid, based on fears that using \n16 those programs will affect their future immigration relief options.  Women have refrained and will \n17 continue to refrain from seeking health services, food, and other programs for themselves and their \n18 children, based on fears that using those benefits will prevent them from adjusting status.  If the \n19 Regulation is implemented, MCHA expects even more women to refrain from seeking Medicaid \n20 and other necessary health services, food, and other programs for themselves and their children, \n21 based on fears that using those benefits will prevent them from adjusting status.  To support their \n22 babies, pregnant women need, on average, an additional 300 calories per day.  Yet MCHA already \n23 sees women pulling themselves out of nutrition support programs based on fear of public charge, \n24 and anticipates even more SNAP disenrollments if the rule is implemented.  Losing access to \n25 critical health and nutrition services during pregnancy and early childhood could negatively affect \n26 MCHA’s clients for years.   \n27 26.  Their clients’ disenrollment from health, housing, and nutrition programs will make \n28 it difficult for MCHA to continue its operations.  MCHA will be forced to shift its capacity and \n  -7-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 10 of 45\n \n1 divert its resources to respond to the Regulation, whose complexity makes simple reassuring \n2 messages impossible.  MCHA will need to identify alternative forms of assistance for those who \n3 disenroll from benefit programs, develop and implement additional measures so that mothers and \n4 families feel comfortable continuing to use MCHA’s home-visitation program, and engage in \n5 substantial community education to try to combat the Regulation’s chilling effect.  If the \n6 Regulation goes into effect, MCHA will be forced to address client situations that have worsened \n7 over time, such as prolonged malnutrition and delayed access to medical care.  These heightened \n8 client problems will require additional staff time.  To respond to the Regulation, MCHA will also \n9 need to allocate staff members who can follow up with individuals who raise concerns about the \n10 Regulation. \n11 27.  Plaintiff Farmworker Justice (“FJ”) is a national non-profit organization \n12 representing farmworkers who perform agricultural work in the United States and their families.  \n13 FJ’s mission is to empower migrant and seasonal farmworkers to improve their living and working \n14 conditions, health, occupational safety, and access to justice.  It also provides policy analysis and \n15 advocacy, legal advocacy, training, and technical assistance to farmworkers, attorneys, migrant \n16 health centers, and immigrant advocacy groups.  FJ represents approximately 2 million \n17 farmworkers who work in the United States, as well as their spouses and children who, combined, \n18 represent approximately 4.5 million individuals in the United States.  A large and growing number \n19 of farmworkers have H-2A non-immigrant visas, which are for temporary agricultural workers. \n20 28.  The Regulation will disadvantage many farmworkers who seek to adjust to lawful \n21 permanent resident (LPR) status or to obtain or extend their non-immigrant H-2A status.  For \n22 example, the Regulation penalizes individuals with low incomes, and farm laborers’ wages are \n23 among the lowest in the nation.  FJ also represents immigrant farmworker families who receive \n24 Medicaid and SNAP, and who will feel compelled by the Regulation to forgo those benefits in \n25 order to remain eligible to adjust their status.  Farmworkers are disenrolling eligible U.S. citizen \n26 children from Medicaid due to fears that their children’s health care coverage will affect their \n27 ability to seek immigration relief. They also fear that this may lead eventually to the forced \n28\n  -8-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 11 of 45\n \n1 separation of their family and are not seeking health coverage or services at health centers for the \n2 same reasons. \n3 29.  The Regulation has forced FJ to divert substantial resources in order to develop and \n4 disseminate information about the Regulation that addresses the farmworker communities’ needs, \n5 thus reducing the organization’s ability to engage extensively in other issues that affect \n6 farmworker families and advance FJ’s mission.  \n7 30.  Plaintiff COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS–CALIFORNIA \n8 (“CAIR-CA”) is dedicated to enhancing the understanding of Islam, protecting civil rights, \n9 promoting justice, and empowering American Muslims.  CAIR-CA was established in 1994 and \n10 has four offices throughout the state.  CAIR-CA serves Arab, Middle Eastern, Muslim, and South \n11 Asian (“AMEMSA”) communities.  Among other activities, CAIR-CA provides direct \n12 immigration assistance, including by helping AMEMSA communities with adjustment of status \n13 applications. \n14 31.  CAIR-CA has clients who are seeking or will seek to adjust their status in the \n15 future.  CAIR-CA also has clients who use public benefits, including Medicaid, public housing, \n16 and SNAP.  CAIR-CA’s clients have incomes at or below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level \n17 (“FPL”).  The Regulation will frustrate CAIR-CA’s mission to protect civil rights, promote \n18 justice, and empower American Muslims.  CAIR-CA will need to divert its resources in an attempt \n19 to reduce the harm stemming from Defendants’ Regulation, forcing CAIR-CA staff members to \n20 reduce their capacity in other areas that further CAIR-CA’s mission.  Moreover, the Regulation is \n21 causing many of the immigrant families that CAIR-CA serves to refrain from seeking \n22 supplemental benefits or to disenroll from those programs, cutting off important services and \n23 destabilizing their families and their communities.   \n24 32.  Plaintiff AFRICAN COMMUNITIES TOGETHER (“ACT”) is a membership \n25 organization of African immigrant members fighting for civil rights, opportunity, and a better life \n26 for African immigrant families residing in the United States.  ACT serves African immigrants \n27 seeking legal assistance with immigration relief, including by providing assistance with \n28 adjustment of status applications.  ACT has approximately 3,000 members, offices in New York \n  -9-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 12 of 45\n \n1 and the District of Columbia, and organizes a national network of African immigrant- serving \n2 organizations.  ACT serves immigrant families who are originally from Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, \n3 Ethiopia, and other African nations. \n4 33.  Defendants’ Regulation will frustrate ACT’s mission by directly restricting the \n5 number of African immigrants who will be able to adjust to LPR status or maintain or change their \n6 non-immigrant immigration status due to the public charge test, thus eliminating essential \n7 pathways for this population to obtain LPR status.  This is because ACT’s clients who will seek to \n8 adjust status include individuals who are low-income and who possess other characteristics \n9 considered to be negative factors under the Regulation.  ACT also has clients who receive \n10 Medicaid, SNAP, and other public benefits.  Moreover, ACT will be forced to divert its resources \n11 to combat the chilling effects and discriminatory message of the Regulation, forcing the \n12 organization to spend less time on its other areas of work and to reduce the overall number of \n13 cases the organization can take on.  The Regulation is discouraging ACT’s clients from accessing \n14 social services for fear that receipt of any public benefit will affect any future attempt to adjust, \n15 maintain or change their immigration status, causing harm to individuals and families who are \n16 eligible for those benefits. \n17 34.  Plaintiff LEGAL AID SOCIETY OF SAN MATEO COUNTY (“LEGAL AID”) \n18 has been the primary legal service provider for low-income and vulnerable residents in San Mateo \n19 County for over sixty years.  LEGAL AID engages in community education, legal representation, \n20 systemic advocacy, and collaboration with community partners to help vulnerable community \n21 members secure safe, affordable housing, access health care, achieve economic security, and \n22 obtain immigration benefits for which they are eligible.  Legal Aid has devoted significant \n23 resources to educating San Mateo County’s immigrant residents about the various public programs \n24 for which they are eligible, including Medicaid and SNAP, as well as about the public charge \n25 inadmissibility test. \n26 35.  Some of LEGAL AID’s clients will be subject to the Regulation when they seek to \n27 adjust their status or extend or change their non-immigrant visas.  Many of Legal Aid’s clients are \n28 likely to disenroll from, or fear enrolling in, these important programs.   Some clients may be \n  -10-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 13 of 45\n \n1 deemed public charges under the Regulation because they either use or will become eligible for \n2 public benefits, including Medicaid, SNAP, and housing benefits and have other characteristics \n3 that will weigh against them, including low household incomes, limited-English proficiency, and \n4 large household sizes.  Access to these programs enables LEGAL AID clients to thrive.    \n5 36.  The Regulation frustrates LEGAL AID’s mission to fight social injustice by \n6 helping San Mateo County residents obtain services through legal advocacy, and to help low-\n7 income individuals achieve self-sufficiency.  LEGAL AID will need to divert its resources to help \n8 San Mateo County’s immigrant residents and their families who are either directly subject to the \n9 Regulation or harmed because of the Regulation’s chilling effect.  These diversions will reduce \n10 Legal Aid’s capacity to take additional cases. \n11 37.   Plaintiff CENTRAL AMERICAN RESOURCE CENTER of Los Angeles \n12 (“CARECEN”) is a civil rights, social services and community empowerment organization. \n13 Founded by Salvadoran refugees in 1983, it is now the largest Central American immigrant-rights \n14 organization in the country.  CARECEN’s mission is to empower Central Americans and all \n15 immigrants by defending human and civil rights, working for social and economic justice, and \n16 promoting cultural diversity, including by providing pro bono and low-cost immigration legal \n17 services to low-income immigrants.  Most of CARECEN’s legal work consists of legal counseling \n18 and representation to low-income individuals seeking admission and LPR status.  CARECEN also \n19 engages in community outreach and education, including about the process for obtaining lawful \n20 permanent residence.  \n21 38.  The Regulation will frustrate the core component of CARECEN’s mission to \n22 provide legal representation to individuals seeking admission and adjustment to lawful permanent \n23 residence.  More than half of CARECEN’s clients receive, have received, or have household \n24 members who receive or have received one or more forms of public assistance, including \n25 Medicaid and SNAP.  About half of CARECEN’s clients’ household incomes fall below the \n26 federal poverty line, and nearly all of its clients’ household incomes fall below 250% of the FPL.  \n27 CARECEN’s legal staff will have to expend significant additional time interviewing clients about \n28 their public-benefits history and assessing whether they are harmed by the Regulation, as well as \n  -11-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 14 of 45\n \n1 advising clients about the potential impact of the Regulation if they receive certain benefits in the \n2 future.  CARECEN will also expend considerable time educating the community about the \n3 Regulation as well as training its own staff so they can properly counsel clients who may be \n4 adversely affected by the Regulation.  This will divert significant resources away from other \n5 aspects of CARECEN’s mission.  \n6 39.  Plaintiff KOREAN RESOURCE CENTER (“KRC”) is a non-profit community and \n7 membership organization empowering low-income, immigrants, Asian American and Pacific \n8 Islander, and people of color communities in Southern California. KRC’s mission is to empower \n9 members and clients, using a holistic approach, by integrating services, education, culture, \n10 organizing, and coalition building, all of which seek to help individuals thrive.  KRC has offices in \n11 Los Angeles and Orange County.  \n12 40.  KRC engages in community education and organizing, systemic advocacy, and \n13 legal representation.  KRC’s legal representation in immigration matters includes family-based \n14 adjustment of status applications, naturalization, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) \n15 renewals, and deportation defense.  KRC also assists members, particularly seniors, with public \n16 benefits, such as Medicaid, SNAP and subsidized housing.  The Regulation will cause KRC \n17 members and their families to disenroll from, or to fear enrolling in these important programs.   \n18 41.  The Regulation will frustrate KRC’s mission by directly reducing the number of \n19 clients and members who will be able to adjust to LPR status or maintain or change their non-\n20 immigrant immigration status due to the public charge test.  KRC’s members and clients include \n21 individuals who are low-income and receive Medicaid, SNAP, subsidized housing and other \n22 public benefits, and who possess other characteristics considered to be negative factors under the \n23 Regulation, including being elderly, having low incomes, and having limited-English proficiency.  \n24 KRC believes its individual members will be unable to adjust status as a result of the Regulation. \n25 42.  In addition, the Regulation will force KRC to spend more resources on immigration \n26 consultations and public benefits assistance.  \n27 43.  KRC will be forced to divert its resources to combat the chilling effects of the \n28 Regulation, forcing the organization to spend less time on its other areas of work, such as services \n  -12-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 15 of 45\n \n1 for survivors of domestic violence.  KRC has already had to expend considerable resources on \n2 community education on public charge, including training Korean ethnic media to correct \n3 misinformation about the public charge rule.  KRC expects to conduct additional trainings to the \n4 media and members on public charge because of the Regulation’s upcoming implementation. \n5 II.  Defendants \n6 44.  Defendant Donald J.

Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is a federal \n9 agency headquartered in Washington, D.C. \n10 46.  Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is a \n11 component agency of DHS, which is responsible for the adjudication of applications for \n12 adjustment of status and for extensions or modifications of stay by non-immigrant visa holders.  \n13 USCIS is the component of DHS that promulgated the public charge Regulation.  \n14 47.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is the Acting Director of USCIS.  He is sued in \n15 his official capacity. \n16 48.  Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is Acting Secretary of DHS.  He is sued in his \n17 official capacity. \n18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19 49.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this case \n20 arises under the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. \n21 50.  Venue properly lies in this district because Plaintiffs LA CLÍNICA, CPCA, \n22 LEGAL AID, CAIR-CA, and FJ work and provide services in this district.  28 U.S.C. \n23 § 1391(e)(1).  Venue also properly lies in this district because a substantial part of the events or \n24 omissions giving rise to this action occurred in the district.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n25 BACKGROUND \n26 I.  Current Statutory Framework \n27 51.  The INA is the primary statute governing immigration to the United States.  Under \n28 the INA, if a current resident of the United States seeks LPR status through a family-based or \n  -13-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 16 of 45\n \n1 employment-based petition, the first step is to file the petition and, if it is approved, wait until a \n2 visa becomes available.  If the resident has been admitted or paroled into the United States and \n3 meets certain other conditions, the individual may file an application for adjustment of status with \n4 USCIS, in most cases only once a visa becomes available.  In determining whether a noncitizen is \n5 eligible for adjustment of status, or whether an LPR who has been outside the United States for \n6 more than 180 days can reenter the country, DHS officers assess whether the applicant is \n7 inadmissible under section 212 of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1182).   \n8 52.  Individuals seeking admission as nonimmigrants, such as temporary agricultural or \n9 health care workers, foreign students, and cultural exchange visitors, are also assessed for \n10 inadmissibility before receiving a visa.  Most nonimmigrant visa holders may apply to extend or \n11 change their visa provided certain conditions are satisfied, such as compliance with the terms of \n12 their current visa.     \n13 53.  Section 212(a)(4) of the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the \n14 consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at \n15 the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a \n16 public charge is inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  This is commonly known as the \n17 “public charge” ground of inadmissibility. \n18 54.  The statute further directs that an adjudicator making a determination on the public \n19 charge ground “shall at a minimum consider the alien’s (I) age; (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) \n20 assets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \n21 Together these five factors are referred to as the “totality of circumstances” test. \n22 55.  The adjudicator “may also consider any affidavit of support.”  8 U.S.C. \n23 § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).  The U.S. citizen or LPR sponsor who signs the affidavit of support pledges to \n24 accept financial responsibility for the immigrant who is seeking admission or adjustment of status \n25 and specifically pledges to maintain the sponsored immigrant “at an annual income that is not less \n26 than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the period in which the affidavit is \n27 enforceable.”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A).  The affidavit is a legally enforceable contract between \n28 the sponsor and the U.S. government. \n  -14-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 17 of 45\n \n1 II.  The Public Charge Statute and its Long-Standing Meaning. \n2 56.  For over a century, the term “public charge” has referred to persons who cannot \n3 care for themselves and are thus primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution.   \n4 57.  The term first appeared in an 1882 act barring the admission of “any convict, \n5 lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public \n6 charge.”  An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214 (1882).   \n7 58.  The Immigration Act of 1907 included those “likely to become a public charge” \n8 among the categories of individuals barred entry, which also included “idiots,” “imbeciles,” \n9 “insane persons,” “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “persons . . . with a loathsome or \n10 dangerous contagious disease.”  An Act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United \n11 States, Pub. L. No. 96, § 2, 34 Stat. 898, 898–99 (1907). \n12 59.  As the Second Circuit recognized, “The excluded classes with which this provision \n13 is associated are significant.  It appears between ‘paupers’ and ‘professional beggars.’”  Howe v. \n14 United States, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917).  The court concluded, “We are convinced that \n15 Congress meant the act to exclude persons who were likely to become occupants of almshouses \n16 for want of means with which to support themselves in the future.”  Id.; see also Gegiow v. \n17 Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915) (reasoning that “public charge” had “to be read as generically similar \n18 to the others mentioned before and after” and rejecting an attempt to exclude individuals on public \n19 charge grounds). \n20 60.   In 1952 Congress enacted § 212 of the INA, which excluded from admissibility \n21 individuals “who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n22 the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time \n23 to become public charges.”  Pub. L. 414, ch. 2, § 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952). \n24 61.  The Department of Justice has recognized courts’ longstanding interpretation of the \n25 term “public charge” to mean a person who is “destitute.” For instance, the Department has \n26 explained that “[t]he words ‘public charge’ had their ordinary meaning: that is to say, a money \n27 charge upon or an expense to the public for support and care, the alien being destitute.”   Matter of \n28\n  -15-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 18 of 45\n \n1 Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 586 (BIA 1974).  Congress has not altered this meaning of \n2 “public charge,” though it has revisited the topic on many occasions. \n3 62.  In the INA of 1965, for instance, Congress deliberately overturned decades-old \n4 laws that restricted immigration from certain global regions and opened the U.S. to immigrants \n5 from all over the world.  But Congress made no change to the public charge test. \n6 63.  In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (“IRCA”).  \n7 Congress again did not modify the “public charge” test.  But Congress did provide additional \n8 grounds for waivers allowing individuals deemed a public charge to overcome that determination.   \n9 64.  Consistent with prior agency interpretations, the Immigration and Naturalization \n10 Service (“INS”)—the previous federal agency tasked with administering immigration \n11 applications—explained in 1987 that applicants would not be subject to exclusion on public-\n12 charge grounds if “the applicant demonstrates a history of employment in the United States \n13 evidencing self-support without the receipt of public cash assistance.”  Adjustment of Status for \n14 Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205, 16,211 (May 1, 1987) (emphasis added).  The agency defined \n15 “public cash assistance” as “income or needs-based monetary assistance . . . designed to meet \n16 subsistence levels.”  Id. at 16,209 (emphasis added).  The agency specifically excluded “assistance \n17 in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits” from those benefits that \n18 would render an individual a public charge.  Id. \n19 65.  Congress again declined to alter the “public charge” test in the Immigration Act of \n20 1990, despite making a number of other changes to immigration-related statutes.   \n21 66.  In 1991, the State Department—an agency that also has primary responsibility for \n22 implementing the INA’s public charge provisions—recognized in its Foreign Affairs Manual that \n23 the essential issue in determining if an individual is a public charge within the meaning of INA \n24 212(a)(4) is “whether the purpose of the public program in which the individual is participating is \n25 specifically designed to support individuals unable to provide for themselves.”  It recognized that \n26 the purpose of the food stamp program is “to strengthen the agricultural economy and help achieve \n27 a fuller use of food abundances through improving levels of nutrition among low-income \n28 households.  It has thus a number of objectives of a general nature and is not simply a matter of \n  -16-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 19 of 45\n \n1 welfare or relief as such . . . [A] program that is essentially supplementary in nature, in the sense \n2 of providing training, services, food, etc. to augment the standard of living, rather than to \n3 undertake directly the support of the recipients does not fall within the scope of INA 212(a)(4).” \n4 (emphasis added). \n5 67.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n6 Reconciliation Act of 1996 (“PRWORA”), which imposed restrictions on immigrant eligibility for \n7 certain public benefits.  But Congress did not alter the “public charge” test.  \n8 68.  Congress again declined to change the meaning of “public charge” one month later \n9 when it enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n10 (“IIRIRA”).  Congress considered but rejected, an expanded definition of “public charge” that \n11 would have included food, health care, and housing assistance.   \n12 69.  Instead, IIRIRA codified the totality–of-the-circumstances test, which had been \n13 developed in case law and administrative policies.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  \n14 70.  IIRIRA also introduced the affidavit of support that could be used to help an \n15 immigrant overcome the public-charge barrier, so long as the sponsor pledged to maintain the \n16 sponsored immigrant’s at or above 125% of the FPL. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); \n17 1183a(a)(1)(A).  \n18 71.  Following IIRIRA, the INS issued guidance explaining that the statute “has not \n19 altered the standards used to determine the likelihood of an alien to become a public charge nor \n20 has it significantly changed the criteria to be considered in determining such a likelihood.”  \n21 Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Dep’t of Justice, Public Charge:  INA Sections 212(A)(4) \n22 and 237(A)(5)—Duration of Departure for LPRs and Repayment of Public Benefits (Dec. 16, \n23 1997).     \n24 72.  Similarly, in 1998, the State Department stated that IIRIRA did “not change[] the \n25 long-standing legal presumption that an able-bodied, employable individual will be able to work \n26 upon arrival in the United States” and thus not become a public charge.  Dep’t of State, I-864 \n27 Affidavit of Support:  Update No. 14—Commitment to Provide Assistance, Unclas State 102426 \n28 (Cable dated June 8, 1998).  The INS further stated “[t]he presumption that the applicant will find \n  -17-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 20 of 45\n \n1 work coupled with the fact that the [affidavit of support] is a legally enforceable contract will \n2 provide in most cases a sufficient basis to accept a sponsor’s . . . technically sufficient [affidavit] \n3 as overcoming the public charge ground.”  Id.   \n4 73.  Although the INS and State Department recognized that IIRIRA made no changes \n5 to the longstanding meaning or interpretation of the term “public charge,” the INS was concerned \n6 that, because Congress passed both IIRIRA and PRWORA close in time, “confusion about the \n7 relationship between the receipt of public benefits and the concept of ‘public charge’ ha[d] \n8 deterred eligible [non-citizens] and their families, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking \n9 important health and nutrition benefits that they are legally entitled to receive.”  Field Guidance on \n10 Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689, 28,692 (May \n11 26, 1999) (“1999 Field Guidance”).  \n12 74.  The INS recognized that “[t]his reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact \n13 not just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare.”  Id., 64 Fed. Reg. \n14 at 28,692.  The uncertainty following IIRIRA and PRWORA was “undermining the Government \n15 policies of increasing access to health care and helping people to become self-sufficient.”  \n16 Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, 28,677 \n17 (proposed May 26, 1999) (“Public Charge Grounds”). \n18 75.   To alleviate that confusion and its deleterious effects, the INS published two \n19 documents in the 1999 Federal Register to confirm that the longstanding historic understanding of \n20 the term “public charge” remained operative.   \n21 76.  The first was a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) in which the INS \n22 confirmed that the term “public charge” meant an individual “who is likely to become . . . \n23 primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of \n24 public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at \n25 Government expense.”  Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,677.  The agency never issued \n26 a final rule. \n27 77.  The second was the INS Field Guide that aimed to “help alleviate public confusion \n28 over the meaning of the term ‘public charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt \n  -18-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 21 of 45\n \n1 of Federal, State, and local public benefits” and to “provide aliens with better guidance as to the \n2 types of public benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge determinations.”  \n3 1999 Field Guidance, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689.   \n4 78.  These documents dictated that agencies consider only receipt of cash assistance for \n5 income maintenance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security \n6 Income, and state equivalents) and publicly funded long-term institutionalization in making the \n7 public-charge determination. \n8 79.  In explaining its interpretation of “public charge,” the INS recognized that “federal, \n9 state, and local benefits are increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above \n10 the poverty level, reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health \n11 and nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of \n12 becoming self-sufficient.”  Id., 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692.  This meant that “participation in such non-\n13 cash programs is not evidence of poverty or dependence.”  Id. \n14 80.  The INS further observed that non-cash benefits “are by their nature supplemental \n15 and do not, alone or in combination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or \n16 family.”  Id.  By focusing only on cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term \n17 institutionalization, the INS could thus “identify those who are primarily dependent on the \n18 government for subsistence without inhibiting access to non-cash benefits that serve important \n19 public interests.”  Id. \n20 81.  The INS also explained that the focus on cash benefits for making the public-\n21 charge determination was consistent with the advice provided by federal benefits agencies, \n22 including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and the \n23 Social Security Administration.  Each department had concurred that “receipt of cash assistance \n24 for income maintenance is the best evidence of primary dependence on the Government” because \n25 “non-cash benefits generally provide supplementary support . . . to low-income working families \n26 to sustain and improve their ability to remain self-sufficient.”  Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. \n27 Reg. at 28,677–78. \n28\n  -19-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 22 of 45\n \n1 82.  The INS reasoned further, based on input from the Department of Health and \n2 Human Services, that while as a general matter, it could not “conceive of a situation where an \n3 individual … could support himself or his family solely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily \n4 dependent on the [G]overnment,” it made one exception for long-term institutionalization at \n5 government expense, which should be considered in the public charge determination.  Id., 64 Fed. \n6 Reg. at 28,678. \n7 83.  In addition, under the 1999 Field Guidance, forms of cash not intended for income \n8 maintenance and cash benefits that have been earned, such as government pension benefits or \n9 veteran’s benefits, were not considered cash benefits for purposes of the public-charge \n10 determination and should not be taken into account.  Further, “[p]ast receipt of non-cash benefits \n11 [such as Medicaid, CHIP, nutrition programs, housing benefits, child care services, energy \n12 assistance, emergency disaster relief, foster care and adoption assistance, educational assistance, \n13 job training programs, and in-kind, community-based programs, as well as similar state and local \n14 programs] should be excluded from consideration for public charge purposes.”  64 Fed. Reg. at \n15 28,693. \n16 84.  The INS noted that the “primary dependence model of public assistance was the \n17 backdrop against which the ‘public charge’ concept in immigration law developed in the 1800s.”  \n18 Since then, legislators, judges, and executive officials have consistently understood the term to \n19 refer to those who are primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution.  This is of \n20 particular importance given the many times that Congress has sought to re-employ the term over \n21 the years including in 1891, 1903, 1907, 1917, 1952, 1990, and 1996.  At no time has Congress \n22 widened the concept of “public charge” to include nutrition, health care (other than \n23 institutionalization), housing, or other non-cash programs, even as public assistance programs \n24 expanded and changed over the years.       \n25 85.  Although the 1999 NPRM never became a final rule, these regulations and the \n26 Field Guidance governed Defendants’ public charge policy until the new Regulation, at issue in \n27 this litigation, was finalized.   \n28\n  -20-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 23 of 45\n \n1 86.  Indeed, the Congressional Research Service explained that, until the new \n2 Regulation, Defendants’ position had been consistent and clear: “USCIS, in making public charge \n3 determination for aliens applying for adjustment to LPR status, only considers cash income-\n4 maintenance benefits and government-funded institutionalization for long-term care.  Cash \n5 assistance for income maintenance . . . ‘includes Supplemental Security Income (SSI), cash \n6 assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and state or local \n7 cash assistance programs for income maintenance, often called “general assistance” programs’ \n8 . . . . [A]n alien’s past or current receipt of these benefits or of government funded long-term care \n9 does not automatically lead to a determination of inadmissibility, but instead only factors into the \n10 prospective analysis under the totality of the circumstances test.”  Congressional Research Service, \n11 Immigration: Frequently Asked Questions about “Public Charge” at 7 (Sept. 19, 2018), \n12 https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45313.pdf.      \n13 87.  In fact, Congress has expanded immigrants’ access to some of the benefits that had \n14 been explicitly excluded from the public charge determination. In the 2002 Farm Bill, for \n15 example, Congress restored eligibility for food stamps (now known as “SNAP”) to immigrant \n16 children, immigrants receiving disability benefits, and adults who had lived in the United States in \n17 a “qualified” immigrant status for five years.  Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002: \n18 Pub L. No. 107-171 (May 13, 2002).   \n19 88.  Although Congress and administrative agencies have interpreted “public charge” \n20 consistently over time, altering the definition of “public charge” has been a clear priority from the \n21 early days of the Trump administration.  During the President’s first month in office, members of \n22 the administration drafted an executive order to reinterpret the term.  That executive order was \n23 leaked to the public.  The administration never issued the executive order.    \n24 89.  Instead, in 2017, the Trump Administration endorsed the Reforming American \n25 Immigration for Strong Employment (“RAISE”) Act.  That bill that would have eliminated some \n26 of the family-based admission preferences created by the 1965 Act and established a point-based \n27 system for evaluating potential immigrants.  The system would have awarded points based on \n28 factors including age, formal education, English language proficiency, and highly-compensated \n  -21-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 24 of 45\n \n1 employment.  The RAISE Act would have disadvantaged many groups of potential immigrants, \n2 including applicants who had family ties to U.S. citizens but who had limited formal education or \n3 employment history and middle-aged and older adults.   \n4 90.  In 2017, Congress once again rejected changes to the existing immigration system \n5 and declined to pass the RAISE Act.   \n6 91.  Subsequently, on October 10, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security \n7 published its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Regulation.   \n8 III.  Defendants’ New Public Charge Regulation \n9 92.  On August 13, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security published the \n10 Regulation. \n11 93.  The Regulation drastically redefines the term “public charge.”  Under the \n12 Regulation, “public charge” means a noncitizen “who receives one or more public benefits, as \n13 defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\n14 month period.”  Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292, 41,501 (Aug. 14, \n15 2019) (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.21(a)).  Paragraph (b) defines “public benefit” to mean any \n16 receipt of federal, state, local, or tribal cash assistance for income maintenance and includes \n17 receipt of health assistance through  Medicaid (with some exceptions); SNAP benefits; and \n18 housing assistance through Section 8 housing choice vouchers, project-based Section 8 rental \n19 assistance, or public housing.  Several of these non-cash benefits were not included in prior \n20 agency definitions of “public charge,” and were, in fact, specifically excluded under agency \n21 guidance.  The Regulation counts all benefits equally, regardless of the value of the benefit \n22 received.   \n23 94.  The Regulation next defines the term “likely at any time to become a public \n24 charge.”  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.21(c)); see 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  Under the \n25 Regulation, “[l]ikely at any time to become a public charge means more likely than not at any time \n26 in the future to become a public charge, as defined [above], based on the totality of the alien’s \n27 circumstances.”   \n28\n  -22-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 25 of 45\n \n1 95.  Under the Regulation, the totality of the circumstances determination is prospective \n2 and looks to “all factors that are relevant to whether the alien is more likely than not at any time in \n3 the future [to receive one or more public benefit for 12 months over a 36-month period].”  84 Fed. \n4 Reg. at 41,502 (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(a)). As prescribed by Section 1182(a)(4)(B), the \n5 determination must consider, at minimum, the individual’s “age; health, family status, education \n6 and skills, and assets, resources, and financial status.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,502 (to be codified as 8 \n7 CFR § 212.22(b)).   \n8 96.  As to age, the agency must consider whether the noncitizen is between 18 and the \n9 minimum retirement age for Social Security.  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(1)).   \n10 97.  With regard to health, the agency must consider whether the individual’s health, \n11 including any diagnosed medical conditions, makes the individual more or less likely to be a \n12 public charge.  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(2)).   \n13 98.  The Regulation next requires that the agency consider whether the individual’s \n14 household size makes the individual more or less likely to become a public charge.  Id. (to be \n15 codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(b)(3)).   \n16 99.  As to assets, resources, and financial status, the Regulation requires the agency to \n17 consider, inter alia, whether the individual’s household’s annual gross income is at least 125% of \n18 the FPL (100% for active duty military personnel).  If it is under that amount, the agency must \n19 consider whether the individual has “significant assets.”  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § \n20 212.22(b)(4)(i)).  The Regulation also requires the agency to examine whether the individual has \n21 sufficient assets and resources to cover “any reasonably foreseeable medical costs;” has any \n22 financial liabilities; and has applied for, been certified to receive, or received public benefits. Id.  \n23 100.  As evidence, the agency must look to the noncitizen’s sources of income, other \n24 assets and resources, credit score, whether the noncitizen has private health insurance, and whether \n25 the noncitizen has applied for, been certified or approved for, disenrolled or requested to be \n26 disenrolled from, or received public benefits.  Id. at 41,503 (to be codified as 8 CFR § \n27 212.22(b)(4)(ii)).   \n28\n  -23-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 26 of 45\n \n1 101.  Finally, as to education and skills, the agency is to look to whether the noncitizen \n2 “has adequate education and skills to either obtain or maintain lawful employment with an income \n3 sufficient to avoid being more likely than not to become a public charge,” including evidence of \n4 past work history, education level, and English language proficiency.  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR \n5 § 212.22(b)(5)).   \n6 102.  The Regulation selects a subset of factors to be “heavily weighted” in the \n7 determination.  Id. at 41,504 (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(1)).  The Regulation adopts the \n8 following “heavily weighted negative factors,” under 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(1): \n9 (A)  The noncitizen is not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is \n10 unable to demonstrate current employment, recent employment history, or a \n11 reasonable prospect of future employment; \n12 (B)  The noncitizen has received, or been certified or approved to receive, public \n13 benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period; \n14 (C)  The noncitizen has been diagnosed with a medical condition that will \n15 interfere with the alien’s ability to support him or herself; \n16 (D)  The noncitizen is uninsured and has neither the prospect of receiving private \n17 insurance nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable \n18 expenses due to a medical condition; and \n19 (E)  The noncitizen has previously been found inadmissible or deportable on \n20 public charge grounds.  \n21 103.  The Regulation includes as “heavily weighted positive factors”:  \n22 (A)  The noncitizen’s “household has financial assets, resources, and support,” \n23 excluding illegal activities or public-benefit income, of at least 250% of \n24 FPL.  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § 212.22(c)(2)(i)). That income threshold \n25 equates to over $64,000 a year for a family of four, more than the median \n26 household income for households of any size in the United States. \n27 (B)  The noncitizen is authorized to work and has a legal annual income of at \n28 least 250 percent of the FPL for her household size; and \n  -24-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 27 of 45\n \n1 (C)  The noncitizen has private health insurance, excluding health insurance \n2 subsidized by premium tax credits established by the Patient Protection and \n3 Affordable Care Act.    \n4 104.  The Regulation adds new, nonstatuory factors for USCIS to consider in evaluating \n5 the affidavit of support.  USCIS must now also evaluate the sponsor’s annual income, the \n6 sponsor’s relationship to the applicant, the likelihood that the sponsor will actually provide the \n7 required financial support, “and any other related considerations.”  Id. (to be codified as 8 CFR § \n8 212.22(b)(7)).    \n9 105.  The Regulation also requires applicants to compile extensive documentation of \n10 their finances and to fill out a newly developed 15-page form that the agency estimates will \n11 require 4.5 hours to complete. \n12 106.  The Regulation also applies a public charge test to an entirely new group of people: \n13 nonimmigrant visa holders seeking to extend or change their visas.  USCIS must evaluate whether \n14 the person has received the designated benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a \n15 36-month period since obtaining their status.  \n16 107.  During the notice and comment period, hundreds of thousands of comments were \n17 submitted, “the vast majority” opposing the proposed rule, as acknowledged by the agency. 84 \n18 Fed. Reg. 41304.  Commenters explained that the factors were not rationally related to predicting \n19 the likelihood of a noncitizen becoming a public charge, were arbitrary and vague, and would \n20 cause substantial negative effects.    \n21 108.  For example, commenters criticized the proposed Regulation’s threshold of 15% of \n22 the Federal Poverty Guidelines as the value of monetizable benefits a noncitizen could receive \n23 over a 12-month period without being a public charge.  According to several sets of commenters, \n24 the threshold was far too low to show dependency on benefits and did not account for the taxes \n25 that immigrants pay and the fact that they pay more into the healthcare system than they take out.  \n26 Rather than engage with these criticisms, the Regulation instead moved the threshold from 15% to \n27 0%, such that receipt of benefits of any value over the applicable time period qualifies a noncitizen \n28 as a public charge.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41,357–358. \n  -25-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 28 of 45\n \n1 109.  In addition, Defendants failed to adequately respond to comments related to the \n2 potential retroactive application of the Regulation.  Although Defendants repeatedly assert that the \n3 Regulation will have no retroactive effect and implicates no reliance interests, Defendants failed to \n4 adequately respond to concerns that the new Form I-944 asks applicants to list all benefits that the \n5 applicant ever used and to list the dates of the use of those benefits even if they were used before \n6 the effective date of the Regulation.  If DHS does not intend to take past use of benefits into \n7 account, there is no reason to ask for this information, yet DHS also claims that Form I-944 \n8 requests information “about all the relevant factors” for the public charge determination.  \n9 Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,483.  Questions on the Form I-944 \n10 about past use of public benefits, which DHS simultaneously claims are relevant and not relevant \n11 to the public charge determination, creates internal inconsistency and ambiguity about the \n12 retroactive effect of the Regulation.   \n13 A.  Impact of the New Regulation on Immigrants and Non-White Communities \n14 110.  Defendants’ Regulation will label as a “public charge” a very large percentage of \n15 immigrants, including low-and moderate-income working families.  In fiscal year 2017, 83% of all \n16 immigrants who received green cards were subject to the public-charge test.1  The remainder were \n17 exempt under the statute.     \n18 111.  While only roughly 2–4% of the noncitizen population would have qualified as a \n19 public charge under the prior definition, the Regulation will result in the exclusion of vast \n20 numbers of individuals who, like millions upon millions of working Americans, will receive one \n21 or more of the supplemental benefits listed in the Regulation over the course of a lifetime.  Under \n22 a similar definition of public charge, which applies to individuals seeking to enter the United \n23 States from abroad, exclusions on the basis of public charge increased from 1,076 in 2016 to \n24 13,450 in 2018, a 1,250% increase.  The increases have disproportionately impacted immigrants \n25 from predominantly non-white countries.  For instance, denials on public charge grounds of \n26\n                                                 \n27 1 See Randy Capps, et al., Gauging the Impact of DHS’s Proposed Public –Charge Rule on U.S. \nImmigration (Nov. 2018), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/impact-dhs-public-charge-\n28 rule-immigration. \n  -26-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 29 of 45\n \n1 immigrants from Mexico increased from 7 to 5,343 in just a few years.  Similarly, the State \n2 Department denied 1,254 immigrant visas for Indian nationals in 2018, after denying none at all in \n3 2016.  And the State Department denied 1,109 immigrant visas to Haitian nationals in 2018, after \n4 denying none in 2016.  Meanwhile, only three Canadian nationals had immigrant visas denied in \n5 2018.2     \n6 112.  In fact, the Regulation’s definition is so expansive that, if applied to U.S. citizens, \n7 roughly half of the population would be characterized as “public charges,” simply because they \n8 will receive one of the newly listed supplemental benefits at some point in their lifetimes.   \n9 113.  The Regulation will also affect an estimated 2.3 million nonimmigrants with \n10 temporary visas, including students and agricultural workers, who attempt to extend their visas or \n11 change their non-immigrant status over a five-year period.  The Regulation introduces an \n12 unprecedented public charge inquiry and potential barrier for these groups.  See DHS, RIN: 1615-\n13 AA22, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds 28–32 (Aug. 2019).   \n14 114.  The increase in denials for green cards will not be based solely on current or recent \n15 benefit use but will also be based on immigration officers’ determinations that individuals are \n16 likely to use benefits in the future considering the factors listed in the Regulation’s totality-of-the-\n17 circumstances test. \n18 115.  Overall, the Regulation’s modification of the totality-of-the-circumstances test will \n19 disproportionately exclude women, children, and older adults and will serve to facilitate or \n20 prolong the separation of immigrant families, striking at the heart of the pro-family immigration \n21 policy conceived in 1965.  Under the Regulation, many citizens, both U.S. and foreign born, will \n22 encounter new barriers to uniting with their families.     \n23 116.  The majority of green card applications, especially in communities of color, are \n24 family-based petitions that allow U.S. citizens and LPRs to reunite with their immediate family \n25\n26\n                                                 \n27 2 See Ted Hesson, Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department \n(Aug. 6, 2019), https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-trump-\n28 1637094. \n  -27-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 30 of 45\n \n1 members in the United States.  The Regulation’s negatively weighted factors disproportionately \n2 and detrimentally affect communities of color.    \n3 117.  According to a recent study of recently admitted lawful permanent residents that \n4 was submitted in comments, 60% of those from Mexico and Central America had at least two \n5 negative factors, compared with only 27% of those from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.  Forty-\n6 eight percent of recent LPRs from the Caribbean, 41% from Asia, 40% from South America, and \n7 34% from Africa had at least two negative factors and thus would be excluded at a \n8 disproportionately higher rate than those from Europe, Canada, and Oceania. \n9 118.  Defendants do not dispute the disparate impact.  In fact, acting director of USCIS \n10 Kenneth Cuccinelli has tacitly admitted its presence, stating during a press briefing on the \n11 Regulation that “if we had been having this conversation 100 years ago, [the Regulation] would \n12 have applied more to Italians” than to other groups.3 And a day later in an interview about the \n13 Regulation, Mr. Cuccinelli argued that “The New Colossus,” the 136-year-old sonnet inscribed at \n14 the base of the Statute of Liberty that welcomes “poor” immigrants, referred to “people coming \n15 from Europe.”4  \n16 B.  The Discriminatory Impact is the Intended Purpose of the New Regulation. \n17 119.  The Trump Administration has made numerous efforts to suppress immigration \n18 from non-white countries, including advocating to end family-based immigration.  Curtailing \n19 immigration by people of color has been a thread uniting each of the Trump Administration’s \n20 numerous attempts to change existing immigration law and regulations.   \n21 120.  The Administration has promulgated numerous immigration-related executive \n22 actions since January 2017, most either exclusively or disproportionately harming immigrants \n23 from non-white-majority nations, including: \n24\n25\n26                                                  \n3 Chris Rodrigo, White House: New immigration policy meant to promote ‘self-sufficiency and \n27 personal responsibility’ (Aug. 12 2019), https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457093-\nwhite-house-defends-new-immigration-policy. \n28 4  Jacey Fortin, ‘Huddled Masses’ in Statue of Liberty Poem Are European, Trump Official Says \n(Aug. 14, 2019), https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/cuccinelli-statue-liberty-poem.html. \n  -28-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 31 of 45\n \n1 (A)  Separating thousands of young children from their parents as a proclaimed \n2 deterrent to immigration at the southern border; \n3 (B)  Refusing refuge to immigrants seeking asylum, and criminally prosecuting \n4 asylum seekers for crossing the border between checkpoints; \n5 (C)  Initially suspending the refugee admission program and then slashing the \n6 number of refugees who may be admitted from 110,000 to 30,000 in 2019, \n7 and proposing cutting the number to 0 in 2020; \n8 (D)  Ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; \n9 (E)  Terminating Temporary Protected Status for nationals of El Salvador, \n10 Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Sudan, and Nicaragua; \n11 (F)  Winding down Deferred Enforced Departure for Liberian nationals; and \n12 (G)  Excluding nationals from several majority-Muslim countries. \n13 121.  These attempted changes have occurred alongside a string of racist statements by \n14 the President predating his seeking office and continuing through to the final days before the \n15 Regulation’s promulgation, including:  \n16 (A)  Rising to political prominence based upon the racist false claim that \n17 President Obama was not born in the United States and/or had allegiance to \n18 Kenya;5  \n19 (B)  Running a campaign replete with racist aspersions about people of Mexican \n20 descent and of the Muslim faith;6  and \n21 (C)  Wrongly slurring countries of the African diaspora by declaring while in \n22 office that Haitians “all have AIDS”; that once Nigerians had seen the \n23\n                                                 \n24 5 Alexander Burns, Trump: Obama born in Kenya (May 25, 2012), \nhttps://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/05/trump-obama-born-in-kenya-124569. \n25\n6 Matt Ford, Trump Attacks a ‘Mexican’ U.S. Federal Judge (May 28, 2016), \n26 https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/trump-judge-gonzalo-curiel/484790/; \nMaggie Haberman and Richard Oppel Jr., Donald Trump Criticizes Muslim Family of Slain U.S. \n27 Soldier, Drawing Ire (June 30, 2016), https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/politics/donald-\ntrump-khizr-khan-wife-ghazala.html. \n28\n  -29-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 32 of 45\n \n1 United States, they would never go “back to their huts;” and that America \n2 should not be a haven for “people from shithole countries.”7  \n3 122.  Courts considering challenges to the Administration’s immigration policies have \n4 routinely considered the President’s statements as evidence of discriminatory animus toward \n5 immigrants of color.8  \n6 123.  More recently, while the Regulation was in final review at the Office of \n7 Management and Budget, President Trump made statements linking his view of immigration and \n8 racial exclusion.  \n9 124.  Specifically, on July 14, 2019, the President claimed that four women of color \n10 serving in the United States Congress “originally came from countries whose governments are a \n11\n12                                                  \n7 Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Stoking Fears, Trump Defied Bureaucracy to Advance \n13 Immigration Agenda (Dec. 23, 2017), https://www.nytimes.com/ \n2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html?smid=tw-\n14 share&mtrref=thehill.com&gwh=786472CC33DA9619FF8E4ABABEBAAA04&gwt=pay; \nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-referred-haiti-african-countries-shithole-\n15 nations-n836946. \n16 8 See, e.g., CASA de Md. v.

The President and the White House have been actively involved in pressing for the \n5 Regulation.

And it should be the last thought you have before you go to bed. \n8 And sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed.”9   In mid-2019, President Trump removed the leadership \n9 of several immigration-related agencies based, in part, on a desire to speed up the Regulation’s \n10 release. \n11 126.  L. Francis Cissna was directed to step down as director of USCIS, in part because \n12 Stephen Miller had been “agitating for Mr. Cissna’s removal for months” due to Mr. Miller’s \n13 stance that Mr. Cissna was “moving too slowly in implementing” the Regulation.10   Prior to Mr. \n14 Cissna’s removal from office, Mr. Miller told Mr. Cissna in a June 8, 2018 email exchange that \n15 “the timing on public charge is unacceptable … I don’t care what you need to do to finish it on \n16 time.”11 \n17 127.  After Mr. Cissna resigned at the President’s request effective June 1, 2019, \n18 President Trump nominated Kenneth Cuccinelli to be the new Secretary of Homeland Security.  \n19 Mr. Cuccinelli has a long history of advocating for anti-immigrant policies. While he was a \n20 Virginia State Senator, he proposed bills to end birthright citizenship and to allow firing of \n21\n22\n23                                                  \n9 Eileen Sullivan & Michael D.

Defendants’ Unlawful Appointment of Acting Head of USCIS \n4 128.  Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), vacancies in an office \n5 requiring Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation can only be filled on an acting basis by \n6 certain individuals. Specifically, such a vacancy can be filled by “the first assistant to the office of \n7 such officer,” by a person who has already been confirmed by the Senate for a different office, or \n8 by a person who, during the year prior to the vacancy, served as an officer or employee in the \n9 same agency for at least 90 days.  5 U.S.C. § 3345(a).   \n10 129.  On the date of Mr. Cissna’s resignation, Mr. Cuccinelli did not meet any of these \n11 criteria.  The position of first assistant was then, and is now, held by Mark Koumans.  On or about \n12 June 10, 2019, after Mr. Cissna resigned effective June 1, 2019, USCIS created the entirely new \n13 office of Principal Deputy Director, vaulting that office above the Deputy Director and \n14 purportedly creating a new First Assistant.  DHS Acting Secretary McAleenan named Mr. \n15 Cuccinelli Principal Deputy Director and Acting Director of USCIS. \n16 130.  While in the position of Acting Director of USCIS, Mr. Cuccinelli issued the \n17 Regulation challenged in this litigation.  He described the Regulation as the President “delivering \n18 on his promise to the American people.”12 \n19 D.  Additional Harms Resulting from the Regulation \n20 131.  While the Regulation targets immigrants of color, it will have significantly broader \n21 consequences for the country’s public health and the economy as a whole. \n22 132.  Defendants admit that the proposed Regulation will create the following harms \n23 because individuals will be deterred from using important supplemental benefits: \n24\n25\n26\n27                                                  \n12 Ken Cuccinelli (@USCISCuccinelli), Twitter (Jul. 15, 2019, 9:21 AM) \n28 https://twitter.com/usciscuccinelli/status/1150802490843176960?lang=en. \n  -32-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 35 of 45\n \n1 (A)  Worse health outcomes, including increased prevalence of obesity and \n2 malnutrition, especially for pregnant or breastfeeding women, infants, or \n3 children, and reduced prescription adherence;  \n4 (B)  Increased use of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of \n5 primary health care due to delayed treatment;  \n6 (C)  Increased prevalence of communicable diseases, including among members \n7 of the U.S. citizen population who are not vaccinated;  \n8 (D)  Increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid \n9 for by an insurer or patient;  \n10 (E)  Increased rates of poverty and housing instability; and  \n11 (F)  Reduced productivity and educational attainment.  Inadmissibility of Public \n12 Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,270 (Oct. 10, 2018) (NPRM); \n13 Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,364–66 \n14 (responding to comments regarding detriments of disenrollment by noting, \n15 inter alia, “rigorous application of the public charge ground of \n16 inadmissibility will inevitably have negative consequences for some \n17 individuals.”).  \n18 133.  The proposed Regulation recognized that “reductions in federal and state transfers \n19 under federal benefit programs may have downstream and upstream impacts on state and local \n20 economies, large and small businesses, and individuals.”  Inadmissibility of Public Charge \n21 Grounds (NPRM), 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,118.  The final Regulation acknowledged that reduced \n22 program participation could result in higher poverty levels, reduced access to health care, and an \n23 increase in severe and chronic health issues.  See generally Inadmissibility of Public Charge \n24 Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,310–12 (detailing comments on effects of Regulation).  In other \n25 words, families will increasingly be poorer and less healthy.  \n26 134.  Rather than contest commenters’ assertions, Defendants simply stated that it would \n27 be “difficult to predict how this rule will affect aliens subject to the public charge ground of \n28 admissibility.”  Id., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,313.  DHS did not directly refute the numerous comments \n  -33-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 36 of 45\n \n1 estimating such impacts, did not address the chilling effect which necessarily does not require \n2 estimating eligibility numbers, and conceded that it is not sure of the breadth of impact of the \n3 Regulation. \n4 135.  The Regulation will create confusion and fear in immigrant communities and will \n5 have a dramatic effect, potentially causing an estimated tens of millions of people to avoid seeking \n6 services or to disenroll from core public-health and general-welfare programs.  This includes both \n7 individuals subject to the public charge inquiry and individuals who are not subject to the \n8 Regulation but who will nonetheless be dissuaded from applying for benefits for themselves and \n9 their families.  These harms defeat Defendants’ stated purpose of the Regulation because they \n10 make it harder to achieve self-sufficiency for immigrants and their families, including their U.S. \n11 citizen children.  As immigration policy experts note, “public assistance can make someone less \n12 likely to rely on government in the future” because “temporary use of public benefits can stabilize \n13 immigrants and families, putting them on a track to long-term financial stability and health.”13  \n14 While Defendants assert that altering the longstanding definition of “public charge” will save \n15 costs, the long-term effect will be the exact opposite. \n16 136.  Deterring people from enrolling or remaining in vital programs that support their \n17 health, food security, and ability to maintain housing will cause severe harm to the health and \n18 welfare of communities across the country.   \n19 137.  Reducing access to preventive care and vital health services will lead to a range of \n20 negative health outcomes, including increased costs and rates of preventable disease, late \n21 diagnoses, unmanaged chronic conditions, premature births, and early deaths.  These effects will \n22 reach far beyond the individuals who are subject to public charge determinations and will harm \n23 significant numbers of U.S. residents regardless of their national origin or immigration status.  \n24\n25\n26\n                                                 \n27 13 Matthew La Corte, The New ‘Public Charge’ Rule Will Harm the Rule of Law, Economic \nGrowth, and Public Health (Aug. 28, 2018), https://niskanencenter.org/blog/the-new-public-\n28 charge-rule-will-harm-the-rule-of-law-economic-growth-and-public-health/. \n  -34-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 37 of 45\n \n1 138.  Deterring families from remaining in affordable housing will increase \n2 homelessness and housing instability, leading to negative health outcomes and higher health care \n3 costs.  Lack of access to affordable housing will also lead to job instability and loss. \n4 139.  Reduction in use of SNAP benefits will increase food insecurity, which will lead to \n5 negative health outcomes and correspondingly higher health-care costs. \n6 140.  U.S. citizen children living in mixed-status families are at particular risk. Evidence \n7 shows that when parents lose access to health coverage, children are more likely to be uninsured.  \n8 The Regulation, therefore, is likely to increase the rates of uninsured children throughout the \n9 country. \n10 141.  Reducing access to housing benefits will also result in severe and irreparable harm \n11 to children, including impairment of cognitive development.  SNAP benefits are particularly \n12 important to mitigate the effects of poverty on children, and reducing access to these benefits will \n13 have a negative impact on school attendance and performance, emotional and physical \n14 development, and long-term health and achievement. \n15 142.  In addition to the direct impact on immigrants, their families, and their \n16 communities, the new Regulation will have severely negative impacts on several sectors of the \n17 economy.  \n18 143.  For example, SNAP benefits have a high multiplier effect as they circulate through \n19 the economy.  Every dollar of SNAP translates to $1.79 in local economic activity.   \n20 144.  Businesses that accept SNAP will be disproportionately harmed and may need to \n21 close or cut back on carrying healthy, perishable foods that can be purchased with SNAP, which \n22 will reduce the healthy food options available in these communities.   \n23 145.   The direct health impacts of the new rule will create additional negative economic \n24 consequences because people who are uninsured miss more work, tend to be less productive when \n25 they are working, and are more likely to retire at younger ages because of health issues and \n26 disability.  Among working-age adults, there is a significant correlation between food insecurity \n27 and chronic disease, including conditions that can limit an individual’s ability to work.   \n28\n  -35-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 38 of 45\n \n1 146.  Moreover, Medicaid supports hospitals, health centers, and other community \n2 providers that are critical sources of care for low-income people and the broader community.  By \n3 reducing Medicaid enrollment, these providers will lose a primary source of funding, significantly \n4 increasing the risk that hospitals and other providers will close or offer fewer services.  When \n5 health centers and other community providers close or reduce services, individuals have to rely on \n6 more costly emergency care to address acute medical conditions.  \n7 147.  The impacts of hospital closures and reductions are far-reaching.  They push \n8 providers to leave in their wake, and will affect access to care for all residents of their service \n9 areas, particularly for rural communities, which generally have difficulty attracting health care \n10 providers.   \n11 148.  Hospital closures and cutbacks also harm local economies, as hospitals are major \n12 employers and purchasers of goods and services. Moreover, communities without hospitals find it \n13 more difficult to attract new industries, companies, and job seekers and thus grow their economies. \n14 149.  The Regulation will also have destabilizing effects on several other critical sectors \n15 of the economy.  For example, the public charge rule will disadvantage farmworkers who are \n16 either adjusting to lawful permanent residence or who seek to apply for or extend their non-\n17 immigrant H-2A visas, as these low-wage workers will find it difficult to satisfy the new public \n18 charge test.  Farmworker families will disproportionately have a number of factors negatively \n19 weighed against them, including their income, lack of credit history and health insurance, \n20 household-size, lack of education and skills, and lack of English proficiency.   \n21 150.  The public charge rule will also destabilize the health care workforce—a sector \n22 with a sizable immigrant population that relies on access to public programs.  For example, \n23 approximately 24% of direct care workers—comprising home health aides, personal care aides, \n24 and nursing assistants—are foreign-born, and approximately 40% of foreign-born direct care \n25 workers receive public benefits.14  The Regulation will force some workers to choose between \n26\n                                                 \n27\n14 Robert Espinoza, Immigrants and the Direct Care Force, Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute \nat 4–5 (June 2017), https://phinational.org/wp-\n28\ncontent/uploads/2017/06/immigrants_and_the_direct_care_workforce_-_phi_-_june_2017.pdf. \n  -36-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 39 of 45\n \n1 securing benefits and potentially undermining their opportunity to extend or change their \n2 nonimmigrant visas or adjust their status.  Others who would not be subject to the Regulation will \n3 nonetheless refrain from seeking benefits to which they are entitled for fear of potential \n4 consequences.  If these individuals forgo access to benefits, and in particular health care benefits, \n5 they will miss more work days and burden the vulnerable population whom they serve—a \n6 population that consists overwhelmingly of older adults and U.S. citizens.  \n7 151.  The administrative and adjudicative burdens imposed by the new Regulation and \n8 the accompanying paperwork will cause significant delays in access to immigration benefits and \n9 work authorization for all applicants.  These delays will prevent affected individuals from being \n10 able to support themselves and their families.   \n11 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n13 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS CONTRARY TO THE STATUTORY SCHEME \n14 ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS \n15 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n16 152.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n17 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n18 153.  The Regulation is a final agency action and subject to judicial review. \n19 154.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “not in accordance with law” or is “in \n20 excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \n21 155.  The Regulation’s definition of “public charge” is contrary to the plain and well-\n22 established meaning of that phrase, and to how it has been interpreted and applied since 1882.  \n23 With knowledge of those interpretations and applications, Congress has repeatedly declined to \n24 change the longstanding definition of “public charge.” \n25 156.  The new public charge definition is an unreasonable interpretation of and contrary \n26 to the meaning of “public charge” in Section 1182.  The Regulation uses the public charge ground \n27 of inadmissibility to penalize the receipt of or likely use of certain public benefits even though \n28 Congress has repeatedly rejected efforts to do precisely that. \n  -37-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 40 of 45\n \n1 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n3 THE CHALLENGED REGULATION IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS OR \n4 OTHERWISE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n5 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n6 157.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n7 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n8 158.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n9 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” \n10 159.  The Regulation is arbitrary and capricious because it departs from decades of prior \n11 law and practice without adequate explanation.  \n12 160.  The changes in policy are substantive and highly consequential, and they require a \n13 showing that there are good reasons for the new policy, which Defendants have failed to provide.   \n14 161.  Defendants failed to consider all relevant factors and articulate a rational \n15 connection between the facts found and the decisions made.  In fact, Defendants have offered \n16 explanations for their decisions that run counter to the evidence before the agency.   \n17 162.  The Regulation sets forth a number of different factors, some weighted more than \n18 others, to determine whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge.  These weighted \n19 factors are not reasonably related to determining whether an individual is likely to become a \n20 public charge.  Indeed, even under Defendants’ expanded definition of “public charge,” these \n21 various considerations do not predict a likelihood that an individual will receive benefits.    \n22 163.  Defendants failed to consider that the factors are so vague they invite arbitrary or \n23 discriminatory enforcement.  \n24 164.  The Agency ignored or failed to adequately consider important aspects of the \n25 problem, including evidence that the Regulation would cause harm by penalizing the use of \n26 housing, health care, and nutritional assistance benefits. \n27 165.  The Agency failed to adequately consider the harms caused by the chilling effect of \n28 the Regulation. \n  -38-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 41 of 45\n \n1 166.  The Agency failed to adequately consider the racially disparate impact of the \n2 policy. \n3 167.  In addition, although the Regulation provides several purported rationales for the \n4 changes it makes to the public charge inquiry, those purported rationales are arbitrary, irrational, \n5 not supported by the evidence in the record, and a pretext that conceal the true motivation, which \n6 is to dismantle the family-based immigration system and make it more difficult for non-white \n7 immigrants to remain in the United States.  Even on their own terms, the explanations for the \n8 Regulation are arbitrary and capricious.   \n9 168.  Defendants have also failed to adequately address the public comments that were \n10 submitted in response to the proposed Regulation.  \n11 169.  USCIS and DHS were improperly influenced in their rulemaking process by the \n12 political motivations of individuals within the Trump Administration. \n13 170.  USCIS issued the Regulation under the signature of and with the approval of Mr. \n14 Cuccinelli, who is not lawfully in charge of the promulgating agency.  As a result, the Regulation \n15 is contrary to law and without observance of procedure required by law under 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n16 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n17 FIFTH AMENDMENT (EQUAL PROTECTION) \n18 THE REGULATION DISCRIMINATES AGAINST NON-WHITE IMMIGRANTS \n19 171.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n20 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n21 172.  The Fifth Amendment contains an implicit guarantee of equal protection that \n22 invalidates any official action that reflects a racially discriminatory intent or purpose.  \n23 Classifications based on race, ethnicity, or national origin are subject to strict scrutiny, and even \n24 facially neutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern \n25 unexplainable on grounds other than racial discrimination.  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 \n26 (1954); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977). \n27 173.  Defendants acted with improper discriminatory intent and bias against non-white \n28 immigrants in promulgating the Regulation. \n  -39-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 42 of 45\n \n1 174.  Multiple tweets, statements, speeches and other actions by President Trump and his \n2 administration demonstrate racial animus toward non-white immigrants that underlie the \n3 Regulation. \n4 175.  The Regulation is unconstitutional because its promulgation was motivated, at least \n5 in part, because of, and not merely in spite of, its adverse effects on non-white immigrants.  Pers. \n6 Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). \n7 176.  Defendants promulgated the Regulation with full knowledge that it would have a \n8 disproportionate impact on non-white immigrants’ ability to obtain green cards and extend non-\n9 immigrant visas. \n10 177.  The history and sequence of events leading up to the promulgation of the \n11 Regulation were irregular, indicate a predetermined outcome not based on an objective \n12 assessment, and reveal that the Trump Administration’s animus for non-white immigrants drove \n13 the decision to adopt the Regulation. \n14 178.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the implementation of the \n15 unconstitutional Regulation. \n16 FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n17 DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT \n18 THE REGULATION IS INVALID BECAUSE IT WAS ISSUED BY AN UNLAWFULLY \n19 APPOINTED AGENCY DIRECTOR \n20 179.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury resulting from the implementation of the \n21 unconstitutional Regulation. \n22 180.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation contained in the \n23 preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n24 181.  The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. provides that “in a case of \n25 actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . , any court of the United States, upon the filing of an \n26 appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party \n27 seeking such declaration, whether or not such further relief is or could be sought.”  Id. § 2201(a). \n28 The Court has equitable jurisdiction to enjoin “violations of federal law by federal officials,” \n  -40-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 43 of 45\n \n1 Armstrong v.

Defendant Cuccinelli was appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause and \n6 the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.  Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the Regulation is \n7 invalid as signed by Defendant Cuccinelli and that Defendant Cuccinelli’s designation as acting \n8 head of USCIS violated the Constitution and federal law. \n9 183.  The Regulation, which could not have been promulgated without the approval of \n10 Cuccinelli as head of the issuing agency, harms Plaintiffs for the reasons stated above. \n11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n12 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:  \n13 1.  Declare the Regulation arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not \n14 in accordance with law, and without observance of procedure as required by law, in violation of \n15 the Administrative Procedure Act and the United States Constitution; \n16 2.  Declare the Regulation unconstitutional as violating the equal protection guarantee \n17 of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; \n18 3.  Declare that the Regulation has no force or effect under the Federal Vacancies \n19 Reform Act. \n20 4.  Vacate the Regulation; \n21 5.  Enjoin the Department and all its officers, employees and agents from \n22 implementing, applying, or enforcing the Regulation;  \n23 6.  Declare the appointment of Kenneth Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS \n24 invalid under the Appointments Clause and the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. \n25 7.  Award Plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorney’s fees as appropriate; and  \n26 8.  Grant such further and other relief as this Court deems just and proper. \n27  \n \n28  \n  -41-  Case No. 3:19-cv-4980\nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 44 of 45\n \n1     Respectfully submitted, \n2 Dated: August 16, 2019  By:  /s/ Nicholas Espíritu      \n    NICHOLAS ESPÍRITU (SBN 237665) \n3 espiritu@nilc.org \nLINTON JOAQUIN (SBN 73547) \n4 joaquin@nilc.org \nALVARO M.

TRUMP, et al., \n  Defendants. \n \n MEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nThis Memorandum Opinion concerns a challenge to recent amendments to the State \nDepartment’s Foreign Affairs Manual (the “FAM” or “Manual”).  The amendments pertain to the \ndetermination of “public charge” for purposes of an immigrant visa application.  \nAmong other things, the FAM sets forth the criteria that consular officers must consider to \ndetermine whether a visa applicant is likely to be a “public charge”—a person dependent on the \ngovernment for subsistence—if admitted to the United States.  See ECF 1, ¶ 92.  Under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., enacted in 1952, an applicant \ndeemed “likely . . . to become a public charge” is “inadmissible” for entry into the United States.  \nId. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \nThe Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the “City”) filed a 70-page lawsuit against \nDonald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; the United States \nDepartment of State (“State Department”); and Michael R. Pompeo, in his official capacity as \nUnited States Secretary of State, seeking to enjoin defendants from using the revised Manual to \nprocess immigrant visas applications.  ECF 1 (“Complaint”).  Appended to the City’s Complaint \nis a redlined copy of the FAM.  See ECF 1-1.   \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 3 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 2 of 82\nThe Complaint contains three counts under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551 et seq. (“APA”), and one count asserting an equal protection violation under the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  According to the City, the \namendments to the FAM’s public charge provisions impose financial costs on the City and disrupt \nits social services.  The City also contends that the amendments harm the health and well-being of \nBaltimore’s immigrant communities, which include family members who may be citizens.  In turn, \nit asserts that “Baltimore as a whole will suffer.”  ECF 1, ¶ 170.   \nDefendants (sometimes collectively referred to as the “government”) have moved to \ndismiss the Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \nand under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim.  ECF 17.  The motion is supported \nby a memorandum of law (ECF 17-1) (collectively, the “Motion”) and a copy of the Manual.  ECF \n17-2.  According to the government, the claims are not ripe and the City lacks standing to pursue \nthem.  Further, defendants maintain that even if the City can overcome these jurisdictional \nobstacles, the City has failed to plausibly allege that the FAM violates either the APA or the Due \nProcess Clause.  The City opposes the Motion.  ECF 25.  Defendants have replied.  ECF 56.   \nNumerous amici curiae have filed memoranda in support of the City.  ECF 49; ECF 51; \nECF 53.1 \n                                                 \n  1 The Public Justice Center; Capital Area Immigrant Rights Coalition; CASA of Maryland, \nInc.; Catholic Charities of Baltimore’s Immigration Legal Services; and Episcopal Refugee and \nImmigrant Center Alliance, jointly filed a memorandum in support of plaintiff, docketed at ECF \n49.  \n \nAmerican  Immigration  Council;  Americans  for  Immigrant  Justice;  Asian  Americans \nAdvancing Justice Los Angeles; Black Alliance for Just Immigration; LatinoJustice PRLDEF; \nMacArthur Justice Center; Muslim Advocates; National Immigrant Justice Center; Refugee and \nImmigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, Inc.; and Southern Poverty Law Center jointly \nfiled a memorandum in support of plaintiff, docketed at ECF 51. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 4 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 3 of 82\n  No hearing is necessary to resolve the Motion.  Local Rule 105.6.  For the reasons that \nfollow, I shall deny the Motion. \nI.  Background2 \nA.  The Public Charge Statute \nThe  INA  contains  ten  grounds  that  render  a  visa  applicant  inadmissible.    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a).  This case concerns one of them:  the public charge ground.  The statute provides: “Any \nalien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the \nopinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is \nlikely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  Thus, under \nthe statute,3 individuals deemed a public charge are “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be \nadmitted to the United States.”  Id. § 1182(a).    \n                                                 \nAnd, Alameda County, California; Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Los Angeles, California; \nMarin County, California; Montgomery County, Maryland; Mountain View, California; Oakland, \nCalifornia; Palm Springs, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Sacramento, California; Santa \nCruz County, California; Seattle, Washington; St. Paul, Minnesota; Stockton, California; Tucson, \nArizona; and West Hollywood, California jointly filed a memorandum in support of plaintiff.  It \nis docketed at ECF 53. \n \n2 As discussed, infra, at this juncture the facts alleged in the suit are taken as true.  See, \ne.g., Durden v. United States, 736 F.3d 296, 300 (4th Cir. 2013); Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d \n187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009).  Further, the Court “may take judicial notice of ‘matters of public record’ \nand other information that, under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, constitute ‘adjudicative facts.’”  \nGoldfarb v. Mayor & City Council of Balt., 791 F.3d 500, 508 (4th Cir. 2015).  \n3 The term “public charge” has a sordid heritage.  See ECF 51 at 2-6 (recounting the history \nof the public charge rule).   It  first  appeared in 1847, when New York, facing a surge of \nimpoverished Irish immigrants, created a commission to prevent the entrance of “any lunatic, idiot, \ndeaf and dumb, blind or infirm persons, not members of emigrating families, and who . . . are \nlikely to become permanently a public charge,” unless the shipmaster would post a bond for the \npassenger.    Torrie  Hester  et  al.,  Historians’  Comment:  DHS  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule \n“Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds” FR 2018-21106, at 2 (Oct. 5, 2018) (citation omitted).  \nOther states took  similar action.   See HIDETAKE HIROTA, EXPELLING THE POOR: ATLANTIC \nSEABOARD STATES & THE ORIGINS OF AMERICAN IMMIGRATION POLICY 41-70 (2017).  \n  \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 5 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 4 of 82\nThe INA does not define the term “public charge.”  Rather, the INA directs that the \ngovernment “shall at a minimum consider the alien’s—(I) age; (II) health; (III) family status; (IV) \nassets, resources, and financial status; and (V) education and skills.”  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  In \nmaking public charge  determinations, the  government “may  also  consider any  Affidavit of \nSupport[.]”  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).   \nVisa applicants in the United States are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”).  ECF 1, \n¶ 84. Visa applicants abroad are processed by the State Department through consular offices.  Id. \n¶ 21.  Both DHS and the State Department consider whether a visa applicant is likely to become a \n“public charge.”  Id. ¶ 39.     \nB.  Visa Application Process \nThe Consular Visa Process is the process by which non-citizens apply for a visa to enter \nthe United States.  Id. ¶ 18.  There are two primary types of visas: (1) immigrant visas, for \n                                                 \nWhen the Supreme Court invalidated New York’s law on Commerce Clause grounds in \n1875, see Henderson v. Mayor of City of New York, 92 U.S. 259, 274-75 (1875), Congress took \nup the mantle.  HIROTA, EXPELLING THE POOR, supra, at 184-85.  In 1882, Congress passed two \nlaws restricting immigration.  In May 1882, Congress prohibited the entry of “Chinese laborers.”  \nChinese Exclusion Act, ch. 126, 22 Stat. 58. (1882).  Three months later, it enacted the first general \nimmigration law “with immigrant exclusion and deportation at its core.”  HIROTA, EXPELLING THE \nPOOR, supra, at 191.  Among other things, the Act prohibited the entry into the United States of \n“any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without \nbecoming a public charge.”  An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214 (1882).  \nThroughout the early Twentieth Century, the federal government employed the public charge rule \nto exclude immigrant groups deemed undesirable, such as South Asians, Jews, and Hispanics.  See \nHester et al., Historians’ Comment, supra, at 3-4; see also ECF 51 at 5.    \n \n  When Congress enacted the INA in 1952 to modernize the nation’s immigration system, \nit included the public charge rule as a basis for inadmissibility.  See Pub. L. No. 414, ch. 2, \n§ 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)).  The public charge \nprovision  was  last  amended  in  1996.    See  Pub.  L.  104-208,  Div.  C,  110  Stat.  3009-674, \n§ 531(a)(4)(B) (1996).  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 6 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 5 of 82\nindividuals who seek to become permanent residents of the United States; and (2) nonimmigrant \nvisas, for individuals seeking a temporary stay in the United States.  Id. ¶ 19; see also 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1181(a); 1182(a)(7).  \nThe “vast majority” of foreign nationals must travel to a U.S. consulate to apply for a visa.   \nECF 1, ¶ 20.  “Consular processing” requires the visa applicant to submit various documents, \nundergo a medical screening, and be interviewed in person by a consular officer.  Id. ¶ 21; see also \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1202(a), (e); 22 C.F.R. § 42.62.  During the interview, the consular officer reviews \nthe applicant’s criminal, financial, and medical records to decide if the applicant is admissible to \nthe United States.  ECF 1, ¶ 28.   \nThe applicant bears the burden to demonstrate “to the satisfaction of the consular officer” \nthat he or she is eligible for the type of visa for which the applicant has applied.  8 U.S.C. § 1361.  \nNo visa “shall be issued to an alien” if “it appears to the consular officer” from the application \npapers “that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa” or if “the consular officer knows or has reason \nto believe” that the alien is ineligible.  Id. § 1201(g); see 22 C.F.R. § 40.6 (explaining that the term \n“‘reason to believe’ . . . shall be considered to require a determination based upon facts or \ncircumstances which would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the applicant is ineligible to \nreceive a visa”).4 \nAn individual illegally residing in the United States must satisfy additional requirements \nto obtain a visa.  ECF 1, ¶ 22.  Those individuals must leave the country and undergo consular \n                                                 \n4 Although a visa normally is necessary for admission, it does not guarantee admission; a \nvisa holder still must be found admissible upon inspection at a port of entry. See 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1201(h), 1185(d), 1225(a); see also id. § 1101(a)(4) (specifying that an application for a visa is \ndistinct from an application for admission). \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 7 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 6 of 82\nprocessing abroad in order to obtain a visa.  Id. ¶ 29.5   The individual must remain abroad while \nthe consulate processes his or her application.  This can take weeks or months or may last \nindefinitely if the individual’s visa is denied or put into administrative processing.  Id.  \nIndividuals may obtain an immigrant visa through three channels.  First, a United States \nemployer may file for an employment-based visa for the immigrant.  Id. ¶ 23.  Second, an \nindividual may submit a diversity visa application to the diversity visa lottery.  Id.  Third, a lawful \npermanent resident or United States citizen may file on behalf of a relative for a family-based visa.                                              \nId. ¶¶ 23, 25.  Where an applicant files for a family-based visa, the family member sponsor must \nsubmit an Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) on the applicant’s behalf.  Id. ¶ 25.  Consular officials \nuse the Affidavit to determine whether a visa applicant will have sufficient financial support should \nhe or she receive a visa.  Id. ¶ 26.  The Affidavit also serves as a contract between the visa applicant, \nthe sponsor, and the federal government, in which the sponsor pledges to support the applicant if \nhe or she is not self-sufficient.6  Id.  According to the City, “an immigrant who can depend on a \nreliable source of support from a sponsor is dramatically less likely to need any public benefits.”  \nId.  \nC.  The Foreign Affairs Manual \nThe State Department’s website describes the FAM as “a single, comprehensive, and \nauthoritative source for the Department’s organization structure, policies, and procedures that \ngovern the operation of the State Department, the Foreign Service, and, when applicable, other \n                                                 \n5 In contrast, individuals already in the United States on a valid visa who wish to extend \ntheir visa, change their visa status, or apply for permanent residency must petition USCIS.  See \nECF 1, ¶¶ 20 n.12, 84. \n \n6 If a sponsor has a household income of less than 125% of the federal poverty limit, the \nsponsor must co-sponsor the applicant with another individual such that their joint income exceeds \nthat threshold. ECF 1, ¶ 27. However, the joint sponsor need not be related to the applicant. Id.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 8 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 7 of 82\nfederal agencies.”  Id. ¶ 42 (quoting Foreign Affairs Manual and Handbook, U.S. Dep’t of State, \nhttp://fam.state.gov/).  Along with the State Department’s handbooks, the Manual “convey[s] \ncodified information to Department staff and contractors so they can carry out their responsibilities \nin accordance with statutory, executive, and Department mandates.”  Id.; see also Sheikh v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 685 F. Supp. 2d 1076, 1090 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (“FAM contains the \nfunctional  statements,  organizational  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of  each  of  the  major \ncomponents of the U.S. Department of State, including Consular Officers.”).  \n1.  The Prior FAM Public Charge Rule \nVolume Nine of the Manual contains instructions that consular officers are to follow when \nassessing whether a visa applicant is a public charge.  Prior to January 3, 2018, the FAM defined \n“public charge” as a non-citizen “likely to become primarily dependent on the U.S. Government \nfor subsistence.”  ECF 1, ¶ 44; ECF 17-2 (9 FAM § 302.8 (2017)) at 3.  This occurred either from \n“[r]eceipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance” or “[i]nstitutionalization for long-\nterm care at U.S. Government expense.”    ECF 1, ¶ 44; ECF 17-2 at 3.   \n“When considering the likelihood of an applicant becoming such a ‘public charge,’ [the \nconsular officer] must take into account, the totality of the alien’s circumstances at the time of visa \napplication.”  ECF 17-2 at 3.  However, the FAM clarified that the officer “must assess only the \n‘totality of the circumstances’ existing at the time of visa application.”  Id. at 11.  In other words, \nthe officer “may not refuse a visa on the basis of ‘what if’ type considerations.”  Id.    \nNotably, the Manual excluded the visa applicant’s past, current, or future receipt of non-\ncash benefits from this holistic review.  ECF 1, ¶ 44.  It stated, ECF 17-2 at 4 (emphasis added):  \nThere are many forms of U.S. Government assistance that an alien may have \naccepted in the past, or that you may reasonably believe an alien might receive after \nadmission to the United States, that are of a noncash and/or supplemental nature \nand would not create an inadmissibility under INA 212(a)(4). Certain programs are \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 9 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 8 of 82\nfunded with public funds for the general good, such as public education and child \nvaccination programs, etc., and are not considered to be benefits for the purposes \nof INA 212(a)(4). Although the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996 prohibit aliens from receiving many kinds of public \nbenefits, it specifically exempts from this prohibition several of the public benefits \nindicated below. Neither the past nor possible future receipt of such non-cash or \nsupplemental assistance may be considered in determining whether an alien is \nlikely to become a public charge.  \n \nThe FAM provided a non-exhaustive list of non-cash benefits “that are not to be considered \nas public cash assistance or income . . . .”  Id.  The list included:  \n1.  The Food Stamp Program;  \n2.  The Medicaid Program (other than payments under Medicaid for long-term \ninstitutional care);  \n3.  The Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP);  \n4.  Emergency medical services;  \n5.   The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program;  \n6.  Other nutrition and food assistance programs;  \n7.  Other health and medical benefits;  \n8.  Child-care benefits;  \n9.  Foster care  \n10. Transportation vouchers;  \n11. Job training programs; \n12. Energy assistance, such as the low-income home energy assistance program \n(LIHEAP); \n13. Educational assistance, such as Head Start or aid for elementary, secondary, or \nhigher education; \n14. Job training; \n15. In-kind emergency community services, such as soup kitchens and crisis \ncounseling; \n16. State and local programs that serve the same purposes as the Federal in-kind \nprograms listed above; and \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 10 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 9 of 82\n17. Any other Federal, State, or local programs in which benefits are paid in-kind, \nby voucher or by any means other than payment of cash benefits to the \neligible person for income maintenance. \nECF 1, ¶ 45; ECF 17-2 at 4-5.   \nFurther, the Manual limited the relevance of benefits used by the visa applicant’s family \nmembers.  It stated: “Past or current receipt of cash benefits for income maintenance by a family \nmember of the visa applicant may be factored into the applicant’s case only when such benefits \nalso constitute(d) the primary means of subsistence of the applicant.”  ECF 1, ¶ 102; ECF 17-2 at \n10 (alteration in original).  The Manual also provided: “Past or current receipt of other types of \nbenefits, . . . must not be considered.”  ECF 1, ¶ 102; ECF 17-2 at 101.  \nIn regard to an Affidavit of Support, the FAM instructed that “[a] properly filed, non-\nfraudulent Form I-864 should normally be considered sufficient to overcome the INA 212(a)(4) \nrequirements.”  ECF 1, ¶ 47; ECF 17-2 at 7.  “If the sponsor or any member of his or her household \nhas received public means-tested benefits within the past three years,” the FAM required the \nconsular officer to “review fully the sponsor’s current ability to provide the requisite level of \nsupport, taking into consideration the kind of assistance provided and the dates received.”  ECF 1, \n¶ 48; ECF 17-2 at 11-12.  Nonetheless, the Manual stated: “There is no provision in the law to \nindicate that the receipt of means-tested benefits by the sponsor would, in itself, result in a finding \nof inadmissibility for the applicant . . . .”  ECF 1, ¶ 107; ECF 17-2 at 11.   \n2.  The Amended FAM Public Charge Rule \nWithout prior notice, the State Department issued amendments to Volume Nine of the \nManual on January 3, 2018.  ECF 1, ¶ 92.  The State Department posted a memorandum on its \nwebsite on January 4, 2018, announcing the changes.  Id. ¶ 115.  In three significant ways, the \nrevisions alter how consular officers conduct public charge determinations.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 11 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 10 of 82\nFirst, the FAM previously prohibited consular officers from considering the applicant’s \npast or potential future use of non-cash public assistance.  ECF 1, ¶ 97.  But, the Manual now \nrequires consular officers to consider a visa applicant’s receipt of non-cash benefits as part of the \npublic charge determination.  Id. ¶ 96.  Specifically, the FAM states: “There are many forms of \npublic assistance that an applicant may have accepted in the past, or that you may reasonably \nbelieve, an alien might receive after admission to the United States that are of a non-cash and/or \nsupplementary nature and should not be considered to be benefits when examining the applicant \nunder INA 212(a)(4), and may only be considered as part of the totality of the applicant’s \ncircumstances in determining whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge.”  Id. ¶ 98; \nECF 1-1 at 5 (emphasis added).  Furthermore, the State Department dropped the FAM’s directive \nthat “[n]either the past nor possible future receipt of such non-cash or supplemental assistance may \nbe considered in determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge.”  ECF 1, ¶¶ 99-\n100; ECF 1-1 at 5. \nSecond, under the earlier version of the FAM, consular officers were not permitted to \nconsider the use of non-cash benefits by the applicant’s family members; the receipt of cash \nassistance was relevant only if the benefits were the applicant’s primary source of income.  ECF \n1, ¶ 102.  However, the FAM now includes the receipt of non-cash benefits by the visa applicant’s \nfamily members as a part of the totality-of-the-circumstances test.  Id. ¶ 101.  The relevant \nprovision now states: “Past or current receipt of public assistance of any type by the visa applicant \nor a family member in the visa applicant’s household is relevant to determining whether the \napplicant is likely to become a public charge in the future[.]”  ECF 1, ¶ 103; ECF 1-1 at 9 (emphasis \nadded).  Further, the FAM instructs consular officers to treat “[a] dependent family member’s \nreceipt of public benefits” as “a heavily negative factor in the totality of the circumstances unless \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 12 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 11 of 82\nthe applicant can demonstrate that his or her prospective income and assets with the income and \nassets of the others in the family will be sufficient for the family to overcome the poverty income \nguideline for the family.”  ECF 1, ¶ 104; ECF 1-1 at 10 (emphasis added). \nThird, whereas the FAM once taught that an Affidavit of Support from the applicant’s \nsponsor was “normally . . . sufficient” to satisfy the public charge inquiry, the revised Manual \ndiminishes the Affidavit’s weight, instructing that it is merely one factor among many that the \nconsular officer should consider.  ECF 1, ¶¶ 105-08.  Currently, the consular officer may treat the \nAffidavit as a “positive” factor, whereas it was previously “sufficient” in most cases.  Id. ¶ 105; \nECF 1-1 at 7.   \nAccording to the City, the State Department “now considers the past or current receipt of \nnon-cash, means-tested benefits by sponsors or their family members to be disqualifying.”  ECF \n1, ¶ 106.  For support, plaintiff notes that the new Manual no longer contains the qualifier that \n“[t]here is no provision in the law to indicate that the receipt of means-tested benefits by the \nsponsor would, in itself, result in a finding of inadmissibility . . . .”  Id. ¶ 108; ECF 1-1 at 24. \nThe City contends that the memorandum posted by the State Department on January 4, \n2018, concerning the revisions to the FAM, did not mention many of the changes made to the \nFAM.  ECF 1, ¶ 119(a).  In particular, it “failed to acknowledge that the changes to the FAM’s \npublic charge provisions amounted to a reversal of the decades-old understanding of the public \ncharge ground of inadmissibility, codified in prior versions of the FAM and by INS in the 1999 \nNPRM and Field Guidance.”  Id. ¶ 119(c).  Moreover, it did not “disclose that DHS would be \nproposing for public comment similar changes to the public charge determination . . . .”  Id. \n¶ 119(e).  And it “failed to provide any explanation as to why the State Department was changing \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 13 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 12 of 82\nits policy and approach to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, nor reasons for the new \napproach.”  Id. ¶119(f) (emphasis in original). \nThe State Department removed the memorandum from its website several weeks after it \nwas posted.  Id. ¶ 116.  Since then, the State Department has neither reposted the memorandum \nnor issued any other public statement about the revisions to the FAM’s public charge provisions.  \nBut, the amendments to the FAM remain in effect.  \n3.  The Effect of the FAM’s New Public Charge Rule  \nThe City alleges that “the FAM change deters immigrants, their family members, and their \nsponsors from accepting public benefits—benefits for which they are legally eligible and which \nare designed to promote public health and economic self-sufficiency.”  Id. ¶ 121.  It points to media \nstories detailing a steep drop in the receipt of non-cash benefits by immigrants.  Id. ¶ 126; see infra \nPart III.A(2).  And, the City notes that healthcare providers throughout Maryland have observed \nthat immigrants are foregoing health benefits like WIC or Medicare for fear of immigration \nconsequences.  Id. ¶ 127. \nAccording to the City, the changes to the FAM’s public charge provisions will be felt most \nacutely by non-white immigrants.  Id. ¶ 128.  For support, plaintiffs turn to an analysis of DHS’s \nproposed  rule  pertaining  to  the  definition  of  public  charge,  which  found  that  the  rule,  if \nimplemented,  would  “have  disproportionate  effects  based  on  national  origin  and  ethnicity, \nblocking 71% of applicants from Mexico and Central America, 69% from Africa, and 52% from \nAsia—but only 36% from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.”  Id. (quoting The Public Charge Rule, \nExplained,  Boundless  (Sept.  23,  2018),  https://www.boundless.com/  blog/public-charge-rule-\nexplained).  Thus, the City posits that the FAM change will disproportionately affect immigrants \nfrom developing countries.  Id.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 14 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 13 of 82\nThe City and Amici also note in their briefs that visa denials due to public charge \ninadmissibility have surged since the State Department issued the amended FAM.  See ECF 25 at \n19-20; ECF 49 at 5; ECF 53 at 3-4.  In 2015, the State Department denied 897 visa applications \non  public  charge  grounds.    U.S.  Dep’t  of  State,  Ann.  Rep.  Table  XX  (2015), \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2015AnnualReport/FY15\nAnnualReport-TableXX.pdf.  There were 3,237 such denials in 2017. U.S. Dep’t of State, Ann. \nRep.  Table  XX  (2017),  https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/ \nFY2017AnnualReport/FY17AnnualReport-TableXX.pdf.  In contrast, during the 2018 fiscal year, \nthe  number  of  visa  applications  denied  on  public  charge  grounds  exceeded  13,000  visa \napplications. U.S. Dep’t of State, Ann. Rep. Table XX (2018), https://travel.state.gov/content/ \ndam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2018AnnualReport/FY18AnnualReport%20%20-\n%20TableXIX.pdf. \nD.  Allegations of Defendants’ Animus \nThe City alleges that President Trump and senior Executive Branch officials harbor \n“animus  towards  immigrants,  particularly  those  from  Latin  American,  Asian,  and  African \ncountries, and those who accept public benefits.”  ECF 1, ¶ 74.  In support of this allegation, \nplaintiff points to multiple statements by President Trump that allegedly reflect disdain for \nimmigrants from Africa and Latin America.   \nFor example, President Trump reportedly told advisors in June 2017 that immigrants from \nHaiti “all have AIDS” and that Nigerians, once admitted to the United States, would never “go \nback to their huts.”  Id. ¶ 70; see Eugene Scott, Trump’s History of Making Offensive Comments \nAbout Nonwhite Immigrants, Wash. Post (Jan. 11, 2018), https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ \nthe-fix/wp/2018/01/11/trumps-history-of-controversial-remarks-about-nonwhite-immigrants/.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 15 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 14 of 82\nAnd, during a cabinet meeting on January 11, 2018, in reference to immigrants from Haiti and \nAfrica, President Trump allegedly remarked, “Why do we want all these people from ‘shithole \ncountries’ coming here?”  ECF 1, ¶ 69; see also Scott supra.  \nMoreover, the Complaint contains four pages of other public statements made by President \nTrump, complaining that immigrants are a drain on the public fisk.  ECF 1, ¶ 71.  Those statements \ninclude:  \n1.  “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system \ncosts America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.”  Id. ¶ 71(m). \n \n2.  “We also believe that those seeking to immigrate into our country should be able \nto  support  themselves  financially  and  should  not  be  able  to  use  welfare  for \nthemselves or the household for a period of at least five years.”  Id. ¶ 71(n).   \n \n3.  “Current immigration policy imposes as much as $300 billion annually in net fiscal \ncosts on U.S. taxpayers.”  Id. ¶ 71(p). \n \n4.  “According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the $18 billion wall will pay for \nitself by curbing the importation of crime, drugs, and illegal immigrants who tend \nto go on the federal dole.”  Id. ¶ 71(q). \n \n5.   “[T]hey’re not sending their finest. We’re sending them the hell back.”  Id. ¶ 71(r). \n \n6.  “So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and \nis very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other.”  Id. ¶ 71(t). \n \n7.   “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and \nthe baby is essentially a citizen of the United States . . . with all of those benefits.”  \nId. ¶ 71(u). \n \nIn support of the City’s claims that the Trump Administration harbors animus towards \nimmigrants, the City also cites to statements made by Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to President \nTrump on immigration policy, and comments made by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions \nwhen he was a U.S. Senator.  Id. ¶¶ 72-73.   \nSignificantly, the City alleges that the President’s conduct led to the State Department’s \ndecision to amend the FAM’s public charge instructions.  Id. ¶ 76.  The City asserts that, shortly \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 16 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 15 of 82\nafter President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the media obtained a draft order titled \n“Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote \nAccountability and Responsibility.”  Id. ¶ 77; see Andrew Bremberg, Memorandum for the \nPresident,  Subject:  Executive  Order  on  Protecting  Taxpayer  Resources  by  Ensuring  Our \nImmigration Laws Promote Accountability and Responsibility (Jan. 23, 2017).  According to the \nCity, the draft order directed DHS to “rescind any field guidance” and “propose for notice and \ncomment a rule that provides standards for determining which aliens are inadmissible or deportable \non public charge grounds.”  ECF 1, ¶ 77.  In addition, the City alleges that the draft order instructed \nthe State Department “to amend the Foreign Affairs Manual to ensure that its public-charge \nprovisions are consistent with the goals of this Order.”  Id.   \nNotably, the draft order was never finalized.  Id.  Nevertheless, plaintiff contends that both \nthe State Department and DHS took measures in accordance with the draft order.  On October 10, \n2018,  DHS  published  a  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  in  the  Federal  Register  titled \n“Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds.”  Id. ¶ 83; see 83 Fed. Reg. 51, 114 (Oct. 10, 2018) \n(“DHS Proposed Rule”). The proposed rule purported to expand the definition of public charge to \ninclude the receipt of non-cash public benefits.  ECF 1, ¶ 86.  DHS published a final version of the \nregulation on August 14, 2019.  See Inadmissibility of Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. \n41,292, 41,501 (Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified as 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a)).7  And, as noted, the State \nDepartment amended the FAM’s public charge provisions on January 3, 2018. ECF 1, ¶ 92.   \n                                                 \n7 There are seven pending lawsuits lodged against DHS’s public charge rule.  See CASA de \nMaryland Inc. v. Trump, PWG-19-02715 (D. Md.); Make the Road N.Y. v. Cuccinelli, No. 1:19-\ncv-07993 (S.D.N.Y.); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 1:19-cv-07777 (S.D.N.Y.); \nCalifornia v.

Additional facts are included below, as necessary for the analysis.  \nII.  Standard of Review  \nDefendants have moved to dismiss the City’s Complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, and pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. \nA.  Rule 12(b)(1) \nA challenge to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may proceed “in one of two \nways”: either a facial challenge, asserting that the allegations pleaded in the complaint are \ninsufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction, or a factual challenge, asserting “‘that the \njurisdictional allegations of the complaint [are] not true.’”  Kerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, \n192 (4th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); accord Durden v. United States, 736 F.3d 296, 300 (4th Cir. \n2013).  The plaintiff bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, the existence \nof subject matter jurisdiction.  See Demetres v. East West Const., Inc., 776 F.3d 271, 272 (4th Cir. \n2015); see also The Piney Run Preservation Ass’n v. Cty. Comm’rs of Carroll Cty., 523 F.3d 453, \n459 (4th Cir. 2008); Evans v. B.F. Perkins Co., 166 F.3d 642, 647 (4th Cir. 1999).     \nIn a facial challenge, “the facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true, and the motion \nmust be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.”  \nKerns, 585 F.3d at 192.  On the other hand, in a factual challenge, “the district court is entitled to \ndecide disputed issues of fact with respect to subject matter jurisdiction.”   Id.  In that circumstance, \nthe court “may regard the pleadings as mere evidence on the issue and may consider evidence \noutside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.”  Velasco \nv. Gov’t of Indonesia, 370 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir. 2004); see also United States ex rel. Vuyyuru v. \nJadhav, 555 F.3d 337, 347-48 (4th Cir. 2009); Evans, 166 F.3d at 647.  \n \n  \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 18 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 17 of 82\nB.  Rule 12(b)(6) \nA defendant may test the legal sufficiency of a complaint by way of a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  In re Birmingham, 846 F.3d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 2017); Goines v. Valley Cmty. \nServs. Bd., 822 F.3d 159, 165-66 (4th Cir. 2016); McBurney v. Cuccinelli, 616 F.3d 393, 408 (4th \nCir. 2010), aff’d sub nom., McBurney v. Young, 569 U.S. 221 (2013); Edwards v. City of \nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999).  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion constitutes an assertion by \na defendant that, even if the facts alleged by a plaintiff are true, the complaint fails as a matter of \nlaw “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”   \nWhether a complaint states a claim for relief is assessed by reference to the pleading \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  That rule provides that a complaint must contain a “short \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  The purpose of the \nrule is to provide the defendants with “fair notice” of the claims and the “grounds” for entitlement \nto relief.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007). \nTo survive a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain facts \nsufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570; see \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 684 (2009) (“Our decision in Twombly expounded the pleading \nstandard for ‘all civil actions’ . . . .” (citation omitted)); see also Paradise Wire & Cable Defined \nBenefit Pension Plan v. Weil, 849 F.3d 93, 112 (4th Cir. 2019); Willner v. Dimon, 849 F.3d 93, \n112 (4th Cir. 2017).  To be sure, a plaintiff need not include “detailed factual allegations” in order \nto satisfy Rule 8(a)(2).  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Moreover, federal pleading rules “do not \ncountenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the \nclaim asserted.”  Johnson v. City of Shelby, Miss., 574 U.S. 10, 10, 135 S. Ct. 346, 346 (2014) (per \ncuriam).  But, mere “‘naked assertions’ of wrongdoing” are generally insufficient to state a claim \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 19 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 18 of 82\nfor relief.  Francis v. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).  \nIn  other  words,  the  rule  demands  more  than  bald  accusations  or  mere  speculation.  \nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see Painter’s Mill Grille, LLC v. Brown, 716 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. \n2013).  If a complaint provides no more than “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation \nof the elements of a cause of action,” it is insufficient.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  “[A]n \nunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation” does not state a plausible claim of \nrelief.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Rather, to satisfy the minimal requirements of Rule 8(a)(2), the \ncomplaint must set forth “enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest” a cognizable cause of \naction, “even if . . . [the] actual proof of those facts is improbable and . . . recovery is very remote \nand unlikely.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court “must accept as true all of the factual \nallegations contained in the complaint” and must “draw all reasonable inferences [from those facts] \nin favor of the plaintiff.”  E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 \n(4th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted); see Semenova v. MTA, 845 F.3d 564, 567 (4th Cir. 2017); \nHouck v. Substitute Tr. Servs., Inc., 791 F.3d 473, 484 (4th Cir. 2015); Kendall v. Balcerzak, 650 \nF.3d 515, 522 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 943 (2011).  But, a court is not required to \naccept legal conclusions drawn from the facts.  See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986); \nGlassman v. Arlington Cty., 628 F.3d 140, 146 (4th Cir. 2010). “A court decides whether [the \npleading]  standard  is  met  by  separating  the  legal  conclusions  from  the  factual  allegations, \nassuming the truth of only the factual allegations, and then determining whether those allegations \nallow the court to reasonably infer” that the plaintiff is entitled to the legal remedy sought.  A \nSociety Without a Name v. Virginia, 655 F.3d 342, 346 (4th. Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 937 \n(2012).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 20 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 19 of 82\nCourts ordinarily do not “‘resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or \nthe applicability of defenses’” through a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Edwards, 178 F.3d at 243 (quoting \nRepublican Party v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992)).  However, “in the relatively rare \ncircumstances where facts sufficient to rule on an affirmative defense are alleged in the complaint, \nthe defense may be reached by a motion to dismiss filed under Rule 12(b)(6).”  Goodman v. \nPraxair, Inc., 494 F.3d 458, 464 (4th Cir. 2007) (en banc); accord Pressley v. Tupperware Long \nTerm Disability Plan, 553 F.3d 334, 336 (4th Cir. 2009).  Because Rule 12(b)(6) “is intended \n[only] to test the legal adequacy of the complaint,” Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R. \nCo. v. Forst, 4 F.3d 244, 250 (4th Cir. 1993), “[t]his principle only applies . . . if all facts necessary \nto the affirmative defense ‘clearly appear[ ] on the face of the complaint.’”  Goodman, 494 F.3d \nat 464 (quoting Forst, 4 F.3d at 250) (emphasis added in Goodman). \n“Generally, when a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), courts \nare limited to  considering the sufficiency of allegations set  forth  in  the complaint and the \n‘documents attached or incorporated into the complaint.’”  Zak v. Chelsea Therapeutics Int’l, Ltd., \n780 F.3d 597, 606 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 637 F.3d at 448).  \nTherefore, the court ordinarily “may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint, \nor not expressly incorporated therein . . . .”  Clatterbuck v. City of Charlottesville, 08 F.3d 549, \n557 (4th Cir. 2013), abrogated on other grounds by Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz., 576 U.S. ____, \n135 S. Ct. 2218 (2015), as recognized in Cahaly v.

However, under limited \ncircumstances, when resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider documents beyond \nthe complaint without converting the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment.

LCI Int’l Inc., 190 F.3d 609, 618 (4th Cir. 1999).  But, “before treating \nthe contents of an attached or incorporated document as true, the district court should consider the \nnature of the document and why the plaintiff attached it.”  Goines, 822 F.3d at 167 (citing N. Ind. \nGun & Outdoor Shows, Inc. v. City of S. Bend, 163 F.3d 449, 455 (7th Cir. 1998)).   \nOf import here, “[w]hen the plaintiff attaches or incorporates a document upon which his \nclaim is based, or when the complaint otherwise shows that the plaintiff has adopted the contents \nof the document, crediting the document over conflicting allegations in the complaint is proper.”  \nGoines, 822 F.3d at 167.  Conversely, “where the plaintiff attaches or incorporates a document for \npurposes other than the truthfulness of the document, it is inappropriate to treat the contents of that \ndocument as true.”  Id. \nA court may also “consider a document submitted by the movant that [is] not attached to \nor expressly incorporated in a complaint, so long as the document was integral to the complaint \nand there is no dispute about the document’s authenticity.”  Goines, 822 F.3d at 166 (citations \nomitted); see also Woods v.

P. 10(c) (“A \ncopy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all \npurposes.”). \nIn addition, “a court may properly take judicial notice of ‘matters of public record’ and \nother information that, under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, constitute ‘adjudicative facts.’”  \nGoldfarb, 791 F.3d at 508; see also Tellabs, Inc. v.

Clatterbuck, 708 F.3d at 557.   \nAs noted, the City has attached as an exhibit to its Complaint the redline version of the \nFAM’s public charge provisions, subsequent to January 3, 2018.  ECF 1-1; see ECF 1, ¶ 95.  With \ntheir Motion, the government submitted a version of the Manual, dated August 4, 2017.  ECF 17-\n2.  As the City’s APA and constitutional claims are predicated on the Manual, it is integral to the \nComplaint and may be considered.  In addition, the government references the Attorney General’s \nManual on the APA in its Motion (ECF 17-1 at 42), and plaintiff relies on data concerning visa \napplication denials in its opposition.  ECF 25 at 19-20.  Because these materials are publicly \navailable,  and neither party  disputes  their  authenticity,  I may take judicial  notice of them.  \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 23 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 22 of 82\nAccordingly, I may consider the exhibits and referenced public materials, without converting \ndefendants’ Motion to one for summary judgment.  \nIII.  Justiciability  \nThe government argues that this Court is without subject matter jurisdiction to consider \nthis case.  According to defendants, plaintiff lacks Article III standing to pursue this suit and the \ncase is not ripe.  ECF 17-1 at 21-32.   \nDefendants advance several arguments in regard to standing.  First, they assert that \nplaintiff’s harm does not qualify as an injury-in-fact, as “it relies on speculation about what might \nhappen to the City depending on how Baltimore residents react to the guidance.”  Id. at 25.  Second, \nthey maintain that the City’s alleged harms are not “fairly traceable” to the FAM or redressable by \njudicial order, because they are caused by the “‘unfettered choices’” of “‘independent actors not \nbefore the courts.’”  Id. at 26 (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562 (1993) \n(plurality opinion)).  In addition, the government contends that the City lacks standing to assert \nthe constitutional rights of its residents.  Id. at 29-30.  And, defendants argue that even if the City \nhas Article III standing to sue the State Department and Pompeo, the City lacks standing to sue the \nPresident, because it does not plausibly allege that its injuries are fairly traceable to him.  Id. at 30-\n31.  Not surprisingly, the City disagrees.  ECF 25 at 22-37.  \nAs  noted,  under Rule  12(b)(1),  the  plaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  proving,  by  a \npreponderance of evidence, the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n561; Demetres, 776 F.3d at, 272; Durden, 736 F.3d at 300.  Notably, the analysis of standing will \nvary with the stage of litigation.  Overbey v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., 930 F.3d 215, 227 \n(4th Cir. 2019).  In the context of a facial challenge under Rule 12(b)(1), the question is whether \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 24 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 23 of 82\nplaintiff’s allegations, taken as true, “are enough to give the [plaintiff] constitutional standing.”  \nId.   \nWhen, as here, “‘standing is challenged on the pleadings, [the court will] accept as true all \nmaterial allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining \nparty.’”  Deal v. Mercer Cty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, 187 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting So. Walk at \nBroadlands Homeowner’s Ass’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 181-82 \n(4th Cir. 2013)); see Kerns, 585 F.3d at 192.  “At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of \ninjury resulting from the defendant’s conduct may suffice, [because] on a motion to dismiss [the \ncourt] presum[es] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support \nthe claim.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citation and quotation marks omitted); accord Hutton v. Nat’l \nBd. of Exam’rs in Optometry, Inc., 892 F.3d 613, 620 (4th Cir. 2018); Moore v. Blibaum & Assocs., \nP.A., 693 F. App’x 205 (4th Cir. 2017); NAACP v. Bureau of the Census, PWG-18-891, 2019 WL \n355743, at *17 (D. Md. Jan 19, 2019).  \nTherefore, in analyzing the standing issue, I shall accept as true the allegations in the \nComplaint, so long as “there is sufficient ‘factual matter’ to render them ‘plausible on [their] \nface.’”  Beck v. McDonald, 848 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2017) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678), \ncert. denied sub nom. Beck v. Shulkin, __ U.S. __, 137 S. Ct. 2307 (2017); see also Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555-56.   \nA.  Standing  \n1.  Background \nIt is a bedrock principle that Article III of the Federal Constitution confines the federal \ncourts to adjudicating “actual, ongoing cases or controversies.”  Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 \nU.S. 472, 477 (1990) (citations omitted); see Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 25 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 24 of 82\n(2013).  “Indeed, ‘no principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in our system of \ngovernment than the constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or \ncontroversies.’”  Dreher v. Experian Info. Solutions, Inc., 856 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir. 2017) \n(quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. __, __, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016)).   \nTherefore, during the pendency of a case, an actual controversy must exist.  See Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 (1974); Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 639 v. Airgas, \nInc., 885 F.3d 230, 234 (4th Cir. 2019); Williams v. Ozmint, 716 F.3d 801, 808 (4th Cir. 2013).    \nConversely, in the absence of a case or controversy, “the court’s subject matter jurisdiction ceases \nto exist . . . .”  S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 789 F.3d 475, \n482 (4th Cir. 2015); see Gardner v. GMAC, Inc., 796 F.3d 390, 395 (4th Cir. 2015) (same).  \n “One element of the case-or-controversy requirement” is that a plaintiff must establish \nstanding to sue.  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997); see Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1547 \n(“Standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy.”); \nSouth Carolina v. United States, 912 F.3d 720, 726 (4th Cir. 2019) (“The standing doctrine derives \nfrom  the  Constitution’s  limitation  on  Article  III  courts’  power  to  adjudicate  ‘cases  and \ncontroversies.’) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Clapper Court explained, \n568 U.S. at 408: “The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers principles, \nserves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political \nbranches.”8   \n                                                 \n  8 Under the political question doctrine, which is not asserted here, courts may not “review \nthose controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally \ncommitted for resolution to the halls of Congress or the confines of the Executive Branch.”  Japan \nWhaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc’y, 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986).  It is a “narrow exception” to \njudicial review.  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 195 (2012); see Kravitz v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 336 F. Supp. 3d 545, 561 (D.

Lee’s Crossing Homeowners \nAss’n, 718 F.3d 262, 269 (4th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted); South Carolina, 912 F.3d at 730.  Like \nstanding, ripeness is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.  Sansotta v. Town of Nags Head, 724 \nF.3d 533, 548 (4th Cir. 2013); see NAACP, WL 355743, at *8 (describing standing and ripeness \nas “overlapping facets” of subject matter jurisdiction). \nThe  doctrine  of  standing  consists  of  two  distinct  “strands”:  constitutional  standing, \npursuant to Article III, and prudential standing.  Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. \n1, 11 (2004).  As discussed, infra, “the standing inquiry asks whether a plaintiff ha[s] the requisite \nstake in the outcome of a case . . . .”  Deal, 911 F.3d at 187 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000)).  Under Article III, “a party invoking \nthe jurisdiction of a federal court [must] seek relief for a particularized injury,” which is a \nrequirement that “serves vital interests going to the role of the judiciary in our system of separated \npowers.”    Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 696 (2013). \nIn  addition  to  satisfying  constitutional  standing  requirements,  a  plaintiff  must  also \ndemonstrate that his claims are not barred by prudential limitations on a federal court’s exercise \nof jurisdiction.  United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 756-57 (2013); see also, e.g., Elk Grove \nUnified Sch. Dist., 542 U.S. at 11; Doe v. Sebelius, 676 F. Supp. 2d 423, 428 (D. Md. 2009).  \nPrudential  standing  “‘embodies  judicially  self-imposed  limits  on  the  exercise  of  federal \njurisdiction.’”  Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist., 542 U.S. at 11 (citation omitted).   \nOne such limitation is that “a plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”  Warth \nv. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499 (1975).  This limitation serves to “preclude a court from deciding \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 27 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 26 of 82\n‘questions of broad social import in cases in which no individual rights will be vindicated’” and to \nensure that “‘access to the federal courts [is] limited to those litigants best suited to assert the \nclaims.’”  Buchanan v. Consolidated Stores Corp., 125 F. Supp. 2d 730, 738 (D. Md. 2001) \n(quoting Mackey v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 724 F.2d 419, 422 (4th Cir. 1984)).     \nTo establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must satisfy three elements.  Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560. They are, id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted):  \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally \nprotected  interest  which  is  (a)  concrete  and  particularized,  and  (b)  actual  or \nimminent,  not  conjectural  or  hypothetical.  Second,  there  must  be  a  causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be \nfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the \nindependent action of some third party not before the court.  Third, it must be likely, \nas opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.  \n \nSee also Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 168 (2014); Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409; \nFriends of the Earth, Inc., 528 U.S. at 180-81; Overbey, 930 F.3d at 226-27; Sierra Club v.

Obama, 631 F.3d 157, 160 (4th Cir. 2011).   \nTo meet the injury-in-fact requirement, a plaintiff must allege that it “suffered ‘an invasion \nof a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not \nconjectural and hypothetical.’”  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560); \nsee South Carolina, 912 F.3d at 726.  A threatened injury can also satisfy Article III standing, \nalthough “not all threatened injuries constitute an injury-in-fact.”  Beck, 848 F.3d at 271; South \nCarolina, 912 F.3d at 726.   \nThe Fourth Circuit recently explained in Deal, 911 F.3d at 189, that the two concepts—\nactual, ongoing injury or imminent injury—are “disjunctive.”  An “allegation of future injury may \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 28 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 27 of 82\nsuffice if the threatened injury is ‘certainly impending,’ or there is a ‘“substantial risk” that the \nharm will occur.’”  Susan B. Anthony, 573 U.S. at 158 (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414 n.5); see \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 564; South Carolina, 912 F. 3d at 726.  In contrast, “‘[a]llegations of possible \nfuture injury’ are not sufficient.” Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409 (emphasis in original) (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158 (1990)).  This requirement serves “to ensure that the \nalleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes.” Wikimedia Found., 857 F.3d at 208. \nIn some cases, it is enough that there is a “substantial risk” of a harm occurring that \n“prompt[s] plaintiffs to reasonably incur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. \nat 414 n.5.  But, in such a case, the plaintiff cannot rely on an “attenuated chain of inferences” nor \n“on speculation about ‘the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court.’”  \nId. (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562).  Nor can plaintiffs “manufacture standing merely by inflicting \nharm  on  themselves  based  on  their  fears  of  hypothetical  future  harm  that  is  not  certainly \nimpending.”  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416.  “If the law were otherwise, an enterprising plaintiff would \nbe able to secure a lower standard for Article III standing simply by making an expenditure based \non a nonparanoid fear.”  Id.; see, e.g., Wikimedia, 857 F.3d at 216 (“Nor can Plaintiffs establish \nstanding  on  the  ground  that . . . surveillance  compels  them  to  take  burdensome  and  costly \nmeasures.”).   \n“For an injury to be traceable, ‘there must be a causal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of’ by the plaintiff.”  Air Evac EMS, Inc. v. Cheatham, 910 F.3d 751, 760 \n(4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).

Alleged Harms  \nThe City asserts that it has alleged “quintessential injuries-in-fact.”  ECF 25 at 28.  In sum, \nit asserts that allegations of diversion of its resources, increased financial costs to the City, and \nwithdrawal of immigrants and their families from City programs, all due to the revised FAM, \n“satisfy its pleading burden.[]”  Id.   \nThe City alleges that the change to the FAM sows confusion among immigrants and their \nfamilies as to the consequences of accepting public benefits from the City and other levels of \ngovernment, and chills them from pursuing such benefits.  As a result, plaintiff avers that \nimmigrants are taking advantage of fewer public benefits to avoid adverse effects on immigration \ndeterminations.

In addition, the City describes the recent effects of the policy \nchange on the City’s programs.  See, e.g., ECF 1, ¶¶ 143, 144.  And, the City alleges that the \ngovernment has acknowledged that these changes are likely.  It avers: “Research shows that when \neligibility rules change for public benefits programs there is evidence of a ‘chilling effect’ that \ndiscourages immigrants from using public benefits programs for which they are still eligible.”  Id. \n¶ 122 (quoting Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,266 (Oct. 10, \n2018)); see also ECF 1, ¶ 122 (“There may also be additional reductions in transfer payments from \nstates to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in a public benefits \nprogram.” (quoting 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,268)).   \nThe City claims that by inducing immigrants to use fewer public benefits, the changes to \nthe FAM harm the City in three distinct ways.  These contentions are discussed below. \na.   Impeding the City’s Delivery of Social Services to Immigrants \nFirst, the amendments to the FAM allegedly impede the City’s attempts to provide benefits \nand social services to immigrants residing in the City.  ECF 1, ¶¶ 137-55.  Baltimore provides \nsignificant health services, operating specialty clinics in two facilities, and funding of a visiting-\nnurse program, as well as programs targeted at asthma, tuberculosis, childhood lead poisoning, \nand substance abuse.  Id. ¶¶ 141-42.   \nThe City also provides housing benefits and services through three separate entities.  Id. \n¶ 144.  For example, the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development \n                                                 \n \n11 See, e.g., Mitchell H. Katz & Dave A. Chokshi, The “Public Charge” Proposal and \nPublic Health: Implications for Patients and Clinicians, J. Am. Med. Ass’n Viewpoint 3 (Oct. 1, \n2018), https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2705813; Krista M. Perreira et al., A \nNew Threat to Immigrants’ Health – The Public-Charge Rule, 901 New Eng. J. Med. 903, 903 \n(Sept. 12, 2018).   \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 31 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 30 of 82\noperates the Leading Innovation for a Green and Healthy Tomorrow (“LIGHT”) Program, which \nassesses residents and their homes to determine eligibility for over 200 federal, state, and local \nprograms.  According to the City, “LIGHT employees have seen clients come in to start the \napplication process and voice concern over the potential immigration consequences of doing so.”  \nId.  The City also administers and funds housing programs used by immigrants.  Id.  These \nprograms  provide  weatherization  assistance,  energy  conservation  services,  and  lead  hazard \nreduction, as well as financial assistance with down payments and closure costs.  Id. ¶ 145.  Further, \nthe City provides services targeted at the homeless and those at risk for homelessness, including \nimmigrants.  Id.  ¶ 146.    And,  the  City  manages  over  9,000  public  housing  units  in  fifteen \ndevelopments and administers rental assistance programs.  Id. ¶ 147.  \nThe City also provides low-income assistance programs targeted at poverty reduction. Id. \n¶ 148.  This includes a Summer Food Service Program, which it makes available to all minors \nregardless of their immigration status.  Id. ¶ 150.  The City maintains that many of these services \nresemble other services that immigrants are avoiding because of the change to the FAM. Id.; see \nid. ¶¶ 126-27.  As a result, the City concludes that immigrants are likely avoiding the City’s \nprograms as well. Id. ¶ 150.  \nUsing  federal  funds,  Baltimore  operates  Head  Start  programs.    These  programs  are \navailable  to  immigrants,  but  enrollment  “has  decreased,  even  sharply  decreased  among \nimmigrants.”  Id. ¶ 151.  The Complaint asserts that Baltimore’s African immigrant population has \n“virtually ceased” enrollment in the months leading up of to the filing of the Complaint in \nNovember 2018.  Id.  \nBaltimore also subsidizes a litany of other programs that provide services to immigrants.  \nAnd,  the  City’s  SAFE  Cities  Network  subsidizes  legal  assistance  for  immigrants  facing \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 32 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 31 of 82\ndeportations.  Id. ¶ 152.  Although the City presumes that these services are not within the scope \nof the FAM change, it maintains that some immigrants may fear that using these services could \njeopardize their immigration status and therefore decline to use them.  Id. ¶ 154.  \nBut, the City asserts that, “‘[e]ven before the publication of th[e] [DHS] rule, there have \nbeen reports of immigrants avoiding health care for concern of being considered a public charge.’”  \nECF 1, ¶ 143 (quoting Katz & Chokshi, supra n.9).  Accordingly, plaintiff posits that the change \nto the FAM has driven some immigrants not to use health clinics and public services.  ECF 1, \n¶ 143.  \nb.  Forcing the City to Divert Resources \nThe City contends that it must incur significant financial expense to adapt its programs to \nthe policy changes.  Id. ¶¶ 156-61.  The City alleges that it will need to divert resources to analyze \nthe policy change and its effects on the City’s programs.  Id. ¶ 157; see also id. (“Indirect costs . . . \ninclude familiarization with the rule for those entities that are not directly regulated but still want \nto understand the changes in federal and state transfer payments due to this rule familiarization \ncosts, those familiarization costs are a direct cost of the rule.” (quoting 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,260)).  \nIt will then devote additional costs training City employees, as well as the City’s contractors and \npartners.  ECF 1, ¶ 158.  According to the City, the government has acknowledged these costs.  Id. \n(“[local governments] may need to update and rewrite guidance” and “prepare training materials \nand retrain staff,” which “will require staff time and have associated costs” (quoting 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 51,270)).   \nThe City will also allocate additional time and resources to encouraging immigrants to \naccept public benefits that are not within the scope of the FAM change.  ECF 1, ¶ 159. And, it will \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 33 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 32 of 82\nspend still more funds advising immigrants about the potential adverse effects of accepting public \nresources and the uncertainties that remain due to changes to the FAM.  Id. ¶ 161.  \nc.  Imposing Financial Costs on the City \nThe amendments to the FAM shift costs from the federal budget to the City’s budget.  Id. \n¶¶ 162-70.  The City alleges that immigrants may believe that local programs are exempt from \nimmigration consequences, driving increased demand to City programs and draining the City’s \ncoffers.  Id. ¶ 163.  For example, the withdrawal of immigrants from state and federal publicly \nsubsidized health insurance programs, such as Medicaid, could result in a shift to Baltimore’s \npublic clinics for the provision of care to immigrants.  Id. ¶¶ 134-35, 164-65.  Likewise, an \nimmigrant  may  refuse  to  take  federal  nutrition  programs,  like  the  Supplemental  Nutrition \nAssistance Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, instead turning to Baltimore’s Summer Food Service Program or its public school-\nadministered pantries.  Id. ¶ 166. Similarly, an immigrant unwilling to use Section 8 housing \nvouchers may instead rely on the City’s homeless services programs.  Id.  \n Indeed,  the  City  alleges  that  the  government  acknowledged  the  following  possible \nconsequences: falling productivity, vaccination rates, and educational achievement, rising poverty, \nmalnutrition, and communicable diseases.  ECF 1, ¶ 168 (citing 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,270).  Thus, \nthe City asserts that the amendments to FAM will make the City’s immigrants “poorer and less \nhealthy[.]”  ECF 1, ¶ 167.      \n3.  Analysis \nAs noted, defendants contend that plaintiff has not suffered an injury-in-fact as a result of \nthe amendments to the FAM.  Further, they argue that the City’s alleged injuries are not fairly \ntraceable to the FAM. \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 34 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 33 of 82\nThe government places significant weight on the case of Frank Krasner Enterprises, Ltd. \nv. Montgomery Cty., 401 F.3d 230, 235 (4th Cir. 2005).  However, the Frank Krasner Court did \nnot establish that courts could never find standing when the “asserted injury arises from the \ngovernment’s allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else,” only that \ndoing so will be “‘substantially more difficult.’” Id. at 235 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). \n(internal citation omitted). The Fourth Circuit explained: “This is so because, ‘[t]he existence of \none or more of the essential elements of standing depends on the unfettered choices made by \nindependent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the \ncourts cannot presume either to control or to predict.’”  Frank Krasner Enters., 401 F.3d at \n235(emphasis omitted) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562).  \nIn the recent case of Department of Commerce v. New York, __ U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 2551 \n(2019), the Supreme Court confronted the standing arguments the government raises here.  That \ncase involved the Department of Commerce’s plan to ask about citizenship on the 2020 United \nStates Census. Several states, counties, cities, and other entities challenged the change as arbitrary \nand capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. at 2564.  The respondent challengers \nmaintained that the question would result in residents declining to complete the Census, and that \nthis underreporting would, in turn, lead to a host of injuries, including a loss of federal funds for \nstates with a disproportionate share of noncitizen households.  Id. at 2565.   \nThe Department of Commerce contested respondents’ Article III standing on the ground \nthat the alleged harms were not traceable to the Department’s actions but to the independent actions \nof third parties.  Id. at 2565-66.  Indeed, the Department contended that the chain of causation was \nfurther attenuated by the fact that the intervening, third party-actions were unlawful and driven by \n“unfounded fears.”  Id.  The Supreme Court rejected the Department’s argument, concluding that \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 35 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 34 of 82\nrespondents “met their burden of showing that third parties will likely react in predictable ways to \nthe citizenship question, even if they do so unlawfully and despite the requirement that the \nGovernment keep individual answers confidential.”  Id. at 2566 (emphasis added).  As a result, the \nrespondents’ theory of standing “d[id] not rest on mere speculation about the decisions of third \nparties” but “instead on the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third \nparties.”  Id.  \nThe Court’s decision applies here on all fours.  The City alleges that immigrants and their \nfamilies will react in “predictable ways” to the changes in the FAM.  They support this allegation \nwith significant evidence that is consistent with the government’s own statements.  Furthermore, \nthe causal connection is even tighter here.  According to the City, the amendments to FAM were \nintentionally designed to  discourage immigrants  from  using public benefit programs.   This \nexpected behavior is neither speculative nor unlawful. Rather, it is the desired result.  The City’s \n“theory of standing thus does not rest on mere speculation about the decisions of third parties; it \nrelies instead on the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties.”  \nDep’t of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2566.  \nThe government’s other challenges to standing are also without merit.  It maintains that \ncosts incurred by the City for education and outreach are not a cognizable injury because the harm \nis “the result of the City’s own decisions[.]”  ECF 17-1 at 28.  But, the City claims that it is \ncompelled to reallocate its finite resources in response to the FAM for the purpose of combatting \nthe injurious effects that the FAM will have on its residents, and the public programs it administers.  \nECF 1, ¶¶ 156-59, 161, 165-66.  This qualifies as an Article III injury because it “threaten[s] [the \nCity’s] ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.”  Gladstone Realtors \nv.  Vill.  of  Bellwood,  441  U.S.  91,  110-11  (1979);  see  also  Air  Evac  EMS,  910  F.3d  760 \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 36 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 35 of 82\n(“‘[F]inancial harm is a classic and paradigmatic form of injury in fact[.]’”) (citation omitted); \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 150-62 (5th Cir. 2015) (standing to challenge based on cost \nof issuing driver’s licenses to immigrants made eligible by executive action). \nIn a footnote, defendants assert that the City lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights \nof its residents.  ECF 17-1 at 29.  To be sure, the general prohibition against asserting the rights of \nanother is a prudential limitation on standing.  See Warth, 422 U.S. at 498. “To overcome the \nprudential limitation on third-party standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) an injury-in-fact; \n(2) a close relationship between herself and the person whose right she seeks to assert; and (3) a \nhindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.”  Freilich v. Upper \nChesapeake, Health, Inc., 313 F.3d 205, 215 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, \n410-11 (1991)); see also Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114-15 (1976).  Regarding the third \nprong, the obstacles need not be “insurmountable.”  Singleton, 428 U.S. at 117.  Rather, it is enough \nif they engender “some hindrance to the third party’s ability to protect his or her own interests.”  \nPowers, 499 U.S. at 411. \nAt this juncture, the City alleges sufficient facts to clear this prudential hurdle.  See ECF \n1, ¶¶195-97.  First, as discussed, supra, plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement of Article \nIII standing.  Second, the City provides a range of social services to immigrants and others residing \nwithin the City, from health clinics to housing to supplemental food programs to educational \nopportunities.  The City seeks to assert the constitutional rights of immigrants living within the \njurisdiction in order to seek relief from the FAM changes, which it alleges will disrupt the delivery \nof its services, force it to divert precious resources to understanding and explaining the FAM to its \nresidents, and overwhelm its stop-gap services.   \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 37 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 36 of 82\nAnd, the City’s immigrants face significant obstacles in bringing this suit on their own, as \nthey may hold a credible fear that suing the federal government would torpedo the visa application \nof a family member whom they are sponsoring or seek to sponsor.  See Singleton, 428 U.S. at 117 \n(holding that physicians have third-party standing to assert the rights of abortion patients because \nthose women “may be chilled from . . . assert[ing] [their rights] by a desire to protect the very \nprivacy of [their] decision from the publicity of a court suit”); Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc. \nv. Pence, 165 F. Supp. 3d 718, 732-33 (S.D. Ind. 2016) (finding organization had third-party \nstanding to assert constitutional rights of Syrian refugees due to an understandable desire to “lay-\nlow and not draw the attention to themselves that this suit would necessarily bring”), aff’d, 838 \nF.3d 902 (7th Cir. 2016).   \nIn short,  the City satisfies the requirements  of Article  III standing  to challenge the \namendments to the FAM.  \nB.  Standing to Sue the President \nDefendants aver that the City does not have standing to sue President Trump in his official \ncapacity.  ECF 17-1 at 30-31.  They assert that because the FAM “was issued by and is used by \nthe Department of State, not by the President,” any injury that the City suffers “‘is not fairly \ntraceable’ to the President.”  Id. at 31.  The City responds that it has standing to sue the President \nunder the Due Process Clause, because the Complaint plausibly alleges that the President’s animus \nwas a motivating factor that led to the amendments to the FAM.  ECF 25 at 36-37.  .  \nThe City must establish Article III standing for each claim against each defendant.  See, \ne.g., Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 371 (4th Cir. 2014).  As defendants correctly point out (ECF \n17-1 at 49), the President is not amenable to suit under the APA as he is not an “agency.”  See \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 38 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 37 of 82\nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-01 (1992) (plurality opinion).  Thus, the inquiry \nfocuses on whether the City has standing to bring its equal protection claim against the President.  \nThe City alleges that the President harbors animus towards immigrants of color.  See ECF \n1 at 25-31, 72.  In this regard, the Complaint alleges that President Trump made repeated \nstatements that, accepted as true, exhibit hostility towards immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin \nAmerica.  Those statements include his remark that immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS”; his \nsuggestion that Nigerian immigrants, if admitted to the United States, would never “go back to \ntheir huts”; and his comment that immigrants from Africa and Latin America are “people from \nshithole countries[.]”  Id. ¶¶ 69-70.   \nIn addition, the Complaint plausibly alleges, at least by inference, that President Trump \ndeliberately manipulated the State Department to revise the FAM.  According to the Complaint, \nin the weeks following the President’s inauguration, high-ranking executive branch officials \ndrafted an executive order directing the State Department “to amend the Foreign Affairs Manual \nto ensure that its public-charge provisions are consistent with the goals of this Order.”  Id. ¶ 77 \n(quoting  Andrew  Bremberg,  Memorandum  for  the  President,  Subject:  Executive  Order  on \nProtecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote Accountability and \nResponsibility (Jan. 23, 2017)).  Although the draft order was never finalized, plaintiff contends \nthat the State Department got the message because, approximately a year after the draft order, it \nbroadened the FAM’s definition of public charge.  ECF 1, ¶ 92.  Thus, the City has plausibly \nalleged that President Trump’s racial animus inspired the FAM revision.  Consequently, the \ninjuries that the City alleges are fairly traceable to the President.  \nI am not persuaded by defendants’ argument that plaintiff lacks standing to sue the \nPresident because the State Department, not the President, revised the FAM.  “Our Constitution \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 39 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 38 of 82\nvests ‘executive Power’ in the President, not in the Secretary of [State], who reports to the \nPresident and is removable by him at will.”  Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. Supp. 3d 260, 279 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting U.S. Const., art. II, § 1, cl. 1).  In other words, the buck stops with the \nPresident.  Consequently, if President Trump harbors animus towards immigrants of color, and if \nhe encouraged the State Department to revise the FAM, then the amendments violate equal \nprotection, even if officials within the State Department did not personally harbor racial animus.   \nIndeed, other courts have found that plaintiffs had plausibly stated an equal protection \nclaim against an executive agency’s immigration action based on the same statements by President \nTrump that are alleged here.  See NAACP v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 364 F. Supp. 3d 568, \n578 (D. Md. 2019) (concluding that President Trump’s statements were sufficient to plausibly \nalleged that DHS’s decision to rescind immigrants’ temporary protected status violated equal \nprotection); Saget v. Trump, 345 F. Supp. 3d 287, 303 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (same); Ramos v. Nielsen, \n321 F. Supp. 3d 1083, 1123-24 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (same); Batalla, 291 F. Supp. 3d at 279 (holding \nthat plaintiff had plausibly alleged that DHS’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals policy violated equal protection based on the President’s statements).  \nThe issue is presented in the context of a motion to dismiss.  The City’s Complaint alleges \nfacts sufficient to nudge from conceivable to plausible the allegation that the President harbors \nracial animus and that he played a role in the creation of the FAM amendments.  I conclude that \nthe City has standing to advance its equal protection claim against the President.  \nC.  Ripeness  \nAs with standing, the ripeness doctrine is “drawn both from Article III limitations on \njudicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction . . . .” Nat’l Park \nHospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 40 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 39 of 82\nsee Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 632 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (ripeness “has both \nconstitutional and prudential facets”), cert. denied, __, U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 978 (2018).  Whereas \nstanding  focuses  on  who  can  sue,  ripeness  “addresses  ‘the  appropriate  timing  of  judicial \nintervention.’”  Deal, 911 F.3d at 190 (quoting Cooksey v. Futrell, 721 F.3d 226, 240 (4th Cir. \n2013)); see NAACP, 2019 WL 355743, at *8 (noting that standing addresses who may sue, and \nripeness addresses when a party may sue). \n“Like standing, the ripeness doctrine ‘originates in the case or controversy constraint of \nArticle III.’”  South Carolina, 912 F.3d at 730 (citation omitted) (cleaned up).  And, “[a]s with \nstanding, ripeness is a question of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Id.; see San Sotta v. Town of Nags \nHead, 724 F.3d 533, 548 (4th Cir. 2013).  Moreover, the doctrine of ripeness requires presentation \nof “a controversy in a ‘clean-cut and concrete form.’”  Id. (quoting Miller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, \n318-19 (4th Cir. 2006)).  In so doing, the doctrine “prevent[s] the courts, through avoidance of \npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative \npolicies, and . . . protect[s] the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision \nhas been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.”  Ohio \nForestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732-33 (1998) (citations omitted). \nRipeness depends on “(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship \nto the parties of withholding court consideration.”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808; accord \nSouth Carolina, 912 F.3d at 730; Deal, 911 F.3d at 191.  “A case is ‘fit for judicial decision when \nthe issues are purely legal and when the action in controversy is final and not dependent on future \nuncertainties.’”    Lansdowne  on  the  Potomac  Homeowners  Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  OpenBand  and \nLansdowne, LLC, 713 F.3d 187, 198 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Miller, 462 F.3d at 318-19).  “‘The \nhardship prong is measured by the immediacy of the threat and the burden imposed on the \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 41 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 40 of 82\nplaintiff.’”  Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Charter Fed. Sav. Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, \n976 F.2d 203, 208 (4th Cir. 1992)); see also Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 317 (4th Cir. 2013); \nArch Mineral Corp. v. Babbitt, 104 F.3d 660, 665 (4th Cir. 1997).   \nThus, a claim is not ripe for judicial review “‘if it rests upon contingent future events that \nmay not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.’”  Scoggins, 718 F.3d at 270 (quoting \nTexas v. United States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998)); see also South Carolina, 912 F.3d at 730 (an \naction is ripe if “final and not dependent on future uncertainties or intervening agency rulings”) \n(quoting Franks v. Ross, 313 F.3d 184, 195 (4th Cir. 2002)).  \nThe government contends that the City’s claims are not ripe because the City “has not \nidentified any particular instance in which the guidance has been applied in a way that threatens \nharm to the City.”  ECF 17-1 at 30.  Further, they maintain that the City is not harmed by the FAM \nbecause it “has never been applied to the City of Baltimore and it will never be—a city is obviously \nnever in the position of applying for a U.S. visa.”  Id.  In response, the City argues that the bulk of \nthe issues are “purely legal,” and the City is already suffering from the FAM change.  ECF 25 at \n36.  According to the City, it has presented “ample evidence that the application of the FAM \nchange produces a chilling effect that harms the city.”  Id.  \nDefendants’ ripeness argument is without merit.  The City’s claims satisfy the fitness \ncriterion.  Its APA claims—whether the FAM change is “arbitrary and capricious,” impermissibly \nretroactive, or procedurally invalid—present purely legal questions.  And, postponing review is \nunnecessary for the City’s equal protection claim to crystallize into a more definite form, given \nthat the City rests its claim primarily on the President’s statements. \nAs for the hardship prong, delayed review would cause the City significant hardship.  The \nFAM change is “final and not dependent on future uncertainties.”  South Carolina, 912 F.3d at \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 42 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 41 of 82\n730; see also infra Part IV.C.  And, as discussed, supra, the City has plausibly alleged that it is \nsuffering substantial harm due to the FAM change.  See Part III.A(2), supra.   \nThe government’s contention that the City will “never [be] in the position of applying for \na U.S. visa” and therefore experiences no hardship is not persuasive.  ECF 25 at 35.  The primary \ninjury alleged by the City is not that it fears being deemed a public charge.  Rather, it is that the \nCity must bear the financial costs of the defendants’ unlawful action.  To repeat, the City alleges \nthat the revised Manual frustrates the City’s efforts to provide social services to immigrants; forces \nthe City to divert valuable resources to understanding the changes and conducting education and \noutreach; and strains the City’s budget by increasing the demand for certain City benefits like \nemergency health care.  See ECF 1 at 53-68.  Postponing review will only exacerbate these harms.    \nAccordingly, I find that the City’s claims are ripe for judicial review.  \nIV.  APA Claims \nDefendants put forth a smorgasbord of arguments for why the City’s claims are not \ncognizable under the APA.  ECF 17-1 at 32-44.  They argue that the City has failed to state a claim \nunder the APA because the FAM change is committed to agency discretion, the City does not fall \nwithin the INA’s zone of interests, and the FAM change is not a final agency action.  Id. at 33-41.  \nIn addition, defendants posit that Count Two should be dismissed, as the Manual’s changes are not \nretroactive.  Id. at 42-44.  Defendants also move to dismiss Count Three, asserting that the FAM \nis not subject to notice and comment.  Id. at 41-42. \nA.  Background  \nThe APA provides for judicial review of a final agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 702 (“A person \nsuffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency \naction within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”).  See Abbott \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 43 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 42 of 82\nLabs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140-41, (1967) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704); see also Ergon-W. Va., \nInc. v. EPA, 896 F.3d 600, 609 (4th Cir. 2018); Roland v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \n850 F.3d 625, 629 n.3 (4th Cir. 2017); Friends of Back Bay v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 681 \nF.3d 581, 586 (4th Cir. 2012).   \n “The APA provides that a reviewing court is bound to ‘hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction’  for  certain  specified  reasons,  including  whenever  the  challenged  act  is  ‘arbitrary, \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”  Friends of Back \nBay, 681 F.3d at 586-87 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)); see United States v. Bean, 537 U.S. 71, \n77 (2002).  Review under the APA is highly deferential, however, and the agency action enjoys a \npresumption of validity.  Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co., 556 F.3d 177, 192 (4th \nCir. 2009) (citing Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, 16 F.3d 1395, 1400 (4th Cir. 1993)).   \nIn assessing an agency decision, “the reviewing court ‘must consider whether the decision \nwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of \njudgment.’”  Marsh v. Or. Nat. Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989) (quoting Citizens to \nPreserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971)).  But, the court “is not to substitute \nits judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  And, while the arbitrary and capricious standard “is not \nmeant to reduce judicial review to a rubber-stamp of agency action,” Ohio Valley Entl. Coal., 556 \nF.3d at 192 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), so long as the agency “‘provide[s] an \nexplanation of its decision that includes a rational connection between the facts found and the \nchoice made,’ its decision should be sustained.”  Perez v. Cissna, 914 F.3d 846, 855 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Ohio Valley Envtl. Coal., 556 F.3d at 192); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 44 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 43 of 82\n463 U.S. at 43, (noting that a court should “uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the \nagency’s path may reasonably be discerned”).  \nIn addition, the APA mandates that, subject to limited exceptions, agencies comply with \ncertain procedures before issuing a rule.  5 U.S.C. § 553; N.C. Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. v. United Farm \nWorkers, 702 F.3d 755, 763 (4th Cir. 2012); Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n v. Block, 755 F.2d 1098, 1103 \n(4th Cir.1985). Under the APA, a rule is “the whole or party of an agency statement of general or \nparticular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or \npolicy[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).  \nGenerally stated, the APA’s rulemaking provisions require that the agency publish a notice \nof proposed rule-making in the Federal Register; permit interested parties the opportunity to \ncomment on the proposed rule; and, after considering the submitted comments, issue a concise \ngeneral statement of the rule’s purpose along with the final rule.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (c); N.C. \nGrowers’ Ass’n, Inc., 702 F.3d at 763.  The notice and comment procedures serve both to “ensure \ninformed agency decisionmaking” and to “encourage public participation in the administrative \nprocess.”  N.C. Growers’ Ass’n, Inc., 702 F.3d at 763 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  Although review of an agency’s decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard is \ndeferential, the Fourth Circuit has instructed that courts “‘must be strict in reviewing an agency’s \ncompliance with procedural rules.’”  Id. at 764 (quoting Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n, 755 F.2d at 1103). \nB.  Reviewability  \nThe government maintains that executive immigration policies cannot be challenged under \nthe APA, absent express statutory authorization.  ECF 17-1 at 33-34.  According to defendants, \nthe City’s APA claims must fail “because the Supreme Court ‘ha[s] long recognized the power . . . \nto exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 45 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 44 of 82\ndepartments largely immune from judicial control.’”  Id. at 33 (quoting Fiallo ex rel. Rodriguez v. \nBell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977)).12  \n“[T]here is a ‘strong presumption’ in favor of judicial review of agency action.”  Casa de \nMaryland v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 924 F.3d 684, 697 (4th Cir. 2019) (quoting Speed \nMining, Inc. v. Fed Mine Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 528 F.3d 310, 316 (4th Cir. 2008), \npetition for cert. filed (U.S. May 24, 2019) (No. 18-1469); see Ergon-W. Virginia, Inc., 896 F.3d \nat 609; Roland, 850 F.3d at 629 n.3.  As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, the APA \n“creates a ‘basic presumption of judicial review for one ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency \naction.’”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., __ U.S. __, __, 139 S. Ct. 361, 370 \n(2018) (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 140); see also Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. \n__, __, 135 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2015); Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 190 (1993).  \nHowever, judicial review is not available “to the extent that . . . statutes preclude judicial \nreview,” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), or “agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  Id. \n§ 701(a)(2).  The latter exception is read “quite narrowly.”  Weyerhaeuser Co., 139 S. Ct. at 370; \naccord Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, 401 U.S. at 410.  This applies “in those rare instances \nwhere ‘statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.’”  Id. \n(quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191); see also Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985) (judicial \nreview is unavailable if the statute provides “no judicially manageable standards . . . for judging \nhow and when an agency should exercise its discretion”); see also Speed Mining, Inc., 528 F.3d at \n317.  “In determining whether a ‘meaningful standard’ for reviewing agency discretion exists, \n                                                 \n12  Defendants  do  not  contend  that  §  702  precludes  judicial  review  of  plaintiff’s \nconstitutional claim.  Nor could they, as “it is well settled that even if agency action is committed \nto its discretion by law, a court may still determine whether the action is constitutional.”  Inova \nAlexandria Hosp. v. Shalala, 244 F.3d 342, 347 (4th Cir. 2001).  \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 46 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 45 of 82\ncourts consider the particular language and overall structure of the statute in question, as well as \n‘the nature of the administrative action at issue.’”  Speed Mining, Inc., 528 F.3d at 317 (internal \ncitations omitted) (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830 and Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, 70 (D.C. Cir. \n2002)).  \nDefendants do not specify which provision of § 701 they believe precludes plaintiff’s APA \nclaims.  See ECF 17-1 at 33-34.  But this is of no moment, because neither applies to this case. \nFirst,  the  APA  specifies  procedures  that  agencies  must  follow  when  engaging  in \n“substantive” or “legislative” rulemaking.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 604.  Therefore, the Court can \nreview the process by which defendants promulgated the amended Manual in light of the APA’s \nprocedural requirements.  See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 195-98.  Second, the INA provides a meaningful \nstandard against which to assess whether the FAM change is arbitrary and capricious.  In sum, \n§ 701(a)(1) does not bar the City’s APA claims. \nMoreover, defendants have not identified any statutory authority for their argument.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(1).  Rather, they seem to argue that the Manual is immune from judicial scrutiny \nsimply because it bears on immigration policy.  See ECF 17-1 at 33.   \nTo  be  sure,  significant  deference  is  due  to  foreign  affairs  and  immigration  policy \ndeterminations made by the Executive Branch.  See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, __ U.S. __, __, 138 S. \nCt. 2392, 2419 (2018) (“For more than a century, this Court has recognized that the admission and \nexclusion of foreign nationals is a ‘fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s \npolitical departments largely immune from judicial control.’”) (quoting Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. \n787 (1977)); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 33-34 (2010); Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 588-589 (1952).  However, “the Supreme Court has repeatedly and \nexplicitly  rejected  the  notion  that  the  political  branches  have  unreviewable  authority  over \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 47 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 46 of 82\nimmigration . . . .”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162 (9th Cir. 2017), superseded by 858 \nF.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2017); see also Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 883 F.3d 233, 278 \n(4th Cir. 2018) (Gregory, C.J., concurring) (“No case from either this Court or the Supreme Court \nsupports [the] sweeping proposition” that courts may not review “statutory challenge[s] to the \nPresident’s authority to exclude classes of noncitizens”), vacated on other grounds, __ U.S. __, \n138 S. Ct. 2710 (2018); Batalla Vidal v. Duke, 295 F. Supp. 3d 127, 151-52 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) \n(rejecting  government’s  contention  that  § 702(a)(2)  barred  review  of  Deferred  Action  for \nChildhood Arrivals policy); see also Casa de Maryland, 924 F.3d at 699 (citing cases).  Indeed, a \nbrief survey of the Supreme Court’s immigration cases reveals that the Court regularly reaches the \nmerits of a plaintiff’s statutory claims.  See, e.g., Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2407 (reviewing plaintiffs’ \nstatutory claims lodged against President Trump’s so-called Travel Ban); Sale v. Haitian Centers \nCouncil, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 170-88 (1993); Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 800.  \nDefendants lean heavily on Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977), for the proposition that \nchanges to the Manual are unreviewable under the APA due to the Executive’s broad discretion to \nenforce the immigration laws.  ECF 17-1 at 33.  But, in my view, Fiallo cuts in favor of the City.   \nIn Fiallo, three sets of fathers and children attacked the constitutionality of an INA \nprovision that extended “special preference” to natural fathers of legitimate U.S. citizen children \nbut not the fathers of “illegitimate” children.  Id. at 788-89.  After recounting the facts, the Court \nstated, id. at 792 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted): \nAt the outset, it is important to underscore the limited scope of judicial \ninquiry into immigration legislation. This Court has repeatedly emphasized that \nover no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete \nthan it is over the admission of aliens.  Our cases have long recognized the power \nto expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the \nGovernment's political departments largely immune from judicial control.   \n  \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 48 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 47 of 82\nThis statement is consistent with the longstanding principle that courts may not review \nindividual immigration determinations.  See, e.g., Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, \n1159 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (courts lack jurisdiction to review a consular officer’s decision to grant or \ndeny a visa).  However, it does not mean, as defendants would have it, that any agency policy \ntouching immigration escapes judicial review.  That much is confirmed by the fact that the Fiallo \nCourt proceeded to resolve the merits of the plaintiff’s claims.  See 430 U.S. at 800.  Thus, Fiallo \nreinforces that the federal judiciary retains the authority to review challenges to executive action \nin the immigration sphere.  \n  Accordingly, § 701(a) does not compel the dismissal of plaintiff’s APA claims.  \nC.  Zone of Interests  \nDefendants argue that the City’s APA claims fail because they fall outside the “zone of \ninterests” protected by the INA.  ECF 17-1 at 34-35.  According to the government, the City’s \ninterest in this litigation is its “desire to ensure that its residents take advantage of available social \nservices when needed.”  Id. at 35.   In their view, the INA does not “protect or even consider \ninterests of this type.”  Id.    \nThe zone-of-interests test asks “whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action \nthat he asserts.”  Bank of Am. Corp., 137 S. Ct. at 1303; see Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 134 S. Ct. at 1387 \n(“Whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests” turns on “whether a legislatively \nconferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)).  Where the plaintiff asserts a cause of action under the APA, the inquiry focuses on the \nrelevant zone of interest defined by the substantive statute, not the APA.  See Block v. Cmty. \nNutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 345-48 (1984); Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1017 (D.C. Cir. \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 49 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 48 of 82\n2014); Am. Inst. of Certified Pub. Accountants v. IRS, 746 F. App’x. 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(collecting cases).   \nThe “zone-of-interests limitation” applies to “all statutorily created causes of action.” \nLexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014); see also Bank of \nAm. Corp. v. City of Miami, __ U.S. __, __, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1303 (2017).  However, unlike \nstanding and ripeness, the test is not jurisdictional because “‘the absence of a valid . . . cause of \naction does not implicate . . . the court’s statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.’”  \nLexmark Int’l, Inc., 527 U.S. at 128 (emphasis in original) (quoting Verizon Md. Inc. v. Pub. Serv. \nComm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 642-43 (2002)).  \nMoreover, the zone-of-interests test “is not meant to be especially demanding.”  Match-E-\nBe-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quoting \nClarke v. Sec. Industry Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)).  This is especially so where the plaintiff \nfiles suit under the APA, given “Congress’s ‘evident intent’ when enacting the APA ‘to make \nagency action presumptively reviewable.’”  Id.  (quoting id.).  To that end, the plaintiff need only \ndemonstrate that its interests “arguably” fall within the statute’s purpose, with “the benefit of any \ndoubt go[ing] to the plaintiff.”  Id.  Further, courts “do not require any indication of congressional \npurpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.”  Id.  Thus, the rule “forecloses suit only when a \nplaintiff's ‘interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’”  Id. \n(quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399). \nTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided court, __ \nU.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (mem.), is instructive on this point.  Texas filed suit against the \nfederal government under the APA to enjoin the implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 50 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 49 of 82\nof Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program (“DAPA”), an executive action to delay \nthe deportation of immigrants who lacked lawful residency status.  Id. at 148.  Texas asserted that \nit satisfied prudential standing to challenge DAPA because, under Texas law, DAPA recipients \nwould be entitled to obtain a state-subsidized driver’s license.  Id. at 149-50.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed.  Id. at 163.  It observed that the INA “[r]eflect[s] a concern that ‘aliens have been applying \nfor  and  receiving  public  benefits  from  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments  at  increasing \nrates . . . .’”  Id. at 163 (quoting United States v. Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1298 (11th Cir. 2012)).   \nThe  Fifth  Circuit  pointed  out  that  8  U.S.C.  § 1621(a)  prohibits  unlawfully  present \nimmigrants from receiving state or local benefits, including driver’s licenses.  Id.  Texas’s claim \nthus fell within the INA’s zone of interest, because it was asserting its right to “participate in notice \nand comment before the Secretary changes the immigration classification of millions of illegal \naliens in a way that forces the state to the Hobson’s choice of spending millions of dollars to \nsubsidize driver’s licenses or changing its statutes.”  Id.   \nHere, the City’s interest in avoiding the costs of the FAM revision falls within the INA’s \nzone of interest.  As the Fifth Circuit observed, the INA expressly regulates the use of public \nassistance by immigrants.  Section 1621 provides that immigrants who lack lawful status are “not \neligible for any State or local public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  And, § 1621(c) clarifies that \n“State or local public benefit” encompasses “any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or \nassisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other \nsimilar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or \nfamily eligibility unit by an agency of a State or local government or by appropriated funds of a \nState or local government.”  Id. § 1621(c)(B) (emphasis added).  Moreover, the INA’s public \ncharge provision accounts for the impact public charge determinations may have on municipal \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 51 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 50 of 82\ngovernments.  Specifically, § 1183 entitles “the proper law officers” of “any State, territory, \ndistrict, county, town, or municipality in which [an] alien becomes a public charge” to bring a \nlawsuit against the individual who sponsored the alien’s visa to enforce the Affidavit of Support.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1183.   \nAnd, like Texas, the City seeks to vindicate its interest in having the opportunity to \n“participate in notice and comment before [defendants] change[d] the immigration classification \nof millions of [immigrants] in a way that forces the [City] to the Hobson’s choice of spending \nmillions of dollars . . . or changing its [services].”  809 F.3d at 163.  Thus, the City’s claims “are, \nat the least, ‘arguably within the zone of interests’” protected by the INA.  Bank of Am., 137 S. Ct. \nat 1303 (citation omitted).  \nD.  Finality \nDefendants maintain that the City has failed to state a claim because the revision to the \nManual is not a “final agency action” and “therefore is not reviewable under the APA.”  ECF 17-\n1 at 36. \nThe APA limits judicial review to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704; see also City of New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 913 F.3d \n423, 430-31 (4th Cir. 2019); Clear Sky Car Wash LLC v. City of Chesapeake, 743 F.3d 438, 445 \n(4th Cir. 2014); Golden & Zimmerman LLC v. Domenech, 599 F.3d 426, 432-33 (4th Cir. 2010).  \nUnder Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997), an agency action is final if it (1) “‘mark[s] the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process’” and (2) is an action “‘by which rights or \nobligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.’”  U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. ___, ___, 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813 (2016) (quoting \nBennett v, 520 U.S. at 177-78).   \n50 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 52 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 51 of 82\n“The core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process, and \nwhether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.”  Massachusetts v. \nFranklin, 505 U.S. 788, 797 (1992) (plurality opinion); see Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative \nStabilization Corp. v. EPA, 313 F.3d 852, 858 (4th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he critical issue is whether the \n[agency’s  action  gives  rise  to  legal  consequences,  rights,  or  obligations.”).    Courts  take  a \n“‘pragmatic’ approach . . . to finality.”  Hawkes, 136 S. Ct. at 1815 (quoting Abbott Labs. v. \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). \nThe government does not contest that the revision to FAM satisfies the first Bennett prong, \nand for good reason.  The FAM is not “informal, or only the ruling of a subordinate official, or \ntentative.”  Abbott Labs, 387 U.S. at 151.  Rather, it is the State Department’s “authoritative \nsource” on “policies[] and procedures,” including consular processing.  Foreign Affairs Manual \nand Handbook, U.S. Dep’t of State, http://fam.state.gov/.  The Manual is the State Department’s \nlast  word  on  the  criteria  consular  officers  should  consider  when  making  public  charge \ndeterminations.  Accordingly, the FAM “mark[s] the consummation of the [State Department’s] \ndecisionmaking process.”  Hawkes, 136 S. Ct. at 1813.     \nThe parties dispute, however, whether the amendments to the FAM have “‘direct and \nappreciable legal consequences.’”  Id. at 1814 (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178).  The government \nmaintains that the change to the Manual “does not have any legal effect of its own” because “it \nonly  instructs  Department  of  State  personnel  on  how  to  apply  the  governing  statute  and \nregulations.”  ECF 17-1 at 36.  Yet, the government concedes that the “new guidance, compared \nto the old guidance, could potentially lead to individuals being denied visas on ‘public charge’ \ngrounds more frequently.”  Id. at 41.  Nevertheless, it contends that this fact alone does not render \nthe revision to the Manual a final agency action.  Id.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 53 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 52 of 82\nThe  City  counters  that  the  amendments  to  the  FAM  have  legal  force  because  they \neliminated a safe harbor for visa applicants and their families by directing consular officers to \nconsider non-cash benefits in making public charge determinations.  ECF 25 at 40.   \nAgency action has legal consequences if it “alters the legal regime[.]”  Bennett, 520 U.S. \nat 178; see also Hawkes, 136 S. Ct. 1814; Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, 320 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  So too does action that grants or withdraws a regulatory “safe harbor.”  Hawkes, 136 \nS. Ct. 1814; Frozen Food Express v. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44-45 (1956); Scenic Am., Inc. v. \nDep’t of Transp., 836 F.3d 42, 56 (D.C. Cir. 2016), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 2 (2017); \nRhea Lana, Inc. v. Dep’t of Labor, 824 F.3d 1023, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2016); Dow AgroSciences LLC \nv. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 637 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir. 2011); Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 290 \nF.3d 384, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nThe Supreme Court’s analysis in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., ___ U.S. \n___, 136 S. Ct. 1807 (2016), is instructive.  There, the Court considered whether “jurisdictional \ndeterminations” made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regarding whether a particular tract \nof land contains “waters of the United States,” and thus subject to the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), \nwere final agency actions.  See id. at 1812-13.  The Court found that the determinations satisfied \nthe second Bennett prong because legal consequences flow from both negative and affirmative \ndeterminations.  Id. at 1814.  If the Army Corps concludes that a parcel does not contain such \nwaters, that finding creates a “safe harbor,” precluding the Army Corps and EPA from bringing an \nenforcement action under the CWA against the property owner for five years.  Id.  Moreover, while \na negative determination does not foreclose the possibility of citizen suits under the CWA, the \nproperty owner cannot be held liable for past violations.  Id.  Thus, a negative finding “both \nnarrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the potential liability a landowner faces for \n52 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 54 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 53 of 82\ndischarging pollutants without a permit. Each of those effects is a ‘legal consequence’ satisfying \nthe second Bennett prong.”  Id. (brackets omitted).  Affirmative determinations “have legal \nconsequences as well: They represent the denial of the safe harbor that negative [determinations] \nafford.”  Id.   \nThe revisions to the FAM alter the visa application regime by eliminating, in effect, a safe \nharbor once extended to the receipt of non-cash benefits.  Previously, the Manual directed that \n“[n]either the past nor possible future receipt of such non-cash or supplemental assistance may be \nconsidered in determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge.”  ECF 17-2 at 4.  \nAnd, it barred consular officers from denying a visa application on public charge grounds due to \nthe current or past use of non-cash public assistance by the applicant’s family.  Id. at 11.                                               \nIn no uncertain terms, the new version of the Manual reverses this position.   \nAccording to the new version of the FAM, consular officers should consider the past and \nfuture  use  of  non-cash  benefits  by  the  applicant  as  “part  of  the  totality  of  the  applicant’s \ncircumstances in determining whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge.”  ECF 1-1 \nat 5.  Moreover, the FAM now requires consular officers to examine the use of non-cash public \nbenefits by the applicant’s family members and dictates that this is a “heavily negative factor” in \nthe analysis.  Id. at 8-9.  Thus, it is no longer the case that visa applicants and their families can \nuse non-cash public assistance without the possibility of being deemed a public charge.      \nThe government argues that this safe harbor was illusory.  ECF 56 at 20.  According to the \ngovernment, applicants “who accepted noncash public benefits never had any assurances that they \nwould not be denied visas on public-charge grounds.”  Id.  In their view, because an applicant \nreceiving non-cash public benefits could have been deemed a public charge based on some other \nconsideration, such as health or financial condition, the change is of no legal significance.  Id.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 55 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 54 of 82\nThis contention misses the mark.  The fact that consular officers can deny visa applications \nfor reasons other than the receipt of non-cash benefits does not rob the FAM change of legal \nconsequences.  Rather, as Hawkes demonstrates, agency action has legal consequences even if it \nonly “narrows” the field of regulatory targets or “limits the[ir] potential liability[.]”  Hawkes, 136 \nS. Ct. at 1814; see also Texas v. EEOC, No. 18-10638, slip op. at 12-13 (5th Cir. Aug. 6, 2019) \n(finding EEOC guidance letter to be final agency action because it creates a safe harbor by detailing \nhow employers can avoid liability). \nThe amendments to the FAM bear the hallmarks of finality.  In particular, they present the \n“authoritative” position of the State Department on the public charge rule; they alter a legal regime; \nand they eliminate a safe harbor relied on by visa applicants and their families.  It follows that \ndefendants’ Motion, seeking dismissal of the City’s APA claims under § 704, is unavailing on this \nbasis. \nDefendants further assert that the FAM is not a “final agency action” because it is an \ninterpretive rule.  See ECF 17-1 at 37-41.  This argument elides § 704’s finality requirement with \n§ 553’s command that agencies provide notice and comment before promulgating legislative rules.  \nI discuss interpretive and legislative rules, infra.  But, I note here that the D.C. Circuit \nrecently explained: “[A]lthough all legislative rules are final, not all final rules are legislative, and \nthe finality analysis is therefore distinct from the test for whether an agency action is a legislative \nrule.” Cal. Comtys. Against Toxics v. EPA, 934 F.3d 627, 631 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 20, 2019); see also \nid. (observing that the Hawkes Court “neither asked whether the action at issue had the force and \neffect of law nor made a single mention of legislative rules”).  The Manual’s legislative character \n(or lack thereof) is therefore inapposite to the finality inquiry.   \n \n54 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 56 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 55 of 82\nE.  Retroactivity  \n  The revised FAM directs consular officers to consider an immigrant’s use of non-cash \nbenefits at any time as a factor in visa determinations.  This directive is not limited to an \nimmigrant’s current or future use of non-cash public benefits; the officer also must consider the \nuse  of  non-cash  benefits,  even  if  that  use  occurred  before  the  changes  to  the  FAM  were \nimplemented.   \nDefendants have moved (ECF 17-1 at 42-44) to dismiss Count Two of the Complaint, \nwhich alleges that the amendments to the FAM have an impermissible retroactive effect, in \nviolation of the APA.  ECF 1 at 71.  The government argues that the City has not plausibly raised \nthis claim, insisting that the amended FAM does not attach new legal consequences to past events.  \nECF 17-1 at 42-44.  Instead, it allows past events to be considered as a factor in future visa \ndeterminations.   \nThe City disagrees.  It maintains that it sufficiently alleged that the changes to the FAM \nare impermissibly retroactive.  ECF 25 at 49-51.  Further, it contends that such a retroactive change \nmust be authorized by statute.  Moreover, even if it were authorized, it would be unjustified, \naccording to the City. \n“Retroactivity is not favored in the law.”  Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. \n204, 208 (1988).  The “core principle disfavoring retroactive application of laws” is that “‘settled \nexpectations should not be lightly disrupted[.]’”  GTE S., Inc. v. Morrison, 199 F.3d 733, 741 (4th \nCir. 1999) (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 265).  The APA provides that a rule must be of “future \neffect.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).  Therefore, “a statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will \nnot, as a general matter, be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules \nunless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms.”  Bowen, 488 U.S. at 208.  This \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 57 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 56 of 82\nprohibition applies to “interpretative rules, no less than legislative rules.” Health Ins. Ass’n of Am., \nInc. v. Shalala, 23 F.3d 412, 423 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  \nA rule is impermissibly retroactive if it “‘alter[s] the past legal consequences of past \nactions.’” Celtronix Telemetry, Inc. v. FCC, 272 F.3d 585, 588 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting Bowen, \n488 U.S. at 219 (Scalia, J., concurring)); see also Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 269-70.  Specifically, a \nrule may not “impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party’s liability for past \nconduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.” Landgraf, 511 U.S. \nat 280.   \nIf  a  rule  has  an  “exclusively  ‘future  effect’”  that  “affect[s]  the  desirability  of  past \ntransactions,” it is considered “secondarily retroactive” and is “invalid only if arbitrary and \ncapricious.”  Celtronix Telemetry, 272 F.3d at 589; see Nat’l Petrochemical & Refiners Ass’n v. \nEPA, 630 F.3d 145, 159 (D.C. Cir. 2010); see also Nat’l Petrochemical & Refiners Ass’n, 630 \nF.3d at 159 (describing rules that “merely ‘upset[] expectations’” as “secondarily retroactive”).  A \nsecondarily  retroactive  rule  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  if  a  court  determines  that  it  is  not \n“reasonable both in substance and in being made retroactive.”  Celtronix Telemetry, Inc., 272 F.3d \nat 589. \nThe government rests its argument primarily on Boniface v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n613 F.3d 282 (D.C. Cir. 2010), and Matherly v. Andrews, 817 F.3d 115 (4th Cir. 2016).  In \nBoniface, the court considered a regulation directing DHS to consider past criminal acts to \ndetermine eligibility for a license to transport hazardous materials.  A state can grant a “‘license to \noperate a motor vehicle transporting in commerce hazardous materials’” only if the TSA has \ndetermined that the applicant is not a security threat.  Id. at 284 (quoting 49 C.F.R. §§ 5103a(a)(1)).  \nThe challenged rule provided a list of “disqualifying criminal offense[s].” If an applicant has been \n56 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 58 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 57 of 82\nconvicted of a disqualifying offense, then the TSA issues an initial determination that the applicant \nis a “‘security threat warranting denial’” of his application.  However, this initial determination \ncould be rebutted through a waiver process.   \nAfter  Bonifice  was  denied  a  license  in  2009  because  of  a  1975  conviction  for  a \n“disqualifying criminal offense,” he challenged the rule.  The court found that a “disqualifying \ncriminal offense” creates only a rebuttable presumption that the applicant poses a threat.  As a \nresult, it concluded that the regulation did have not an unauthorized retroactive effect under any of \nthe tests set out in Landgraf.   \nIn Matherly, 817 F.3d 115, the Fourth Circuit considered a challenge to a federal statute \nproviding for the civil commitment to the Bureau of Prisons of a “sexually dangerous person.”  \nMatherly challenged the law as impermissibly retroactive because it took effect after he was \nconvicted and in the Bureau’s custody.  Id.  The Court determined that the statute was not \nretroactive because “it simply ‘uses’ prior acts ‘solely for evidentiary purposes’ to support a \nfinding” that a person is sexually dangerous.  Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Comstock, 627 \nF.3d 513, 523 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted)).   \nThese cases are distinguishable.  In both cases, the contested law or regulation changed the \neffect of past criminal convictions on future governmental decisions.  In essence, the government \nconsidered the plaintiffs’ prohibited acts as evidence adverse to the plaintiff in future government \ndecisions.  Here, the revised FAM does not pertain to prior unlawful acts, but to “transactions \nalready completed,” i.e., the receipt of non-cash public benefits. Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.  Before \nthe changes to the Manual, the receipt of these benefits was not only lawful, but also sanctioned \nby the FAM. After the changes to the Manual, however, benefits received prior to the policy \nchange  are  considered  as  a  factor  (or  in  some  cases  a  “heavily  negative  factor”)  in  visa \n57 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 59 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 58 of 82\ndeterminations.  Based on the allegations, this change represents a “complete[] reversal of the \nstatus quo.”  See Nat’l Petrochemical & Refiners Ass’n, 630 F.3d at 160 (characterizing Bowen, \n488 U.S. 204, as an instance in which an “agency ‘completely reversed the status quo ante’”).    \nEven if the change does not “alter the past legal consequences of past actions,” the City \nhas adequately alleged that the revised FAM is secondarily retroactive.  Celtronix Telemetry, Inc., \n272 F.3d at 588. Immigrants (and their families) had “settled expectations” that receipt of non-\ncash benefits would have no effect on visa determinations.  See Olatunji v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 383, \n396 (4th Cir. 2004).  Accordingly, plaintiff plausibly alleges that the changes to the FAM are \nretroactive.13  \nF.  Notice and Comment \nCount Three of the Complaint asserts that the amended public charge instructions must be \nset aside as unlawful because the Manual was “amended without notice and comment,” in violation \nof 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  ECF 1, ¶¶ 186-87.  Defendants move to dismiss Count Three for failure \nto state a claim.  ECF 17-1 at 41.   \nAs noted, the APA generally requires that before a federal agency adopts a rule it must \npublish a proposed rule in the Federal Register and provide interested parties with an opportunity \nto comment.  See 5 U.S.C. § § 551(4)-(5), 553(a)-(c).  Failure to comply with the APA’s \nrulemaking process renders the rule invalid.  See, e.g., N.C. Grower’s Ass’n., Inc., 702 F.3d at 770 \n(invalidating regulation that was issued without notice and comment); Mendoza, 654 F.3d at 1025; \nMack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 95-96 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  \n                                                 \n13 Although not essential to my determination, I note that the DHS Proposed Rule expressly \ndeclined to apply the rule retroactively.  93 Fed. Reg. at 51,206.  (“DHS would not consider public \nbenefits under the proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b) that were previously excluded under the 1999 \nInterim Field Guidance if received before effective date of the final rule.”).  \n58 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 60 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 59 of 82\nThe APA, however, contains several exemptions to these procedural requirements.  See 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 553(a), 553(b)(3).  Here, defendants offer two distinct reasons for why the FAM is not \nsubject to the APA’s rulemaking procedures.  First, they contend the Manual is exempt from notice \nand comment as an “interpretive rule” under § 553(d)(2).  ECF 17-1 at 36-41.  Second, they argue \nthe FAM falls within the sweep of § 553(a)(1), which exempts from notice and comment rules \naffecting “foreign affairs.”  ECF 17-1 at 42.  \n1.  Interpretative and Legislative Rules \nUnder the APA, a “Rule” is a “statement of general or particular applicability and future \neffect” that is “designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describ[e] the \norganization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 551(4).  “The APA \ndivides agency action, as relevant here, into three boxes: legislative rules, interpretive rules, and \ngeneral statements of policy.  A lot can turn on which box an agency action falls into.”  Nat’l Min. \nAss’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 246 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (Kavanaugh, J.).   \n“The APA generally requires that agencies provide notice of proposals to create, amend, \nor repeal a rule and an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the proposal.”  Casa de \nMd., 924 F.3d at 701 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(4)-(5), 553(a)-(c)).  Thus, an agency’s failure to \ncomply with notice and comment renders a rule procedurally invalid.  See, e.g., Children’s Hosp. \nof the King’s Daughters, Inc. v.

Carroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1341 (4th Cir. \n1995)).  As for legislative rules, the Fourth Court has explained:  \n“By  contrast,  ‘a  substantive  or  legislative  rule,  pursuant  to  properly \ndelegated authority, has the force of law, and creates new law or imposes new rights \nor duties.’  To that end, ‘[a] rule is legislative if it supplements a statute, adopts a \nnew  position  inconsistent  with  existing  regulations,  or  otherwise  effects  a \nsubstantive change in existing law or policy.’  Likewise, a rule is legislative if it \n‘expand[s] the footprint of a regulation by imposing new requirements, rather than \nsimply interpreting the legal norms Congress or the agency itself has previously \ncreated.’” \n \nId. (first quoting Jerri’s Ceramic Arts, 874 F.2d at 207, then quoting Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1021, \nand then quoting Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 873 (8th Cir. 2013)).  Further, \n“[w]hen an agency relies on expressly delegated authority to establish policy . . . courts generally \ntreat the agency action as legislative, rather than interpretive, rulemaking.”  Id. at 622.   \nDefendants argue that the City has failed to state a claim that the FAM violates the APA’s \nnotice and comment requirements because the FAM is an interpretive rule.  In their view, the \namendment to the FAM “does not carry legal force” because it merely “clarif[ies] the agency’s \ninterpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations” and serves only to “advis[e]” consular \nofficers.  ECF 17-1 at 37.  That is, the FAM’s public charge provisions “merely draw on those \nstatutes and regulations and do not establish legal rules in their own right.”  Id. at 39.  In addition, \ndefendants point out that the Ninth and D.C. circuits have described the FAM as not carrying \n“force of law,” and they analogize to Fourth Circuit cases in which agency manuals were held to \nbe interpretive rules.  Id. at 38-40.  \n61 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 63 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 62 of 82\nThe government concedes that the revision to FAM “could potentially lead to individuals \nbeing denied visas on ‘public charge’ grounds more frequently.”  Id. at 41.  But, it insists that this \n“does not mean the guidance should be considered substantive rather than interpretive.”  Id.   \nThe City counters that it has plausibly alleged that the FAM is a legislative rule subject to \nnotice and comment.  They contend that defendants’ characterization of the FAM as interpretive \nis  belied  by  the  fact  that  DHS  “is  simultaneously  proceeding  through  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking to implement similar changes to public charge for immigrants seeking to adjust status.”  \nECF 25 at 42 (citing 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114).  Further, the City argues that the FAM change is a \nlegislative rule because it “‘change[d] the rules of the game’ by including within public charge a \nhost of programs that had previously been excluded—a quintessentially legislative action.”  Id. at \n43 (bracket in original) (quoting Sprint Corp. v. FCC, 315 F.3d 369, 374 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). \nThe focus of this litigation, the FAM’s public charge provisions, contain all the hallmarks \nof a legislative rule.  For starters, it “supplements a statute,” specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).  \nCKHD, 896 F.3d at 620.  In making the public charge determination, the INA provides that \nconsular officers “shall at a minimum consider” the applicant’s “age”; “health”; “family status”; \n“assets resources, and financial status”; and “education and skills.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B).  \nPublic assistance—cash or otherwise—is not, therefore, a factor that the statute explicitly requires \nconsular officers to consider.  And, to the extent that cash benefits are encompassed within \n“financial status,” the same cannot necessarily be said for the receipt of non-cash benefits.  \nSimilarly, the INA makes no mention of the receipt of public benefits by a visa applicant’s family \nmembers, nor does it prescribe the proper weight that should be given to an Affidavit of Support.  \nSee id.  “Accordingly, [9 FAM] does not derive ‘from an existing [statute or regulation] whose \nmeaning compels or logically justifies the proposition,” thereby weighing in favor of treating the \n62 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 64 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 63 of 82\n[challenged FAM provisions] as a legislative rule.”  CKHD, 896 F.3d at 622 (quoting Mendoza, \n754 F.3d at 1021).   \nThe  FAM  changes  also  “‘expand[]  the  footprint  of  a  regulation  by  imposing  new \nrequirements, rather than simply interpreting the legal norms Congress or the agency itself has \npreviously created.’”  Id. at 620 (brackets omitted).  To be sure, the fact that the revision to FAM \nalters the longstanding concept of the public charge rule does not, alone, transform the FAM into \na legislative rule.  See Perez, 135 S. Ct. at 1206 (“Because an agency is not required to use notice-\nand-comment procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule, it is also not required to use those \nprocedures when it amends or repeals that interpretive rule.”).  But, the revisions to the FAM did \nnot simply repeal an existing regulation or clarify the INA.  Instead, the FAM effects substantive \nchanges to the definition of public charge in the INA as interpreted and applied by the State \nDepartment.   \nIn  particular,  non-cash  benefits,  which  were  once  excluded  from  public  charge \ndeterminations, are now part of the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.  ECF 1, ¶ 97.  Likewise, \nwhile the FAM previously stated that past or current receipt of cash benefits by the applicant’s \nfamily members “must not be considered,” it now provides that the “[p]ast or current receipt of \npublic assistance of any type” by the applicant’s family members “is relevant” to the analysis.  \nECF 1, ¶ 103 (emphasis added).  And, the FAM deemphasized the importance of an Affidavit of \nSupport from “normally . . . sufficient” to only a “positive” factor.  ECF 1, ¶ 105.  Thus, the FAM \nrevisions impose new requirements on visa applicants and their families with respect to what \nbenefits they can utilize without the risk of being deemed a public charge.  See, e.g., Jafarzadeh v. \nNielsen, 321 F. Supp. 3d 19, 45-47 (D.D.C. 2018) (denying motion to dismiss plaintiff’s APA \nclaims after finding plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts that USCIS memorandum was a legislative \n63 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 65 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 64 of 82\nrule because it “broadens statutory criteria” for deportability); Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1022 (DOL \nguidance letters were legislative rules because the letters “do more than clarify or remind parties \nof preexisting duties”; “they supplement the statute by imposing specific duties on employers”). \nFinally, the State Department “relie[d] on expressly delegated authority to establish [the] \npolicy” embodied in the FAM’s public charge provisions.  CHKD, 896 F.3d at 621.  Section 1104 \nof the INA provides that “[t]he Secretary of State shall be charged with the administration and the \nenforcement of the provisions of this chapter and all other immigration and nationality laws \nrelating to (1) the powers, duties, and functions of diplomatic and consular officers of the United \nStates . . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1104.  Based on this authority, the State Department promulgated Volume \nNine to instruct consular officers how to make public charge determinations.  The “Introduction \nto 9 FAM Visa” explains that the Manual is “based on statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, \nPresidential directives, OMB circulars and other sources.”  9 FAM 101.1-1 (2019).   \nSpecifically, the FAM derives its authority from the INA and 22 C.F.R.  §§ 40-42 (2019), \nwhich govern the State Department’s visa operations.  See 9 FAM 101.1-2.  As the Fourth Circuit \nobserved in CKHD, the Secretary’s reliance on his delegated authority to implement the FAM’s \npublic charge provisions militates in favor of finding the provisions legislative, rather than \ninterpretive.  See CKHD, 896 F.3d at 623; see also Mendoza, 754 F.3d at 1022 (“Where Congress \nhas specifically declined to create a standard, the Department cannot claim its implementing rule \nis an interpretation of the statute.”). \nThe government makes three arguments in support of the contrary contention.  First, it \npoints out that the State Department “published the [Manual] in a form that does not carry legal \nforce[.]”  ECF 17-1 at 37.  The government is correct that the form of the agency action bears on \nthe analysis.  See McCarthy, 758 F.3d at 252 (an “agency’s characterization of the guidance” is a \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 66 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 65 of 82\nrelevant factor when identifying legislative rules).  But, it is not dispositive.  See Jerri’s Ceramic \nArts, 874 F.2d at 207 (“An agency’s ‘characterization of its statement as an expansion of its policy \nor interpretation . . . does not preclude our finding that it is something more.’” (citation omitted)); \nsee also Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1023 (D.C.Cir.2000) (finding guidance \ndocument was a legislative rule). \nSecond, the government argues that this Court should follow in the footsteps of the Ninth \nCircuit and D.C. Circuit, both of which have held that the FAM does not carry the force of law.  \nBut, the government misreads both cases.   \nScales v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 1159 (9th Cir. 2000), involved the appeal of an order of removal.  \nFacing deportation, Scales argued that he was a U.S. citizen because his Filipina mother was \nmarried to a U.S. service member at the time Scales was born in the Philippines.  Id. at 1162.  The \ngovernment responded by citing the FAM, which provided that, “[a]bsent a blood relationship \nbetween the child and the parent on whose citizenship the child's own claim is based, U.S. \ncitizenship is not acquired.”  Id. at 1165 (quoting 7 FAM § 1131.4–1(a) (ed. 2000)).  The \ngovernment urged the Ninth Circuit to accord Chevron “defer[ence] to the FAM as an agency \ninterpretation” of the INA.  Id.   \nThe Ninth Circuit declined to do so.  The court observed that “the statement in the FAM is \nnot specifically an interpretation of [the pertinent INA section] and, importantly, it is not an \ninterpretation  “arrived  at  after,  for  example,  a  formal  adjudication  or  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.”  Id. at 1166.  For additional support, the court then quoted Christensen v. Harris \nCounty, 529 U.S. 576 (2000), a case principally concerned with Chevron and Auer deference, for \nthe  proposition  that  “‘[i]nterpretations  such  as  those  in  opinion  letters—like  interpretations \ncontained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the \n65 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 67 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 66 of 82\nforce of law—do not warrant Chevron-style deference.’”  Id. (quoting Christensen v. Harris Cty., \n529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000)). \nIn Miller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332 (D.C. Cir. 2012), a safety inspector at the U.S. embassy \nin  Paris  sued  the  State  Department,  alleging  that  his  forced  retirement  violated  the  Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”).  Id. at 1335.  In assessing whether the State \nDepartment was bound by the ADEA, the court noted in passing: “Whether or not more informal \ndocuments like the Department's Foreign Affairs Handbook and Foreign Affairs Manual would \nqualify for Chevron treatment, there is no mention of mandatory retirement (or an exemption from \nthe ADEA) in the provisions of those documents that the Department cites.”  Id. at 1349 (footnote \nomitted).  \nNeither Scales nor Miller preclude this Court from concluding that 9 FAM is legislative.  \nBoth cases discussed the FAM in passing, and in the context of Chevron deference—a question \ndistinct from whether the FAM is a legislative rule.  More important, neither concerned the FAM’s \npublic charge provisions—the focus of this litigation.  And, the focus of the inquiry here is on \nthose changes, not the FAM as a whole or Volume Nine.  Cf. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) (defining a “rule” \nas “the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future \neffect”).   \nThird, the government asserts that agency manuals are interpretive rules under Fourth \nCircuit precedent, arguing that this case is “most similar” to United States v. Ellen, 961 F.2d 462 \n(4th Cir. 1992).  Ellen involved an appeal of a criminal conviction for discharging pollutants in \nwetland areas, in violation of the Clean Water Act.  Id. at 464.  The defendant argued that his \nconviction violated the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses because the court admitted \ntestimony defining “wetlands” according to an inter-agency manual, which was promulgated after \n66 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 68 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 67 of 82\nhe was charged.  Id. at 465.  The Court rejected this contention, stating: “Ellen has presented no \nreasons why the 1989 Manual is legislative rather than interpretive in nature and we find no \nindication that promulgation of the 1989 Manual was an exercise of the agencies’ delegated \nlegislative function.”  Id. at 466 (emphasis in original). \nEllen is distinguishable.  The manual at issue in Ellen “merged” the then-existing policies \nof four federal agencies into one “technical guidance document” to establish “a uniform national \nprocedure for wetland determinations.”  Id.  The manual “d[id] not purport to create new law or \nimpose new rights or duties . . . .”  Id.  The same cannot be said for the FAM’s public charge \nprovisions.   \nFor one thing, while the FAM provides guidance to consular officers, the FAM also affects \nthe legal rights of visa applicants and their families, i.e., what benefits they can utilize without the \npossibility of being deemed a public charge.  Moreover, the FAM revisions are not merely \ncodifying longstanding practices to improve inter-agency coordination; rather, they alter the \nstandards that govern whether a visa applicant is inadmissible as a public charge.  \nJerri’s Ceramic Arts, Inc. v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 874 F.2d 205 (4th Cir. \n1989), is instructive.  There, the Fourth Circuit determined that a “Statement of Interpretation” \nissued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission was a legislative rule.  See id. at 206.  The \nstatement at issue designated the “paper, fabric, yarn, fuzz, elastic, and string” components of toys \nto be “small parts.”  Id. at 207.  This reversed the agency’s longstanding policy treating only hard \ncomponents as “small parts,” and it threatened to result in toys previously exempt from regulation \nbeing banned as choking hazards.  Id.   \nExamining “‘the provision’s language, its context, and any available extrinsic evidence’” \nrevealed its legislative character.  Id. at 208 (quoting Doe v. Hampton, 556 F.2d 265, 280-81 (D.C. \n67 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 69 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 68 of 82\nCir. 1977)).  The Court reasoned, 874 F.2d at 208: “[T]he language of the statement and related \ncomments establishes that more is involved than mere ‘interpretation,’ because the proposed \nstatement has the clear intent of eliminating a former exemption and of providing the Commission \nwith power to enforce violations of a new rule.”  Thus, given the Commission’s authority to impose \ncivil and criminal penalties on noncompliant actors, the Court found “the agency’s argument that \n“the statement ‘only expects’ and ‘urges’ compliance, and merely provides guidance to the public \nand its staff” to be “simply incredible.”  Id.  Further, the Court observed that “[t]he fact that the \nstatement altered a long-standing position cannot readily be discounted,” and here “the statement \nwould, for the first time, have the effect of bringing within the sweep of the regulation entirely \nnew classes of business.”  Id.  \nHere too, at least according to the allegations, the changes to the FAM “alter a long-\nstanding position,” as it “imposes new duties” and has “the effect of bringing within the sweep of \nthe regulation entirely new classes of [benefits].”  Id. at 208.  And, the FAM is not all bark and no \nbite—a visa applicant (or family member) who utilizes non-cash benefits faces the prospect of \nbeing deemed inadmissible to enter the United States on public charge grounds.  Thus, as in Jerri’s \nCeramic Arts, the facts surrounding the FAM change, in the light most favorable to the City, \n“establish that the [State Department] has made a legislative rule and called it an interpretation.”  \nId.  \nTherefore, I conclude that the City has adequately pleaded that the FAM is subject to notice \nand comment under the APA.  Accordingly, dismissal is not warranted in regard to the City’s \nnotice-and-comment claim.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 70 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 69 of 82\n2.  Foreign Affairs Exception \nThe government maintains that the changes to the FAM are exempt from notice and \ncomment under the APA’s foreign affairs exception.  ECF 17-1 at 41-42.  Therefore, it claims that \nCount Three fails to state a claim. \nThe APA’s foreign affairs exception provides that a rule need not undergo notice and \ncomment “to the extent that there is involved . . . a military or foreign affairs function of the United \nStates[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1).  However, to invoke the exception, the government must do more \nthan “merely recite that the Rule ‘implicates’ foreign affairs.”  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \nTrump, 932 F.3d 742, 775 (9th Cir. 2018).  The government must demonstrate a “need for \nimmediate implementation of the final rule” due to “obvious international consequences.”  Id.; see \nalso Zhang v. Slattery, 55 F.3d 732, 744 (2d Cir. 1995) (“For the exception to apply, the public \nrulemaking  provisions  should  provoke  definitely  undesirable  international  consequences.”), \nsuperseded on other grounds by statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42); Jean v. Nelson, 711 F.2d 1455, \n1477-78 (11th Cir. 1983) (rejecting the foreign affairs exception where government “offered no \nevidence  of  undesirable  international  consequences  that  would  result  if  rulemaking  were \nemployed”), vacated and rev’d on other grounds, 727 F.2d 957 (11th Cir. 1984) (en banc), aff’d, \n472 U.S. 846 (1985).   \nTo my knowledge, the federal appellate courts have recognized the applicability of the \nAPA’s foreign affairs exception on just two occasions:  responding to the attacks of September 11, \n2001, see Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 437 (2d Cir. 2008), and the Iranian hostage crisis.  See \nNademi v. INS, 679 F.2d 811, 814 (10th Cir. 1982); Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 (9th \nCir. 1980) (per curiam); Malek-Marzban v. INS, 653 F.2d 113, 116 (4th Cir. 1981). \n69 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 71 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 70 of 82\nIn the immigration context, “the dangers of an expansive reading of the foreign affairs \nexception . . . are manifest.”  City of N.Y. v. Permanent Mission of India to United Nations, 618 \nF.3d  172,  202  (2d  Cir.  2010).    Indeed,  a  capacious  interpretation  of  §  553  (would  risk \n“eliminat[ing] public participation in [an] entire area of administrative law.”  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see also Yassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 n.4 (9th Cir. 1980) \n(“The foreign affairs exception would become distended if applied to [immigration] actions \ngenerally, even though immigration matters typically implicate foreign affairs.”).  Consequently, \nwhere the government seeks to apply the exception to immigration rules, it must establish that the \n“ordinary application of the public rulemaking provisions [will] provoke definitely undesirable \ninternational consequences.”  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 932 F.3d at 776 (brackets in original) \n(quoting Yassini, 618 F.2d at 1360); accord City of New York, 618 F.3d at 202; Zhang, 55 F.3d at \n744; Jean, 711 F.2d at 1477-78. \nAt this stage, I cannot conclude that subjecting the FAM to APA rulemaking would \nproduce “definitely undesirable international consequences.”  Nor are there “obvious” exigent \ncircumstances like the September 11 attacks or the Iranian hostage crisis that would explain \ndefendants’ need to suddenly expand the FAM’s definition of public charge.   \nIndeed, the government relies almost exclusively on the Attorney General’s Manual on the \nAPA to support its contention that the foreign affairs exception applies here.  ECF 17-1 at 42.  \nSuch reliance is misplaced.    \nThe Attorney General’s Manual states that the foreign affairs exception is “broad” and \n“applicable to most functions of the State Department.”  U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Attorney General’s \nManual on the Administrative Procedure Act 26-27 (1947).  According to defendants, the Manual \nis  “entitled  to  deference”  because  the  Department  of  Justice  was  “heavily  involved  in  the \n70 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 72 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 71 of 82\nlegislative process that resulted in the Act’s enactment in 1946.”  Id. at 42 (quoting Chrysler Corp. \nv. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 n.31 (1979), and citing Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 546 (1978)).   \nThe government overstates the import of the Attorney General’s Manuel.  In Chrysler \nCorp., 441 U.S. at 302 n.31, the Court only considered the Attorney General’s Manual after noting \nthat the House and Senate Reports did not address the issue under consideration.  Likewise, in \nVermont Yankee, 435 U.S. at 546, the Court analyzed the House and Senate Reports before citing \nthe Attorney General Manual as further confirmation of the legislative history.  Thus, while \nrelevant, the Court need not blindly adhere to the Attorney General Manual’s views on the foreign \naffairs exception. \nAnd, in any event, the Attorney General Manual does not mandate the application of the \nforeign affairs exception to this case.  Tellingly, the government omits the quote of a House and \nSenate Report, contained in the Attorney General’s Manual, id. at 26: \nAs to the meaning of “foreign affairs function”, both the Senate and House \nreports state: “The phrase ‘foreign affairs functions,’ used here and in some other \nprovisions of the bill, is not to be loosely interpreted to mean any function extending \nbeyond the borders of the United States but only those ‘affairs’ which so affect \nrelations with other governments that, for example, public rule making provisions \nwould clearly provoke definitely undesirable international consequences.\"  \n \n(quoting H. Rep. No. 79-1980 at 257 S. Rep. No. 79-572 at 199 (1946)) (emphasis added). \nIn sum, defendants’ effort to invoke § 553(a)(1) is doomed by their failure to explain how \nsubjecting the FAM to APA rulemaking would harm foreign policy interests.  At this stage, I agree \nwith plaintiff that the foreign affairs exception does not require dismissal of the suit.  \nV.  Equal Protection \nThe City contends that the amendments to the FAM violate the equal protection component \nof the Due Process Clause because they discriminate based on “race, national origin, nationality, \n71 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 73 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 72 of 82\nincome, or receipt of public benefits.”  ECF 1, ¶ 189.  The government moves to dismiss the City’s \nequal protection claim, asserting that “the City has not alleged facts that could establish that the \nchallenged FAM guidance was motivated by racial animus on the part of the Department of State \nor the President.”  ECF 17-1 at 44.  And, the government points out that federal actions which \ndiscriminate on the basis of income and national origin are subject only to rational basis review.  \nId. at 45-46.20 \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “commands that no State shall \n‘deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,’ which is essentially a \ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne, Tex. v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (quoting Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)).  \nEqual Protection principles apply to the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment to the Constitution.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).   \n“To state a race-based claim under the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must allege that \na government actor intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his race.”  Williams v. \nHansen, 326 F.3d 569, 583 (4th Cir. 2003); see also Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. \nDev. Corp., 429 U.S.252, 265 (1977) (“Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is \nrequired to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”).  Discriminatory intent “implies \nmore  than  intent  as  volition  or  intent  as  awareness  of  consequences.  It  implies  that  the \ndecisionmaker . . . selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”  Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. \n                                                 \n20 The government does not explain why the City has failed to state a claim even if the \nFAM discriminated on the basis of income or national origin, as opposed to race.  See ECF 17-1 \nat 44-46.  Regardless, as discussed, infra, Trump v. Hawaii, __ U.S. __, __, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), \nmay compel the application of rational basis review to the City’s equal protection claim, regardless \nof whether the alleged classification is income, national origin, or race.  \n72 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 74 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 73 of 82\nFeeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).  That said, “the Equal Protection Clause ‘does not require a \nplaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes.’”  \nWilliams, 326 F.3d at 584 (emphasis in original) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265).  It \nis enough to show “that racial animus was one of several factors that, taken together, moved the \ndecision-maker to act as he did.”  Id.  \n“There are several ways for a plaintiff to make out a valid claim of unconstitutional \ndiscrimination[:]” The plaintiff can (1) “point to a law or policy that expressly classifies persons \non the basis of race,” (2) “identify a facially neutral law or policy that has been applied in an \nintentionally discriminatory manner,” or (3) “allege that a facially neutral statute or policy that is \nneutrally applied nonetheless has an adverse effect on a protected group, and that the adoption of \nthe statute or policy was motivated by discriminatory animus.”  Williams, 326 F.3d at 584 (internal \ncitations omitted). \nIn Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 \n(1977), the Supreme Court set forth a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider in \nperforming the “sensitive inquiry” into discriminatory intent.  These include: (1) “The historical \nbackground of the decision . . . particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for \ninvidious purposes”; (2) “The specific sequence of events leading up the challenged decision”; (3) \n“Departures from the normal procedural sequence”; (4) “Substantive departures . . ., particularly \nif the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary \nto the one reached”; and (5) “The legislative or administrative history . . . especially where there \nare contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body, minutes of its meetings, or \nreports.”  Id. at 267-68 (internal citations and references omitted).  \n73 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 75 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 74 of 82\nWhen undertaking this analysis, courts must be cautious not to “miss[] the forest in \ncarefully surveying the many trees.” N.C. State Conference of NAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d, 204, \n214 (4th Cir. 2016).  “Any individual piece of evidence can seem innocuous when viewed alone, \nbut gains an entirely different meaning when considered in context.”  Id. at 233. \nApplying the Arlington Heights factors, the City’s allegations are sufficient to survive \ndefendants’ Motion.  First, the Complaint alleges that the FAM change was a substantive departure \nfrom previous policy.  “For decades,” asserts the City, the FAM’s definition of public charge did \nnot encompass the receipt of non-cash benefit.   Then, on January 3, 2018, the State Department \nchanged course, making the receipt of non-cash benefits by both the visa applicant and his or her \nfamily a relevant factor.  ECF 1, ¶ 44.  Likewise, the State Department retracted its instruction that \nAffidavits of Support are “normally . . . sufficient,” and replaced it with the advisement that an \nAffidavit is simply a “positive factor.”  Id., ¶¶ 47, 105.  \nSecond, the City points to “specific sequences of events” that raise red flags.  Shortly after \nPresident Trump’s inauguration, a draft Executive Order was leaked to the media, which directed \nDHS and the State Department to adjust how they conduct public charge determinations.  Id. ¶ 77.  \nAlthough  the  order  was  never  finalized,  both  agencies  have  implemented  nearly  identical \nregulatory changes.  Id. ¶ 78.  Similarly, plaintiff alleges that the State Department published the \namended Manual without forewarning; that when it did announce the changes on its website, it left \nout many of the details, including any explanation for the revisions; and it removed the press \nrelease from its website shortly after posting it.  Id. ¶¶ 115-20.  \nFinally, the City identifies statements by the President and senior Executive Branch \nofficials to support its claim that defendants’ decision was motivated, at least in part, by intentional \ndiscrimination against immigrants of color.  See id. ¶¶ 69-73.   \n74 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 76 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 75 of 82\nThe government throws the proverbial kitchen sink at the City’s equal protection claim.  \nHowever, none of its arguments are persuasive.  \nAs an initial matter, defendants contend that the City cannot raise a plausible equal \nprotection claim because “aliens seeking entry into the United States cannot assert constructional \nrights.”  ECF 17-1 at 44.  That is undoubtedly true.  Kerry v. Din, 576 ___ U.S. ___, ___, 35 S. Ct. \n2128, 2131 (2015) (opinion of Scalia, J.); Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762 (1972).  But, \nthe City is not asserting the rights of unadmitted nonresident aliens.  Rather, it seeks to assert the \nconstitutional rights of its residents, particularly those who are affected by the FAM, either because \nthey are immigrant residents, sponsors, or family members of a visa applicant.  ECF 1, ¶¶ 195-97.  \nThus, Din and Kleindienst are inapposite.     \nFurther, the government insists that the remarks by President Trump, on which the Cities \nrelies, are merely “statements about policy” and that, regardless, none of these statements pertain \nto the FAM change.  ECF 17-1 at 47-48.  The government is wrong on both fronts. \n It is true that many of the President’s remarks on which the City relies are policy or policy-\nrelated statements, like his contention that “[c]urrent immigration policy imposes as much as $300 \nbillion annually in net fiscal costs on U.S. taxpayers.”  ECF 1, ¶ 71(p).  And, others are nothing \nmore than political bluster.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 71(e) (“ObamaCare gives free insurance to illegal \nimmigrants.”).  Indeed, it cannot be the case that an equal protection claim is born every time a \npresident expresses his views on contentious subjects, such as immigration.  See Hawaii, 138 S. \nCt. at 2417 (“The President of the United States possesses an extraordinary power to speak to his \nfellow citizens and on their behalf.”).   But, the Complaint contains statements of the President \nthat plausibly constitute prejudice.  Those statements include (1) the President’s alleged complaint \non January 11, 2019, about “people from shithole countries” coming to the United States (id. ¶ 69); \n75 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 77 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 76 of 82\n(2) his comment that immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS” (id. ¶ 70); and (3) his assertion that \nNigerians, if admitted to the United States, would never “go back to their huts” (id.).   \nAnd, the government invokes Trump v. Hawaii, __ U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), for the \nproposition that courts should ignore the President’s statements when searching for evidence of \nracial animus.  ECF 17-1 at 48-49.  In Trump v. Hawaii, the plaintiffs lodged, inter alia, an \nEstablishment Clause challenge to Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, which restricted the entry \nof foreign nationals from six predominantly Muslim countries.  Id. at 2403; see 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 \n(Sept. 27, 2017).  The President’s statements in that case were at “the heart” of the plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claim.  Id. at 2417.  The plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction barring \nenforcement of the restrictions, and the government appealed.  Id. at 2406-07. \nAs relevant here, the Court vacated the preliminary injunction based, in part, on finding \nthat the plaintiffs had not “demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional \nclaim.”  Id. at 2423.  The Court applied the standard set forth in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. \n753, 770 (1972), which provides that, pursuant to Congress’s plenary power over immigration, a \ncourt reviewing a constitutional attack on a visa denial should examine only whether there was a \n“facially legitimate and bona fide reason” for the decision.  Id. at 2420.   \nApplying the Mandel standard, the Court found that the Proclamation was facially neutral \nas to religion, “reflect[ed] the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple \nCabinet officials  and their agencies,” and was “expressly premised on legitimate purposes: \npreventing the entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to \nimprove their practices.”  Id. at 2421.   But, the Court went further, finding it appropriate to “look \nbehind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying rational basis review.”  Id. at 2420.  \nThus, the Court stated: “As a result, we may consider plaintiffs’ extrinsic evidence, but will uphold \n76 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 78 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 77 of 82\nthe policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification independent of \nunconstitutional grounds.”  Id.  Although the Court acknowledged the extrinsic record presented \nby the plaintiffs, it concluded that, “because there is persuasive evidence that the entry suspension \nhas a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility, \nwe must accept that independent justification.”  Id. \nThere is little daylight between Hawaii and the case sub judice.  Here, as there, plaintiff \nmounts a constitutional challenge to an Executive Branch policy concerning the entry of foreign \nnationals into the country.  Accordingly, the Court is limited to the “circumscribed judicial \ninquiry,” asking only if the FAM changes “can reasonably be understood to result from a \njustification independent of unconstitutional grounds.”  Id. at 2420.  \nHowever, Hawaii does not foreclose plaintiff’s equal protection claim.  First, rational basis \nreview is not toothless.  See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996); City of Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 448-50 (1985); U.S. Dep’t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413, U.S. \n528, 534-36 (1973).  Perhaps plaintiff will unearth evidence during discovery demonstrating that \ndefendants were driven by nothing more than “a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular \ngroup.”  Moreno, 413 at 534.  Or, perhaps defendants will produce evidence that the revisions to \nthe FAM have a legitimate basis.  But, at this juncture, there is no evidence as to why defendants \namended the Manual.   \n Second, Hawaii in no ways holds that the President’s statements are irrelevant.  See Int’l \nRefugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 373 F. Supp. 3d 650, 671 (D. Md. 2019) (“[Hawaii] does \nnot instruct courts to disregard [presidential] statements . . ., nor does it hold that the subjective \nintent of the President and his advisors . . . is irrelevant.”); see also Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 519-520 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. granted, __ U.S. __, \n77 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 79 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 78 of 82\n139 S. Ct. 2779 (2019) (No. 18-587); id. at 524 n.4 (Owens, J., concurring in the judgment).  \nIndeed,  despite  limiting  its  review,  the  Hawaii  Court  nonetheless  considered  “extrinsic \nevidence”—namely, President Trump’s statements.  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2420.  \nFinally, defendants ignore that the standard of review in Hawaii was materially different \nthan the one this Court must apply to defendants’ Motion.  The question in Hawaii was whether \nthe plaintiffs had established a “likelihood of success on the merits,” so as to entitle them to a \npreliminary injunction.  See id. at 2423; see also Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 20 (2008).  Here, in contrast, this Court is tasked with deciding whether the Complaint states a \nplausible claim for relief.  See Arab Am. Civil Rights League v. Trump, No. 17-10310, 2019 WL \n3003455, at *9 (E.D. Mich. July 10, 2019) (declining to apply Hawaii v. Trump at motion to \ndismiss stage due to the differing standards of review). \nThe government is correct that none of the President’s statements relate specifically to the \ndecision to change the FAM’s public charge provisions.  But, at this juncture, the City does not \nneed to demonstrate a tight nexus between words and actions.  See, e.g., Saget v. Trump, 345 F. \nSupp. 3d 287 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (plaintiffs plausibly alleged an equal protection violation based on \nthe President’s statements); Casa de Md., Inc. v. Trump, 355 F. Supp. 3d 307, 325-26 (D. Md. \n2018) (same); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 315 F. Supp. 3d 766, 810 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) \n(same), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, __ U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 953 (2019); Centro Presente v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 332 F. Supp. 3d 393, 414-15 (D. Mass. 2018) (same); Batalla Vidal v. \nNielsen, 291 F. Supp. 3d 260, 279 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (rejecting the argument that the President’s \nstatements were irrelevant to equal protection challenge to agency action).  Indeed, “there can be \nno doubt that if, as alleged, the President influenced the decision to [amend the FAM], the \ndiscriminatory motivation cannot be laundered through the Secretary.”  Casa de Maryland, 355 F. \n78 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 80 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 79 of 82\nSupp. 3d at 326.  And, in any event, plaintiff plausibly claims that President Trump was personally \ninvolved in the decision based on the draft Executive Order commanding the State Department to \nrevise the FAM’s public charge provisions.  ECF 1, ¶ 77.    \nWhether this evidence will ultimately suffice to establish an equal protection violation is a \nquestion for another day.  At this juncture, accepting plaintiff’s allegations as true, and drawing all \nreasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor, as I must at this stage, I conclude that the City has alleged \nsufficient facts to allege a claim of an equal protection violation.   \nVI.  Injunctive relief and the President \nRelying primarily on Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992) (plurality opinion), \ndefendants assert that the Court should, at a minimum, dismiss the City’s claims against the \nPresident because “separation of powers generally prevents a federal court from issuing an \ninjunction purporting to supervise the President’s performance of his duties.”  ECF 17-1 at 50.   \nThe prospect of enjoining the President raises serious separation of powers concerns.  \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has consistently cautioned courts against granting equitable relief \nagainst the chief executive.  See Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 718-19 (1997) (Breyer, J. \nconcurring); Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923) (The “general rule is that neither \ndepartment may invade the province of the other and neither may control, direct, or restrain the \naction of the other”); Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 500 (1866) (“Neither [the Congress or \nPresident] can be restrained in its actions by the judicial department; though the acts of both, when \nperformed, are, in proper cases, subject to its cognizance.”).  \nIn Franklin, 505 U.S. 788, Massachusetts sued to enjoin the President from submitting the \ncensus statement to Congress under the APA and the Enumeration Clause.  Id. at 802.  A plurality \nof the Supreme Court observed that a “grant of injunctive relief against the President himself is \n79 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 81 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 80 of 82\nextraordinary, and should . . . raise[ ] judicial eyebrows.”  Id.  The plurality went on to state: “in \ngeneral ‘this court has no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his \nofficial duties.’”  Id. at 802-03 (quoting Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 500).  But the plurality \ndid “not decide whether injunctive relief against the President was appropriate, because . . . the \ninjury alleged is likely to be redressed by declaratory relief against the Secretary alone.”  Id. at \n803. \nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Scalia opined in Franklin:  \nThe apparently unbroken historical tradition supports the view, which I \nthink implicit in the separation of powers established by the Constitution, that the \nprincipals in whom the executive and legislative powers are ultimately vested—\nviz., the President and the Congress (as opposed to their agents)—may not be \nordered to perform particular executive or legislative acts at the behest of the \nJudiciary. . . . . Permitting declaratory or injunctive relief against the President \npersonally would not only distract him from his constitutional responsibility to \n“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const., Art. II, § 3, but, as \nmore and more disgruntled plaintiffs add his name to their complaints, would \nproduce needless head-on confrontations between district judges and the Chief \nExecutive. \n \nId. at 827-28 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).   \nBut, this does not place the President above the law.  Justice Scalia explained that “[r]eview \nof the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be obtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the \nofficers who attempt to enforce the President's directive . . . .” Id. at 828; accord Int'l Refugee \nAssistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 605 (4th Cir.), as amended (May 31, 2017), as \namended (June 15, 2017) (reversing injunction issued against the President because injury could \nbe remedied by injunctive relief against subordinate officials), vacated and remanded on other \ngrounds sub nom. Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance, __ U.S. __, __, 138 S. Ct. 353, 199 (2017); \nSwan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \n80 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 82 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 81 of 82\n  Despite casting grave doubt on enjoining Presidential action, the Supreme Court has not \nforeclosed the possibility that it may be warranted in extreme cases.  See Clinton v. New York, 524 \nU.S. 417, 433 n.22 (1998) (holding plaintiffs satisfied Article III standing because “each injury is \ntraceable to the President's cancellation of [certain act provisions], and [it] would be redressed by \na declaratory judgment that the cancellations are invalid”); see also Patricia M. Wald & Jonathan \nR. Siegel, The D.C. Circuit and the Struggle for Control of Presidential Information, 90 Geo. L.J. \n737, 758 (2002) (noting that the Court “has not expressly held that a court may never enjoin the \nPresident,” only “that there is something unique about litigation against the President eo nomine \nthat should cause a special judicial hesitation in the enforcement of legal constraints on executive \naction.”).   \nOther district courts, when faced with this delicate question at the motion to dismiss stage, \nhave declined the government’s invitation to dismiss the President as a party.  See Stone v. Trump, \n__ F. Supp. 3d __, __, 2019 WL 3935363 at ⃰ 29 (D. Md. Aug. 2019) (declining to dismiss President \nfrom suit on a motion to dismiss); District of Columbia v. Trump, 291 F. Supp. 3d 725, 751-52 (D. \nMd. 2018), rev’d and remanded on other grounds, In re Trump, 928 F.3d 360 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(same); Centro Presente, 332 F. Supp. 3d at 418-19 (finding it “premature to determine whether \nthis case has the potential to be the rare case in which such an extraordinary remedy might be \njustified”); CASA de Md., 355 F. Supp. 3d at 328-29 (“Though ultimately, relief against the \nPresident himself is extraordinarily unlikely in this case, none of the authority cited by Defendants \nrequires that the President be dismissed at this early stage. The Court thus denies Defendants' \nmotion to dismiss President Trump from the case.”); Saget, at 345 F. Supp. 3d at 297-98 (E.D.N.Y. \n2018) (“Because this could be one of the rare cases in which the extraordinary remedy of injunctive \n81 \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04980-PJH   Document 119-1   Filed 09/25/19   Page 83 of 83\nCase 1:18-cv-03636-ELH   Document 59   Filed 09/20/19   Page 82 of 82\nrelief against the President could be appropriate, it is premature to dismiss the President as a party \nat this time.”). \nDefendants contend that the City’s suit against the President is “especially weak” because \nthe State Department, not the President, publishes the FAM.  ECF 71 at 50.  That may ultimately \nprove to be true.  But this argument is misplaced at this stage in the litigation.  Therefore, I shall \ndeny the government’s motion to dismiss defendant President Trump as a party.  \nVII.  Conclusion \n  For the reasons stated above, I shall deny defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF 17).  An \nOrder follows, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.    \n \nDate: September 20, 2019              /s/     \n              Ellen Lipton Hollander \n              United States District Judge\n82 \n ",
