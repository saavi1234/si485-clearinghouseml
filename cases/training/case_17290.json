Once those two events occur, or by July 21, 2021, whichever is earlier, the parties shall file a joint status report and shall indicate in that report whether they are ready to proceed to a trial scheduling conference.

    "special_case_type": [],
    "state": "Washington",
    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by states, counties, and non-profit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. In the fall of 2019, district court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule. But after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The District Court in this case issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the public charge rule. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction, but vacated its nationwide application. However, the order affirming the injunction is currently stayed pending the Supreme Court's disposition on petitions for review from cases in the Second and Seventh Circuits. In addition, on February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule and the petitions for certiorari were voluntarily dismissed by the government. On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Ninth Circuit to defend the rule in the hope of having it reinstated. Although the issue of intervention went up to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court dismissed the case for \"improvidently granted&rdquo; certiorari on July 15, 2022. Ultimately, the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the case on March 1, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><u>States Sue Over the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2019, fourteen states, led by Washington, California, and New York, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The plaintiff states sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiff states sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Final Rule (the Public Charge Rule or the Rule) vacated due to violations of the APA and unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The states also sought to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Rule from being enforced. The case was assigned to District Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a revised, final public charge rule, which defined personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increased the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded non-cash health, nutrition, and housing benefits. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provided that if an immigration officer found that a person seeking a visa was likely to become a public charge, that person was &ldquo;inadmissible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The states alleged that the Rule redefined the term &ldquo;public charge&rdquo; in a manner contrary to congressional intent and agency interpretation. Since colonial times the term public charge was used to refer to someone permanently and primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The states' complaint asserted that &ldquo;the Rule departs from this original meaning by redefining a public charge as a noncitizen who receives common forms of federal and state public assistance, even in small amounts and for a short period of time.&rdquo; The complaint further states that even though, on average, over 20% of the U.S. population participates in these programs each month, under the Rule, participation in these programs by legally present immigrants could block their path to citizenship. The states alleged that the Rule will deter lawfully present, legally eligible immigrants from participating in these programs, resulting in social and economic costs for the states.</p>\r\n<p>The states filed an amended complaint on September 5, adding an allegation that the Rule was \"motivated by Administration officials' intent to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin,\" in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\r\n<p><u>The States Seek a Stay of the Rule and Preliminary Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2019, the plaintiff states filed a motion to stay the Rule pending final adjudication of their claims on the merits or, in the alternative, for preliminary injunction. The Rule, unless prohibited, was set to go into effect on October 15, 2019. The states asserted that the Rule should not take effect while the legal action was still pending.</p>\r\n<p>On September 20, 2019, defendants filed an opposition to the states&rsquo; motion, challenging the states&rsquo; standing to bring this action. Defendants also contended the Rule was long overdue after Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act in 1996 to &ldquo;expand the public charge ground of inadmissibility.&rdquo; Defendants further asserted that the Rule simply defined the term &ldquo;public charge&rdquo; to reflect Congress&rsquo; legislated policy and its delegation of broad authority to the Executive Branch to set the definition. Lastly, they argued the Rule was a product of a &ldquo;well-reasoned process&rdquo; and was of limited scope.</p>\r\n<p><u>The District Court Grants a Nationwide Preliminary Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>On October 11, 2019, District Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson granted the states&rsquo; Motion for Stay Pending Judicial Review and Preliminary Injunction, finding that they &ldquo;have shown that the status quo should be preserved pending resolution of this litigation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Peterson held that the plaintiff states demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their first cause of action under the APA because evidence showed that Congress already rejected key components of the Rule and that the DHS overstepped its authority. Judge Peterson also held that the states demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that defendants &ldquo;acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in formulating the Public Charge Rule.&rdquo; Furthermore, Judge Peterson held that there was a significant threat of irreparable injury, in the form of disenrollment from non-cash benefits, to the states and their residents if the Rule was to take effect as scheduled. Lastly, Judge Peterson found that &ldquo;the balance of equities tips sharply in favor of the Plaintiff States&rdquo; and that the threat of harm to the government was not enough to outweigh these other factors. Thus, the implementation of the Public Charge Rule was stayed in its entirety, pending entry of a final judgment in the suit, and DHS was enjoined from implementing or enforcing the Rule nationwide. 408 F.Supp.3d 1191.</p>\r\n<p>On October 25, 2019, defendants sought a stay of the preliminary injunction. The defendants informed the court that it would seek appellate relief if the court did not act by November 14.</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2019, the defendants appealed the Order Granting Stay and Preliminary Injunction to the Ninth Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2019, the defendants filed an Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, arguing that they are likely to prevail on appeal and that enjoining the implementation of the Rule will cause harm to the federal government and taxpayers.</p>\r\n<p>On December 3, 2019, Judge Peterson denied the Defendants' Motion for Stay of the Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Ninth Circuit Stays the Preliminary Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2019, Circuit Judges Bybee, Ikuta, and Owens of the Ninth Circuit issued an Order granting the defendants' Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, concluding that defendants have shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits, that it will suffer irreparable harm, and that the balance of the equities and public interest favor a stay. Judge Bybee, writing for the court, concluded that defendants are likely to succeed on its claim that the Rule is not contrary to law, reasoning that defendants' \"decision to consider the receipt of in-kind government assistance as part of its totality-of-the-circumstances test is a reasonable interpretation of the INA and does not violate the Rehabilitation Act.\" Judge Bybee further held that the Rule is not arbitrary and capricious; that the defendants sufficiently considered the costs and benefits of changing the Rule and adequately explained the reasons for the change to the Rule. Finally, Judge Bybee concluded that the defendants will suffer irreparable injury absent a stay because the preliminary injunctions will force defendants to grant status to those not legally entitled to it, contrary to its obligations as defined by the Rule. 944 F.3d 773. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on December 19, 2019. The Ninth Circuit panel denied this motion and petition for rehearing en banc in February 2020.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Supreme Court Stays All Nationwide Injunctions Enjoining Implementation of the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court, in <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of New York v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a></em>, issued a stay on all nationwide injunctions enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. 140 S.Ct. 599. Following this decision, USCIS stated that the Rule was set to take effect on February 24, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, Judge Peterson issued an order granting plaintiffs' motion to compel defendants to produce a privilege log and discovery regarding their equal protection claim. Judge Peterson found that defendants \"sought and received input from other federal agencies, yet did not include those communications in the administrative record.\" Moreover, Judge Peterson concluded that \"[g]iven the inquiry required to determine whether the relevant decisionmakers manifested a discriminatory purpose, the Court finds that reasonable discovery beyond the administrative record is appropriate.\"</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to stay the order on May 5. Judge Peterson denied the stay in part on May 13, though he granted them extended time to produce the privilege log.</p>\r\n<p><u>Defendants Move to Dismiss; District Court Mostly Denies</u></p>\r\n<p>On May 22, 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Defendants asserted that the amended complaint should be dismissed in light of the Ninth Circuit's \"opinion concluding that the Rule falls well within the Executive Branch&rsquo;s discretion\" under the INA and is not arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, defendants asserted that plaintiffs' claims are not justiciable and that \"plaintiffs' allegations do not suggest that DHS issued the Rule 'because of' any alleged 'adverse effects upon an identifiable' racial or ethnic group.\"</p>\r\n<p>Judge Peterson granted the motion in part on September 14, 2020, dismissing the plaintiffs' <em>ultra vires</em> claim with leave to amend by October 16 because it lacked \"plausible and detailed allegations that DHS acted outside of its legal authority.\" Judge Peterson then denied dismissal of the APA claims because the Court had already ruled that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits. She also held that the statements made by high-level officials combined with the acknowledgement of a discriminatory effect were sufficient grounds for denying dismissal of the equal protection claim.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants moved for reconsideration of the motion to dismiss on October 8. Citing a Ninth Circuit ruling decided on the same day as Judge Peterson's order, <a href=\"../../../../case/16815/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ramos v. Wolf</a>&nbsp;(975 F.3d 872), defendants argued that the controlling law for dismissal of equal protection claims had changed.</p>\r\n<p><u>Ninth Circuit Affirms the Preliminary Injunction, But Vacates Nationwide Application</u></p>\r\n<p>On September 15, 2020, the Ninth Circuit heard arguments for the district court's stayed preliminary injunction with a new panel of judges (Circuit Judges Mary Schroeder, William Fletcher, and Lawrence VanDyke). On December 2, 2020, citing recent other circuit court decisions, it issued an order and a 2-1 opinion affirming the preliminary injunction but vacating the nationwide application of it. The Court also affirmed the preliminary injunction of a related case, <em><a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=17410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a></em>. 981 F.3d 742. Writing for the majority, Judge Schroeder first concluded that the plaintiff states had standing because they were suffering financial harm from immigrants shifting to state and local aid. Next, she found that the states demonstrated a high likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the Rule's definition of public charge was inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of the statute and was arbitrary and capricious. She also found that the remaining preliminary injunction factors favored the plaintiff states. Finally, she determined that the nationwide injunction was not appropriate because identical injunctions had been and were still being litigated in other federal district and circuit courts.</p>\r\n<p>Judge VanDyke dissented from the majority's analysis for the same reasons as the December 5, 2019 decision, citing the Supreme Court's stays from January, a dissenting opinion from a similar ruling in the Seventh Circuit (962 F.3d 208), and a contrary ruling from the Fourth Circuit (971 F.3d 220).</p>\r\n<p>On January 20, 2021, the Ninth Circuit granted a request by the government to stay its December 2, 2020 order affirming the preliminary injunctions, pending the Supreme Court's disposition on petitions for review from the Second and Seventh Circuits. The new public charge rule was to remain in effect until the Supreme Court ruled on the petitions.</p>\r\n<p>On January 22, 2021, the defendants filed a petition to the Supreme Court for review of the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 2021, Judge Peterson denied the government's motion to reconsider the Court's September 14 order granting in part and denying in part its motion to dismiss. 2021 WL 11732966. The Court found that, even in light of the <em>Ramos</em> decision, there was sufficient evidence here of discriminatory intent to prevent dismissal.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u></p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. The following day, the government notified the Court that it would be engaging in discussion with the plaintiff states over how this would impact litigation.</p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>.

Wolf</em></a>). That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition for <em>Cook County</em>, as well as similar petitions for the Ninth (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City and County of San Francisco v. USCIS</em></a>) and Second (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>New York v. DHS</em></a>) Circuits.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Ninth Circuit to defend the Rule in the hope of having it reinstated. They filed similar motions in the Seventh and Fourth Circuits, and a day later on March 11, they filed an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <em>Cook County</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, Judge Peterson stayed proceedings until April 12, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 2021 the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 to deny the motion to intervene without an opinion. 2021 WL 1310846. However, Judge Vandyke wrote a lengthy dissent, arguing that the Biden administration was now colluding with the plaintiffs in the Public Charge lawsuits, making their interests at odds with the interests of the states who were seeking to intervene. He explained that this case was clearly still worth pursuing, since it had sufficient merit to warrant Supreme Court review and the government was circumventing APA requirements. Moreover, even though the Rule had been vacated, there was still a chance the Supreme Court may reverse that decision, making this lawsuit not yet moot. The states who sought to intervene then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to weigh in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Peterson continued to extend the stay on proceedings on this case through 2022 given the Supreme Court's determination.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Supreme Court Dismisses the Writ for Certiorari</span></p>\r\n<p>On June 15, 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed the case regarding the states' motion to intervene in the Ninth Circuit. The Court, in an unsigned ruling dismissed the case &ldquo;improvidently granted&rdquo; indicating that the court concluded it was wrong to have taken up the dispute in the first place. Justice Roberts wrote a brief concurrence, stating that numerous concerns stood in the way of the Court reaching a decision on the merits (this included issues of standing, mootness, whether the APA authorizes district courts to vacate regulations on a nationwide basis, and more). 596 U.S. 763.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Voluntary Dismissal and a New Final Rule</span></p>\r\n<p>The Biden Administration then promulgated a new rule to replace the 2019 Rule.

    "summary_short": "In August of 2019, fourteen states filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The DHS' Public Charge Rule, enacted in August of 2019, increases the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. It is alleged that the Public Charge Rule will result in harm to the Plaintiff States and its residents because it will deter legal residents from enrolling in basic benefit programs, out of fear of being determined a \"public charge,\" and thus inadmissible for citizenship. District Court Judge Rosanna Peterson granted the Plaintiff States' Motion to Stay Pending Judicial Review and Preliminary Injunction, resulting in the Rule not being implemented as planned. The Ninth Circuit then stayed the lower courts order. The preliminary injunction was subsequently affirmed in the Ninth Circuit in December 2020. However, the order was stayed a few weeks later, leaving the stay of the preliminary injunction in effect. Currently, the injunction is stayed pending petitions to the Supreme Court. The Rule was abandoned by DHS on March 9, 2021 and vacated nationwide. The Biden Administration promulgated a new rule regarding public charge grounds for inadmissibility. Given the vacated 2019 Rule, and the new rule, the parties voluntarily dismissed the case on March 1, 2023. The case is now closed.",

The Court substitutes Chad F. Wolf for Kevin \n16  K. McAleenan in the caption, who was named as a Defendant in the Amended \nComplaint but is no longer Acting Secretary of DHS.

Chandler v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 598 \n3  F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010).   \n4  A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ.

Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“Public Charge Rule”).  In \n8  the Amended Complaint, the States raise four causes of action: (1) a violation of the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action \n10  contrary to the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”)3, the Personal \n11  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”)4, the Illegal \n12  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”)5, the \n13  Rehabilitation Act6, and the SNAP statute7; (2) a violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n14  706(2)(C), for agency action “in excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority” or \n15  “ultra vires”; (3) a violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action that \n16  is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion”; and (4) a violation of the \n17 \n \n3 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4), 1152, and 1182(a)(1). \n18 \n4 8 U.S.C. §§1611−13, 1621−22, and 1641. \n19 \n5 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1183a. \n20 \n6 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n21 \n7 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5602   Page 5 of 43\n \n1  guarantee of equal protection under the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment Due \n2  Process Clause.  ECF No. 31 at 161−70. \n3  The INA sets forth ten grounds of inadmissibility, all of which make a person \n4  “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States.”  8 \n5  U.S.C. § 1182(a).  This case concerns one of those grounds: a likelihood of \n6  becoming a public charge.  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \n7    In its current form, the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of \n8  the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the \n9  Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is \n10  likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”8  8 U.S.C. § \n11  1182(a)(4)(A).  The same provision requires the officer determining whether an \n12  applicant is inadmissible as a public charge to consider “at a minimum” the  \n13  applicant’s \n14    (I) age; \n  (II) health; \n15    (III) family status; \n  (IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and \n16    (V) education and skills. \n \n17  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \n18 \n \n19  8 When Congress transferred the adjudicatory functions of the former \nCommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) to the \n20  Secretary of DHS, the Attorney General’s authority regarding the public charge \nprovision was delegated to the Director of USCIS, a division of DHS.

Id. § \n3  1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). \n4  A.  Redefinition of “Public Charge” \n \n5    The Public Charge Rule, in its final format, defines “public charge” to denote \n6  “an alien who receives one or more public benefits, as defined in paragraph (b) of \n7  this section, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period \n8  (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).”  \n9  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a))9.  The Public Charge \n10  Rule redefines “public benefit” to include: “(1) [a]ny Federal, State, local, or tribal \n11  cash assistance for income maintenance (other than tax credits),” including \n12  Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n13  (“TANF”) or state “General Assistance”; (2) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \n14  Program (“SNAP,” colloquially known as “food stamps”); (3) housing assistance \n15  vouchers under Section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; (4) Section 8 “Project-\n16  Based” rental assistance, including “Moderate Rehabilitation”; (5) Medicaid, with \n17  exceptions for benefits for an emergency medical condition, services or benefits \n18  under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), school-based \n19  services or benefits, and benefits for immigrants under age 21 or to a woman during \n20 \n \n9 The Court’s subsequent references to the provisions of the Public Charge Rule \n21 \nuses the C.F.R. citations that took effect with the Public Charge Rule. \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5604   Page 7 of 43\n \n1  pregnancy or within 60 days after pregnancy; and (6) public housing under Section 9 \n2  of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.  8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b). \n3  B.  Weighted Factors for Totality of the Circumstances Determination \n4  The Public Charge Rule instructs officers to evaluate whether an applicant is \n5  “likely to become a public charge” using a “totality of the circumstances” test that \n6  “at least entail[s] consideration of the alien’s age; health; family status; education \n7  and skills; and assets, resources, and financial status” as described in the Rule.  8 \n8  C.F.R. § 212.22(a), (b).  The Public Charge Rule then prescribes a variety of factors \n9  to weigh “positively,” in favor of a determination that an applicant is not a public \n10  charge, and factors to weigh “negatively,” in favor of finding the applicant \n11  inadmissible as a public charge.  8 C.F.R. § 212.22(a), (b), and (c); see also, e.g., 84 \n12  Fed. Reg. 41,295 (“Specifically, the rule contains a list of negative and positive \n13  factors that DHS will consider as part of this determination, and directs officers to \n14  consider these factors in the totality of the alien’s circumstances. . . . The rule also \n15  contains lists of heavily weighted negative factors and heavily weighted positive \n16  factors.”).  The Public Charge Rule attributes heavy negative weight to the following \n17  circumstances: \n18    (1) “not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is \nunable to demonstrate current employment, recent employment history, \n19 \nor a reasonable prospect of future employment”; \n  (2) “certified or approved to receive one or more public benefits \n20 \n. . .  for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \nperiod,  beginning  no  earlier  than  36  months  prior  to  the  alien’s \n21 \napplication for admission or adjustment of status”;  \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5605   Page 8 of 43\n \n1    (3) “diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require \nextensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere \n2 \nwith the alien’s ability to provide for himself or herself, attend school, \nor work; and . . . uninsured and has neither the prospect of obtaining \n3 \nprivate  health  insurance,  nor  the  financial  resources  to  pay  for \nreasonably  foreseeable  medical  costs  related  to  such  medical \n4 \ncondition”; and \n5    (4)  “previously  found  inadmissible  or  deportable  on  public \ncharge grounds[.]” \n6 \n \n8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(i)−(iv). \n7 \n \n  Conversely, the Public Charge Rule attributes heavy positive weight to three \n8 \nfactors: \n9 \n  (1) an annual household income, assets, or resources above 250 \n10 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (“FPG”) for the household \nsize;  \n11 \n  (2) an annual individual income of at least 250 percent of the \n12  FPG for the household size; and \n(3)  private  health  insurance  that  is  not  subsidized  under  the \n13 \nAffordable Care Act. \n \n14 \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)(i)−(iii). \n \n15 \n  The Public Charge Rule also directs officers to consider whether the applicant \n16 \n(1) is under the age of 18 or over the minimum early retirement age for social \n17 \nsecurity; (2) has a medical condition that will require extensive treatment or interfere \n18 \nwith the ability to attend school or work; (3) has an annual household gross income \n19 \nunder 125 percent of the FPG; (4) has a household size that makes the immigrant \n20 \nlikely to become a public charge at any time in the future; (5) lacks significant \n21 \nassets, like savings accounts, stocks, bonds, or real estate; (6) lacks significant assets \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5606   Page 9 of 43\n \n1  and resources to cover reasonably foreseeable medical costs; (7) has any financial \n2  liabilities; (8) has applied for, been certified to receive, or received public benefits \n3  after October 15, 2019; (9) has applied for or has received a USCIS fee waiver for an \n4  immigration benefit request; (10) has a poor credit history and credit score; (11) \n5  lacks private health insurance or other resources to cover reasonably foreseeable \n6  medical costs; (12) lacks a high school diploma (or equivalent) or a higher education \n7  degree; (13) lacks occupational skills, certifications, or licenses; or (14) is not \n8  proficient in English.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b). \n9    The officer administering the public charge admissibility test may determine \n10  what factors are relevant and may consider factors beyond those enumerated in the \n11  rule.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(a) \n12  C.  Applicability of the Rule \n13  The Public Charge Rule applies to non-citizens subject to section 212(a)(4) of \n14  the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), who apply to DHS for admission to the United \n15  States or for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident.  See 8 C.F.R. \n16  § 212.20. \n17  The Public Charge Rule was set to take effect on October 15, 2019.  84 Fed. \n18  Reg. at 41,292.

Standing \n2  The role of a federal court “is neither to issue advisory opinions nor to declare \n3  rights in hypothetical cases, but to adjudicate live cases or controversies consistent \n4  with the powers granted the judiciary in Article III of the Constitution.”  Thomas v. \n5  Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). \n6  To satisfy the “‘irreducible constitutional minimum’” for standing under \n7  Article III, a plaintiff must establish three elements: “(1) injury in fact (2) that is \n8  fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant and (3) that is likely to be \n9  redressed by a favorable decision.”  Skyline v. Wesleyan Church v. Cal. Dep’t of \n10  Managed Health Care, 959 F.3d 341, 349 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of \n11  Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560−61 (1992)).  “[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.” \n12  Davis v. Federal Election Comm’n, 554 U. S. 724, 734 (2008) (quoting Lewis v. \n13  Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 358, n. 6 (1996) (alteration omitted)).  Rather, “‘a plaintiff \n14  must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of \n15  relief that is sought.’”  Id.  In cases involving multiple plaintiffs, one plaintiff must \n16  have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.  Town of \n17  Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650−51 (2017). \n18  In the Preliminary Injunction Order, this Court previously extensively \n19  analyzed and found that the States satisfied the standing requirements.  ECF No. \n20  162 at 11−26.  The Court found that the States had alleged sufficient injury to \n21  satisfy the first prong of the standing inquiry.  Id. at 23−24.  The Court also found \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5610   Page 13 of 43\n \n1  that the harms alleged by the States were fairly traceable to the Public Charge \n2  Rule.   \n3  The Court determined that the States made a strong showing at the \n4  preliminary injunction stage that applying the multi-factor totality of the \n5  circumstances test and the expanded definition of “public charge” would “result in \n6  disparate results” across the USCIS officials administering the exclusion.  ECF No. \n7  162 at 25.  The States further demonstrated predictable harm from the chilling \n8  effect from the “unmistakable” message sent by the broadened scope of the public \n9  charge inadmissibility ground.  Id.  The Court found that “the chilling effect of the \n10  Public Charge Rule likely will lead individuals to disenroll from benefits, because \n11  receipt of those benefits likely would subject them to a public charge \n12  determination, and, equally foreseeably, because the Public Charge Rule will \n13  create fear and confusion regarding public charge inadmissibility.”  Id.  The Court \n14  further found equally predictable the damage that the States had shown was likely \n15  to their missions, the health and wellbeing of their residents, citizens and non-\n16  citizens alike, and the States’ budgets and economies.  Id. at 26.  \n17  DHS argues in its Motion to Dismiss that the Public Charge Rule “governs \n18  DHS personnel and certain aliens,” but neither requires nor forbids any action by the \n19  States and does not “expressly interfere with any of [the States’] programs \n20  applicable to aliens.”  ECF No. 223 at 13.  DHS further argues that the States do not \n21  “adequately allege that the Rule would produce a net increase in costs” for the \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5611   Page 14 of 43\n \n1  States.  Id.  Rather, DHS contends, the Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the “broader \n2  chilling effect” support that the Public Charge Rule would conserve the States’ \n3  resources through decreased receipt of state benefits overall and through \n4  “discouraging reliance” on state benefits.  Id.  Additionally, DHS argues that the \n5  States lack organizational or parens patriae standing.  Id. at 14. \n6  The Court previously heard and addressed DHS’s arguments that the States \n7  have not stated an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of \n8  the defendant, and the Court finds no basis to depart from its prior analysis and \n9  conclusion that the States have sufficiently alleged concrete and particularized \n10  injuries resulting from DHS’s promulgation of the Public Charge Rule.   \n11  As the three Circuit judges on the motions panel that granted DHS’s stay of \n12  the preliminary injunction unanimously agreed,11 “the States have shown that they \n13  have suffered and will suffer direct injuries traceable to the Final Rule and thus have \n14  standing to challenge its validity.”  San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 787.  In reaching that \n15  conclusion, the motions panel found that DHS’s arguments that the Plaintiff’s \n16  allegations of future financial harm are too attenuated and speculative to support \n17  standing were “unavailing” and “disingenuous . . . when [DHS] acknowledge these \n18  costs in its own rulemaking process.”  Id. at 787;  see also New York,  2020 U.S. \n19 \n \n11 In contrast to the motions panel Circuit judges’ unanimity regarding standing, \n20 \nthe panel split 2-1 regarding the application of the stay factors set forth by Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 427, 433−34 (2009).  See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at \n21 \n809−10.   \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5612   Page 15 of 43\n \n1  App. LEXIS 24492, at *25  (“Where the agency itself forecasts the injuries claimed \n2  by the States, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that it is ‘disingenuous’ for DHS to \n3  claim that the injury is not sufficiently imminent.”) (quoting San Francisco, 944 \n4  F.3d at 787). \n5  Therefore, as DHS concedes in its reply, the States have established standing \n6  for their APA claims.  ECF No. 236 at 9 n. 3.  However, DHS contests in a footnote \n7  whether the States have standing to pursue their equal protection claim, asserting \n8  that the States lack standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the federal \n9  government under Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 \n10  U.S. 592, 610 n.16 (1982).  ECF Nos. 223 at 9 n. 2; 336 at 9 n. 3. \n11  States are “not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal \n12  jurisdiction,” and are entitled to “special solicitude” when they seek to vindicate \n13  their “proprietary” or “quasi-sovereign” interests.  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n14  497, 518 (2007).  Quasi-sovereign interests are “independent of the benefits that \n15  might accrue to any particular individual,” and the Supreme Court has recognized \n16  that neither an exhaustive formal definition nor a definitive list of qualifying \n17  interests can be presented in the abstract . . . .”  Snapp, 458 U.S. at 607.  However, \n18  the Supreme Court has recognized as a general category of interests “the health and \n19  well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general[,]” which \n20  includes a state’s “substantial interest in securing its residents from the harmful \n21  effects of discrimination.”  Snapp, 458 U.S. at 608−09 (adding, “This Court has had \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5613   Page 16 of 43\n \n1  too much experience with the political, social, and moral damage of discrimination \n2  not to recognize that a State has a substantial interest in assuring its residents that it \n3  will act to protect them from these evils.”).  A state also must allege a sufficiently \n4  “substantial” effect on its residents, “rather than a narrow and definable class.”  Aziz \n5  v. Trump, 231 F. Supp. 3d 23, 32 (E.D. Va. 2017) (citing Snapp, 458 U.S. at \n6  607−09).  When evaluating whether an effect is substantial, a court must consider \n7  both persons who are directly and indirectly affected.  Id. \n8  Although DHS argues that there is a blanket prohibition against parens patriae \n9  suits by states against the federal government, courts have widely observed that \n10  Massachusetts v. EPA cannot be reconciled with an absolute bar against parens \n11  patriae standing for a state suing the federal government.  Compare ECF Nos. 223 at \n12  9 n. 2; 336 at 9 n. 3 with Ariz. State Legis. v. Ariz. Ind. Redistricting Comm’n, 576 \n13  U.S. 787, 802 n. 10 (2015); Wash. Utils. And Transp. Comm’n v. Fed. Commc’ns \n14  Comm’n, 513 F.2d 1142, 1153 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 836 (1975) (finding \n15  state standing based on parens patriae against the federal government); Aziz, 231 F. \n16  Supp. 3d 23 (finding state standing to pursue the equal protection claims of its \n17  residents in litigation challenging the Trump Administration’s second ban on travel \n18  from majority-Muslim countries).   \n19  As with the States’ APA claims, the States’ allegations demonstrate a \n20  sufficiently concrete stake in the outcome of this lawsuit for purposes of their equal \n21  protection claim.  The nature of the equal protection claim they raise implicates their \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5614   Page 17 of 43\n \n1  quasi-sovereign interests in the health and well-being of their residents, and their \n2  interests in securing their residents from the harmful effects of discrimination.  See \n3  Snapp, 458 U.S. at 608−09. \n4  Therefore, the Court denies DHS’s Motion to Dismiss with respect to \n5  standing. \n6  B.   Zone of Interests \n7  For the claims that the States are pursuing under the APA, they must satisfy \n8  an additional test beyond Article III’s standing requirements; the interests asserted \n9  by an APA plaintiff “must be ‘arguably within the zone of interests to be protected \n10  or regulated by the statute’ that [the plaintiff] says was violated.”  Match-E-Be-\n11  Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012) \n12  (quoting Assoc. of Data Processing Serv. Org., Inc., 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)).  The \n13  zone of interests test is not “especially demanding.”  Id. at 225.  Moreover, the \n14  Supreme Court has emphasized Congress’s “‘evident intent’ when enacting the APA \n15  ‘to make agency action presumptively reviewable.’”  Id. (quoting Clarke v. Sec. \n16  Indus. Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)).  The Supreme Court has “conspicuously \n17  include the word ‘arguably’ in the test to indicate that the benefit of any doubt goes \n18  to the plaintiff.”  Id. (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399).  There is no requirement that \n19  a would-be plaintiff demonstrate any “indication of congressional purpose to \n20  benefit” that plaintiff.  Id.  “The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s ‘interests \n21  are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5615   Page 18 of 43\n \n1  that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’”  Id. \n2  (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399).  \n3  DHS argues that the States fall outside of the zone of interests protected by the \n4  public charge inadmissibility provision in the INA because the States’ “‘interests are  \n5  . . . marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute.’”  \n6  ECF No. 236 at 4 (quoting Clark, 479 U.S. at 399).  DHS argues that the States’ \n7  “interest here is practically the inverse” of the public charge provision’s objective of \n8  “conserv[ing] federal and State resources by excluding aliens who are likely to \n9  consume public benefits” because “the States here seek to conserve their resources \n10  by enhancing reliance on federal resources.”  Id. at 11 (emphasis in original) \n11  The States respond that the protection of state fiscs has been an objective of \n12  the public charge exclusion since it was instituted.  ECF No. 233 at 21 (citing \n13  Hidetaka Hirota, Expelling the Poor 185 (2017)).  The States further argue that the \n14  INA itself recognizes the states’ role and authority in administering public benefits \n15  programs.  Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1183(a), (b), (e)(2); Texas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, \n16  163 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d by an equally divided Court, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016)).  The \n17  States argue that they administer the public benefits programs at issue in the Public \n18  Charge Rule, and are “well within the zone of interests, as the Rule imposes \n19  significant uncompensated costs on them and undermines the administration of their \n20  comprehensive public assistance program.”  Id.  \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5616   Page 19 of 43\n \n1  DHS argues about the States’ fiscs from a discrete framework of immediate \n2  costs expended for public benefits, such as SNAP or housing assistance, as opposed \n3  to the States’ long-range view of fiscs including long-term costs of citizens who are \n4  deprived of adequate food or housing before they achieve citizenship.  At this early \n5  stage of litigation, this Court is satisfied that the States meet the zone of interests \n6  standard by identifying the original purpose of the public charge exclusion as \n7  protecting “state fiscs” as well as the long-range impact on the States’ fiscs of \n8  potential citizens forgoing lawful benefits in order to steer clear of the “public \n9  charge” net.12  As the Seventh Circuit observed in finding that Cook County’s \n10  financial interests suffice to bring it within the zone of interests of the public charge \n11  provision, “though the purpose of the public-charge provision is to screen for and \n12  promote ‘self-sufficiency’ among immigrants, it is not obvious what self-sufficiency \n13  means.”  Cook Cty. v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 220 (7th Cir. 2020).  The Seventh Circuit \n14  continued: \n15  Subsidies  abound  in  the  modern  world,  from  discounted  or  free \ntransportation for seniors, to public snow removal, to school lunches, \n16  to childhood vaccinations, and much more.  Ensuring that immigrants \nhave access to affordable basic health care, for example, may promote \n17  their  greater  self-sufficiency  in  other  domains,  including  income, \nhousing, and nutrition.  It also protects the community at large from \n18  highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19.  Cook County’s interest \nin ensuring lawful immigrants’ access to authorized federal and state \n19  public benefits is not plainly inconsistent with the text of the statute.  Its \n20 \n \n12 At the preliminary injunction stage of this case, the Court also found that the \n21 \nStates met the zone of interests standard.

Precedential Weight of Emergency Stay Opinions \n6 \nWith respect to numerous issues raised by the Motion to Dismiss, DHS argues \n7 \nthat the Ninth Circuit’s stay opinion is “precedential” and “controlling” on this \n8 \nCourt.  See, e.g., ECF No. 236 at 12 (arguing that this Court is bound by the Ninth \n9 \nCircuit stay opinion’s discussion and conclusions regarding Chevron step one).  \n10 \nDHS also cites to the Supreme Court’s opinions granting DHS’s applications to stay \n11 \npreliminary injunctions of the Public Charge Rule “including one involving an equal \n12 \nprotection claim similar to that alleged in this case.”  ECF No. 136 at 1 n. 1 (citing \n13 \nNew York, 140 S. Ct. 599; Wolf, 140 S. Ct. 681).   \n14 \nSubject to various exceptions, the law of the case doctrine generally requires \n15 \ncourts to “refuse to reconsider an issue that has already been decided by the same \n16 \ncourt or a higher court in the same case.”  Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677 F.3d 383, 389 \n17 \nn.4 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Jeffries v. Wood, 114 F.3d 1484, 1488−89 (9th Cir. 1997) \n18 \n(en banc)).  Recognized exceptions include: “‘(1) the decision is clearly erroneous \n19 \nand its enforcement would work a manifest injustice, (2) intervening controlling \n20 \nauthority makes reconsideration appropriate, or (3) substantially different evidence \n21 \nwas adduced at a subsequent trial.’”  Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 389 n. 4 (quoting \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5618   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  Jeffries, 114 F.3d at 1489 (footnote omitted) (quoting Caldwell v. Unified Capital \n2  Corp. (In re Rainbow Magazine, Inc.), 77 F.3d 278, 281 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal \n3  quotation marks omitted)).  \n4  This Court’s reading of the relevant caselaw outlining the parameters of the \n5  law of the case finds no support for DHS’s argument that the motions panel’s \n6  decision regarding an emergency stay of a preliminary injunction is binding with \n7  respect to the issues before this Court on DHS’s Motion to Dismiss.  The Ninth \n8  Circuit was not reviewing whether the claims raised by the States’ Amended \n9  Complaint should be dismissed under the Iqbal/Twombly standard that is applicable \n10  to a motion to dismiss.  See San Francisco, 944 F.3d 773.  As the Ninth Circuit \n11  recently observed, the question before the merits panel resolving an appeal of a \n12  preliminary injunction order is “doctrinally distinct” from the question of a stay \n13  pending review posed to a motions panel.  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 \n14  F.3d 1242, 1263−64 (9th Cir. 2020).  “‘[T]here are important differences between a \n15  preliminary injunction and a stay pending review.’”  Id. (quoting Leiva-Perez v. \n16  Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 2011)).  A merits panel resolving an appeal of a \n17  preliminary injunction is asking whether the district court abused its discretion while \n18  a motions panel instead is evaluating a stay request in “‘likelihood terms,’” and \n19  asking whether “the government raised serious questions relating to the propriety of \n20  the district court’s preliminary injunction and whether the government would likely \n21  prevail on appeal[.]”  Id. (quoting Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 967).  The “question \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5619   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  presented to the motions panel is an additional step removed from the underlying \n2  merits of the district court's preliminary injunction.”  Id. at 1264 (observing that the \n3  appellate court “exercise[s] restraint in assessing the merits of either question, but \n4  particularly so when considering the ‘extraordinary request’ to stay a preliminary \n5  injunction granted by a district court.”) (quoting Barr v. E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, \n6  140 S. Ct. 3, 4 (2019) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting from grant of a stay)).   \n7  The questions now before this Court differ significantly from the question that \n8  the Court previously faced in determining the preliminary injunction.  Now, the \n9  Court must consider whether the States’ Amended Complaint, ECF No. 31, bears \n10  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state claims to relief that are plausible \n11  on their face.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  During the preliminary injunction phase, \n12  the Court was applying the Winter13 and Nken14 factors to determine whether a \n13  preliminary injunction was appropriate.   \n14  Likewise, the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of any of the claims \n15  raised by plaintiffs in the Public Charge Rule litigation from the Second Circuit.  See \n16  Wolf, 140 S. Ct. at 682 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (noting that in granting the \n17  Government’s application for a stay in New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, “[n]o Member of \n18  the [Supreme] Court discussed the application’s merit apart from its challenges to \n19  the injunction’s nationwide scope.”). \n20   \n13 Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). \n21 \n14 Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 425−26 (2009). \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5620   Page 23 of 43\n \n1  The Court is mindful that it is bound by Ninth Circuit decisions.  However, it \n2  would be a travesty of due process for the litigants to bind district courts at a motion \n3  to dismiss stage to a decision made by a motions panel using a different standard of \n4  review to consider a different set of factors regarding whether to stay a preliminary \n5  injunction.  Indeed, much of the concern expressed in legal conferences, appellate \n6  decisions, and the academy concern the bar that nationwide injunctions create in \n7  allowing cases to “percolate” through the system from the trial court, through the \n8  appellate court, and finally to the Supreme Court.  See CASA de Md., Inc. v. Trump, \n9  No. 19-2222, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 24672, at *85−86 (4th Cir. Aug. 5, 2020); \n10  Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 \n11  Harv. L. Rev. 418, 420−21 (2017).  Accordingly, the Court rejects DHS’s argument \n12  that this Court’s consideration of the Motion to Dismiss is circumscribed by the \n13  Ninth Circuit motion panel’s stay opinion.  \n14  DISCUSSION \n15    DHS moves to dismiss the States’ Amended Complaint in its entirety.  ECF \n16  No. 223. \n17  A.  Counts I and III: Contrary to Law under the APA; Arbitrary and \n18  Capricious under the APA \n19  In the Preliminary Injunction Order, this Court found that the States had \n20  shown that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the APA \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5621   Page 24 of 43\n \n1  that the Public Charge Rule is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.  ECF \n2  No. 162 at 34−50; see 5 U.S.C. § 702; 706(2)(A). \n3  To prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show that \n4  he or she is likely to succeed on the merits.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  By contrast, as \n5  outlined above, a motion to dismiss should not be granted “unless it appears \n6  beyond doubt that Plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that \n7  would entitle him to relief.”  Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, 18 F. 3d 752, 754 \n8  (9th Cir. 1994).  A motion to dismiss provides for early disposal of actions “‘that \n9  are fatally flawed in their legal premises and destined to fail, and thus spare \n10  litigants the burdens of unnecessary pretrial and trial activity.’”  Forsberg v. Fid. \n11  Nat’l Credit Servs., No. 03cv2193-DMS(AJB), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7622, at *4 \n12  (S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2004) (quoting Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc. v. Scimed \n13  Life Sys., Inc., 988 F.2d 1157, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). \n14  At this stage in the countrywide Public Charge Rule litigation, two higher \n15  courts, the Seventh and the Second Circuits, have affirmed preliminary injunction \n16  orders in part based on conclusions that the Public Charge Rule is contrary to the \n17  INA, providing extensive analysis of both Chevron steps one and two.  New York, \n18  2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 24492, at *35−76 (heavily analyzing IRIIRA and \n19  PRWORA along with the INA); Cook Cty., 962 F.3d at 221−29 (concluding that \n20  the Public Charge Rule is not a reasonable interpretation of the INA, the \n21  Rehabilitation Act, or the SNAP statute).  The Second and Seventh Circuits also \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5622   Page 25 of 43\n \n1  concluded that the district courts properly found that DHS’s policymaking process \n2  was flawed and that the Public Charge Rule, therefore, is arbitrary and capricious.  \n3  New York, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 24492, at *76−89; Cook Cty., 962 F.3d at \n4  229−32.  The Fourth Circuit subsequently reversed a preliminary injunction order \n5  based in part on its conclusion that the Public Charge Rule likely is a permissible \n6  interpretation of the INA.  CASA de Md., Inc., 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 24672, at \n7  *36−72.  \n8  In short, the analyses of the Circuit Courts with respect to the merits of the \n9  contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious claims vary significantly, and, the \n10  Circuits in which merits panels have resolved DHS’s appeals of the preliminary \n11  injunctions issued in the Public Charge Rule litigation are split in their conclusions.  \n12  Moreover, the time for petitioning for rehearing en banc has not yet expired with \n13  respect to all of the opinions.  See Fed. R. App. P. 35, 40.   \n14  In light of the fact that this Court already found that the States were likely to \n15  succeed on their APA claims, there is no justification to revisit the analysis of \n16  those claims, given the less demanding standard for surviving a motion to dismiss.  \n17  See Clegg, 18 F. 3d at 754; see also New York, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134493, at \n18  *21 (reaching the same conclusion while DHS’s appeal of the preliminary \n19  injunction order issued by the Southern District of New York was still pending).  \n20  Furthermore, the fact that two higher courts have found that district courts properly \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5623   Page 26 of 43\n \n1  found that the Public Charge Rule is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious \n2  heavily reinforces the conclusion that the States’ APA claims are plausible.   \n3  Certainly, this Court may significantly revise its analysis of the States’ APA \n4  claims if and when the Court is faced with the merits of the States’ Counts I and III \n5  with a fully developed record.  However, DHS’s Motion to Dismiss is not the \n6  appropriate prompt to revisit that analysis or contribute to the lucid, rigorous \n7  discourse among the higher courts regarding identical issues raised by the States’ \n8  APA claims.  The Ninth Circuit stay opinion in this case also does not compel this \n9  Court to revisit its earlier analysis of the contrary to law and arbitrary and \n10  capricious claims because DHS’s appeal of the Preliminary Injunction Order is still \n11  pending.  A Ninth Circuit merits panel has not yet entered the nationwide \n12  discussion of the merits of APA claims challenging the Public Charge Rule, thus \n13  leaving this issue still open in the Ninth Circuit.   \n14  Therefore, this Court denies the Motion to Dismiss with respect to Count I, \n15  the contrary to law claim, and Count III, the arbitrary and capricious claim, on the \n16  rationale that the Court already found the States likely to prevail on these APA \n17  claims based on the more demanding preliminary injunction standard, thereby \n18  satisfying the lower Iqbal/Twombly threshold of plausibility under Rule 12(b)(6).   \n19  B.  Count II: Ultra Vires Conduct \n20  The Court next considers whether the States have alleged a sufficient basis to \n21  find their ultra vires claim plausible.  The States allege in their Amended Complaint \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5624   Page 27 of 43\n \n1  that the “INA does not permit—either expressly or impliedly—[DHS] to expand its \n2  authority” by extending the public charge exclusion to reach applicants for visa \n3  extensions and change of status.  ECF Nos. 31 at 171; 233 at 37.   \n4  DHS argues that the States fail to state a claim because the Public Charge \n5  Rule “independently sets a new condition for approval of extension of stay and \n6  change of status applications and petitions pursuant to its ample statutory authority \n7  to impose such conditions.”  ECF No. 236 at 26.  DHS contends that unlike the \n8  public charge inadmissibility determination, the Public Charge Rule introduces an \n9  “exclusively backward-looking condition for extension of stay and change of status \n10  applications” that treats “proof that an alien has used covered benefits for 12 or more \n11  months in a 36 month period since gaining his or her nonimmigrant status” as “itself \n12  disqualifying.”  Id.  DHS maintains that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1184 and 1258 assign DHS the \n13  authority to set these conditions for the relevant applications.  Id. \n14  The States respond that “DHS’s distinction between backward- and forward-\n15  looking assessments disintegrates under scrutiny” because the public charge \n16  exclusion test is also backward looking.  ECF No. 233 at 38 (pointing out that an \n17  individual’s past use of public benefits is counted against them when the officer \n18  predicts their future use of benefits).  The States urge that DHS may not simply \n19  borrow a legal standard that Congress established for a certain statutory application \n20  and apply it to a completely different statutory application.  Id. (citing Comcast \n21  Corp. v. FCC, 600 F.3d 642, 655 (D.C. Cir. 2010) for the proposition that an agency \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5625   Page 28 of 43\n \n1  may not use a Congressional statement of policy in one statutory provision as a basis \n2  to interpret a different statutory provision). \n3  Non-statutory review of agency action that is allegedly ultra vires, or beyond \n4  the agency’s legislative authority, is designed to determine whether the agency has \n5  acted “without any authority whatsoever.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \n6  Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101 n.11 (1984) (internal quotation omitted).  In \n7  determining whether an agency regulation is ultra vires, courts apply the Chevron \n8  two-step Chevron analysis.  City of Arlington v. F.C.C., 569 U.S. 290, 295 (2013); \n9  Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder, 702 F.3d 504, 525 (9th Cir. 2012); Chevron U.S.A., \n10  Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).  The Court’s first task \n11  under Chevron is to “give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of \n12  Congress.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.  If Congress has “directly spoken to the \n13  precise question at issue[,]” the inquiry stops there, as the unambiguously expressed \n14  intent of Congress governs.  Id. at 842−43.  However, “[i]f the statute is silent or \n15  ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the \n16  agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”  Id. at 843. \n17  The public charge ground of inadmissibility does not apply to individuals who \n18  hold nonimmigrant student or exchange visitor visas seeking to extend their stay or \n19  change their nonimmigrant status.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).  However, as part of \n20  the Public Charge Rule, DHS imposed a “public benefits condition” that renders \n21  those nonimmigrant visa holders ineligible for an extension of stay or change of \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5626   Page 29 of 43\n \n1  status if they received public benefits for more than twelve months, in the aggregate, \n2  within any 36-month period after the alien obtained the nonimmigrant status he or \n3  she seeks to extend or change.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1(a)(3)(iv), 428.1(a), and \n4  248.1(c)(4). \n5  Admission on a nonimmigrant visa to the United States “shall be for such time \n6  and under such conditions” as the Attorney General prescribes through regulation.  8 \n7  U.S.C. § 1184(a)(1).  In addition, the Secretary of Homeland Security “may, under \n8  such conditions as he may prescribe, authorize a change from any nonimmigrant \n9  classification to any other nonimmigrant classification in the case of any alien \n10  lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant . . .[,]” subject to limited \n11  exceptions.  8 U.S.C. § 1258.   \n12  The States do not make any argument for why this statutory text is ambiguous, \n13  and the Court agrees with DHS that on its face the authority allocated to DHS \n14  encompasses a regulation that imposes the public benefits condition.  Therefore, the \n15  Court does not proceed past step one of Chevron.  467 U.S. at 842−43.  The ultra \n16  vires claim challenges not whether the public benefits condition, and the distinction \n17  that DHS is drawing between that condition and the public charge exclusion, make \n18  sense or deteriorate under scrutiny, as the States argue.  See ECF No. 233 at 38.  \n19  Rather, the ultra vires claim is not plausible unless the States can direct the court to \n20  exactly what authority DHS exceeds by including the public benefits condition in the \n21  Public Charge Rule. \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5627   Page 30 of 43\n \n1  In the absence of plausible and detailed allegations that DHS acted outside of \n2  its legal authority regarding nonimmigrant visa extensions and changes of status, the \n3  Court grants DHS’s Motion to Dismiss the States’ Count II for ultra vires action \n4  without prejudice.  See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  However, the Court has no basis on \n5  which to conclude that the States could not remedy the defects with an amended \n6  pleading.  Therefore, the Court grants leave to amend.  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d \n7  1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (leave to amend is appropriate unless the district court \n8  determines that the pleading “could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other \n9  facts”) (internal quotation omitted). \n10  C.  Count IV: Denial of the Right to Equal Protection under the Fifth \n11  Amendment Due Process Clause \n12  The States’ fourth claim, for denial of equal protection, remains for the Court \n13  to evaluate and determine whether the States’ allegations plausibly give rise to an \n14  entitlement to relief.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.  The States allege in their Amended \n15  Complaint that the Public Charge Rule was “motivated by Administration officials’ \n16  intent to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin.”  ECF No. 31 \n17  at 176−77.   The States allege that the discriminatory purpose behind the Public \n18  Charge Rule violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n19  Constitution.

Standard of Review \n2  The parties disagree as to the appropriate standard of review to apply to the \n3  States’ equal protection claims.  See ECF Nos. 236 at 31−32; 233 at 50.  DHS argues \n4  that deferential rational basis review, rather than strict scrutiny, applies to the Public \n5  Charge Rule “unless Plaintiffs establish discriminatory intent.”  ECF No. 223 at 32 \n6  (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976), for the proposition that \n7  disproportionate impact alone “does not trigger the rule . . . that racial classifications \n8  are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny).  DHS also relies on Trump v. Hawaii, \n9  138 S. Ct. 2392, 2418, 2419 (2018), to argue that rational basis is appropriate to \n10  review the Public Charge Rule because it concerns the “admission and exclusion of \n11  foreign nationals, ‘a matter within the core of executive responsibility.’”  Id. (citing \n12  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2418).  DHS asserts that the narrower rational basis review \n13  contemplated by Hawaii, should apply to any government policies regarding the \n14  admission of aliens.  ECF No. 236 at 32. \n15  The States assert that they may offer circumstantial evidence in support of a \n16  reasonable inference of discriminatory intent.  ECF No. 233 at 50 (relying on \n17  Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264−65 (1977)).  The \n18  States argue that Hawaii does not require rational basis review here because: (1) the \n19  statute at issue in Hawaii, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), contains much more deferential \n20  language regarding executive discretion than the public charge provision at 8 U.S.C. \n21  § 1182(a)(4);  (2) the “international affairs and national security” concerns present in \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5629   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  Hawaii are not present here, where DHS has offered only economic justifications for \n2  the Public Charge Rule; and (3) Hawaii challenged executive action regarding “the \n3  entry of foreign nationals” into the United States but the Public Charge Rule applies \n4  in part to individuals who are already lawfully present in the United States.  ECF \n5  No. 233 at 52−53; Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409, 2420 n. 5. \n6  The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains an equal protection \n7  component that prohibits denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.  \n8  United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013).   One framework for \n9  demonstrating an equal protection violation is to show that “‘defendants acted with \n10  an intent or purpose to discriminate against the plaintiff based on membership in a \n11  protected class.’”  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 686 (9th Cir. 2001) \n12  (quoting Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, \n13  525 U.S. 1154 (1999).  “Where the challenged governmental policy is ‘facially \n14  neutral,’ proof of its disproportionate impact on an identifiable group can satisfy the \n15  intent requirement only if it tends to show that some invidious or discriminatory \n16  purpose underlies the policy.’”  Id. (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264−66).  \n17  The Arlington Heights framework is one method of “alleging a viable equal \n18  protection claim.  See Ramos v. Nielsen, 321 F. Supp. 3d 1083, 1125 (N.D. Cal. \n19  2018) (citing a U.S. Department of Justice legal manual explaining that Arlington \n20  Heights and the framework provided by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5630   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  U.S. 792, 802−03 (1973), provide alternative methods of proving intentional \n2  discrimination).   \n3  In Hawaii, the Supreme Court resolved an Establishment Clause challenge to \n4  an executive order restricting entry into the United States by aliens from several \n5  countries.  138 S. Ct. at 2403.  The Court held that “plaintiffs’ request for a \n6  searching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the President’s justifications” was \n7  “inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded \n8  the President in this sphere.”  138 S. Ct. at 2409. \n9  At least two other district courts already have rejected DHS’s contention that \n10  the narrow standard of review from Hawaii applies in the context of the Public \n11  Charge Rule, and this Court also finds Hawaii distinguishable for purposes of the \n12  appropriate standard by which to evaluate the States’ equal protection claim.  See \n13  Cook Cty. v. Wolf, Case No. 19-C-6334, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87687, at *25−28; \n14  La Clinica de la Raza v. Trump, Case No. 19-cv-4980-PJH, 2020 U.S. 141725, at * \n15  52−57 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2020). \n16  First, Hawaii addressed foreign nationals seeking initial entry into the \n17  territorial United States.  138 S. Ct. at 2403−04.  By contrast, the Public Charge Rule \n18  applies to applicants for initial admission to the United States as well as to persons \n19  already within the United States seeking to adjust status.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.20.   \n20  Noncitizens have long been recognized to enjoy greater constitutional \n21  protections than those outside the geographic borders who are seeking admission for \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5631   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  the first time.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (explaining that \n2  “certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the United States are \n3  unavailable to aliens outside of our geographic borders . . . [b]ut once an alien enters \n4  the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to \n5  all ‘persons’ within the United States, including aliens . . . .”); Landon v. Plascencia, \n6  459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982) (noting that “once an alien gains admission to our country \n7  and begins to develop the ties that go with permanent residence his constitutional \n8  status changes accordingly”).  The Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court have held \n9  explicitly that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \n10  protect even those noncitizens who are in the United States without legal status.  \n11  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (“Even one whose presence in this country \n12  is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection.”); \n13  Lopez-Valenzuela v. Arpaio, 770 F.3d 772, 781 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (same); see \n14  also Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369−70 (1886) (applying Fourteenth \n15  Amendment due process and equal protection provisions “to all persons within the \n16  territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of \n17  nationality”); Wong v. INS, 373 F.3d 952, 974 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The entry fiction \n18  does not preclude non-admitted aliens . . . from coming within the ambit of the equal \n19  protection component of the Due Process Clause.”).  Nothing in the Hawaii decision \n20  indicates that it disturbed this line of caselaw differentiating between the \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5632   Page 35 of 43\n \n1  constitutional status of foreign nationals seeking initial admission at the border and \n2  foreign nationals already present in the geographic United States.   \n3  Second, the Supreme Court indicated in Hawaii that executive action is \n4  shielded from a more “searching inquiry” where the executive branch acts “in the \n5  context of international affairs and security . . . .”  138 S. Ct. at 2409.  The Hawaii \n6  Court found that the statutory provision at issue in that litigation, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), \n7  “exudes deference to the President in every clause” and provides a “comprehensive \n8  delegation” of power to the President to suspend entry to aliens upon a finding “that \n9  the entry of the covered aliens ‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United \n10  States.””  138 S. Ct. at 2408 (quoting 8 U.S.C. §1182(f)).  The public charge \n11  provision does not contain language similarly indicating that it is aimed at national \n12  security interests.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).  Moreover, as this Court has noted \n13  before, there has been no contention by DHS that this case or the Public Charge Rule \n14  implicates national security concerns.   ECF No. 229 at 8.   \n15  In sum, DHS argues that the Hawaii case supports that the rational basis \n16  standard should be applied in any case involving the admission or exclusion of \n17  foreign nationals.  ECF No. 236 at 31.  However, the Hawaii decision itself does not \n18  countenance such an expansive reading, as numerous lower courts have recognized.  \n19  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. DHS, 908 F.3d 476, 519−20 (9th Cir. 2018), rev’d \n20  in part, vacated in part, 140 S. Ct. 1891 (2020) (distinguishing Hawaii on the basis \n21  that it did not concern aliens physically present within the geographic United States); \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5633   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  Saget v. Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 367 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (determining that Hawaii \n2  did not provide the applicable standard for an equal protection claim by foreign \n3  nationals “lawfully present in the United States along with their U.S.-born \n4  dependents); New York v. United States DOC, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502, 666 (S.D.N.Y. \n5  2019) (finding that nothing in the Hawaii opinion indicates that the “‘circumscribed \n6  inquiry’ applies outside of the ‘national security and foreign affairs context.’”) \n7  (quoting Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2420, n. 5); Centro Presente v. DHS, 332 F. Supp. 3d \n8  393, 410 (D. Mass. 2018) (recognizing that the Supreme Court has applied \n9  heightened scrutiny to a gender-based classification in the immigration context) \n10  (citing Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1686, 1690 (2017)).  \n11  Accordingly, DHS has not supported its contention that rational basis review \n12  should supplant the well-established strict scrutiny review of Arlington Heights in \n13  the particular immigration context in which the Public Charge Rule applies. \n14  2.  Plausibility of the States’ Equal Protection Claim \n15  DHS maintains that the Rule is facially neutral, and the States cannot establish \n16  discriminatory intent through the statements of officials outside of DHS.  ECF No. \n17  223 at 31.  DHS further argues that the States’ allegations are analogous to  \n18  allegations that the Supreme Court found to be insufficient to support a valid equal \n19  protection claim in the plurality opinion recently issued in DHS v. Regents of the \n20  Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915−16 (2020).  ECF No. 36 at 33−34.   \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5634   Page 37 of 43\n \n1  The States filed their response six days before the Regents decision was \n2  issued.  See ECF No. 233 (filed June 12, 2020); 140 S. Ct. 1891 (issued on June 18, \n3  2020).  However, the States respond to DHS’s Motion to Dismiss their equal \n4  protection claim by asserting that their Amended Complaint includes sufficient \n5  factual content to support that the Public Charge Rule was “motivated by \n6  Administration officials’ intent to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or \n7  national origin.”  ECF No. 233 at 46 (quoting Amended Complaint). \n8  Most facially neutral actions by legislators and government officials, \n9  including those that “result[] in a racially disproportionate impact” are subject only \n10  to judicial review to determine whether the decision had a rational basis “because \n11  legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous \n12  considerations.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264−65.  However, the Supreme \n13  Court recognized in Arlington Heights that “racial discrimination is not just another \n14  competing consideration,” so “[w]hen there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose \n15  has been a motivating factor in the decision, this judicial deference is no longer \n16  justified.”  Id. at 265−66. \n17  A plaintiff may state a viable equal protection claim by offering evidence that \n18  a discriminatory purpose was one motivating factor.  See Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d \n19  968, 978 (9th Cir. 2015) (a plaintiff “does not have to prove that the discriminatory \n20  purpose was the sole purpose of the challenged action, but only that it was a \n21  ‘motivating factor.’”) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).  Rather, courts \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5635   Page 38 of 43\n \n1  determine “whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor” by \n2  conducting “a sensitive inquiry in such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent \n3  as may be available.”  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266.  Under the Arlington \n4  Heights standard, judicial inquiry beyond the stated reasons for the official action \n5  may include the following: “(1) the impact of the official action and whether it bears \n6  more heavily on one race than another; (2) the historical background of the decision; \n7  (3) the specific sequence of events leading to the challenged action; (4) the \n8  defendant’s departures from normal procedures or substantive conclusions; and (5) \n9  the relevant legislative or administrative history.” Arce, 793 F.3d at 978 (citing \n10  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266−68, and describing the list as non-exhaustive).  \n11  Courts have recognized that “any indication of discriminatory motive may suffice to \n12  raise a question that can only be resolved by a fact-finder.”  Pac. Shores Props., LLC \n13  v. City of Newport Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1158−59 (9th Cir. 2013). \n14  Beginning with the impact of the official action, the States allege that: (1) \n15  DHS received many comments alerting the agency to the racially and ethnically \n16  disparate impact of the new public charge definition; and (2) DHS itself \n17  acknowledged that the Public Charge Rule “may impact in greater numbers \n18  communities of color, including Latinos and [Asian Americans and Pacific \n19  Islanders], as well as those with particular medical conditions that require public \n20  benefits for treatment, and therefore may impact the overall composition of \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5636   Page 39 of 43\n \n1  immigration with respect to these groups. ECF Nos. 31 at 85−86; 233 at 49−50 \n2  (quoting 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,369).  \n3    With respect to the sequence of events leading to the challenged action and \n4  the rulemaking history, the States quote remarks by Administration officials that the \n5  States allege reflect “animus toward non-European immigrants.”  ECF No.  31 at \n6  177−78.  The States allege that White House staff member Stephen Miller remarked \n7  that he “would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever touched American soil,” \n8  within the same timeframe as he advised President Donald Trump on immigration \n9  policy.  Id. at 52.  The States also allege that emails by Miller that became public \n10  after the filing of the Amended Complaint reflect that Miller promoted white \n11  supremacist and racist websites.  See ECF Nos. 233 at 47; 198 (response by DHS to \n12  the States’ motion to compel discovery related to the equal protection claim \n13  indicating that DHS does not dispute that Miller is a regular visitor to white \n14  supremacist and racist websites).  By June 2018, the States allege, Miller was \n15  pressuring DHS to expedite its timeline for publishing a rule revising the public \n16  charge regulation.  Id. at 56, 64−65.  By June 2019, at a White House meeting with \n17  DHS officials, Miller allegedly expressed frustration that the public charge \n18  redefinition had not been finalized and predicted that the rule would be \n19  “transformative.”  Id. at 65. \n20    The States also allege numerous remarks by President Trump that they offer \n21  as circumstantial evidence of racially or ethnically discriminatory intent.  In January \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5637   Page 40 of 43\n \n1  2018, the States allege that President Trump rejected a bipartisan immigrant \n2  proposal from Congress that included protections for immigrants from Haiti and \n3  Africa, asking “why he should accept immigrants from ‘shithole countries’ rather \n4  than from nations like ‘Norway.’”  ECF No. 31 at 55.  In approximately May 2018, \n5  the States allege that President Trump called on “administration officials to ‘do \n6  much better’ in keeping out undesirable immigrants,” adding “‘You wouldn’t \n7  believe how bad these people are . . . . These aren’t people, these are animals . . . .’”  \n8  ECF No. 31 at 56. \n9    The States further allege statements by former Acting Director of USCIS \n10  Kenneth Cuccinelli in August 2019 that the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty \n11  and its invitation to “‘your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,’” “‘was referring \n12  back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies’ not to \n13  immigrants from outside Europe.”  ECF No. 31 at 67. \n14  DHS does not dispute the validity of the States’ allegations but instead argues \n15  that statements by White House officials that do not reference the Public Charge \n16  Rule, and by individuals who were not the decision-makers regarding the Rule, do \n17  not reveal anything regarding why DHS instituted the Rule.  ECF No. 236 at 33−34.  \n18  DHS emphasizes that the decision-makers with respect to the Public Charge Rule \n19  indicated that their support for the Public Charge Rule was motivated by a desire to \n20  promote self-sufficiency, and Plaintiffs have not alleged any direct relationship \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5638   Page 41 of 43\n \n1  between any discriminatory animus and the precise policy at issue.  ECF No. 236 at \n2  34−35.    \n3  However, under Arlington Heights, the Administration’s stated reasons for the \n4  Public Charge Rule do not undermine the viability of an equal protection claim if the \n5  States have provided circumstantial or direct evidence from which, drawing \n6  inferences in the States’ favor, the Court may find that at least one motivation \n7  behind the rule was discriminatory.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267−68. \n8  DHS also argues in its reply that the recent Regents plurality decision from the \n9  Supreme Court should preclude the States from relying on the above statements to \n10  state their equal protection claim.  Specifically, DHS asserts that the statements \n11  offered by the States are analogous to remarks by President Trump that were found \n12  to be “unilluminating” in Regents because they were “remote in time and made in \n13  unrelated contexts[.]”  ECF No. 236 at 34; Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916.  In Regents, \n14  the Supreme Court considered, in relevant part, an equal protection challenge \n15  alleging that the decision by DHS to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood \n16  Arrivals (“DACA”) was motivated by racial or ethnic animus.  However, the \n17  plurality in Regents concluded that the plaintiffs’ allegations that President Trump \n18  made critical statements about Latinos before and after he was elected were too \n19  remote in time, and in contexts unrelated to the DACA policy, to qualify as \n20  “‘contemporary statements’ probative of the decision at issue.” Regents, 140 S. Ct. \n21  at 1916 (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268).   \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5639   Page 42 of 43\n \n1  In this case, the States’ allegations regarding statements by President Trump, \n2  in addition to statements by a high-level White House official and a DHS decision-\n3  maker, do not suffer from the same deficiency.  The statements described above, \n4  with the exception of the alleged emails from Miller promoting white supremacist \n5  and racist websites, are from January 2018 until August 2019, when the Public \n6  Charge Rule was published.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292.  Moreover, the statements, \n7  and others set forth in the States’ Amended Complaint  go to the issue of animus \n8  against nonwhite immigrants, which directly overlaps with the context of the States’ \n9  challenge to the Public Charge Rule.  See ECF No. 31 at 47−68. \n10  The Court finds that all of these statements, made by high-level officials in the \n11  Administration contemporaneous with DHS’s finalizing the Public Charge Rule, can \n12  reasonably be interpreted as supporting an animus toward nonwhite immigrants.  \n13  The Court further finds that DHS’s acknowledgement, at the time that the Rule was \n14  published, that the Rule would have a likely discriminatory effect further supports \n15  that DHS knew of the discriminatory impact of the Rule.  These factors raise an \n16  inference that an “invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor” in \n17  finalizing the Public Charge Rule.  See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266. \n18  In analyzing a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all of the States’ \n19  allegations as true, and the Court finds that the States have alleged sufficient facts to \n20  make their entitlement to relief under the equal protection component of the Due \n21 \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS ~ 42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 248    filed 09/14/20    PageID.5640   Page 43 of 43\n \n1  Process clause plausible.

ECF No. 254.  The Court \n4  has reviewed DHS’s Motion, ECF No. 254, Plaintiffs’2 response in opposition to \n5  reconsideration, ECF No. 258, DHS’s reply, ECF No. 259, the relevant law, and is \n6  fully informed. \n7  BACKGROUND \n8  The States are challenging DHS’s regulatory redefinition of who to exclude \n9  from immigration status as “likely . . . to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § \n10  1182(a)(4)(A); see Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 \n11  (Aug. 14, 2019) (“Public Charge Rule”).  In the Amended Complaint, the States \n12 \n \n13  1 Defendants in this lawsuit are the United States Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”), Acting Secretary of DHS David Pekoske, United States Citizenship and \n14  Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and Senior Official Performing the Duties of \nDirector Tracy Renaud (collectively, “DHS”).  The Court substitutes David \n15  Pekoske for Chad F. Wolf, who previously was substituted as a Defendant in the \nAmended Complaint but is no longer Acting Secretary of DHS.  The Court further \n16  corrects the caption to reflect that Tracy Renaud has replaced Kenneth Cuccinelli \nas the Senior Official Performing the Duties of Director for USCIS.  See Fed. R. \n17  Civ. P. 25(d). \n2 The Plaintiffs in this lawsuit are the State of Washington, Commonwealth of \n18 \nVirginia, State of Colorado, State of Delaware, State of Hawai’i, State of Illinois, \nState of Maryland, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Attorney General Dana \n19 \nNessel on behalf of the People of Michigan, State of Minnesota, State of Nevada, \nState of New Jersey, State of New Mexico, and State of Rhode Island (collectively, \n20 \nthe “States”). \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6463   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  raise four causes of action: (1) a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n2  (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action contrary to the Immigration and \n3  Nationality Act (“INA”)3, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n4  Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”)4, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n5  Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”)5, the Rehabilitation Act6, and the SNAP statute7; (2) \n6  a violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action “in excess of \n7  statutory jurisdiction [or] authority” or “ultra vires”; (3) a violation of the APA, 5 \n8  U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of \n9  discretion”; and (4) a violation of the guarantee of equal protection under the U.S. \n10  Constitution’s Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.  ECF No. 31 at 161−70. \n11  DHS moved to dismiss the States’ Amended Complaint in its entirety.  ECF \n12  No. 223.  The Court dismissed the States’ Count II: Ultra Vires Claim without \n13  prejudice and denied DHS’s motion in remaining part.  ECF No. 248 at 43.  \n14  Relevant to the instant Motion for Reconsideration, the Court concluded that the \n15 \n16 \n \n3 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4), 1152, and 1182(a)(1). \n17 \n4 8 U.S.C. §§1611−13, 1621−22, and 1641. \n18 \n5 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1183a. \n19 \n6 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n20 \n7 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6464   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  States’ Count IV: Equal Protection Claim did not meet the standard for dismissal \n2  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and allowed that claim to proceed.  Id.   \n3  In the Court’s analysis of the States’ equal protection claim, the Court \n4  determined that the strict scrutiny review of Vill. Of Arlington Heights v. Metro \n5  Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264−65 (1977)), governs the particular immigration \n6  context in which the Public Charge Rule applies.  ECF No. 248 at 36.  The Court \n7  proceeded to consider DHS’s argument that the Public Charge Rule is facially \n8  neutral, and the States cannot establish discriminatory intent through the statements \n9  of officials outside of DHS.  See id.  The Court further considered DHS’s argument \n10  that the States’ allegations of racial discrimination as a motivating factor behind the \n11  Public Charge Rule are analogous to allegations that the Supreme Court found to be \n12  insufficient to support a valid equal protection claim in the plurality opinion in DHS \n13  v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915−16 (2020).  See ECF \n14  No. 248 at 36−37.  The Court concluded that the States’ alleged statements by then-\n15  President Trump, a high-level White House official, and a DHS decision-maker do \n16  not suffer from the deficiencies identified in Regents, in which the plurality found \n17  statements made by then-President Trump about Latinos before and after he was \n18  elected to be too remote in time, and in contexts too attenuated from the policy at \n19  issue, to qualify as “‘contemporary statements’ probative of the decision at issue.”  \n20  ECF No. 248 at 41 (quoting Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916 (quoting Arlington Heights, \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6465   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  429 U.S. at 268)).  The Court found that the statements upon which the States rely in \n2  this case were made “contemporaneous with DHS’s finalizing the Public Charge \n3  Rule” and “can reasonably be interpreted as supporting an animus toward nonwhite \n4  immigrants.”  ECF No. 248 at 42. \n5  On the same day as the Court’s Order was filed, a United States Court of \n6  Appeals for the Ninth Circuit panel issued a 2-1 opinion in Ramos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d \n7  872 (9th Cir. 2020), which found that the plaintiffs’ allegations in that case \n8  regarding their equal protection claim failed to present serious questions on the \n9  merits to support a preliminary injunction.  Id. at 897.  The Ninth Circuit found that \n10  there was no record of evidence in that case to tie then-President Trump’s racial \n11  animus against “nonwhite, non-European” immigrants to terminations of Temporary \n12  Protective Status (“TPS”) by the Secretaries of DHS in 2017 and 2018.  Id.  \n13  Referencing the Regents plurality and its reasoning, the Ninth Circuit found that the \n14  President’s “expressed animus . . . occurred primarily in contexts removed from and \n15  unrelated to TPS policy or decisions.”  Id. at 898 (citing Regents, 140 S. Ct. at \n16  1916).  The Ramos majority found that “the only ‘contemporary statement’ might be \n17  the President’s comments at the January 11, 2018 meeting with lawmakers, during \n18  which TPS terminations were discussed; however, the influence of these remarks on \n19  the actual decisions to terminate TPS is belied by the fact that the meeting occurred \n20  three days after the TPS termination notices for Haiti and El Salvador issued.”  Id.  \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6466   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  The Ramos majority further found:  \n2  Moreover, while the record contains substantial evidence that White \nHouse officials sought to influence the Secretaries’ TPS decisions, and \n3  that the Secretaries sought and acted to conform their TPS decisions to \nthe President’s immigration policy, we find these facts neither unusual \n4  nor improper. It is expected—perhaps even critical to the functioning \nof government—for executive officials to conform their decisions to \n5  the administration's policies.  The mere fact that the White House \nexerted pressure on the Secretaries’ TPS decisions does not in itself \n6  support the conclusion that the President’s alleged racial animus was a \nmotivating factor in the TPS decisions. \n7   \nRamos, 975 F.3d at 897−98. \n8 \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n9 \nRule 54(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., provides that “any order . . . that adjudicates fewer \n10 \nthan all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties . . . may be \n11 \nrevised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all \n12 \nthe parties’ rights and liabilities.”  However, courts in this circuit disfavor motions \n13 \nfor reconsideration and deny them “absent highly unusual circumstances, unless the \n14 \ndistrict court is presented with newly discovered evidence, committed clear error, or \n15 \nif there is an intervening change in controlling law.”  McDowell v. Calderon, 197 \n16 \nF.3d 1253, 1255 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam).  “A motion for reconsideration ‘may \n17 \nnot be used to raise arguments or present evidence for the first time whey they could \n18 \nreasonably have been raised earlier in the litigation.’” Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. v. \n19 \nMucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 880 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Kona \n20 \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6467   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877, 890 (9th Cir. 2000) (emphasis in \n2  original)). \n3  A motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) tests whether a complaint \n4  states a cognizable legal theory as well as essential facts under that theory.  See Ileto \n5  v. Glock, Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, 1199−1200 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing that Rule \n6  12(b)(6) must be read in conjunction with Rule 8, which requires a “short and plain \n7  statement showing that the pleader is entitled to relief”) (internal quote omitted).  \n8  When a defendant challenges a complaint’s sufficiency under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n9  12(b)(6), the court must determine whether the complaint bears “sufficient factual \n10  matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  \n11  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \n12  U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  A claim is plausible when the plaintiff pleads “factual \n13  content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is \n14  liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. \n15  DISCUSSION \n16    The parties dispute whether Ramos, 975 F.3d 872, constitutes a change in \n17  controlling law warranting reconsideration.  ECF Nos. 258 at 5−7; 263 at 4.  DHS \n18  argues that Ramos undermines the Court’s finding that the statements upon which \n19  the States rely “made by high-level officials in the Administration contemporaneous \n20  with DHS’s finalizing the Public Charge Rule, can reasonably be interpreted as \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6468   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  supporting an animus toward nonwhite immigrants.”  ECF Nos. 254 at 11; 248 at 42.  \n2  DHS maintains that “it is apparent from Ramos that that is insufficient to infer that a \n3  particular agency policy was motivated by discrimination” and that, “if the law were \n4  otherwise, a plaintiff could state an equal protection claim for virtually any \n5  immigration policy of this administration simply by pointing to the same statements \n6  of administration officials as alleged by Plaintiffs here.”  ECF No. 254 at 11. \n7    The States respond that Ramos does not qualify as a change in controlling law \n8  because it merely reiterated the analysis of Regents in an analogous context to \n9  Regents without “plow[ing] any new ground that would have better informed this \n10  Court’s Order.”  ECF No. 258 at 6−7.  The States add that Ramos also is inapposite \n11  because it determined whether the plaintiffs had met their burden to obtain a \n12  preliminary injunction, which requires a greater showing than the States’ burden to \n13  survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in this case.  Id. at 7. \n14  Having reviewed Ramos, 975 F.3d 872, the Court finds that the opinion does \n15  not compel dismissal of the States’ equal protection claim.  Both Ramos and this \n16  Court relied on the plurality in Regents and its reasoning to assess whether \n17  statements relied on by plaintiffs in both cases are probative of discriminatory intent.  \n18  See Ramos, 975 F.3d at 897−98; ECF No. 248 at 36, 41−42 (portion of this Court’s \n19  Order considering whether the alleged statements in this case are analogous to the \n20  statements examined and deemed insufficient in Regents).  In Ramos, the only \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6469   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  statements at issue were made by then-President Trump, and the Ninth Circuit \n2  found: “Here, the only ‘contemporary statement’ might be the President’s comments \n3  at the January 11, 2018 meeting with lawmakers, during which TPS terminations \n4  were discussed; however, the influence of these remarks on the actual decisions to \n5  terminate TPS is belied by the fact that the meeting occurred three days after the \n6  TPS termination notices for Haiti and El Salvador issued.”  Ramos, 975 F.3d at 898 \n7  (emphasis in original).  The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that circumstantial \n8  evidence may suffice to prove a discriminatory intent claim under Arlington Heights, \n9  but concluded that “the circumstantial evidence here do [sic] not help Plaintiffs \n10  much.”  Id.  The Ninth Circuit found the circumstantial evidence to be unhelpful \n11  because there was “no indication that the impact of the TPS terminations bear more \n12  heavily on ‘non-white, non-European’ countries.”  Id. \n13  By contrast, in this case, the Court considered allegations regarding statements \n14  not only by then-President Trump, but also by a then-high-level White House \n15  official and a then-DHS decision-maker, and noted that the majority of the \n16  statements were made from January 2018 until August 2019, when the Public \n17  Charge Rule was published.  ECF No. 248 at 42.  Unlike the January 11, 2018 \n18  statement in Ramos, 975 F.3d at 898, the statements relied on by the States were \n19  made during the period in which the Public Charge Rule was being developed and \n20  before the final rule was issued.  Also in contrast to Ramos, 975 F.3d at 898, the \n21 \nORDER DENYING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ~ 9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 283    filed 02/01/21    PageID.6470   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  Court considered the alleged statements in the context that DHS acknowledges in the \n2  “Supplementary Information” for the final rule that the Public Charge Rule is likely \n3  to disproportionately affect communities of color.  See ECF No. 248 at 38−39 (citing \n4  ECF Nos. 31 at 85−86; 233 at 49−50 (quoting 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,369), 42.  \n5  Consequently, after Ramos, the cumulative allegations in the States’ Amended \n6  Complaint still suffice under Arlington Heights to survive under Rule 12(b)(6), a \n7  lesser standard than the preliminary injunction standard applied in Ramos. \n8  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that DHS’s Motion for \n9  Reconsideration, ECF No. 254, is DENIED. \n10  IT IS SO ORDERED.

CUCCINELLI, in\nhis official capacity as Acting Director of\nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration\nServices, \nDefendants-Appellants.\nBefore:  BYBEE, IKUTA, and OWENS, Circuit Judges.\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\nSince 1882, when the Congress enacted the first comprehensive immigration\nstatute, U.S. law has prohibited the admission to the United States of “any person\nunable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge.”  Act\nof Aug. 3, 1882, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214 (1882).  Although the precise\nformulation of this provision has been amended regularly in the succeeding century\nand a quarter, the basic prohibition and the phrase “public charge” remains.  Most\nrecently, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n1996 (IIRIRA), Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to\nprovide that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of\napplication for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of\n3\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 4 of 79\napplication for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a\npublic charge is inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  In making this\ndetermination, “the consular officer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum”\ntake five factors into account: age; health; family status; assets, resources, and\nfinancial status; and education and skills.  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Under long-\nstanding practice, consular officers and the Attorney General consider these factors\nunder a “totality of the circumstances” test.  \nIn 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), providing\nguidance to the public and INS field officers, defined “public charge” as an “alien .\n. . who is likely to become . . . primarily dependent on the government for\nsubsistence” as demonstrated by either “institutionalization for long-term care at\ngovernment expense” or “receipt of public cash assistance for income\nmaintenance.”  Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public\nCharge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689, 28,689 (May 26, 1999) (1999 Field\nGuidance) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although INS determined that the\nreceipt of cash benefits received under a public program would be considered a\nfactor in determining whether an alien was likely to become a public charge, it\nstated that non-cash benefits would not be taken into account for public-charge\npurposes.  Id. \n4\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 5 of 79\nIn August 2019, following notice and comment, the Department of\nHomeland Security adopted a new rule, redefining the term “public charge” to\nrequire a consideration of not only cash benefits, but also certain non-cash\nbenefits.  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292, 41,292\n(Aug. 14, 2019) (Final Rule).  Under DHS’s Final Rule a public charge is “an alien\nwho receives one or more public benefits . . .  for more than 12 months in the\naggregate within any 36-month period.”  Id. at 41,501.  In turn, DHS defined\n“public benefits.”  Consistent with the 1999 Field Guidance, DHS still considers\nreceipt of cash assistance from Supplemental Security Income (SSI); Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF); and federal, state, or local general\nassistance programs to be public benefits.  To that list, DHS added non-cash\nassistance received through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n(SNAP), Section 8 housing assistance, Section 8 project-based rental assistance,\nMedicaid (with certain exceptions), and Section 9 public housing.  Id.  DHS’s rule\nexempts public benefits received for emergency medical conditions, benefits\nreceived under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and school-based\nservices or benefits.  Id.  It also exempts those benefits received by aliens under 21\nyears of age, women during pregnancy, and members of the armed forces and their\nfamilies.  Id.  DHS repeated that “[t]he determination of an alien’s likelihood of\n5\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 6 of 79\nbecoming a public charge at any time in the future must be based on the totality of\nthe alien’s circumstances.”  Id. at 41,502.  \nPrior to the Final Rule taking effect in October 2019, various states,\nmunicipalities and organizations brought suits in California and Washington\nseeking a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the rule.  In Nos.\n19-17213 and 19-17214, California, Maine, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and the District\nof Columbia; the City and County of San Francisco and the County of Santa Clara;\nand various organizations brought suit in the Northern District of California against\nthe United States under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706; and the Declaratory\nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02.  The district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction on the basis of the APA, effective against implementation of the rule in\nthe plaintiff states.  City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship &\nImmigration Servs., 2019 WL 5100718 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2019).  In No. 19-\n35914, thirteen states—Washington, Virginia, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i,\nIllinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico,\nand Rhode Island—filed suit in the Eastern District of Washington against DHS\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the APA.  The district\ncourt granted a preliminary injunction on the basis of the APA claims and issued a\n6\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 7 of 79\nnationwide injunction.  Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2019 WL\n5100717 (E.D. Wash. Oct. 11, 2019).  \nDHS seeks a stay of both preliminary injunctions.1  Our authority to issue a\nstay of a preliminary injunction is circumscribed.  Nevertheless, for the reasons\nexplained below, we will grant the stay.  DHS has shown a strong likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, that it will suffer irreparable harm, and that the balance of\nthe equities and public interest favor a stay.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434\n(2009).\nI. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURE\nWe begin with the governing statutory framework, the proposed change to\nthis framework, and the proceedings below.\nA. Statutory Framework\nThe INA requires all aliens who seek lawful admission to the United States,\nor those already present but seeking to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs),\nto prove that they are “not inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1361; see also id. §§ 1225(a),\n1255(a).  Section 212 of the INA lists the grounds on which an alien may be\nadjudged inadmissible.  Id. § 1182(a)(1)–(10).  One of the grounds for\n1 For clarity, we will refer to the plaintiffs below as “the States” and the\ndefendants as “DHS.”\n7\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 8 of 79\ninadmissibility is a determination that the alien is likely to become a “public\ncharge.”  Id. § 1182(a)(4).  Section 212(a)(4) of the INA reads as follows:\n(4) PUBLIC CHARGE. —\n(A) IN GENERAL.—Any alien who, in the opinion of\nthe consular officer at the time of application for a visa,\nor in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of\napplication for admission or adjustment of status, is\nlikely at any time to become a public charge is\ninadmissible.\n(B) FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.—\n(i) In determining whether an alien is inadmissible under\nthis paragraph, the consular officer or the Attorney\nGeneral[2] shall at a minimum consider the alien’s—\n(I) age;\n(II) health;\n(III) family status;\n(IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and\n(V) education and skills.\n(ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i), the consular\nofficer or the Attorney General may also consider any\n2 The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred much of the Attorney\nGeneral’s immigration authority to the newly created office of the Secretary of\nHomeland Security.  See In re D-J-,  23 I. & N. Dec. 572, 573–74 & n.2 (Op. Att’y\nGen. 2003) (citing Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat.\n531 (2003)).  Though the Attorney General retains authority over the Executive\nOffice for Immigration Review, id. n.3, the Secretary of Homeland Security is now\nresponsible with the general administration and enforcement of immigration law,\nid. n.2. \n8\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 9 of 79\naffidavit of support[3] under section 1183a of this title for\npurposes of exclusion under this paragraph.\nId.  \nThis provision is applied at different times by different government\nagencies.  When an alien seeks a visa to travel to the United States, a Department\nof State (DOS) consular officer must make an admissibility determination.  See 84\nFed. Reg. at 41,294 n.3.  When an alien arrives at a port of entry without a visa,\nDHS makes that determination.  Id.  An alien may also be deemed “inadmissible”\neven when the alien is already in the country.  For example, when an alien seeks an\nadjustment of status from non-immigrant to LPR, DHS must determine that the\nalien is not inadmissible.  See id.  And when an alien is processed in immigration\ncourt, the Department of Justice (DOJ) through immigration judges and the Board\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) must determine whether that alien is inadmissible. \nId.\nThough § 212 of the INA lays out the factors an immigration official must\nconsider “at a minimum” when making a public-charge determination, the INA\ndoes not define the term “public charge,” or restrict how officials are to consider\n3 An affidavit of support is a binding pledge, often made by an employer or\nfamily member of the alien, to financially support the alien at 125 percent of the\nFederal poverty line.  8 U.S.C. § 1183.\n9\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 10 of 79\nage, health, family status, financial resources, and education.  Indeed, as explained\nin more detail below, in the context of immigration law, the term “public charge”\nhas had several meanings.  Since 1999, however, the term has been defined\naccording to guidelines issued by the INS Field Guidance on the matter.  See 1999\nField Guidance, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  The 1999 Field Guidance defined a\npublic charge as an alien who “is likely to become (for admission/adjustment\npurposes) primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated\nby either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii)\ninstitutionalization for long-term care at government expense.”  Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  The 1999 Field Guidance did not permit immigration\nofficers to “place any weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits,” id., and\nallowed consideration of only cash-benefit programs like SSI, TANF, and “[s]tate\nand local cash assistance programs that provide benefits for income maintenance,”\nid. at 28,692.\nB.  The Proposed Rule\nOn October 10, 2018, DHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n(NPRM) indicating its intent to abandon the 1999 Field Guidance and redefine the\nterm “public charge.”  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg.\n10\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 11 of 79\n51,114 (proposed Oct. 10, 2018).4  It did so acting under the authority vested in the\nSecretary of Homeland Security to establish immigration regulations and enforce\nimmigration law.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3) (“[The Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity] shall establish such regulations . . . as he deems necessary for carrying\nout his authority under the provisions of this chapter.”).  The proposed rule\nredefined the term “public charge” in two ways.\nFirst, the proposed rule for the first time established a required length of\ntime for which the alien would have to rely on public benefits before being labeled\na public charge. Under the 1999 Field Guidance, a public charge was defined as an\nindividual “primarily dependent” on government benefits, but the 1999 Field\nGuidance prescribed no specific time period for which this determination should\nbe made.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689, 28,692.  Under the new rule, an alien would\nbe considered a public charge if he or she “receives one or more [designated]\npublic benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a 36-month\nperiod.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,157–58.  Moreover, the proposed rule counts each\n4 The proposed rule would not change the definition of public charge for\nremovability determinations, only for determinations of inadmissibility.  83 Fed.\nReg. at 51,134.  And though the rule only applies to DHS, DHS is currently\nworking with DOS and DOJ to ensure that all three agencies apply a consistent\ndefinition of the term in their admissibility inquiries.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 n.3.\n11\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 12 of 79\npublic benefit received, so that “receipt of two different non-monetizable benefits\nin one month counts as two months.”  Id. at 51,166. \nSecond, the proposed rule expanded which benefits contributed to a public-\ncharge determination.  The proposed rule still included those cash-benefit\nprograms that were listed in the 1999 Field Guidance, but now also includes\nvarious in-kind programs, such as:\n(A) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly\ncalled ‘‘Food Stamps’’), 7 U.S.C. 2011 to 2036c;\n(B) Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher\nProgram, as administered by HUD under 24 CFR part 984; 42 U.S.C.\n1437f and 1437u;\n(C) Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate\nRehabilitation) under 24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880 through 884 and 886;\nand\n . . . \n(i) Medicaid, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., [with several exceptions,\ndiscussed below] \n. . .\n(iv) Subsidized Housing under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 \nU.S.C. 1437 et seq.\n12\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 13 of 79\nId. at 51,290 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21).5\nAdditionally, the proposed rule added other factors for immigration officers\nto consider when making a public-charge determination.  The rule still required\nconsideration of the alien’s age, health, family status, financial status, education\nand skills, as well as any affidavits of support the alien presents.  See 83 Fed Reg.\n51,178 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22).  But the proposed rule also laid out\nnew factors to be afforded extra weight.  Four factors weigh heavily against the\nalien in a public-charge determination: (1) a finding that the alien “is not a\nfull-time student and is authorized to work,” but cannot demonstrate “current\nemployment, employment history, or [a] reasonable prospect of future\nemployment”;  (2) a previous finding of inadmissibility on public-charge grounds;\n(3) a medical diagnosis that would likely require extensive medical treatment or\ninterfere with the alien’s ability to be self-sufficient; and (4) receipt of benefits for\n5 DHS altered the Final Rule to make clear that certain benefits were exempt\nfrom consideration, including “Medicaid [collected] by aliens under the age of 21[,\nMedicaid collected by] pregnant women during pregnancy and during the 60-day\nperiod after pregnancy,” school-based services, Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act (IDEA) services, Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidies, and\nemergency medical care.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,296–97 (codified at 8 C.F.R.\n§ 212.21).  Further, in certain circumstances, the proposed rule excuses receipt of\ncovered public benefits.  See id. (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21) (exempting public\nbenefits from consideration when the recipient has received certain humanitarian\nrelief, the recipient or his spouse was in the Armed Forces, or the recipient\nreceived a waiver).\n13\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 14 of 79\nmore than twelve months within a thirty-six month period.  Id. at 51,198–201 (to\nbe codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22).  Conversely, two factors would weigh heavily in\nfavor of the alien in a public-charge determination: (1) assets or household income\nover 250 percent of the Federal poverty line, and (2) individual income over 250\npercent of the Federal poverty line.6  Id. at 51,292 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §\n212.22(c)(2)).\nDuring the sixty-day public comment period that followed the NPRM, DHS\ncollected 266,077 comments, “the vast majority of which opposed the rule.”  84\nFed. Reg. at 41,297.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Final Rule in the\nFederal Register.  Id. at 41,292.  In its 216-page Final Rule, DHS made some\nchanges to the proposed rule (which are not relevant here) and addressed the\ncomments it received.  The Final Rule was scheduled to take effect on October 15,\n2019, and would apply to anyone applying for admission or adjustment of status\nafter that date.  Id.\nC.  The Proceedings\n1.  The Northern District of California Case \n6 The Final Rule added a third factor: private health insurance not subsidized\nunder the Affordable Care Act.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,504.\n14\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 15 of 79\nOn August 13, 2019, the City and County of San Francisco and the County\nof Santa Clara sued several government agencies and officials, including U.S.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Acting Director of USCIS\nKenneth T. Cuccinelli, DHS, and the then Acting Director of DHS Kevin\nMcAleenan.  They brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California, claiming that the proposed rule violated the APA on two\ngrounds: (1) the rule was not made in accordance with the law, and (2) the rule was\narbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Three\ndays later, on August 16, 2019, California, Maine, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and the\nDistrict of Columbia, sued the same defendants in the same court.  They claimed\nthat (1) the proposed rule violated § 706 of the APA because (a) it was not made in\naccordance with the INA, the IIRIRA, the Rehabilitation Act, or state healthcare\ndiscretion, (b) it was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and (2) the\nproposed rule violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause because it\ndenied equal protection based on race and unconstitutional animus. \n15\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 16 of 79\nEach set of plaintiffs filed a motion to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of\nthe proposed rule.  On August 27, 2019, the district court ordered the two cases\nconsolidated.7\nThe district court heard oral argument on October 2, 2019, and on October\n11, granted the preliminary injunction.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019\nWL 5100718 at *1, 53.  The court first held that both the Counties and the States\nhad standing to sue because they showed imminent financial injury.  Id. at *46–47. \nIt held that they were in the statute’s zone of interests because, in enacting the\npublic-charge provision of the INA, “Congress intended to protect states and their\npolitical subdivisions’ coffers.”  Id. at *41.  On the merits, the district court found\nthat the States satisfied the four-factor test for a preliminary injunction.  See Winter\nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The court held that the\nStates had a likelihood of success on the merits for at least some of their claims.  It\nfound the States were likely to successfully show that the proposed rule was\ncontrary to law because it unreasonably defined the term “public charge,” and thus\nfailed the second step of the Chevron analysis.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019\n7 Several legal and health-care organizations were also parties to the motion\nfor a preliminary injunction below.  The district court found that they failed to\nestablish that they were within the zone of interests.  City & Cty. of San Francisco,\n2019 WL 5100718, at *53.  They are not parties to this appeal.\n16\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 17 of 79\nWL 5100718, at *28.  Alternatively, the court found that the States had shown a\nserious question as to whether the INA unambiguously foreclosed the proposed\nchange to the definition of public charge, thus causing the Final Rule to fail at\nChevron step one.  Id.  The court also concluded that the States had demonstrated a\nlikelihood of success on the arbitrary-and-capricious claim because DHS failed to\nadequately consider the adverse economic and public health-related costs of the\nproposed rule.  Id. at *34, *37.\nFurther, the court found that the rule’s implementation would irreparably\nharm the Counties and States by causing them to lose millions of dollars in federal\nreimbursements and face increased operational costs.  Id. at *46–49.  Focusing on\nthe public’s interest in the continued provision of medical services and the\nprevention of communicable diseases, the district court found both the balance of\nthe equities and the public interest weighed in favor of granting an injunction.  Id.\nat *50–51.  However, because the court found that the States had failed to show\nwhy a nationwide injunction would be necessary, the court granted an injunction\nthat applied only to those persons living in plaintiff states or counties.  Id. at *53.\nOn October 25, 2019, DHS sought a stay of the preliminary injunction. \nDHS informed the court that it would seek appellate relief if the court did not act\nby November 14.  \n17\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 18 of 79\n2.   The Eastern District of Washington Case \nOn August 14, 2019, Washington, Virginia, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai‘i,\nIllinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island,\nand the state attorney general on behalf of Michigan sued USCIS, Cuccinelli, DHS,\nand McAleenan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nWashington.  They alleged claims similar to those presented in the California\ncases:  (1) the proposed rule violated the APA because (a) it was not in accordance\nwith immigration law or the Rehabilitation Act, (b) it exceeded DHS’s statutory\njurisdiction or authority, and (c) it was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of\ndiscretion, and (2) the proposed rule violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause because it denied equal protection based on race and unconstitutional\nanimus.  \nThe district court heard oral argument on October 3, 2019, and on October\n11, granted the preliminary injunction.  See Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at\n*23.  The court’s conclusions largely mirrored those of the Northern District of\nCalifornia, though there were some differences.  Citing the States’ anticipated\neconomic, administrative, and public-health costs, the court held that the States had\nstanding and that the matter was ripe.  Id. at *11.  Finding that the INA was\nenacted “to protect states from having to spend state money to provide for\n18\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 19 of 79\nimmigrants who could not provide for themselves,” the court concluded that the\nStates were within the INA’s zone of interests.  Id.\n On the merits, the court held that the States had shown a likelihood of\nsuccess on the arbitrary-and-capriciousness claim and the Chevron claim, though\nthe Washington court was less clear than the California court had been about at\nwhich step of the Chevron analysis the proposed rule would fail.  Id. at *13–17. \nUnlike the California court, the Washington court also found that the States were\nlikely to succeed in proving that DHS had violated the Rehabilitation Act, and that\nDHS acted beyond its congressionally delegated authority in defining self-\nsufficiency.  Id. at *17–18.  Noting that “the Plaintiff States provide a strong basis\nfor finding that disenrollment from non-cash benefits programs is predictable, not\nspeculative,” and that such disenrollment would financially harm the States, the\ncourt found that the States would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not\nissued.  Id. at *20–21.  On these same grounds, the court found that the balance of\nthe equities and public interest both “tip[ped] in favor” of granting a preliminary\ninjunction.  Id. at *21.  However, unlike the California court, the Washington court\nfound a geographically limited injunction untenable, in part because a limited\ninjunction might give immigrants an incentive to move from unprotected states to\n19\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 20 of 79\nprotected states.  Accordingly, the Washington court granted the States a\nnationwide injunction.  Id. at *22–23.\nOn October 25, 2019, DHS sought a stay of the preliminary injunction. \nDHS informed the court that it would seek appellate relief if the court did not act\nby November 14.  \n *          *          * \nBy November 14, neither district court responded to the respective motions\nto stay. On November 15, 2019, DHS filed a motion in this court for an emergency\nstay of the injunction.\nII. JURISDICTION\nDHS contends that the plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to sue and\nthat their claims do not fall within the zone of interests protected by the INA.  We\nhave an obligation to ensure that jurisdiction exists before proceeding to the merits. \nSee Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 93–95 (1998).8  \nAdditionally, although no party has raised the issue, we must address whether\n8 Both district courts also held that the States’ claims fall within the INA’s\n“zone of interests.”  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *41;\nWashington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *11.  For present purposes, because the issue is\nclose and raises a prudential rather than jurisdictional concern, see Bank of Am.\nCorp. v. City of Miami, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302 (2017), we will assume that the\nStates’ claims satisfy the requirement.\n20\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 21 of 79\nDHS’s request for a stay pending appeal is moot in light of the fact that two courts\noutside our circuit have also issued nationwide injunctions, and any decision we\nissue here would not directly affect those orders.  We conclude that, at this\npreliminary stage of the proceedings, the States have sufficiently alleged grounds\nfor Article III standing and that DHS’s petition for a stay is not moot.\n  \nA. Article III Standing\nArticle III of the Constitution limits the federal judicial power to the\nadjudication of “Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  This\nfundamental limitation “is founded in concern about the proper—and properly\nlimited—role of the courts in a democratic society.”  Summers v. Earth Island\nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 492–93 (2009) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498\n(1975)).  “One of the essential elements of a legal case or controversy is that the\nplaintiff have standing to sue.”  Trump v. Hawai’i, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2416 (2018). \n“[B]uilt on separation-of-powers principles,” standing ensures that litigants have “a\npersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to justify the exercise of the\ncourt’s remedial powers on their behalf.”  Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.,\n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (internal citations and alterations omitted).\n21\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 22 of 79\nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff must show a “concrete and\nparticularized” injury that is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s conduct and “that\nis likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,\n136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547–48 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560–61 (1992)).  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of\nrelief requested,” Town of Chester, 137 S. Ct. at 1651, and that party “bears the\nburden of establishing” the elements of standing “with the manner and degree of\nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n“At this very preliminary stage,” plaintiffs “may rely on the allegations in their\nComplaint and whatever other evidence they submitted in support of their\n[preliminary-injunction] motion to meet their burden.”  Washington v. Trump, 847\nF.3d 1151, 1159 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam).  And they “need only establish a risk\nor threat of injury to satisfy the actual injury requirement.”  Harris v. Bd. of\nSupervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 762 (9th Cir. 2004); see Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548\n(noting that the injury must be “actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical” (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)).\nThe district courts concluded that the States had standing based on their\nalleged loss of federal funds and increase in operational costs related to individuals\ndisenrolling from the non-cash public benefits at issue.  DHS challenges this\n22\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 23 of 79\nfinding, arguing that predictions of future financial harm are based on an\n“‘attenuated chain of possibilities’ that does not show ‘certainly impending’\ninjury.”9  DHS’s argument is unavailing for several reasons.\nFirst, the injuries alleged are not entirely speculative—at least for standing\npurposes.  DHS acknowledges that one result of the Final Rule will be to\nencourage aliens to disenroll from public benefits.  It predicted a 2.5 percent\ndisenrollment rate when proposing the rule.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463.  This\ndisenrollment, DHS predicted, would result in a reduction in Medicaid\nreimbursement payments to the States of about $1.01 billion.  Id. at 41,301.  DHS\nalso acknowledged increased administrative costs that would result from the Final\nRule.  Id. at 41,389.  To be sure, the predicted result is premised on the actions of\nthird parties, but this type of “predictable effect of Government action on the\ndecisions of third parties” is sufficient to establish injury in fact.  Dep’t of\nCommerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019).  \nMoreover, according to evidence supplied by the States, the predicted results\nhave already started.  As more individuals disenroll from Medicaid, the States will\nno longer receive reimbursements from the federal government for treating them. \n9 DHS raises no argument about the second and third elements of the\nstanding analysis.\n23\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 24 of 79\nSimilarly, the States have sufficiently alleged that they are facing new and ongoing\noperational costs resulting from the Final Rule.  See City & Cty. of San Francisco,\n2019 WL 5100718, at *48.  These costs are predictable, likely, and imminent.  It is\ndisingenuous for DHS to claim that they are too attenuated at this point when it\nacknowledged these costs in its own rulemaking process.\nFinally, DHS’s reliance on Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398\n(2013), is unfounded.  There, the Court found that various human rights, labor,\nlegal, and media organizations did not have standing to challenge the\nconstitutionality of a law authorizing governmental electronic surveillance of\ncommunications for foreign intelligence purposes.  Id. at 414.  The alleged injury\nwas that the threat of surveillance would compel them to travel abroad to have in-\nperson conversations with sources and witnesses, in addition to other costs related\nto protecting the confidentiality of sensitive communications.  Id. at 406–07.  The\nCourt found that the injury was not “certainly impending” because it was highly\nspeculative whether the government would imminently target communications\nbetween the plaintiffs and foreign individuals.  Id. at 410–11.  The assumption that\ntheir communications would be targeted was not enough to demonstrate injury in\nfact.  Id. at 411–14.  Here, the States are not making assumptions about their\n24\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 25 of 79\nclaimed injuries.  Unlike in Clapper, the States present evidence that the predicted\ndisenrollment and rising administrative costs are currently happening.\nThus, based on the available evidence at this early stage of the proceedings,\nwe conclude that the States have shown that they have suffered and will suffer\ndirect injuries traceable to the Final Rule and thus have standing to challenge its\nvalidity.\nB. Mootness\nFinally, we raise on our own the question of whether we can consider DHS’s\nrequest for a stay of the district court’s preliminary injunctions.  See Demery v.\nArpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1025 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e have an independent duty to\nconsider sua sponte whether a case is moot.”).  The stay would, presumably, allow\nthe Final Rule to go into effect pending further proceedings in the district court and\nthis court.  The question of mootness arises because, contemporaneous with the\ndistrict courts’ orders here, district courts in Maryland and New York also issued\nnationwide injunctions.  Casa de Md/, Inc. v. Trump, 2019 WL 5190689 (D. Md.\nOct. 14, 2019); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 2019 WL 5100372\n25\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 26 of 79\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019).10  Thus, unless a stay also issues in those cases, any stay\nwe might issue would not allow the Final Rule to go into effect; the Final Rule\nwould still be barred by those injunctions.\nWe recently addressed this precise question in California v. U.S. Department\nof Health & Human Services, 941 F.3d 410, 423 (9th Cir. 2019), and we concluded\nthat even if an injunction from another court “has a fully nationwide scope, we\nnevertheless retain jurisdiction under the exception to mootness for cases capable\nof repetition, yet evading review.”  Similarly, we conclude that DHS’s petition is\nnot moot, and we proceed to the merits of its petition.  \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nDHS requests that we stay the district courts’ preliminary injunctions\npending resolution of the consideration of the merits of DHS’s appeals.  We have\nauthority to do so under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, which provides that\nthe courts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective\njurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.”  See Scripps-\nHoward Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 9–10 (1942) (finding that a federal court\nmay stay judgments pending appeal “as part of its traditional equipment for the\n10 In a third case out of the Northern District of Illinois, the district court\nissued an order enjoining enforcement of the Final Rule in Illinois only.  Cook Cty.\nv. McAleenan, 2019 WL 5110267 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 14, 2019).\n26\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 27 of 79\nadministration of justice”); In re McKenzie, 180 U.S. 536, 551 (1901) (noting the\n“inherent power of the appellate court to stay . . . proceedings on appeal”); see also\nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(g).\nTwo standards affect our determination, the standard applicable to district\ncourts for preliminary injunctions, and the standard for appellate courts for stays\npending appeal.  The district court must apply a four-factor standard: \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he\nis likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the\nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the\npublic interest.\nWinter, 555 U.S. at 20.\nAlternatively, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a balance of\nhardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a\npreliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood\nof irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.”  All. for the\nWild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1135 (9th Cir. 2011).\nGenerally, the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to “preserve the status\nquo and the rights of the parties until a final judgment issues in the cause.”  U.S.\nPhilips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V., 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Univ.\nof Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); Sierra On-Line, Inc. v. Phoenix\n27\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 28 of 79\nSoftware, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir. 1984)).  An injunction is “an\nextraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the\nplaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  It “should not be\ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” \nMazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam) (citation omitted).\n The standard we apply to DHS’s request for a stay is similar, although the\nburden of proof is reversed.  “The party requesting a stay bears the burden of\nshowing that the circumstances justify an exercise of that discretion,” and our\nanalysis is guided by four factors:\n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be\nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will\nsubstantially injury the other parties interested in the proceeding; and\n(4) where the public interest lies.\nNken, 556 U.S. at 433–34 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \n“The first two factors . . . are the most critical,” and the “mere possibility” of\nsuccess or irreparable injury is insufficient to satisfy them.  Id. at 434 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  At this stage of the proceedings, it is now DHS’s\nburden to make “a strong showing that [it] is likely to” prevail against the States’\nclaims.  Lair v. Bullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1203 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Nken, 556\n28\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 29 of 79\nU.S. at 426).  We consider the final two factors “[o]nce an applicant satisfies the\nfirst two.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.\n“A stay is an ‘intrusion into the ordinary process of administration and\njudicial review,’ and accordingly ‘is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury\nmight otherwise result to the appellant.’”  Id. at 427 (citations omitted).  “It is\ninstead ‘an exercise of judicial discretion,’ and ‘the propriety of its issue is\ndependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.’”  Id. at 433 (alteration\nomitted) (quoting Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 672–73\n(1926)). \nThere is significant overlap in these standards.  The first prong in both\ntests—likelihood of success on the merits—is the same.  And the Supreme Court\nhas made clear that satisfaction of this factor is the irreducible minimum\nrequirement to granting any equitable and extraordinary relief.  Trump v. Hawai’i,\n138 S. Ct. at 2423.  The analysis ends if the moving party fails to show a likelihood\nof success on the merits of its claims.  Id.\nIV. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS\nAny “person suffering legal wrong . . . or adversely affected or aggrieved”\nby an agency’s final action may seek judicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The scope\nof our review is determined by the APA.  As a reviewing court, we must “set\n29\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 30 of 79\naside” a final rule if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise\nnot in accordance with law.”  Id. § 706(2)(A).  In making this determination, we\nmay “decide all relevant questions of law, interpret . . . statutory provisions, and\ndetermine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  Id. §\n706. \nDHS argues that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal because,\ncontrary to the conclusions of the district courts, the Final Rule is neither contrary\nto law nor arbitrary and capricious.  We agree.  The Final Rule’s definition of\n“public charge” is consistent with the relevant statutes, and DHS’s action was not\narbitrary or capricious. \nA. Contrary to Law\nThe States argue that the Final Rule is invalid under the APA because the\nFinal Rule’s definition of “public charge” is contrary to (1) the INA and (2) the\nRehabilitation Act.  We disagree and find that DHS is likely to succeed in its\nargument that the Final Rule is not contrary to law.11 \n11 The States also brought claims in both courts under the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause.  U.S. CONST. art. V.  Neither district court\nreached this issue.  We also decline to reach this issue.  We will consider the\nlikelihood of success on the merits only as to those issues that formed the bases for\nthe district courts’ injunctions.  In any further proceedings, the district courts are\nfree to consider any issues fairly before them. \n30\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 31 of 79\n1. The INA and “Public Charge”\nWhen confronted with an argument that an agency’s interpretation of a\nstatute that it administers is wrong, we employ the familiar Chevron two-step test. \nFirst, we ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at\nissue.”  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842\n(1984).  If it has, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency,\nmust give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”  Id. at\n842–43.  But if Congress has not spoken directly to the issue at hand, we proceed\nto the second step and ask “whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.”  Id. at 843.\nWe must keep in mind why Chevron is an important rule of construction:  \nChevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional\nintent: namely, that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute\nadministered by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be\nresolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency\n(rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the\nambiguity allows.  Chevron thus provides a stable background rule\nagainst which Congress can legislate:  Statutory ambiguities will be\nresolved, within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, not by the\ncourts but by the administering agency.  Congress knows to speak in\nplain terms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious terms\nwhen it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.\nArlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 296 (2013) (quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n31\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 32 of 79\nThe district courts found that the Final Rule failed the Chevron test at one or\nboth steps because the Final Rule’s definition of “public charge” was an\nimpermissible reading of that phrase in the INA.  We will consider each step in\nturn.\na. Chevron Step 1\nAt Chevron’s first step, we determine whether Congress has directly spoken\nto the issue at hand by “employing traditional tools of statutory construction.” \nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9.  That means we start with the text.  Afewerki v.\nAnaya Law Grp., 868 F.3d 771, 778 (9th Cir. 2017).  We will then examine the\nhistory of interpretation to see if there has been a judicial construction of the term\n“public charge” that “follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus\nleaves no room for agency discretion.”  Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand\nX Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 982 (2005).  Finally, we will consider other factors\nraised by the district courts and the States.\n(1) Text.  Under § 212 of the INA, an alien is inadmissible if, “in the opinion\nof” the immigration official, the alien “is likely at any time to become a public\ncharge.”  In making that determination, the immigration official must consider “at\na minimum” the alien’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education,\nand skills.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  Congress did not define these terms and\n32\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 33 of 79\nplaced no further restrictions on what these officers may consider in the public-\ncharge assessment.  Nor did Congress prescribe how the officers are to regard the\nfive enumerated factors.  \nWe have four quick observations.  First, the determination is entrusted to the\n“opinion” of the consular or immigration officer.12  That is the language of\ndiscretion, and the officials are given broad leeway.  Depending on the context in\nwhich the “opinion” is given, the decision may be nonreviewable.  Under the rule\nof consular nonreviewability, only the most egregious abuses of discretion may be\nreviewed.  See Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2140–41 (2015) (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring); see also Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1171–72 (9th Cir.\n2016) (holding that Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinion in Din is the controlling\nopinion and summarizing the consular nonreviewability rule).  Indeed, we have\npreviously held that the phrase “in the opinion of the Attorney General” in a now-\nrepealed immigration statute conferred “unreviewable” discretion to the Executive\nBranch.  See Kalaw v. I.N.S., 133 F.3d 1147, 1151–52 (9th Cir. 1997), superseded\nby statute on other grounds.  And to the extent the federal courts may review such\n12 The text of the INA does not mention immigration officers.  Rather, it\ncommits the public-charge determination to the “opinion of the Attorney General.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  As we explained above, Congress has since transferred\nthe authority granted by the INA to DHS’s immigration officers.\n33\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 34 of 79\ndeterminations, our review is narrow.  See Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 277 F.3d\n1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that judicial review of discretionary acts by the\nBIA is limited to “the purely legal and hence non-discretionary” aspects of the\nBIA’s action); see also Allen v. Milas, 896 F.3d 1094, 1106–07 (9th Cir. 2018)\n(noting that judicial review of visa denials is “limited . . . to constitutional\nchallenges” and does not extend to APA-based challenges (emphasis omitted)). \nSecond, the critical term “public charge” is not a term of art.  It is not self-\ndefining.  That does not mean that officials may pour any meaning into the term,\nbut it does mean that there is room for discretion as to what, precisely, being a\n“public charge” encompasses.  In a word, the phrase is “ambiguous” under\nChevron; it is capable of a range of meanings.  So long as the agency has defined\nthe term within that range of meanings, we have no grounds for second-guessing\nthe agency, “even if the agency’s reading differs from what [we] believe[] is the\nbest statutory interpretation.”  Brand X, 545 U.S. at 980 (citing Chevron, 467 U.S.\nat 843–44 & n.11).  It also means that an agency “must consider varying\ninterpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis,” including “in\nresponse to changed factual circumstances, or a change in administrations.”  Id. at\n981 (quotations marks and citations omitted).\n34\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 35 of 79\nThird, Congress set out five factors to be taken into account by immigration\nofficials, but expressly did not limit the discretion of officials to those factors. \nRather the factors are to be considered “at a minimum.”  Other factors may be\nconsidered as well, giving officials considerable discretion in their decisions. \nFourth, Congress granted DHS the power to adopt regulations to enforce the\nprovisions of the INA.  When Congress created DHS, Congress vested the\nSecretary of Homeland Security “with the administration and enforcement of . . .\nall [] laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens” and authorized\nthe Secretary to “establish such regulations . . . as he deems necessary.”  8 U.S.C. §\n1103(a)(1) & (3); see also 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(1) (authorizing the Secretary to\n“delegate any of the Secretary’s functions to any [DHS] officer, employee, or\norganizational unit”); Matter of D-J-, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 573–74.  By granting\nregulatory authority to DHS, Congress intended that DHS would resolve any\nambiguities in the INA.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117,\n2125 (2016) (“A premise of Chevron is that when Congress grants an agency the\nauthority to administer a statute by issuing regulations with the force of law, it\npresumes the agency will use that authority to resolve ambiguities in the statutory\nscheme.”).  As we have already noted, the INA’s text is ambiguous.  DHS has\n35\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 36 of 79\nattempted to elucidate that ambiguity in the Final Rule.  In short, we do not read\nthe text of the INA to unambiguously foreclose DHS’s action.\n(2) Historic Understanding.  Although the foregoing would ordinarily be\nsufficient to end our inquiry, the current provision, which was most recently\nrewritten in 1996 in IIRIRA, is merely the most recent iteration of federal\nimmigration law to deem an alien inadmissible if he or she is likely to become a\n“public charge.”  There is a long history of judicial and administrative\ninterpretations of this phrase in the immigration context that predates the\nenactment of the INA.  Because “Congress is presumed to be aware of an\nadministrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation\nwhen it re-enacts a statute without change,” Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580\n(1978), we must examine this history to determine if “public charge” has a well-\ndefined and congressionally understood meaning that limits DHS’s discretion.\nThe history of the term “public charge” confirms that its definition has\nchanged over time to adapt to the way in which federal, state, and local\ngovernments have cared for our most vulnerable populations.  “Public charge” first\nappeared in this country’s immigration law in 1882.  That statute excluded a\nwould-be immigrant from the United States if the person was a “convict, lunatic,\n36\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 37 of 79\nidiot, or a[] person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a\npublic charge.”  Act of Aug. 3, 1882 ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214.  \nCongress did not define “public charge” in the 1882 act.  We thus ascribe to\nthat phrase its commonly understood meaning at the time, as evidenced by\ncontemporary sources.  See Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.S. 624, 633–34\n& nn.6–8 (2012) (citing contemporary dictionary definitions to interpret statutory\nphrases).  An 1828 dictionary defined “charge” as “[t]hat which is enjoined,\ncommitted, entrusted or delivered to another, implying care, custody, oversight, or\nduty to be performed by the person entrusted,” or a “person or thing committed to\nanothers [sic] custody, care or management.”  Charge, WEBSTER’S DICTIONARY\n(1828 Online Edition), http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/charge; see\nalso Stewart Rapaljb & Robert L. Lawrence, DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN AND\nENGLISH LAW, WITH DEFINITIONS OF THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF THE CANON AND\nCIVIL LAWS 196 (Frederick D. Linn & Co. 1888) (defining “charge” as “an\nobligation or liability.  Thus we speak . . . of a pauper being chargeable to the\nparish or town”).  That is a broad, common-sense definition, which was reflected in\nNineteenth-Century judicial opinions using the phrase.  See, e.g., In re Day, 27 F.\n678, 681 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1886) (defining a “public charge” as a person who “can\nneither take care of themselves, nor are under the charge or protection of any other\n37\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 38 of 79\nperson”); State v. The S.S. “Constitution”, 42 Cal. 578, 584–85 (1872) (noting that\nthose who are “liable to become a public charge” are “paupers, vagabonds, and\ncriminals, or sick, diseased, infirm, and disabled persons”); City of Alton v.\nMadison Cty., 21 Ill. 115, 117 (1859) (noting that a person is not a “public charge”\nif the person has “ample means” of support).  \nThe 1882 act did not consider an alien a “public charge” if the alien received\nmerely some form of public assistance.  The act itself established an “immigrant\nfund” that was designed to provide “for the care of immigrants arriving in the\nUnited States.”  Act of Mar. 26, 1910 ch. 376, § 1, 22 Stat. 214.  Congress thus\naccepted that providing some assistance to recent immigrants would not make\nthose immigrants public charges.  But Congress did not draw that line with any\nprecision.  Instead, we read “public charge” in the 1882 act to refer generally to\nthose who were unwilling or unable to care for themselves.  In context that often\nmeant that they were housed in a government or charitable institution, such as an\nalmshouse, asylum, or penitentiary. \nThe term “public charge” endured through subsequent amendments to the\n1882 act.  In 1910, Congress enacted a statute that deemed “paupers; persons likely\nto become a public charge; professional beggars;” and similar people inadmissible. \nch. 128, § 2, 36 Stat. 263 (1910).  Relying on the placement of “public charge”\n38\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 39 of 79\nbetween “paupers” and “professional beggars,” the Supreme Court held that a\nperson is likely to become a public charge if that person has “permanent personal\nobjections” to finding employment.  Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915).  In that\ncase, the petitioners, Russian emigrees, arrived in the United States with little cash\nand the intention of going to Portland, Oregon.  The immigration officials\nconsidered them likely to become public charges because Portland had a high\nunemployment rate.  In a spare, three-page opinion by Justice Holmes, the Court\nnoted that the “single question” before the Court was “whether an alien can be\ndeclared likely to become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in\nthe city of his immediate destination is overstocked.”  Id. at 9–10.  The Court\nanswered in the negative.  In making the public-charge determination, immigration\nofficers must consider an alien’s “personal” characteristics, not a localized job\nshortage.  Id. at 10.  The Court observed that  “public charge” should be “read as\ngenerically similar to the other[] [statutory terms] mentioned before and after” that\nphrase.  Id.  Five years later, we followed the Supreme Court’s lead, holding that\n“the words ‘likely to become a public charge’ are meant to exclude only those\npersons who are likely to become occupants of almshouses for want of means with\nwhich to support themselves in the future.”  Ng Fung Ho v. White, 266 F. 765, 769\n(9th Cir. 1920) (citing Howe v. United States, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917)),\n39\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 40 of 79\naff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 259 U.S. 276 (1922).13  Thus, as\nof 1920, we considered the likelihood of being housed in a state institution to be\nthe primary factor in the public-charge analysis. \nBy the mid-Twentieth Century, the United States had largely abandoned the\npoorhouse in favor of direct payments through social welfare legislation. At the\nfederal level, the government had created Social Security and Aid to Families With\nDependent Children (AFDC).  At the state level, governments supplemented\nfamily income through programs such as unemployment insurance and worker’s\ncompensation.  Similar changes were being made in other programs such as mental\nhealth care, where we moved from institutionalizing the mentally ill to a program\nof treatment with the end of releasing them.  As Chief Justice Burger observed:\nHistorically, and for a considerable period of time, subsidized\ncustodial care in private foster homes or boarding houses was the\n13 In Ng Fung Ho, the petitioner had been admitted to the United States,\nbased partly on his holding a “certificate” that allowed him to be a “merchant.”  Id.\nat 768.  Several years after his admission, he pleaded guilty to gambling.  Id. at\n769.  It was then determined that the petitioner was no longer a merchant.  The\ngovernment argued that the petitioner was deportable because he had been likely to\nbecome a public charge at the time of his admission.  Because there was no\nevidence that the certificate he had produced prior to admission had been\nfraudulent, we held that merely pleading guilty to gambling and paying a $25 fine\nthree years after being admitted did not “prove that the alien . . . was likely to\nbecome a public charge” at the time of admission.  Id.  We thus rejected the\ngovernment’s assertion that the petitioner should be deported on that basis.  Id. at\n770.\n40\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 41 of 79\nmost benign form of care provided incompetent or mentally ill\npersons for whom the States assumed responsibility.  Until well into\nthe 19th century the vast majority of such persons were simply\nrestrained in poorhouses, almshouses, or jails.\n \nO’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 582 (1975) (Burger, C.J., concurring). \n“[T]he idea that States may not confine the mentally ill except for the purpose of\nproviding them with treatment [was] of very recent origin.”  Id. (footnote omitted). \nThe way in which we regarded the poor and the mentally infirm not only brought\nchanges in the way we treated them, but major changes in their legal rights as well. \nSee, e.g., McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Inst., 407 U.S. 245, 248–50 (1972)\n(requiring a hearing before a person who has completed his criminal sentence can\nbe committed to indefinite confinement in a mental institution); cf. Goldberg v.\nKelly, 397 U.S. 254, 260–61 (1970) (holding that a recipient of public assistance\npayments is constitutionally entitled to an evidentiary hearing before those\npayments are terminated).\nThe movement towards social welfare was soon reflected in the definition of\n“public charge.”  In Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (BIA 1948), the recently\ncreated BIA articulated a new definition of “public charge.”  Permanent\ninstitutionalization would not be the sole measure of whether an alien was a public\ncharge.  The BIA said it would also consider whether an alien received temporary\n41\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 42 of 79\nservices from the government.  At the same time, the BIA recognized that mere\n“acceptance by an alien of services provided by” the government “does not in and\nof itself make the alien a public charge.”  Id. at 324.  Instead, the BIA stated that an\nalien becomes a public charge if three elements are met:  “(1) The State or other\ngoverning body must, by appropriate law, impose a charge for the services\nrendered to the alien. . . .  (2) The authorities must make demand for payment of\nthe charges . . . .  And (3) there must be a failure to pay for the charges.”  Id. at\n326.  In other words, the government benefit received by the alien must be\nmonetized, a bill must be presented to the alien, and the alien must refuse to pay. \nUltimately, in Matter of B-, the BIA held that the petitioner had not become a\npublic charge, even though she had been involuntarily committed to a mental\ninstitution, because the state of Illinois had not charged her or demanded payment. \nId. at 327.  The BIA’s order was subsequently affirmed by the Attorney General. \nId. at 337.\nFour years later, Congress substantially revised the immigration laws in the\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952.  The amended statute retained the term\n“public charge,” but, for the first time, made clear that the decision was committed\nto the opinion of a consular officer or the Attorney General.  The INA deemed\ninadmissible “[a]liens who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of\n42\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 43 of 79\napplication for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of\napplication for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges.”  Title\n2, ch. 2, § 212, 66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952).  Although Matter of B- was not\nmentioned in the legislative history accompanying the 1952 act, it is notable that\nCongress chose to insert this “opinion” language following the BIA’s articulation\nof a new definition of “public charge” that departed from prior judicial\ninterpretations of the term.\nIn 1974, the BIA altered course again.  The BIA limited Matter of B-’s three-\npart test to determining whether a person had become a public charge after having\nbeen admitted to the United States.  See Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec.\n583, 585 (BIA 1974).  After noting that the phrase “public charge” had been\ninterpreted differently by various courts, the BIA held:\n[A]ny alien who is incapable of earning a livelihood, who does not\nhave sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and has no\nperson in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not\nneed public support is excludable as likely to become a public charge\nwhether or not the public support which will be available to him is\nreimbursable to the state.\nId. at 589–90.  The BIA thus pegged the public-charge determination to whether\nthe alien was likely to “need public support,” irrespective of whether the alien was\n43\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 44 of 79\nlikely to be institutionalized for any length of time and billed for the cost by the\nstate.  Id. at 589.\nThat definition of “public charge” was subsequently amended by the INS. \nIn 1987, the INS issued a final rule that deemed an applicant for adjustment of\nstatus to be a “public charge” if the applicant had “received public cash\nassistance.”  Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205, 16,211\n(May 1, 1987).  INS did not state how much “public cash assistance” an alien had\nto receive, but left the decision to officers who would judge the totality of the\ncircumstances.  See id. at 16,211 (noting that “all [the] evidence produced by the\napplicant will be judged”), 16,212 (“The weight given in considering applicability\nof the public charge provisions will depend on many factors . . . .”).  INS did make\nclear that “public cash assistance” would not include the value of  “assistance in\nkind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits,” including\nMedicare and Medicaid.  Id. at 16,209.   \nIn 1996, through IIRIRA, Congress enacted the current language appearing\nin § 212 of the INA.  Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, Title 5 § 531,\n110 Stat. 3009 (1996).  As detailed above, Congress added a requirement that an\nimmigration officer consider an alien’s “age;” “health;” “family status;” “assets,\n44\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 45 of 79\nresources and financial status;” and “education and skills” when determining if a\nperson is likely to become a public charge.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B).  \nResponding to the 1996 act, INS published the 1999 Field Guidance to\n“establish clear standards governing a determination that an alien is inadmissible or\nineligible to adjust status . . . on public charge grounds.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689. \nIn the 1999 Field Guidance, INS defined “public charge” as “an alien . . . who is\nlikely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) primarily dependent on the\ngovernment for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash\nassistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at\ngovernment expense.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The 1999 Field\nGuidance made clear that the public-charge determination remained a “totality of\nthe circumstances test.”  Id. at 28,690.  Within this totality-of-the-circumstances\nassessment, only the receipt of “cash public assistance for income maintenance”\nshould be considered; “receipt of non-cash benefits or the receipt of special-\npurpose cash benefits not for income maintenance should not be taken into\naccount.”  Id.  The 1999 Field Guidance thus largely reaffirmed INS’s 1987 rule. \nFor the past twenty years, the 1999 Field Guidance has governed, until it was\nreplaced by the Final Rule. \n45\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 46 of 79\nSo what to make of this history?  Unlike the district courts, we are unable to\ndiscern one fixed understanding of “public charge” that has endured since 1882.  If\nanything has been consistent, it is the idea that a totality-of-the-circumstances test\ngoverns public-charge determinations.  But different factors have been weighted\nmore or less heavily at different times, reflecting changes in the way in which we\nprovide assistance to the needy.  Initially, the likelihood of being housed in a\ngovernment or charitable institution was most important.  Then, the focus shifted\nin 1948 to whether public benefits received by an immigrant could be monetized,\nand the immigrant refused to pay for them.  In 1974, it shifted again to whether the\nimmigrant was employable and self-sufficient.  That was subsequently narrowed in\n1987 to whether the immigrant had received public cash assistance, which\nexcluded in-kind benefits.  Congress then codified particular factors immigration\nofficers must consider, which was followed by the 1999 Field Guidance’s\ndefinition of “public charge.”  In short, we find that the history of the use of\n“public charge” in federal immigration law demonstrates that “public charge” does\nnot have a fixed, unambiguous meaning.  Rather, the phrase is subject to multiple\ninterpretations, it in fact has been interpreted differently, and the Executive Branch\nhas been afforded the discretion to interpret it.  \n46\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 47 of 79\nCongress simply has not spoken to how “public charge” should be defined. \nWe must presume that when Congress enacted the current version of the INA in\n1996, it was aware of the varying historical interpretations of “public charge.”  See\nForest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239–40 (2009).  Yet Congress chose\nnot to define “public charge” and, instead, described various factors to be\nconsidered “at a minimum,” without even defining those factors.  It is apparent that\nCongress left DHS and other agencies enforcing our immigration laws the\nflexibility to adapt the definition of “public charge” as necessary.  \n(3) Other Factors.  Both district courts found it significant that Congress\ntwice considered, but failed to enact, a definition of “public charge” that is similar\nto the definition adopted in the Final Rule. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL\n5100718 at *27; Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17.  During the debates over\nIIRIRA in 1996, Congress considered whether to enact the following definition of\n“public charge”:  “the term ‘public charge’ includes any alien who receives [certain\nmeans-tested] benefits . . . for an aggregate period of at least 12 months or 36\nmonths” in some cases.  142 Cong. Rec. 24,313, at 24,425 (1996).  Senator Leahy\nargued that this was “too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the\nsame public assistance that many Americans need to get on their feet,” and that the\nphrase “means tested” was “unnecessarily uncertain.”  S. Rep. No. 104-249, at\n47\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 48 of 79\n63–64 (1996).  Nevertheless, the Senate passed the bill containing the definition of\n“public charge.”  Before the House considered the bill, however, President Clinton\nimplicitly threatened to veto it because it went “too far in denying legal immigrants\naccess to vital safety net programs which could jeopardize public health and\nsafety.”  Statement on Senate Action on the “Immigration Control and Financial\nResponsibility Act of 1996,” 32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 783 (May 6, 1996). \nUltimately, Congress chose not to enact this “public charge” definition.  In 2013,\nthe Senate rejected an amendment to the INA that “would have expanded the\ndefinition of ‘public charge’ such that people who received non-cash health\nbenefits could not become legal permanent residents.  This amendment would also\nhave denied entry to individuals whom the Department of Homeland Security\ndetermines are likely to receive these types of benefits in the future.”  S. Rep. No.\n113-40, at 63 (2013).  \nThe district courts viewed these failed legislative efforts as evidence that\nCongress specifically rejected the interpretation of “public charge” DHS\narticulated in the Final Rule, and that the Final Rule is thus an impermissible\nreading of the INA.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *27;\nWashington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17.  We disagree.  If this legislative history is\nprobative of anything, it is probative only of the fact that Congress chose not to\n48\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 49 of 79\ncodify a particular interpretation of “public charge.”14  See Cent. Bank of Denver,\nN.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 184 (1994) (“[F]ailed\nlegislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an\ninterpretation of a prior statute.” (quotation marks and citation omitted)).  But the\nfailure of Congress to compel DHS to adopt a particular rule is not the logical\nequivalent of forbidding DHS from adopting that rule.  The failure to adopt a new\nrule is just that: no new rule.15  And no change to § 212 means that consular\nofficers, the Attorney General, and DHS retain all the discretion granted them in\nthe INA.\n14 Sometimes it is appropriate to consider language Congress has rejected,\nprimarily when Congress rejected language in favor of the statute adopted and\nunder review.  See, e.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 441–42 (1987)\n(contrasting Congress’s decision to adopt the House proposal over the Senate\nversion).  \n15 We can speculate as to the reasons that members of Congress declined to\nadopt these legislative proposals, but the speculation will not help us.  “A bill can\nbe proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many\nothers.”  Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531\nU.S. 159, 170 (2001).  Although some members may have thought the rule too\nharsh, others may have thought it too lenient, while a third group may have thought\nthe rule should be left flexible and in the hands of the immigration agencies.  If\nanything, this legislative history proves only that Congress decided not to constrain\nthe discretion of agencies in determining who is a public charge.  That discretion\nhad long been vested in the agencies, and these failed legislative efforts did not\nalter that discretion.  \n49\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 50 of 79\nA second argument made by the States and relied upon by the Eastern\nDistrict of Washington is that DHS exceeded its authority by determining what\nmakes a person “self-sufficient.”  Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17–18. \nThis argument is refuted by the statute itself.  As we have discussed, the INA\nrequires immigration officers to consider an alien’s “health,” “family status,”\n“assets, resources, [] financial status,” “education and skills.”  8 U.S.C. §\n1182(a)(4)(B)(i)(II)–(V) .  The concept of self-sufficiency is subsumed within each\nof these factors.  And even if it were not, the statutory factors are not exhaustive;\nDHS may add to them.  See id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Because DHS has been\n“charged with the administration and enforcement” of all “laws relating to the\nimmigration and naturalization of aliens,”  Id. § 1103(a)(1); see also 6 U.S.C. §\n50\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 51 of 79\n112(b)(1), determining what constitutes self-sufficiency for purposes of the public-\ncharge assessment is well within DHS’s authority.16 \n* * *\nIn short, Congress has not spoken directly to the interpretation of “public\ncharge” in the INA.  Nor did it unambiguously foreclose the interpretation\narticulated in the Final Rule.  Instead, the phrase “public charge” is ambiguous\nunder Chevron.  DHS has the authority to interpret it and “must consider varying\ninterpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.”  Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 863–64.  Indeed, “the fact that the agency has adopted different definitions\nin different contexts adds force to the argument that the definition itself is flexible,\nparticularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible\n16 The Eastern District of Washington also held that, because the states have\na “central role in formulation and administration of health care policy,” DHS\n“acted beyond its Congressionally delegated authority” when it adopted the Final\nRule.  Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *18; see also id. (“Congress cannot\ndelegate authority that the Constitution does not allocate to the federal government\nin the first place . . . . .”).  Congress, of course, has plenary authority to regulate\nimmigration and naturalization.  U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant to that\nauthority, Congress adopted the “public charge” rule, which no one has challenged\non constitutional grounds.  Further, Congress has authorized DHS to adopt\nregulations.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3).  DHS thus did not overstep its authority by\npromulgating the Final Rule.  Indeed, under the district court’s analysis, even the\n1999 Field Guidance might be unconstitutional.  But neither the district court nor\nthe States question the lawfulness of the 1999 Field Guidance.  We see no\nmeaningful difference between INS’s authority to promulgate the 1999 Field\nGuidance and DHS’s authority to adopt the Final Rule.\n51\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 52 of 79\nreading of the statute.”  Id. at 864.  We thus proceed to the second step of the\nChevron analysis. \nb. Chevron Step 2\nAt Chevron’s second step, we ask whether the agency’s interpretation is\n“reasonable—or ‘rational and consistent with the statute.’”  Diaz-Quirazco v. Barr,\n931 F.3d 830, 840 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 89\n(1990)).  If it is, we must defer to it, “even if the agency’s reading differs from\nwhat the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.”  Perez-Guzman v.\nLynch, 835 F.3d 1066, 1073–74 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Brand X, 545 U.S. at\n980).\nThe Final Rule easily satisfies this test.  As we have explained, the INA\ngrants DHS considerable discretion to determine if an alien is likely to become a\npublic charge.  To be sure, under the Final Rule, in-kind benefits (other than\ninstitutionalization) will for the first time be relevant to the public-charge\ndetermination.  We see no statutory basis from which a court could conclude that\nthe addition of certain categories of in-kind benefits makes DHS’s interpretation\n52\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 53 of 79\nuntenable.17  And whether the change in policy results from changing\ncircumstances or a change in administrations, the wisdom of the policy is not a\nquestion we can review.  See Brand X, 545 U.S. at 981.\nOur conclusion is reinforced by the Personal Responsibility and Work\nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which Congress enacted\ncontemporaneous with IIRIRA.  PRWORA set forth our “national policy with\nrespect to welfare and immigration.”  8 U.S.C. § 1601.  In relevant part, PRWORA\nprovides, “Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration\nlaw since this country’s earliest immigration statutes.”  Id. § 1601(1).  As a result,\n“[i]t continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that . . . aliens\nwithin the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but\nrather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their\nsponsors, and private organizations.”  Id. § 1601(2).  Receipt of non-cash public\nassistance is surely relevant to “self-sufficiency” and whether immigrants are\n“depend[ing] on public resources to meet their needs.”  See id. § 1601(1)–(2); see\n17 Cash benefits and in-kind benefits are often treated under the single rubric\nof a “direct subsidy.”  Witters v. Wash. Dep’t of the Servs. for the Blind, 474 U.S.\n481, 487 (1986).  In certain contexts, such as settlement, “compensation in kind is\nworth less than cash of the same nominal value,” In re Mex. Transfer Litig., 267\nF.3d 743, 748 (9th Cir. 2001), but the Final Rule does not deal with the valuation\nof such services.  It deals only with whether in-kind benefits have been received\nunder certain specified programs.     \n53\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 54 of 79\nalso Korab v. Fink, 797 F.3d 572, 580 (9th Cir. 2014).  PRWORA thus lends\nsupport to DHS’s interpretation of the INA. \nWe conclude that DHS’s interpretation of “public charge” is a permissible\nconstruction of the INA. \n2. The Rehabilitation Act\nThe States argue, and the Eastern District of Washington found, that the\nFinal Rule is inconsistent with the Rehabilitation Act.  Washington, 2019 WL\n5100717, at *18.  The Northern District of California rejected that argument.  City\n& Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *29–30.  The Rehabilitation Act\nprovides:  “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States\n. . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from participation\nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity . . . conducted by any Executive agency.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n“Program or activity” is defined as “all of the operations of . . . [an] agency.”  Id. §\n794(b). \nThis argument need not detain us long.  First, under the INA, immigration\nofficers are obligated to consider an immigrant’s “health” when making the public-\ncharge determination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i)(II).  To the extent that inquiry\nmay consider an alien’s disability, the officers have been specifically directed by\n54\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 55 of 79\nCongress to do so.  Indeed, Congress’s express direction that immigration officers\nconsider an alien’s “health” came twenty-three years after the Rehabilitation Act. \nWe cannot see how a general provision in one statute constrains an agency given a\nspecific charge in a subsequent law.  The INA does not violate the Rehabilitation\nAct.  Second, nothing in the Final Rule changes DHS’s practice with respect to\nconsidering an alien’s health.  Nothing in the Final Rule suggests that aliens will be\ndenied admission or adjustment of status “solely by reason of her or his disability.” \nThroughout the Final Rule, DHS confirms that the public-charge determination is a\ntotality-of-the-circumstances test.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295, 41,368.  And DHS\nspecifically addressed this argument in the Final Rule:  “it is not the intent, nor is it\nthe effect of this rule to find a person a public charge solely based on his or her\ndisability.”  Id. at 41,368.  DHS has shown a strong likelihood that the Final Rule\ndoes not violate the Rehabilitation Act.\n*          *          *\n In sum, DHS is likely to succeed in its argument that the Final Rule should\nnot be set aside as contrary to law.  We will not minimize the practical impact of\nthe Final Rule, but we will observe that it is a short leap in logic for DHS to go\nfrom considering in-cash public assistance to considering both in-cash and in-kind\npublic assistance.  DHS has shown that there is a strong likelihood that its decision\n55\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 56 of 79\nto consider the receipt of in-kind government assistance as part of its totality-of-\nthe-circumstances test is a reasonable interpretation of the INA and does not\nviolate the Rehabilitation Act. \nB. Arbitrary and Capricious\nArbitrary and capricious review under the APA addresses the reasonableness\nof the agency’s decision.  The classic statement of our scope of review is Motor\nVehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States v. State Farm Mutual\nAutomotive Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983):  \n[T]he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made.  In reviewing that\nexplanation, we must consider whether the decision was based on a\nconsideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a\nclear error of judgment.  Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary\nand capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has\nnot intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important\naspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that\ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view of the product of agency\nexpertise.\nId. at 43 (quotation marks and citations omitted); see Org. Vill. of Kake v. Dep’t of\nAgric., 795 F.3d 956, 966–67 (9th Cir. 2015).  An agency’s failure to respond to\nany particular comment or point put forward by a rule’s opponents is not a ground\nfor finding per se arbitrary-and-capricious action.  See Safari Aviation Inc. v.\n56\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 57 of 79\nGarvey, 300 F.3d 1144, 1150–52 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that there is no per se\nviolation of the APA when an agency fails to address comments); Thompson v.\nClark, 741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[The APA] has never been interpreted\nto require the agency to respond to every comment, or to analyse [sic] every issue\nor alternative raised by the comments, no matter how insubstantial.”). \nThe fact that DHS has changed policy does not substantially alter the burden\nin the challengers’ favor.  DHS must, of course, “show that there are good reasons\nfor the new policy,” but, it \nneed not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction that the reasons for the\nnew policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that\nthe new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good\nreasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the\nconscious change of course adequately indicates. \n FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).\nThe district courts raised two objections to DHS’s consideration that the\ndistrict courts found made the Final Rule arbitrary and capricious:  (1) DHS’s\nfailure to properly weigh the costs to state and local governments and healthcare\nproviders, such as hospitals, resulting from disenrollment from public benefits\nprograms; and (2) DHS’s inadequate consideration of the Final Rule’s impact on\npublic health.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *31–35;\nWashington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *19.  We will consider each in turn.\n57\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 58 of 79\n  \n1. Costs of Disenrollment\nThe Northern District of California’s principal concern was the higher costs\nthat state and local governments will face as a result of “disenrollment [from]\npublic benefits.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *31. \nSpecifically, the district court concluded that “DHS appears to have wholly failed\nto engage with [comments on the costs of the change].  DHS failed to grapple with\nthe [Final] Rule’s predictable effects on local governments, and instead concluded\nthat the harms—whatever they may be—are an acceptable price to pay.”  Id. at\n*32.  The court further faulted DHS for “refus[ing] to consider the costs associated\nwith predicted, likely disenrollment of those not subject to the public charge\ndetermination.”  Id.  \nWe begin with the observation that DHS addressed at length the costs and\nbenefits associated with the Final Rule.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,300–03\n(summarizing costs and benefits); id. at 41,312–14 (estimating costs to health care\nproviders, states, and localities); id. at 41,463–81 (responding to various comments\non costs and benefits); id. at 41,485–41,489 (responding to Executive Orders\n58\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 59 of 79\nrequiring an assessment of the costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives).18  In\naddition, DHS prepared an “Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for\nAnalysis of Public Benefits Programs,”\nwww.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-63742.  \nDHS’s analysis began by stating, “This rule will impose new costs on this\npopulation applying to adjust status . . . that are subject to the public charge ground\nof inadmissibility.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,300.  It estimated the direct costs to the\nfederal government of the rule to be $35,202,698 annually.  Some of these direct\ncosts to the federal government would be offset by “individuals who may choose to\ndisenroll from or forego enrollment in a public benefits program.”  Id.  DHS\nestimated the reduction in federal transfer payments would be about $2.47 billion\nannually.  Id. at 41,301.  It further estimated that there would be a reduction in state\ntransfer payments of about $1.01 billion annually.  Id.  DHS also acknowledged\nthat the Final Rule would impose direct and indirect costs on individuals and\nentities.  The first of these, it suggested, were “familiarization costs,” which was “a\n18 Indeed, DHS’s notice is quite comprehensive.  In no fewer than 216 pages\n(which DHS estimated would take sixteen to twenty hours to read), DHS explained\nthe changes proposed, estimated costs and savings, and addressed scores of\ncomments on topics ranging from potential public-health concerns to whether DHS\nshould consider immigrants’ credit scores.  See generally 84 Fed. Reg. at\n41,292–508.\n59\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 60 of 79\ndirect cost of the rule.”  Id.  Organizations that work with immigrant communities\nwould similarly experience indirect costs of familiarization.  Id.\nElsewhere, DHS responded to comments claiming that the Final Rule would\ncause aliens to disenroll from or forego enrollment in public benefit programs and\nthat this “would be detrimental to the financial stability and economy of\ncommunities, States, local organizations, hospitals, safety net providers,\nfoundations, and healthcare centers.”  Id. at 41,312; see also id. (suggesting that the\nFinal Rule would increase the use of hospital emergency rooms).   DHS identified\nthree categories of aliens who might be affected by the Final Rule.  First, there are\naliens who are entitled to public benefits and seek to immigrate or adjust status. \nTheir receipt of some public benefits are simply not covered by the rule.  DHS\nnoted, for example, that “emergency response, immunization, education, or\n[certain] social services” are not included in its revised definition of “public\nbenefits.”  Id.  On the other hand, there are public benefits to which such an alien is\nentitled but which will be considered by DHS in its determination whether such\nalien is a “public charge.”  DHS “acknowledge[d] that individuals subject to this\nrule may decline to enroll in, or may choose to disenroll from, public benefits for\nwhich they may be eligible under PRWORA, in order to avoid negative\nconsequences as a result of this final rule.”  Id.  DHS could not estimate how many\n60\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 61 of 79\naliens in this category would be affected by the Final Rule “because data\nlimitations provide neither a precise count nor reasonable estimate of the number\nof aliens who are both subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and\nare eligible for public benefits in the United States.”   Id. at 41,313.  \nThe second category of aliens are those who are unlawfully in the United\nStates.  These are “generally barred from receiving federal public benefits other\nthan emergency assistance.”  Id. (footnote omitted).   Nevertheless, DHS\nannounced that it will not consider “for purposes of a public charge inadmissibility\ndetermination whether applicants for admission or adjustment of status are\nreceiving food assistance through other programs, such as exclusively state-funded\nprograms, food banks, and emergency services, nor will DHS discourage\nindividuals from seeking such assistance.”  Id. \nThird are those aliens and U.S. citizens who are not subject to the Final\nRule, but erroneously think they are and disenroll from public benefits out of an\nabundance of caution.  Id.  Disenrollment by this category of persons should not be\ninfluenced by the Final Rule because their receipt of public benefits will “not be\ncounted against or made attributable to immigrant family members who are subject\nto this rule.”  Id.  DHS understood “the potential effects of confusion” over the\nscope of the Final Rule that might lead to over-disenrollment.  DHS stated that it\n61\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 62 of 79\nwould “issue clear guidance that identifies the groups of individuals who are not\nsubject to the rule.”  Id.\nThe Northern District of California pointed out that DHS’s response “fails to\ndiscuss costs being borne by the states, hospitals, or others, other than to say DHS\nwill issue guidance in an effort to mitigate confusion.”  City & Cty. of San\nFrancisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *34.  The court further criticized DHS for “flatly\nrefus[ing] to consider the costs associated with predicted, likely disenrollment of\nthose not subject to the public charge determination.”  Id. at *35.\nWe think several points must be considered here.  First, the costs that the\nstates, localities, and various entities (such as healthcare providers) may suffer are\nindirect.  Nothing in the Final Rule imposes costs on those governments or entities;\nthe Final Rule does not regulate states, localities, and private entities. \nDisenrollment will be the consequence of either (1) the free choice of aliens who\nwish to avoid any negative repercussions for their immigration status that would\nresult from accepting public benefits, or (2) the mistaken disenrollment of aliens or\nU.S. citizens who can receive public benefits without any consequences for their\nresidency status.  DHS addressed both groups.  DHS said it did not have data to\ncalculate the size of the first group (and, presumably, the value of the benefits from\nwhich they will disenroll), and it had no way to estimate the second.  84 Fed. Reg.\n62\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 63 of 79\nat 41,313.  DHS stated that it would try to compensate for the latter group’s error\nby publishing clear guidance, and it also noted that other organizations, public and\nprivate, would have an incentive to provide accurate information to persons who\nmight mistakenly disenroll.  Id. at 41,486.  \nSecond, DHS did acknowledge the indirect costs the Final Rule might\nimpose\ndownstream . . . on state and local economics, large and small\nbusinesses, and individuals.  For example, the rule might result in\nreduced revenues for healthcare providers participating in Medicaid,\ncompanies that manufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals,\ngrocery retailers participating in SNAP, agricultural producers who\ngrow foods that are eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, or\nlandlords participating in federally funded housing programs. \nId.  It did not attempt to quantify those costs, but it recognized the overall effect of\nthe Final Rule, and that is sufficient.  See Irvine Med. Ctr. v. Thompson, 275 F.3d\n823, 835 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he Secretary acknowledged that some Medicare\nbeneficiaries would possibly have to shoulder an additional financial burden as a\nresult of the repeal of the carry-forward provision.  This acknowledgment did not\nrender the Secretary’s rulemaking statement or reliance upon it arbitrary,\nhowever.” (internal citation omitted)) .  \n63\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 64 of 79\nThird, DHS is not a regulatory agency like EPA, FCC, or OSHA.  Those\nagencies have broad mandates to regulate directly entire industries or practices,\nsometimes on no more instruction from Congress than to do so in the “public\nconvenience, interest or necessity,” 47 U.S.C. § 303 (FCC), or as “appropriate and\nnecessary,” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(n)(1)(A) (EPA).  When Congress has vested such\nbroad regulatory authority in agencies, the Supreme Court has sometimes insisted\nthat the agencies perform some kind of a cost-benefit analysis.  See, e.g., Michigan\nv. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015) (EPA cannot “ignore cost when deciding\nwhether to regulate power plants”); Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. Am.\nPetroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 644 (1980) (plurality opinion) (OSHA must\n“undertake some cost-benefit analysis before [it] promulgates any [safety and\nhealth] standard”).  But see Am. Textile Mfs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490,\n510–11 (1981) (“Congress uses specific language when intending that an agency\nengage in cost-benefit analysis.”).  By contrast, DHS is defining a simple statutory\nterm—“public charge”—to determine whether an alien is admissible.  Its only\nmandate is to regulate immigration and naturalization, not to secure transfer\npayments to state governments or ensure the stability of the health care industry. \nAny effects on those entities are indirect and well beyond DHS’s charge and\nexpertise.  Even if it could estimate the costs to the states, localities, and healthcare\n64\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 65 of 79\nproviders, DHS has a mandate from Congress with respect to admitting aliens to\nthe United States.  As DHS explained,\nDHS does not believe that it is sound policy to ignore the\nlongstanding self-sufficiency goals set forth by Congress or to admit\nor grant adjustment of status applications of aliens who are likely to\nreceive public benefits designated in this rule to meet their basic\nliving needs in . . . hope that doing so might alleviate food and\nhousing insecurity, improve public health, decrease costs to states and\nlocalities, or better guarantee health care provider reimbursements. \nDHS does not believe that Congress intended for DHS to administer\n[§ 212] in a manner that fails to account for aliens’ receipt of food,\nmedical, and housing benefits so as to help aliens become self-\nsufficient.\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314.  Even had DHS been able to calculate the indirect costs\nthat states, localities, and healthcare providers might bear as a result of the Final\nRule, it is not clear what DHS was supposed to balance.  Rather, it was\nsufficient—and not arbitrary and capricious—for DHS to consider whether, in the\nlong term, the overall benefits of its policy change will outweigh the costs of\nretaining the current policy.  \n2. Public-Health Concerns\nThe Northern District of California also found that DHS did not sufficiently\nrespond to certain public-health concerns.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL\n5100718, at *35–37.  Specifically, the court worried that by disenrolling from\npublic-health benefits like Medicaid, people may forgo vaccinations, which could\n65\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 66 of 79\nhave serious public-health consequences.  Id.  The district court also pointed out\nthat the 1999 Field Guidance declined to define “public charge” to include receipt\nof “health and nutrition benefits” out of fear of possible public-health\nramifications.  Id. at *37 (citing 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692). \nDHS not only addressed these concerns directly, it changed its Final Rule in\nresponse to the comments.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297.  With respect to vaccines, DHS\nstated that it “does not intend to restrict the access of vaccines for children or\nadults or intend to discourage individuals form obtaining the necessary vaccines to\nprevent vaccine-preventable diseases.”  Id. at 41,384.  The Final Rule “does not\nconsider receipt of Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a person’s\npregnancy, to constitute receipt of public benefits.”  DHS said that would address\n“a substantial portion, though not all, of the vaccinations issue.”  Id.  Accordingly,\nDHS “believes that vaccines would still be available for children and adults even if\nthey disenroll from Medicaid.”  Id. at 41,385.\nBoth the Northern District of California and the Eastern District of\nWashington expressed concern that the Final Rule was a departure from the 1999\nField Guidance, which raised the vaccine issue, and that the 1999 Field Guidance\nhad “engendered reliance.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at\n*37; see also Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *19.   The question is not whether\n66\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 67 of 79\nan agency can change a policy that people have come to rely on; clearly, it can. \nThe real question is whether the agency has acknowledged the change and\nexplained the reasons for it.  DHS knew well that it was adopting a change in\npolicy; that was the whole purpose of this rulemaking exercise.  See Encino\nMotorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (holding that a Department of Labor regulation was\n“issued without . . . reasoned explanation” where there was “decades of industry\nreliance on the Department’s prior policy” and the new rule was “offered [with]\nbarely any explanation”); INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996)\n(distinguishing an “an irrational departure from [established] policy” from “an\navowed alteration of it”).  “[I]t suffices that the new policy is permissible under the\nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be\nbetter, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.”   Fox\nTelevision Stations, 556 U.S. at 515.  Because DHS has adequately explained the\nreasons for the Final Rule, it has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the\nmerits.  \nV. OTHER FACTORS\nWe have concluded that DHS is likely to succeed on the merits.  Were we\nreviewing the preliminary injunctions on direct review, this would be sufficient to\nreverse the district courts’ orders.  See Trump v. Hawai’i, 138 S. Ct. at 2423.  But\n67\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 68 of 79\nbecause we are here on DHS’s motion for a stay, DHS bears the burden of\nsatisfying three additional factors: that DHS will suffer some irreparable harm, that\nthe balance of the hardships favors a stay, and that the stay is in the public interest.  \nNken, 556 U.S. at 434.\nA. Irreparable Harm\nWe first consider whether DHS has shown that it “will be irreparably injured\nabsent a stay.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776).  The\nclaimed irreparable injury must be likely to occur; “simply showing some\n‘possibility of irreparable injury’” is insufficient.  Id. (citation omitted).  DHS has\ncarried its burden on this factor.\n         DHS contends that as long as the Final Rule is enjoined,\nDHS will grant lawful-permanent-resident status to aliens whom the\nSecretary would otherwise deem likely to become public charges in the\nexercise of his discretion.  DHS currently has no practical means of\nrevisiting public-charge determinations once made, so the injunctions will\ninevitably result in the grant of LPR status to aliens who, under the\nSecretary’s interpretation of the statute, are likely to become public charges. \nThe States do not deny that LPR status might be irrevocably granted to some\naliens, but they claim that DHS has “exaggerate[d] the effect of the injunction”\nbecause the public-charge exclusion has “never played a significant role in\nimmigration.  In contrast, in just 8 of the 14 Plaintiff States [in the Washington\n68\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 69 of 79\ncase] over 1.8 million lawfully present residents may be driven from federal and\nstate assistance programs if the injunction is lifted.”  They argue that preserving the\nstatus quo will not harm DHS pending adjudication on the merits, especially\nconsidering that the Final Rule replaces a policy that had been in place for\ndecades.   \nSeveral points emerge from the parties’ claims.  First, the States appear to\nconcede that decisions to grant adjustment of status to aliens who could otherwise\nnot be eligible are not reversible.  Second, although the States argue that “public\ncharge” exculsions have not been an important component of our immigration\nscheme in the past, the whole point of DHS’s Final Rule is that “public charge”\ninadmissibility has been underenforced.  \nMoreover, to the extent the States are contesting the magnitude of the harm\nto DHS, the claim is irrelevant here.  We have said that this “analysis focuses on\nirreparability, ‘irrespective of the magnitude of the injury.’”  California v. Azar,\n911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d\n716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999)).  But even if we look at the magnitude, the States’ own\nevidence is double-edged.  The States claim that they will suffer harm because\nmillions of persons will disenroll to avoid potential immigration consequences. \nThis seems to prove DHS’s point.  If millions of “lawfully present residents” are\n69\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 70 of 79\ncurrently receiving public benefits and may choose to disenroll rather than be\nfound to be a “public charge” and inadmissible, the harm cited by DHS is not only\nirreparable, but significant.   \nFinally, we think the tenability of DHS’s past practice is of no import here. \nCongress has granted DHS the authority to enact and alter immigration regulations\nand DHS has done that, and it has done so in a way that comports with its legal\nauthority.  Thus, as of October 15, 2019, DHS had an obligation to deny admission\nto those likely to become public charge, as defined by the Final Rule.  This is true\nregardless of  DHS’s prior policy.  As a consequence, the preliminary injunctions\nwill force DHS to grant status to those not legally entitled to it.  DHS has satisfied\nits burden to show irreparable harm to the government absent a stay of the\ninjunctions.\nB. Balance of Hardships and Public Interest\nSince DHS has satisfied the first two factors, we proceed to the final two:\nbalance of equities and the public interest.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. “Because the\ngovernment is a party, we consider [these two factors] together.”  California v.\nAzar, 911 F.3d at 581. \nTo balance the equities, we consider the hardships each party is likely to\nsuffer if the other prevails.  N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Norton, 503 F.3d 836, 843–44\n70\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 71 of 79\n(9th Cir. 2007) (citing Amoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542\n(1987).  We have discussed above the irreparable, non-monetary harm to the\ngovernment.  On the other hand, the States contend that they face financial, public-\nhealth, and administrative harms if the Final Rule takes effect and otherwise\neligible individuals disenroll from public benefits.  These effects are indirect\neffects of the Final Rule and they are largely short-term, since they will only result\nduring the pendency of the proceedings in the district courts and any appeals to this\ncourt and the Supreme Court.19  Those proceedings are likely to be conducted on\nan expedited basis, limiting further any potential harm to be considered by this\ncourt.  DHS does not dispute that the States will incur some financial harm if the\nFinal Rule is not stayed.  It cannot, because DHS repeatedly addressed the\npotential costs to the States in its Final Rule.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reb. at 41,300,\n41,312–14, 41,385–85, 41,469–70, 41,474.  And while ordinarily, we do not\nconsider purely economic harm irreparable, we have concluded that “such harm is\nirreparable” when “the states will not be able to recover monetary damages.” \nCalifornia v. Azar, 911 F.3d at 581.  Yet the States’ financial concerns will be\nmitigated to some extent.  As DHS explained in the Final Rule, disenrollment from\n19 This is not to say that the States will not continue to incur harms after the\nlitigation terminates, but these potential harms are not relevant to the question of a\npreliminary injunction or a stay.\n71\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 72 of 79\npublic benefits  means a reduction in federal and state transfer payments, so the\nStates will realize some savings in expenditures.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,485–86. \nNevertheless, we consider the harms to the States, even if not readily quantifiable,\nsignificant.\nBalancing these harms is particularly difficult in this case.  First, the harms\nare not comparable.  DHS’s harm is not monetary, but programmatic.  The policy\nbehind Congress’s decision not to admit those who are likely to become a public\ncharge may have a fiscal component, but it is not the reason for DHS’s Final Rule,\nnor has DHS argued financial harm as a reason for seeking a stay.  By contrast, the\nStates’ proffered harms are largely financial.  Second, both parties’ proffered\nharms are, to a degree, speculative.  We cannot say for certain how many residents\nof the plaintiff states and counties will disenroll from public benefits programs, nor\nhow much any over-disenrollment will cost the States.  Nor can we say for certain\nhow many aliens might be found admissible during the pendency of the\npreliminary injunction, and would have been found inadmissible under the Final\nRule.  Given the largely predictive nature of both parties’ alleged harms, we cannot\nstate with any confidence which is greater.  \nFor the same reasons, the public interest in this case is likewise difficult to\ncalculate with precision.  DHS contends it is in the public’s interest not to grant\n72\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 73 of 79\nimmigration status to persons likely to become public charges.  The States contend\nthat it is in the public’s interest to avoid increased administrative and public-health\ncosts.  Both of these contentions are likely true.  But on balance, we have few\nstandards for announcing which interest is greater.\nWe recently observed that “balancing the equities is not an exact science.” \nAzar, 911 F.3d at 582.  Indeed, Justice Frankfurter once remarked that the\nbalancing of the equities was merely “lawyers’ jargon for choosing between\nconflicting public interests.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S.\n579, 609 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  Whether the stay is granted or\ndenied, one party’s costs will be incurred and the other avoided.  In the end, the\n“critical” factors are that DHS has mustered a strong showing of likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits and some irreparable harm.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  Those\nfactors weigh in favor of granting a stay, despite the potential harms to the States. \nAnd for that reason, the stay is in the public interest.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction in Nos. 19-17213 and\n19-17214 is GRANTED.  The petition for stay of the preliminary injunction in No.\n19-35914 is GRANTED.  The cases may proceed consistent with this opinion.\n73\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 74 of 79\nFILED\nCity and County of San Francisco, et al v. USCIS, et al, No. 19-17213+\nDEC 5 2019\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge, concurring, perplexed and perturbed:\nMOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nI join the majority opinion in full.  I write separately to emphasize two\npoints—points that I feel must be made, but are better said in a separate opinion.  \nWe as a nation are engaged in titanic struggles over the future of\nimmigration in the United States.  These are difficult conversations.  As a court,\nthe Ninth Circuit in particular has felt the effects of the recent surge in\nimmigration.  As we observed last year with respect to the asylum problem:  \nWe have experienced a staggering increase in asylum applications.  Ten\nyears ago we received about 5,000 applications for asylum.  In fiscal year\n2018 we received about 97,000—nearly a twenty-fold increase.  Our\nobligation to process these applications in a timely manner, consistent with\nour statutes and regulations, is overburdened.  The current backlog of\nasylum cases exceeds 200,000—about 26% of the immigration courts’ total\nbacklog of nearly 800,000 removal cases.  In the meantime, while\napplications are processed, thousands of applicants who had been detained\nby immigration authorities have been released into the United States. \nE. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 754 (9th Cir. 2018) (citations\nomitted).   Because of our proximity to Mexico, Central America, and East Asia,\nthe brunt of these cases will find their way into our court.   And we are well aware\nthat we are only seeing the matters that find their way into federal court, and that\nthe burdens of the increase in immigration are borne not only by our judges, but by\nthe men and women in the executive branch charged with enforcing the\nimmigration laws.  \n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 75 of 79\nOur court has faced an unprecedented increase in emergency petitions\narising out of the administration’s efforts to administer the immigration laws and\nsecure our borders.  These controversial efforts have met with mixed success in our\ncourt and the Supreme Court.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670 (9th\nCir.) (construction of wall on the border with Mexico), stay issued, 140 S. Ct. 1\n(2019) (mem.); E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 2018)\n(aliens entering outside a port of entry are ineligible for asylum); Regents of Univ.\nof Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. 2018) (DACA),\ncert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 2779 (2019) (mem.); Trump v. Hawai’i, 878 F.3d 662 (9th\nCir. 2017) (per curiam) (entry restrictions), rev’d, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018); Flores v.\nSessions, 862 F.3d 863 (9th Cir. 2017) (treatment of detained alien minors under\nFlores agreement); Hawai’i v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.) (per curiam) (travel\nban), vacated as moot, 138 S. Ct. 377 (2017) (mem.); Washington v. Trump, 847\nF.3d 1151 (9th Cir.) (per curiam) (travel ban), cert. denied sub nom. Golden v.\nWashington, 138 S. Ct. 448 (2017) (mem.).  \nMy first point is that even as we are embroiled in these controversies, no one\nshould mistake our judgments for our policy preferences.  Whether “the iron fist\n[or an extended velvet glove] would be the preferable policy. . . . our thoughts on\nthe efficacy of the one approach versus the other are beside the point, since our\n2\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 76 of 79\nbusiness is not to judge the wisdom of the National Government’s policy.”  Am.\nIns. Ass’n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 427 (2003); see Sale v. Haitian Ctrs.\nCouncil, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 165 (1993) (“The wisdom of the policy choices made\nby Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton is not a matter for our consideration.”); \nLochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 69 (1905) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (“Whether or\nnot this be wise legislation it is not the province of the court to inquire.  Under our\nsystems of government the courts are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of\nlegislation.”). \nOh, I am not so naive as to think that a simple declaration of judicial\nneutrality will quell inquiry into judges’ backgrounds, prior writings, and opinions. \nThe battles over judicial nominations provide ample proof that our generation of\nlawyers bear a diverse set of assumptions about the nature of law, proper modes of\nconstitutional interpretation, and the role of the judiciary.  These are fair debates\nand they are likely to continue for some time.  We can only hope that over time our\ndifferences can be resolved by reason and persuasion rather than by politics by\nother means.  But I don’t know of any judge—at least not this judge—who can say\nthat every opinion and judgment she issued was in accord with her preferred policy\noutcomes. “[I]n our private opinions, [we] need not concur in Congress’ policies to\nhold its enactments constitutional.  Judicially we must tolerate what personally we\n3\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 77 of 79\nmay regard as a legislative mistake.”  Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580,\n590 (1952).\nMy second point is less politic.  In this case, we are called upon to review\nthe merits of DHS’s Final Rule through the lens of the judicial review provisions\nof the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706.  Our review is quite\ncircumscribed.  We can set aside agency action if it is contrary to law, if it exceeds\nthe agency’s jurisdiction or authority, or if the agency failed to follow proper\nprocedure.  Id. § 706(2)(B)–(D).  Those are largely legal judgments, which we can\naddress through the traditional tools judges have long used.  With respect to the\npolicy behind the agency’s action, we are largely relegated to reviewing the action\nfor arbitrariness and caprice.  Id. § 706(2)(A).  That is not a very rigorous standard\nand, as a result, an agency has broad discretion to administer the programs\nentrusted to it by Congress.  Cf. Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def.\nCouncil, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978) (“[F]undamental policy questions\nappropriately resolved in Congress . . . are not subject to reexamination in the\nfederal courts under the guise of judicial review of agency action.”).  \nIn the immigration context, whatever dialogue we have been having with the\nadministration over its policies, we are a poor conversant.  We are limited in what\nwe can say and in our ability—even if anyone thought we were qualified to do\n4\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 78 of 79\nso—to shape our immigration policies.  We lack the tools of inquiry, investigation,\nand fact-finding that a responsible policymaker should have at its disposal.  In sum,\nthe APA is the meagerest of checks on the executive.  We are not the proper foil to\nthis or any other administration as it crafts our immigration policies. \nBy constitutional design, the branch that is qualified to establish\nimmigration policy and check any excesses in the implementation of that policy is\nCongress.  See U.S. CONST. Art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  And, so far as we can tell from our\nmodest perch in the Ninth Circuit, Congress is no place to be found in these\ndebates.  We have seen case after case come through our courts, serious and\nearnest efforts, even as they are controversial, to address the nation’s immigration\nchallenges.  Yet we have seen little engagement and no actual legislation from\nCongress.  It matters not to me as a judge whether Congress embraces or\ndisapproves of the administration’s actions, but it is time for a feckless Congress to\ncome to the table and grapple with these issues.  Don’t leave the table and expect\nus to clean up.  \n5\n\nCase: 19-17213, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 27, Page 79 of 79\nFILED\n \nCity and County of San Francisco, et al v.

DWYER, CLERK \nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS \nWhile I concur with the majority’s jurisdiction analysis, I otherwise \nrespectfully dissent.  In light of the: (1) government’s heavy burden due to the \nstandard of review, (2) opaqueness of the legal questions before us, (3) lack of \nirreparable harm to the government at this early stage, (4) likelihood of substantial \ninjury to the plaintiffs, and (5) equities involved, I would deny the government’s \nmotions to stay and let these cases proceed in the ordinary course.

INTRODUCTION  \n2    On August 14, 2019, Defendants (collectively, DHS) issued a Final Rule \n3  that will cause hundreds of thousands of families in the Plaintiff States, and \n4  millions of eligible children and adults nationwide, to disenroll from federal and \n5  state health care, nutrition, and housing benefits programs. This, in turn, will \n6  result in State residents losing hundreds of millions of dollars in health care \n7  services, decreased vaccinations and increased transmission of communicable \n8  diseases, and denied access for people with disabilities to services only available \n9  through Medicaid. It will increase hunger, malnutrition, and homelessness among \n10  children, all associated with deficits in cognitive development, chronic asthma, \n11  substance abuse, depression, and behavioral challenges. As demonstrated by the \n12  51 declarations submitted with this motion, DHS’s Rule will undermine the \n13  mission of dozens of state programs and impose millions of dollars in costs to the \n14  Plaintiff  States  to  address  the  resulting  public  health  problems,  educational \n15  burdens, and homelessness. \n16    The Plaintiff States move to stay the Rule pending judicial review under \n17  the Administrative Procedure Act, or alternatively for a preliminary injunction \n18  prohibiting DHS from implementing the Rule, which is scheduled to take effect \n19  on October 15, 2019. Through the Rule, the Administration attempts to remake \n20  the “public charge” doctrine, a rarely used statutory ground for exclusion of \n21  immigrants,  into—in  its  own  words—a  “transformative”  tool  to  reshape \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

The Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the \n2  merits of their claims for a host of reasons: \n3    First, DHS interprets the term “public charge” in a manner contrary to \n4  Congress’s intent, as evidenced by statutory text, history, and context. \n5    Second,  DHS  brazenly  adopts  a  legal  standard  that  Congress  twice \n6  expressly rejected, “coopt[ing] Congress’s power to legislate” through executive \n7  action. City & County of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1234 (9th Cir. \n8  2018). \n9    Third, the Rule separately violates four statutes: (1) the Immigration and \n10  Nationality Act of 1952, (2) the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n11  Responsibility  Act  of  1996,  (3)  the  Personal  Responsibility  and  Work \n12  Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and (4) the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n13    Fourth,  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  DHS  failed  to \n14  meaningfully address evidence of the harm the Rule inflicts on vulnerable people, \n15  especially  children,  the  elderly,  and  individuals  with  disabilities,  and  DHS \n16  ignored its own evidence that the factors it prescribed for the public charge \n17  analysis  are  arbitrary,  ill-defined,  and  give  unreasonable  discretion  to \n18  immigration officials. \n19    DHS’s unlawful efforts to refashion American immigration policy through \n20  regulation should not take effect while the Plaintiff States’ legal challenge is \n21  pending. \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Overview of Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility \n3  The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires certain immigrants to \n4  prove that they are “not inadmissible.” 8 U.S.C. § 1361; 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a). A \n5  noncitizen who is “likely at any time to become a public charge” is inadmissible. \n6  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).1 This “public charge exclusion” is enforced abroad by \n7  consular officers (who process visa applications) and domestically by Defendant \n8  USCIS. It applies to: \n9  •  noncitizens seeking to become lawful permanent residents; \n10  •  immigrants entering the United States on a visa;2 \n11  •  noncitizens  applying  to  “adjust”  status  to  lawful  permanent \n12  residency (i.e., apply for a green card); and \n13  •  permanent residents “seeking admission” (including, among other \n14  circumstances, when a permanent resident returns to the United \n15  States after a trip of more than 180 days). \n16  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(13)(c), 1182(a), 1225(a), 1255(a), 1361. \n17                                             \n18  1 Certain groups of noncitizens, such as asylum seekers and refugees, are \n19  exempt from the public charge ground. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1157(c)(3), 1158(b)(2), \n20  1159(c). \n21  2 Visa holders undergo an inadmissibility determination by DHS at ports \n22  of entry every time they enter and re-enter the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1185(d). \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

History of the Public Charge Exclusion  \n2  From colonial “poor laws” through modern times, the term “public charge” \n3  has had a clear and established meaning: a person unable to care for himself or \n4  herself and primarily dependent on the state for support. See Minor Myers III, A \n5  Redistributive  Role  for  Local  Government,  36  Urb.  Law.  753,  773  (2004) \n6  (colonial poor laws permitted towns to expel transient beggars, vagrants, and \n7  paupers as “public charges”); Gerald L. Neuman, The Lost Century of American \n8  Immigration Law (1776-1875), 93 Colum. L. Rev. 1833, 1846 (1993); Hidetaki \n9  Hirota, Expelling the Poor: Atlantic Seaboard States and the Nineteenth-Century \n10  Origins of American Immigration Policy (2017) (mass European migration in the \n11  early 19th century brought “large numbers of exceptionally impoverished and \n12  destitute people” who were described, in common parlance and law, as “public \n13  charges,” “paupers,” or both); Immigration Act of 1882, 47th Cong., ch. 376, 22 \n14  Stat. 214 (1882) (borrowing from state immigration laws, to prohibit the landing \n15  in the United States of “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any other person unable to \n16  take care of himself . . . without becoming a public charge”); 26 Stat. 1084, 1084 \n17  (1891) (adding “paupers” to the list so that the provision precluded admission of \n18  “idiots, insane persons, paupers or persons likely to become a public charge”). \n19  When Congress reorganized immigration law into the present statutory \n20  framework, the INA retained the long-established exclusions of “paupers” and \n21  those “likely at any time to become a public charge,” along with numerous other \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

DHS’s Public Charge Rule \n7  On August 12, 2019, DHS issued a Final Rule designed to “transform”4 \n8  who may immigrate to the United States, by expanding the previously rarely used \n9  “public  charge”  exclusion.5  Final  Rule,  Inadmissibility  on  Public  Charge \n10                                             \n11  3 The Immigration Act of 1990 eliminated all of the above grounds of \n12  inadmissibility, with the exception of the public charge exclusion.

Reg. at 41,292. \n4  The Rule unmoors the public charge definition from its historic anchor in \n5  primary  dependence  on  the  government  for  subsistence,  and  it  significantly \n6  expands the types of benefits considered in the public charge determination and \n7  the amount of wealth an immigrant needs to remain in the country. In public \n8  comments, many states (including the Plaintiff States) explained the devastating \n9  impacts the proposed rule would have on the health care costs and well-being of \n10  families of legal immigrants in their states. See, e.g., Bays Decl.7 Exs. H, I. \n11  1.  New definition of “public charge” \n12  Contrary to the established meaning of “public charge” and Congressional \n13  intent, the Rule redefines the term as “an alien who receives one or more public \n14  benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \n15  period.” 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a). Under the 12-month threshold, receipt of two \n16 \n17                                             \n18  6 Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent C.F.R. citations are to provisions \n19  of the Rule to be codified and effective October 15, 2019. \n20  7  Plaintiff  States  refer  throughout  to  declarations  submitted  with  this \n21  Motion by the last name of the declarant, followed by the pertinent reference to \n22  the paragraph or exhibit number of that declaration. \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Consideration of non-cash benefits \n4  The Rule dismisses the longstanding interpretation of the benefits that \n5  trigger a public charge determination and casts a vastly wider net to include \n6  common, non-cash federal benefits.8 A “public benefit” includes: “(1) [a]ny \n7  Federal state, local or tribal cash assistance for income maintenance,” including \n8  SSI, TANF, or state “General Assistance”; (2) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \n9  Program  (SNAP);  (3)  Section  8  housing  assistance  vouchers;  (4)  Section  8 \n10  project-based rental assistance; (5) Medicaid (with exceptions for benefits or \n11  services  for  emergency  medical  conditions,  under  the  Individuals  with \n12  Disabilities Education Act, that are school-based, to immigrants who are under \n13  21 years of age or a woman during pregnancy); and (6) public housing under \n14  Section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b). \n15 \n16                                             \n17  8 Between 2009 and 2012, approximately 52.2 million people in the United \n18  States (or 21.3% of the general population) participated in one or more major \n19  public assistance programs in a given month—including the programs swept up \n20  in the Rule—of whom more than two-thirds participated for at least 12 months. \n21  See Shelley K.

The \n4  Rule establishes four factors having heavily negative weight: \n \n5  1.  the immigrant is not a full-time student and is authorized to work, \nbut is unable to demonstrate current or recent employment, or no \n6  reasonable prospect of future employment; \n \n7  2.  the immigrant has received or has been certified or approved to \nreceive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months in the \n8  aggregate within any 36-month period; \n \n9  3.  (A) the immigrant has been diagnosed with a medical condition that \nlikely will require extensive medical treatment or will interfere with \n10  his or her ability to attend work or school; and (B) he or she is \nuninsured and has no prospect of obtaining private health insurance \n11  nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts; \n12   \n4.  the  immigrant  has been previously  found  to be inadmissible  or \n13  deportable on public charge grounds. \n14  8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(i)–(iv).  \n15  Other  wealth-related  criteria  the  Rule  introduces  include  whether  the \n16  immigrant (1) is under the age of 18 or over the minimum early retirement age \n17  for  social  security;  (2)  has  a  medical  condition  that  will  require  extensive \n18  treatment or interfere with the ability to attend school or work; (3) has an annual \n19  household gross income under 125% of the Federal poverty guidelines (FPG); \n20  (4) has a household size that makes the immigrant likely to become a public \n21  charge at any time in the future; (5) lacks significant assets, like savings accounts, \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

The Plaintiff States Are Likely to Succeed on Their APA Claims \n17  The Plaintiff States are likely to prevail on three of their core claims.

Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). \n4  Second, the Rule is contrary to law because it adopts an interpretation of “public \n5  charge” that had been expressly rejected by Congress, and its weighted factor test \n6  is contrary to the (i)  “totality of circumstances” test mandated by INA Section \n7  212(a)(4), (ii) Welfare Reform Act, and (iii) Rehabilitation Act. Third, the Rule \n8  is arbitrary and capricious because it fails to address evidence of the harm it \n9  inflicts on vulnerable people, and it includes factors in its public charge test that \n10  are unrelated to—and at times at odds with—its purported purpose.11 \n11  1.  DHS’s new definition of “public charge” is inconsistent with \nthe term’s plain meaning and is contrary to law \n12 \nThe Rule redefines “public charge” to mean “an alien who receives one or \n13 \nmore  public  benefits”  above  the  12-month  threshold.  8  C.F.R.  § 212.21(a). \n14 \nDHS’s definition fails Chevron Step One because it is irreconcilable with the \n15 \nclear meaning of the term “public charge” as demonstrated by its text, history, \n16 \nand context.  \n17 \n18                                             \n19  11  Because  the  Plaintiff  States  are  entitled  to  a  stay  or  a  preliminary \n20  injunction on the APA claims, this motion need not address the Plaintiff States’ \n21  other claim.

The most natural reading of “public \n2  charge” in the 1882 statute is one who is, as the text says, “unable to take care of \n3  himself or herself.” Id.  \n4  Because the statute does not define “public charge,” it must be presumed \n5  that the 47th Congress intended the term to have its “ordinary or natural meaning” \n6  in the “year [it] was enacted.” Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, Dep’t \n7  of Labor v. Greenwich Collieries, 512 U.S. 267, 272 (1994). The period’s most \n8  comprehensive American dictionary defined the root word “charge” to mean \n9  “[a]nything committed to another’s custody, care, concern, or management.” \n10  The Century Dictionary of the English Language vol. IV at 929 (1889–91). This \n11  definition is consistent with historical definitions where “public charge” was \n12  interchangeable with “pauper.” See id. vol. XI at 4334 (defining “pauper” as “a \n13  very poor person; a person entirely destitute of property or means of support; \n14  particularly one who, on account of poverty, becomes chargeable to the public”) \n15  (emphasis  added);  accord  Webster,  An  American  Dictionary  of  the  English \n16  Language 595 (1857). \n17  This definition endured over time. See Black’s Law Dictionary 311 (3d ed. \n18  1933) (defining “public charge” as “[a] person whom it is necessary to support at \n19  public expense by reason of poverty, insanity, and poverty, disease and poverty, \n20  or idiocy and poverty” and—as used in the Immigration Act of 1917, Pub.

The history of the public charge exclusion confirms that \nCongress adopted the term’s common law meaning   \n4 \ni.  Colonial and early state law sources \n5 \nCongress adopted the public charge exclusion against a long backdrop of \n6 \ncolonial and state public charge laws. Because Congress based the Immigration \n7 \nAct of 1882 on those earlier laws, the term “public charge” “must be construed \n8 \nas they were understood at the time in the State[s].” Shannon v. United States, \n9 \n512 U.S. 573, 581 (1994) (quoting Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 36 \n10 \n(1899)). \n11 \nIn the American colonies, “public charges” were persons permanently \n12 \nincapable of caring for themselves and primarily dependent on the government, \n13 \nsimilar to a pauper. As Defendant USCIS acknowledges, due to opposition to \n14 \n“the immigration of ‘paupers,’ . . . several colonies enacted protective measures \n15 \nto prohibit the immigration of individuals who might become public charges.” \n16 \nPublic Charge Provisions of Immigration Law: A Brief Historical Background, \n17 \nUSCIS, https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/our-history/public-charge \n18 \n-provisions-immigration-law-a-brief-historical-background#_ftnref1  (USCIS \n19 \nPublic Charge Hist.

Hirota, Expelling the Poor 33; see, e.g., Act \n6  of Mar. 20, 1850, ch. 105, § 1, 1850 Mass.

Capen, 61 Mass. 116, 121–22 (1851), but that persons be “unable to \n13  take  care  of  themselves,”  In  re  O’Sullivan,  31  F.  447,  449  (C.C.S.D.N.Y.) \n14  (quoting 22 Stat. 214); see, e.g., Fischer v.

The Immigration Act of 1882 \n4  Congress enacted the first federal public charge exclusion in 1882 to fill \n5  the void left from the Supreme Court’s invalidation of state passenger laws. \n6  See Henderson  v.  Mayor  of  City  of  New  York,  92  U.S.  259,  274  (1875). \n7  Borrowing directly from state laws to impose a federal public charge ground of \n8  inadmissibility,  the  1882  Congress  described  “public  charge”  to  express  its \n9  traditional, common law meaning—a person “unable to take care of himself or \n10  herself,” Immigration Act of 1882, 22 Stat. 214—who primarily depends on the \n11  government for support. This understanding is reflected in the legislative history. \n12  See Complaint  ¶ 62, Make the Road New York, et al. v.

Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 and \nsubsequent enactments \n5 \nCongress  overhauled  federal  immigration  law  in  the  Immigration  and \n6 \nNationality Act of 1952 and reenacted the public charge exclusion. Pub. L.  \n7 \n82–414, 66 Stat. 163. The legislative history of the INA shows that Congress \n8 \nintended to retain the common law meaning of “public charge.” See S. Rep.

Early judicial and agency interpretations \n4  During the first half of the 20th century, early judicial interpretations of \n5  the original public charge provisions confirmed Congress’s intent to exclude only \n6  those primarily dependent on the government for their care or management. See, \n7  e.g., Howe v. United States ex rel. Savitsky, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917) (“[w]e \n8  are convinced that Congress meant the act to exclude persons who were likely to \n9  become occupants of almshouses for want of means with which to support \n10  themselves in the future”); FAC ¶ 51 (collecting cases). Federal agencies charged \n11  with enforcing those early federal immigration laws also read “public charge” to \n12  mean  a  person  incapable  of  self-support  and  dependent  upon  the  state  for \n13  survival. See USCIS Public Charge Hist. Backgr. (“immigrants who showed they \n14  had no physical or mental conditions that could prevent them from working and \n15  who demonstrated a willingness to work were admitted”); FAC ¶ 53. \n16  ii.  Modern agency interpretations \n17  Consistent with the original public meaning of “public charge,” federal \n18  immigration authorities have applied the modern public charge provision only to \n19  those dependent on government for survival. See, e.g., Matter of Martinez-Lopez, \n20  10 I. & N. Dec. 409, 421 (A.G. 1962) (then-Attorney General Robert F.

The Rule’s weighted criteria are contrary to law \n14  DHS’s new definition of “public charge,” based on its unwarranted focus \n15  on poverty, distorts the “totality of circumstances” test. This fundamental error \n16  compels invalidation of the rule. See, e.g., Davis Cty. Solid Waste Mgmt. v. U.S. \n17  EPA, 108 F.3d 1454, 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (per curiam); North Carolina v.

The  weighted  criteria  are  contrary  to  the  INA  and \nImmigration Reform Act \n20 \nThe  Rule’s  new  public  charge  test  transforms  the  “totality  of \n21 \ncircumstances” inquiry mandated by Congress into a categorical test of DHS’s \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Because the four “heavily weighted negative factors” overlap with \n2  other enumerated “negative” factors, any one heavily weighted negative factor \n3  may trigger a public charge finding under the new Rule. The new test as written \n4  treats  one  main  consideration—poverty—as  paramount,  if  not  dispositive, \n5  elevating it above the required statutory factors set forth in the INA itself. \n6  The heavily weighted factor of whether an immigrant “has received or has \n7  been certified or approved to receive one or more public benefits” above the \n8  12-month threshold is duplicative of several other negative factors: an immigrant \n9  who met or exceeded the public benefits threshold will ipso facto have “applied \n10  for or received any public benefit” in any amount and be virtually certain to have \n11  a “gross income [of] less than 125 percent” of the FPG (both of which are \n12  nominally  separate  negative,  but  not  heavily  weighted,  factors).  8  C.F.R. \n13  § 212.22(b)(4)(i)(A), (b)(4)(ii)(E)(1). The past receipt of public benefits above \n14  the 12-month threshold appears dispositive, contrary to the INA’s mandated \n15  totality of circumstances inquiry. See, e.g., Martinez-Farias v. Holder, 338 F. \n16  App’x 729, 730–31 (9th Cir. 2009) (in making public charge determination, INA \n17  Section 212(a)(4)(B) requires decision maker to consider all statutory factors). \n18  The  Rule  likewise  makes  an  immigrant’s  medical  condition  virtually \n19  dispositive. A medical condition counts as a heavily weighted negative factor if \n20  the following two conditions apply: (1) the immigrant “has been diagnosed with \n21  a  medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

This heavily weighted factor is \n6  duplicative of other, ostensibly separate, negative factors. See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. \n7  § 212.22(b)(2)(ii)(B)  (treating  as  negative  factor  if  immigrant  “has  been \n8  diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \n9  treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with [his or her] ability to \n10  provide and care for himself or herself, to attend school, or to work”). Because \n11  the medical condition factor is likely to be dispositive under the Rule’s weighted \n12  test, it is contrary to the totality of circumstances inquiry mandated by the INA. \n13  The overlapping medical condition factors are contrary to the INA for \n14  another reason: they go well beyond the discrete “health-related grounds” that \n15  Congress  has  expressly  set  forth  as  basis  of  inadmissibility.  8  U.S.C. \n16  § 1182(a)(1)(A). Under INA Section 212(a)(1), a noncitizen is inadmissible for \n17  health-related reasons only if he or she (1) has a “communicable disease of public \n18  health significance”; (2) failed to submit proof of vaccinations; (3) has or had a \n19  “physical  or  mental  disorder  and  a  history  of  behavior  associated  with  the \n20  disorder” posing a present “threat to the property, safety, or welfare” of the \n21  immigrant or others; or (4) has been determined to be a “drug abuser or addict.” \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

The  provision  of  those  limited  health-based  grounds  of  inadmissibility \n2  strongly suggests that Congress did not intend for the Department to create much \n3  broader health-based exclusions under the guise of a public charge regulation. \n4  See, e.g., Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 188 (1978) (maxim of \n5  expressio unius est exclusio alterius).  \n6  The statutory history makes that intent even clearer. The 1952 INA’s \n7  health-related exclusions were much broader, rendering inadmissible anyone \n8  who  was  “insane,”  “epilep[tic],”  or  who  had  “a  physical  defect  disease,  or \n9  disability, when determined by the consular or immigration officer to be of such \n10  a nature that it may affect the ability of the alien to earn a living.” 66 Stat. 163, \n11  182,  § 212(a).  Congress  eliminated  those  grounds  of  exclusion  in  the \n12  Immigration Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4978, § 601. Yet the Department has now \n13  engrafted that broad health exclusion onto its new public charge test, despite \n14  Congress having stripped it from the INA decades ago. In this respect, the Rule \n15  is contrary to the text of the statute and the clearly expressed intent of Congress. \n16  See, e.g., Cal. Cosmetology Coal. v. Riley, 110 F.3d 1454, 1460 (9th Cir. 1997) \n17  (“A regulation may not serve to amend a statute, nor add to the statute ‘something \n18  which is not there.’”) (citation omitted) (quoting United States v.

The weighted criteria are contrary to the Welfare Reform \nAct \n2 \nThe Rule’s focus on immigrants’ use of non-cash public benefits to deprive \n3 \nthem of the ability to remain in the United States also is inconsistent with the \n4 \nWelfare Reform Act, which expressly allowed qualified immigrants to receive \n5 \nafter five years of entry many forms of federal public benefits included in the \n6 \nRule.

The weighted criteria are contrary to Section 504 of the \n14  Rehabilitation Act \n15  The Rule also is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits “any \n16  program or activity receiving federal financial assistance” or “any program or \n17  activity conducted by any Executive agency,” from excluding, denying benefits \n18  to, or discriminating against persons with disabilities. 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). The \n19  Rule violates this provision by requiring officials to consider an applicant’s \n20  “medical condition”—including a “disability diagnosis”—to weigh in favor of a \n21  public charge determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(iii)(A); 84 Fed. Reg. \n22  at 41,407–08.

Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (State Farm), \n4  463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). When an agency departs from a well-established prior \n5  policy that “engendered serious reliance interests”—as DHS has done here—the \n6  agency must provide a more “detailed justification” for its actions. FCC v. Fox \n7  Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). DHS has failed to do so. \n8  DHS received over 265,000 comments—the “vast majority” of which \n9  opposed the Rule and provided compelling evidence of devastating harms likely \n10  to result from its implementation. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,304; see, e.g., Bays Decl. \n11  Exs. H–CCC (examples of comments submitted in opposition to the Rule). DHS \n12  largely ignored these concerns and instead chose to finalize—without sufficiently \n13  reasoned justification—a Rule that all but promises to inflict the very harms \n14  warned of by commenters. Where DHS did address concerns, it largely brushed \n15  them aside, stating in conclusory fashion that it did not intend to cause the harms \n16  at issue or the purported goal of the Rule merited the trade-off. The Rule is \n17  arbitrary and capricious for two primary reasons: (1) DHS failed to address, \n18  justify, or even meaningfully evaluate the many significant harms identified by \n19  commenters; and (2) the Rule promotes the consideration of factors entirely \n20  unrelated to—and at times directly at odds with—its purported purpose. \n21 \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  41  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

DHS failed to justify or meaningfully address the Rule’s \nmany devastating harms \n2 \nDHS has failed to address drastic harms the Rule will cause, including to \n3 \npublic  health  generally  and  to  vulnerable  populations  specifically,  such  as \n4 \nchildren, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. \n5 \ni.  DHS  disregarded  evidence  the  Rule  will  cause \n6  public health crises \n7  DHS received compelling evidence and comments warning the Rule was \n8  likely to cause significant public health crises. See, e.g., Bays Decl. Exs. R  \n9  at 31–32; T at 107–09. By deterring participation in Medicaid, the Rule would \n10  result in decreased vaccinations and a corresponding increase in the transmission \n11  of communicable diseases. 84 Fed Reg. at 41,384 (noting comments stating that \n12  “uninsured individuals are much less likely to be vaccinated,” and that “even a \n13  five percent reduction in vaccine coverage could trigger a significant measles \n14  outbreak”); Bays Decl.

Reg. at 51,270 (“[D]isenrollment or forgoing enrollment in \n7  public benefits program by [otherwise eligible] aliens” may result in, among \n8  other things, increased obesity, malnutrition, and transmission of communicable \n9  diseases). Nevertheless, DHS still has not conducted any adequate analysis to \n10  measure the public health effects on the American public. See, e.g., Bays Decl. \n11  Ex.

DHS instead responded that it would exempt from \n15  consideration  receipt  of  Medicaid  benefits  only  for  pregnant  women  and \n16  individuals under 21 years of age. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384 (asserting, without \n17  evidentiary support, that these exemptions “should address a substantial portion, \n18  though not all, of the vaccinations issue”).  \n19  DHS’s cursory response disregards overwhelming evidence that even a \n20  slight decrease in population immunity may give rise to a dangerous outbreak of \n21  communicable diseases.

DHS’s failure to appropriately analyze or respond to overwhelming \n6  evidence of potentially devastating public health crises underscores that the Rule \n7  is arbitrary and capricious. \n8  ii.  DHS disregarded evidence of the Rule’s harmful \neffects on children \n9 \nDHS received numerous comments and compelling evidence showing the \n10 \nRule  would  inflict  dramatic  and  lasting  harms  on  vulnerable  children. \n11 \nCommenters  explained  that  the  Rule  will  cause  at-risk  children  to  suffer \n12 \nincreased hunger, malnutrition, and homelessness. Commenters also provided \n13 \nevidence  showing  the  trauma  resulting  from  childhood  food  insecurity  and \n14 \nhousing instability is likely to have lifelong effects, severely compromising these \n15 \nchildren’s physical and mental health, educational outcomes, and employment \n16 \nprospects. Bays Decl. Exs. S at 32–35; VV at 12–13. The lasting trauma of such \n17 \nchildhood instability results in a broad variety of negative outcomes, including \n18 \nchronic asthma, higher incidences of unplanned pregnancies, substance abuse, \n19 \ndepression, and behavioral challenges. Id.; Bays Decl. Exs. T at 61–62; V at 4. \n20 \nWhile detailing the harms the Rule will inflict upon vulnerable children, \n21 \ncommenters also questioned what reasonable basis DHS had for applying such a \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  44  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Bays Decl. Ex. T at 74-78. DHS itself \n4  agrees the programs at issue are intended to help children become healthy, safe, \n5  and successful in their educations, thus improving their employment prospects \n6  and moving them toward the Rule’s purported goal of self-sufficiency. 84 Fed. \n7  Reg. at 41,370–71 (acknowledging “many of the public benefits programs [at \n8  issue] aim to better future economic and health outcomes for minor recipients”). \n9  In response, DHS merely amended the Proposed Rule to exclude from \n10  consideration only the receipt of Medicaid benefits by individuals under 21. DHS \n11  will still, however, consider a young child’s receipt of SNAP or federal housing \n12  assistance as evidence the child is likely to become a public charge. DHS’s failure \n13  to address the overwhelming evidence showing children will suffer severe harms \n14  from the Rule’s implementation (directly undermining their chances of reaching \n15  DHS’s  purported  goal  of  “self-sufficiency”)  is  arbitrary  and  capricious, \n16  underscoring the Plaintiff States’ likelihood of success on the merits. \n17  iii.  DHS  disregarded  the  Rule’s  harmful  and \ndiscriminatory effects on the elderly and individuals \n18  with disabilities \n19  DHS received many comments detailing the discriminatory and harmful \n20  effects the Rule will have on the elderly and individuals with disabilities. See, \n21  e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,367. For example, commenters noted that counting an \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  45  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Bays Decl. Ex. X at 6 (“[T]he proposed formula \n3  effectively  authorizes  blanket  determinations  that  anyone  with  a  significant \n4  disability is likely to become a public charge.”). Further, many of the services on \n5  which people with disabilities rely are available only through Medicaid, meaning \n6  the Rule will separate these already-vulnerable individuals from the very services \n7  that assist them in reaching DHS’s purported goal of “self-sufficiency.” Bays \n8  Decl. Exs. JJ at 6; L at 9–10 (“Individuals with significant disabilities, including \n9  even highly educated professionals and business owners, typically must retain \n10  Medicaid  coverage  because  no  other  public  or  private  program  covers  the \n11  attendant care and equipment they need to get up, get dressed, and go to work.”). \n12  Similarly, the Rule focuses almost exclusively on the age and economic \n13  value of elderly applicants, ignoring the many other contributions they make to \n14  family stability, including caring for children and enabling other family members \n15  to  work.  Bays  Decl.  Ex.  S  at  80. Preventing  these  elderly  applicants  from \n16  accessing  benefits  they  have  paid  for  with  their  taxes  would  reduce  their \n17  self-sufficiency, severely endanger their health, and make it more difficult for \n18  them to live with and contribute to their families. Bays Decl. Ex. KK at 7–9. \n19  DHS readily conceded the potentially “outsized impact” the Rule might \n20  have on specific vulnerable populations, including individuals with disabilities. \n21  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,368. DHS largely dismissed such concerns, however, noting \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  46  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

(emphasis added). But, as commenters noted, DHS’s selection of \n4  arbitrary, poorly defined, and overlapping factors will not only inflict severe \n5  harm on these already vulnerable populations but will also give immigration \n6  officials unfettered discretion to deem them public charges. Bays Decl. Exs. L at \n7  12–14; X at 6. DHS’s disregard for the evidence it received, as well as its refusal \n8  to  meaningfully  address  the  discriminatory  and  lasting  harms  on  these \n9  populations, underscores the arbitrary and capricious nature of the Rule.  \n10 \nb.  DHS ignored evidence showing the factors in the public \ncharge analysis are arbitrary and capricious \n11 \nDHS’s multifactor test is itself arbitrary and capricious. As set forth below, \n12 \nDHS relies on vague, poorly defined factors that are inconsistent with—and often \n13 \ndirectly at odds with—the Rule’s purported purpose, further demonstrating the \n14 \nlack of any “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” \n15 \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43; Bays Decl. Ex. R at 40. Below are a few such \n16 \nexamples. \n17 \ni.  Income thresholds \n18 \nThe Rule imposes arbitrary income thresholds for making public charge \n19 \ndeterminations, despite DHS’s own evidence that such thresholds are unrelated \n20 \nto the Rule’s stated purpose. Under the Rule, an income “below [the] level of 125 \n21 \npercent of FPG would generally be a heavily weighed negative factor,” 84 Fed. \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  47  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Reg. at \n3  41,502-04; 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c). Many commenters, however, noted the arbitrary \n4  and capricious nature of these thresholds, as well as the devastating effects they \n5  will have on hardworking, law-abiding immigrants. See, e.g., Bays Decl. Ex. R \n6  at 47–48 (warning that under the arbitrary income thresholds, “nearly 200,000 \n7  married couples in the United States would be faced with a wrenching choice: \n8  leave the United States, or live apart”). \n9  DHS’s reliance on these income thresholds is irrational based also on \n10  DHS’s own evidence and data. In the Proposed Rule’s preamble, DHS defended \n11  the income thresholds on the ground “[t]he percentage of people receiving these \n12  public benefits generally goes down as the income percentage increases.” 83 Fed. \n13  Reg. at 51,204. This assertion rings hollow, though, as eligibility for public \n14  benefits is generally means-tested based on an applicant’s income. DHS’s data \n15  shows that even immigrants in the lowest-income group analyzed—those with \n16  incomes below 125% of FPG—were in general unlikely to receive such public \n17  benefits. 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,204 tbl. 28. Medicaid, the most-utilized public benefit \n18  received by the group, had a participation rate of 39.2%. Further, such rigid \n19  income thresholds may lead to the perverse result that an applicant who works \n20  full-time making minimum wage but has never used any of the benefits at issue \n21  would  be  assigned  a  negative  factor  and  branded  a  public  charge.

EPA, 788 F.3d \n3  1134, 1141 (9th Cir. 2015). \n4 \nii.  English proficiency \n5  DHS  treats  as  a  negative  factor  an  immigrant’s  “lack  of  English \n6  proficiency.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,435. DHS cites no evidence suggesting that \n7  immigrants “lacking English proficiency”—a vague and poorly defined factor—\n8  are “more likely than not at any time in the future” to receive the public benefits \n9  at issue. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501. Instead, DHS starts from its conclusion and \n10  works backward, asserting that in a USCIS survey of noncitizens, the rate of \n11  enrollment in non-cash benefits programs was lower among “those who spoke \n12  English either well or very well (about 15 to 20 percent)” compared to “those \n13  who either spoke English poorly or not at all (about 25 to 30 percent).” 84 Fed. \n14  Reg. at 41,448. As numerous commenters noted, DHS’s reliance on such an \n15  arbitrary, undefined factor not only affords undue discretion to immigration \n16  officials but also ignores a wealth of evidence demonstrating that an immigrant’s \n17  language proficiency is not an immutable characteristic making them likely to \n18  become  a  public  charge.  See,  e.g.,  Bays  Decl.  Ex.

And, DHS’s own data once again undermines its conclusion, \n6  as its survey shows immigrants with limited English proficiency were more likely \n7  not to utilize public benefits. 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,195 tbl. 24. \n8  iii.  Credit scores \n9  The Rule considers credit reports and credit scores in the public charge \n10  analysis. 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,425. DHS’s reliance on such evidence is not justified, \n11  as there is no evidence credit scores or reports have any relevance in determining \n12  whether someone is likely to become a public charge. Bays Decl. Exs. Y at 1–3; \n13  Z at 1–3; TT at 1–4; ZZ at 1–3. Consideration of credit reports in this context is \n14  arbitrary, as (1) immigrants are likely to have no or thin credit histories and \n15  artificially low credit scores; (2) credit reports are not generally available in \n16  languages  other  than  English,  which  could  limit  immigrants  with  language \n17  barriers from correcting errors (thus double-counting English proficiency in the \n18  public charge analysis); and (3) a bad credit score is frequently the result of a \n19  temporary circumstance such as illness or job loss and does not reflect whether \n20  someone is likely to become a public charge.

DHS offers no rationale \n2  for introducing such dramatically high error rates into the public charge analysis, \n3  and  although  it  promises  not  to  consider  “verified  errors,”  the  process  for \n4  consumers  to  address  such  errors  is  extremely  burdensome—especially  for \n5  immigrants—and private credit reporting agencies may still fail to correct them. \n6  *  *  * \n7  For the reasons stated above, the Plaintiff States are likely to prevail on the \n8  merits of their claims that the Rule violates the APA because it is contrary to law \n9  and arbitrary or capricious.  \n10 \nC.

The anxiety and fear \n11  generated in the immigrant population will lead to people not seeking care for \n12  emergent conditions (heart attacks, for example).” Oliver Decl. ¶ 21. \n13  Beyond the individual effect, a lack of health care harms entire families \n14  because those who disenroll may be deterred from seeking coverage for their \n15  dependent  children,  no  matter  the  minor’s  immigration  status.  See  supra  \n16  at 13–14. Furthermore, this disenrollment will have community-wide effects, \n17  including  the  prevalence  of  disease  “among  members  of  the  U.S.  citizen \n18  population  who  are  not  vaccinated.”  83  Fed.  Reg.  at  51,270;  84  Fed.  Reg. \n19  at 41,384;  see  supra  at  13–14.  Finally,  forgone  health  care  coverage  and \n20  preventative  care,  as  DHS  admits,  will  cause  higher  and  more  frequent \n21  emergency  services  and  uncompensated  care  costs,  as  immigrants  without \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  53  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

Reg. at 41,384; see supra \n2  at 14. These increased costs “shall now fall solely on the [States’] taxpayers,” \n3  harming the Plaintiff States’ financial health. Pryor Decl. ¶ 10. \n4  Second,  the  Final  Rule  will  also  create  food  insecurity,  resulting  in \n5  increased costs to the Plaintiff States and the frustration of programs which aim \n6  to create a well-nourished, productive population. SNAP, and corresponding \n7  state programs, will likely suffer reduction in enrollees. See supra at 14–15. \n8  When immigrants make the heartbreaking decision to forgo food assistance to \n9  maintain  immigration  status,  the  effects  are  threefold.  First,  and  most \n10  immediately, more families, including those with U.S. citizen children become \n11  hungry. See supra at 15–16. Second, disenrollment results in losses to economic \n12  activity and productive output, thus harming the Plaintiff States’ economies. See \n13  supra at 15–16. The State of Illinois, alone, estimates a loss to its economy of \n14  $95 to $222 million in economic stimulus because of immigrant withdrawals \n15  from SNAP. Hou Decl. ¶ 23. Finally, hungry children use more state resources—\n16  educational, social services, and health care. See supra at 15–16.  \n17  Third, immigrant disenrollment in federal and state housing assistance \n18  programs  will  lead  to  increased  homelessness  and  a  cascade  of  negative \n19  outcomes, both for the affected individuals and the States. Especially in markets \n20  where  immigrants  are  more  often  employed  in  lower-paying  jobs,  housing, \n21  without assistance, will quickly become unsustainable and more people will \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

See supra at 16–18. Increased homelessness has immediate and \n3  irreparable consequences for public health and has proven to have deleterious \n4  effects  on  children’s  lifetime  outcomes.  See  supra  at  16–17.  Indeed,  “[t]he \n5  longterm social costs of poor health and education far outweigh the cost of \n6  providing rental assistance.” Carey Decl. ¶ 13. \n7  Overall, the Final Rule will lead to a state population which is sicker, \n8  hungrier, and less able to contribute to the economic vitality of their communities, \n9  all of which imposes significant costs for the Plaintiff States. \n10 \nD.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Both Favor a Preliminary \nInjunction \n11 \nWhen the government is a party, the final two Winter  factors merge. \n12 \nDrakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014). “[T]he \n13 \npurpose of such interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights \n14 \nof the parties, but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.” \n15 \nTrump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017). The \n16 \nprincipal  consideration  concerns  the  extent  of  the  “public  consequences” \n17 \nattendant to the stay of the Rule. Ramirez v. United States Immigration and \n18 \nCustoms Enf’t, 310 F. Supp. 3d 7, 32 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at \n19 \n24); see also Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 996. Here, the balance of the equities and \n20 \npublic interest strongly favor a stay. \n21 \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  55  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR § 705 STAY PENDING  Kennewick, WA 99336 \n \n(509) 734-7285 \nJUDICIAL REVIEW OR FOR PI \nNO. 4:19-CV-05210-RMP \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 34    filed 09/06/19    PageID.1000   Page 70 of 77\n \n1  “There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \n2  agency action. To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest in having \n3  governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence and \n4  operations.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12 (citations and internal \n5  quotation marks omitted). The Rule violates the APA, and will have significant, \n6  and immediate, consequences across the country (including the Plaintiff States \n7  and their residents). It is, without doubt, in the public interest to prevent lawfully-\n8  present individuals and families with children from abandoning myriad federal \n9  and state health, education, and housing benefits to which they are entitled by \n10  law because of fear of future repercussions to their immigration status. \n11  By contrast, preserving the status quo will not harm the defendants, and \n12  refraining from enforcing the Final Rule will cost them nothing. See Diaz v. \n13  Brewer, 656 F.3d 1008, 1015 (9th Cir. 2011) (court may waive Rule 65(c) bond \n14  requirement). Indeed, the Plaintiff States merely seek to keep in place regulations \n15  which have governed for the past 23 years. See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \n16  Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 778 (9th Cir. 2018) (denying the government’s motions to \n17  stay district court’s TRO, reasoning, in part, that the TRO merely “restored the \n18  law to what it had been for many years prior”). \n19  Thus, the final two Winter factors weigh heavily in favor of the interim \n20  equitable relief sought by the Plaintiff States. \n21 \n22 \n \nPLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION  56  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n8127 W.

After \n6  reviewing extensive briefing and hearing argument, the Court finds that the Plaintiff \n7  States have shown that the status quo should be preserved pending resolution of this \n8  litigation.1  Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to stay the effective date of \n9  the Public Charge Rule until the issues can be adjudicated on their merits.  \n10  The Motion for a Section 705 Stay and for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. \n11  34, is brought by Plaintiffs State of Washington, Commonwealth of Virginia, State \n12  of Colorado, State of Delaware, State of Hawai’i, State of Illinois, State of \n13 \n \n14  1 The Court has reviewed the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 34, and \nsupporting declarations and materials, ECF Nos. 35−87; the Plaintiff States’ First \n15 \nAmended Complaint, ECF No. 31; the Briefs of Amici Curiae submitted in support \nof the Plaintiff States’ Motion, ECF Nos. 111 (from nonprofit anti-domestic \n16 \nviolence and anti-sexual assault organizations), 109 (from Health Law Advocates \n17  and other public health organizations), 110 (from nonprofit organizations support \nof the disability community), 149 (from hospitals and medical schools), 150 (from \n18  nonprofit organizations supporting seniors), 151 (from health care providers and \nhealth care advocates), 152 (from professional medical organizations), and 153 \n19 \n(from the Fiscal Policy Institute, the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and \nImmigration, and other organizations addressing economic impact); the Federal \n20 \nDefendants’ Opposition to Preliminary Relief, ECF No. 155; and the Plaintiff \n21  States’ Reply, ECF No. 158. \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4023   Page 3 of 59\n \n1  Maryland, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Attorney General Dana Nessel on \n2  behalf of the People of Michigan, State of Minnesota, State of Nevada, State of New \n3  Jersey, State of New Mexico, and State of Rhode Island (collectively, “the Plaintiff \n4  States”).   \n5  Defendants are the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), \n6  Acting Secretary of DHS Kevin K. McAleenan, United States Citizenship and \n7  Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and Acting Director of USCIS Kenneth T. \n8  Cuccinelli II (collectively, “the Federal Defendants”).  Pursuant to the \n9  Administrative Procedure Act and the guarantee of equal protection under the Due \n10  Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Plaintiff States challenge the Federal \n11  Defendants’ redefinition of who may be denied immigration status as a “public \n12  charge” in federal immigration law among applicants for visas or legal permanent \n13  residency.      \n14  I.  BACKGROUND \n15  On August 14, 2019, DHS published in the Federal Register a final rule, \n16  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (to \n17  be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248) (“Public Charge \n18  Rule”), that redefines whether a visa applicant seeking admission to the United \n19  States and any applicant for legal permanent residency is considered inadmissible \n20  because DHS finds him or her “likely at any time to become a public charge.”  See 8 \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4024   Page 4 of 59\n \n1  U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).  The Public Charge Rule is scheduled to take effect on October \n2  15, 2019.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,292. \n3    A.   The Immigration and Nationality Act’s Public Charge Ground of \n4  Inadmissibility  \n5    The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et \n6  seq., requires visa applicants and individuals applying to become permanent legal \n7  residents to demonstrate that they are not “inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. §§ 1361, \n8  1225(a), and 1255(a).2  The INA sets forth ten grounds of inadmissibility, all of \n9  which make a person “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the \n10  United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).  This case concerns one of those grounds: a \n11  likelihood of becoming a public charge.  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \n12    In its current form, the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of \n13  the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the \n14  Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is \n15  likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”3  8 U.S.C. § \n16   \n2 The INA “established a ‘comprehensive federal statutory scheme for regulation of \n17  immigration and naturalization’ and set ‘the terms and conditions of admission to \nthe country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.’”  \n18  Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582, 587 (2011) \n(quoting De Canas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 353 (1976)). \n19 \n3 When Congress transferred the adjudicatory functions of the former \nCommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) to the \n20 \nSecretary of DHS, the Attorney General’s authority regarding the public charge \nprovision was delegated to the Director of USCIS, a division of DHS.  See 6 U.S.C. \n21 \n§ 271(b)(5). \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4025   Page 5 of 59\n \n1  1182(a)(4)(A).  The same provision requires the officer determining whether an \n2  applicant is inadmissible as a public charge to consider “at a minimum” the  \n3  applicant’s \n4    (I) age; \n  (II) health; \n5    (III) family status; \n  (IV) assets, resources, and financial status; and \n6    (V) education and skills. \n \n7  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \n8    The officer “may also consider any affidavit of support under section 213A [8 \n9  U.S.C. § 1183a] for purposes of exclusion” on the public charge ground.  Id. § \n10  1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). \n11    B.   Public Charge Rulemaking Process and Content of the Public \n12  Charge Rule \n13  The Public Charge Rule followed issuance of a proposed rule on October 10, \n14  2018.  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (proposed \n15  Oct. 10, 2018) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248).  \n16  According to the Public Charge Rule, DHS received “266,077 comments” on the \n17  proposed rule, “the vast majority of which opposed the rule.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n18  41,297. \n19 \n20 \n \n21   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4026   Page 6 of 59\n \n1    The final rule made several changes to the proposed rule.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n2  41,297−41,300.  For instance:  \n3  Under the proposed rule, DHS would not have considered the receipt \nof  benefits  below  the  applicable  threshold  in  the  totality  of  the \n4  circumstances.  As a consequence, USCIS would have been unable to \nconsider an alien’s past receipt of public benefits below the threshold \n5  at all, even if such receipt was indicative, to some degree, of the alien’s \nlikelihood of becoming a public charge at any time in the future.  Under \n6  this final rule, adjudicators will consider and give appropriate weight to \npast receipt of public benefits below the single durational threshold \n7  described above in the totality of the circumstances.   \n \n8  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297. \n \n9    In addition, while the proposed rule provided for consideration of the receipt \n10  of Medicaid benefits by applicants under age 21, the Public Charge Rule does not \n11  negatively assess applicants for being enrolled in Medicaid while under the age 21, \n12  while pregnant, or “during the 60-day period after pregnancy.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n13  41,297. \n14      1.  Redefinition of “Public Charge” \n \n15    The Public Charge Rule, in its final format, defines “public charge” to denote \n16  “an alien who receives one or more public benefits, as defined in paragraph (b) of \n17  this section, for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period \n18  (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).”  \n19 \n20 \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4027   Page 7 of 59\n \n1  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a))4.  The Public Charge \n2  Rule redefines “public benefit” to include: “(1) [a]ny Federal, State, local, or tribal \n3  cash assistance for income maintenance (other than tax credits),” including \n4  Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n5  (“TANF”) or state “General Assistance”; (2) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \n6  Program (“SNAP,” colloquially known as “food stamps”); (3) housing assistance \n7  vouchers under Section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; (4) Section 8 “Project-\n8  Based” rental assistance, including “Moderate Rehabilitation”; (5) Medicaid, with \n9  exceptions for benefits for an emergency medical condition, services or benefits \n10  under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), school-based \n11  services or benefits, and benefits for immigrants under age 21 or to a woman during \n12  pregnancy or within 60 days after pregnancy; and (6) public housing under Section 9 \n13  of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.  8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b). \n14      2.  Weighted Factors for Totality of the Circumstances \n15  Determination \n16  The Public Charge Rule instructs officers to evaluate whether an applicant is \n17  “likely to become a public charge” using a “totality of the circumstances” test that \n18  “at least entail[s] consideration of the alien’s age; health; family status; education \n19 \n \n20 \n4 The Court’s subsequent references to the provisions of the Public Charge Rule \n21  will use the C.F.R. citations scheduled to take effect on October 15, 2019. \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4028   Page 8 of 59\n \n1  and skills; and assets, resources, and financial status” as described in the Rule.  8 \n2  C.F.R. § 212.22(a), (b).  The Public Charge Rule then prescribes a variety of factors \n3  to weigh “positively,” in favor of a determination that an applicant is not a public \n4  charge, and factors to weigh “negatively,” in favor of finding the applicant \n5  inadmissible as a public charge.  8 C.F.R. § 212.22(a), (b), and (c); see also, e.g., 84 \n6  Fed. Reg. 41,295 (“Specifically, the rule contains a list of negative and positive \n7  factors that DHS will consider as part of this determination, and directs officers to \n8  consider these factors in the totality of the alien’s circumstances. . . . The rule also \n9  contains lists of heavily weighted negative factors and heavily weighted positive \n10  factors.”).  The Public Charge Rule attributes heavy negative weight to the following \n11  circumstances: \n12    (1) “not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is \nunable to demonstrate current employment, recent employment history, \n13 \nor a reasonable prospect of future employment”; \n  (2) “certified or approved to receive one or more public benefits \n14 \n. . .  for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \nperiod,  beginning  no  earlier  than  36  months  prior  to  the  alien’s \n15 \napplication for admission or adjustment of status”;  \n16    (3) “diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require \nextensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere \n17 \nwith the alien’s ability to provide for himself or herself, attend school, \nor work; and . . . uninsured and has neither the prospect of obtaining \n18 \nprivate  health  insurance,  nor  the  financial  resources  to  pay  for \nreasonably  foreseeable  medical  costs  related  to  such  medical \n19 \ncondition”; and \n20    (4)  “previously  found  inadmissible  or  deportable  on  public \ncharge grounds[.]” \n21 \n \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4029   Page 9 of 59\n \n1  8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(i)−(iv). \n \n2    Conversely, the Public Charge Rule attributes heavy positive weight to three \n3  factors: \n4    (1) an annual household income, assets, or resources above 250 \npercent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (“FPG”) for the household \n5 \nsize;  \n  (2) an annual individual income of at least 250 percent of the \n6 \nFPG for the household size; and \n(3)  private  health  insurance  that  is  not  subsidized  under  the \n7 \nAffordable Care Act. \n8   \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)(i)−(iii). \n9 \n \n  The Public Charge Rule also directs officers to consider whether the applicant \n10 \n(1) is under the age of 18 or over the minimum early retirement age for social \n11 \nsecurity; (2) has a medical condition that will require extensive treatment or interfere \n12 \nwith the ability to attend school or work; (3) has an annual household gross income \n13 \nunder 125 percent of the FPG; (4) has a household size that makes the immigrant \n14 \nlikely to become a public charge at any time in the future; (5) lacks significant \n15 \nassets, like savings accounts, stocks, bonds, or real estate; (6) lacks significant assets \n16 \nand resources to cover reasonably foreseeable medical costs; (7) has any financial \n17 \nliabilities; (8) has applied for, been certified to receive, or received public benefits \n18 \nafter October 15, 2019; (9) has applied for or has received a USCIS fee waiver for an \n19 \nimmigration benefit request; (10) has a poor credit history and credit score; (11) \n20 \nlacks private health insurance or other resources to cover reasonably foreseeable \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4030   Page 10 of 59\n \n1  medical costs; (12) lacks a high school diploma (or equivalent) or a higher education \n2  degree; (13) lacks occupational skills, certifications, or licenses; or (14) is not \n3  proficient in English.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b). \n4    The officer administering the public charge admissibility test has the \n5  discretion to determine what factors are relevant and may consider factors beyond \n6  those enumerated in the rule.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(a) \n7  C.  Applicability of the Rule \n8  The Public Charge Rule applies to any non-citizen subject to section 212(a)(4) \n9  of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), who applies to DHS anytime on or after October \n10  15, 2019, for admission to the United States or for adjustment of status to that of \n11  lawful permanent resident.  8 C.F.R. § 212.20. \n12  D.  Summary of the Counts of the First Amended Complaint \n13  On the same day that the Public Charge Rule was published in the federal \n14  register, the fourteen Plaintiff States filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the Federal \n15  Defendants from enacting the rule.  The Plaintiff States subsequently filed a First \n16  Amended Complaint, ECF No. 31, stating four causes of action: (1) a violation of \n17  the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action “not in accordance with law”; (2) \n18  a violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action “in excess of \n19  statutory jurisdiction [or] authority” or “ultra vires”; (3) a violation of the APA, 5 \n20  U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), for agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of \n21  discretion”; and (4) a violation of the guarantee of equal protection under the U.S. \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4031   Page 11 of 59\n \n1  Constitution’s Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause on the basis that the Public \n2  Charge Rule allegedly was motivated by an intent to discriminate based on race, \n3  ethnicity, or national origin.  ECF No. 31 at 161−70. \n4  The Federal Defendants have not yet filed an answer, but they have responded \n5  to the pending motion.  ECF No. 155.  In their response, the Federal Defendants \n6  challenge the Plaintiff States’ standing to bring this action.  Id. at 18. \n7  II.  JURISDICTION \n8    The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \n9  U.S.C. § 1331. \n10  III.  STANDING AND RIPENESS \n11  A.  Standing Requirement \n12  Article III, section 2 of the Constitution extends the power of the federal \n13  courts to only “Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. Const., Art. III, sect. 2.  “Those \n14  two words confine ‘the business of federal courts to questions presented in an \n15  adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through \n16  the judicial process.’”  Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 516 (2007) (quoting \n17  Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968)).  \n18  To establish standing to sue under Article III, “a plaintiff must demonstrate \n19  ‘that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is either actual or \n20  imminent, that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant, and that it is likely that \n21  a favorable decision will redress that injury.’”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4032   Page 12 of 59\n \n1  1159 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 517)).  While an injury \n2  sufficient for constitutional standing must be concrete and particularized rather than \n3  conjectural or hypothetical, “an allegation of future injury may suffice if the \n4  threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm \n5  will occur.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct. 2334, 2341 (2014) \n6  (internal quotations omitted). \n7  The Federal Defendants assert that the Plaintiff States lack standing because \n8  their injuries are speculative and do not qualify as injuries-in-fact.  ECF No. 155 at \n9  18−21.  The Federal Defendants further maintain that the Plaintiff States’ described \n10  injuries would be the result of third parties’ independent decisions to “unnecessarily \n11  . . . forgo all federal benefits,” which the Federal Defendants argue is too weak a \n12  basis to support that the injury is fairly traceable to the Public Charge Rule.  ECF \n13  No. 155 at 19−21. \n14  At this early stage in the litigation, the Plaintiff States may satisfy their burden \n15  with allegations in their Amended Complaint and other evidence submitted in \n16  support of their Motion for a Section 705 Stay and Preliminary Injunction.  See \n17  Washington, 847 F.3d at 1159.  Amici briefs also may support the Plaintiff States’ \n18  showing of the elements of standing.   See SEC v. Private Equity Mgmt. Grp., Inc., \n19  No. CV 09-2901 PSG (Ex), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75158, at *18 n.5, 2009 WL \n20  2488044 (C.D. Cal.

Alleged Harms   \n4  1.  Missions of State Benefits Programs \n5    The Plaintiff States allege that they “combine billions of dollars of federal \n6  funds from Medicaid with billions of dollars of state funds to administer health care \n7  programs for millions” of the Plaintiff States’ residents.  ECF No. 34 at 26; see ECF \n8  Nos. 37 at 4; 38 at 4; 40 at 4.  The Plaintiff States argue that the health programs \n9  administered by them enable beneficiaries in varying degrees to access preventative \n10  care, chronic disease management, prescription drug treatment, mental health \n11  treatment, and immunizations.  See, e.g., ECF No. 40 at 5−7.  The Plaintiff States \n12  contend that they administer their programs “to ensure the health, well-being, and \n13  economic self-sufficiency” of all of their residents and to provide “comprehensive \n14  and affordable health insurance coverage” to State residents.  ECF Nos. 41 at 7; 45 \n15  at 5. \n16    Multiple submissions from the Plaintiff States and the amici briefs endorse an \n17  estimate that “the Public Charge Rule could lead to Medicaid disenrollment rates \n18  ranging from 15 percent to 35 percent” among Medicaid and Children’s Health \n19  Insurance Program enrollees who live in mixed-status households, which  “equates \n20  to between 2.1 and 4.9 million beneficiaries disenrolling from the programs.”  ECF \n21  No. 151 at 20−21; see also ECF Nos. 111-1 at 69; 149 at 15−16.

ECF Nos. 37 at 14; 43 at 7. \n5    As stated in the comments submitted to DHS by the Dana-Farber Cancer \n6  Institute, “regulations that will make immigrant families fearful of seeking health \n7  care services like primary care and routine health screenings will increase the burden \n8  of both disease and healthcare costs across the country.”  ECF No. 35-2 at 3. \n9  In addition to making receipt of Medicaid health insurance and other public \n10  benefit programs a negative factor, the Plaintiff States proffer that the Public Charge \n11  Rule disincentivizes individuals from seeking medical diagnoses and treatment \n12  because a diagnosis of a medical condition requiring extensive medical treatment or \n13  institutionalization will be weighed as a heavy negative factor when combined with \n14  a lack of health insurance or independent resources to cover the associated costs; or \n15  weighed as a negative factor even with health insurance or independent resources to \n16  cover the associated costs.  See ECF Nos. 35-2 at 3; 35-1 at 158, 165, and 168.   \n17  Health care professionals noted that the weighting of these factors “creates a \n18  strong incentive for immigrants to avoid medical examinations and tests to prevent \n19  identification of any serious health problem.”  ECF No. 35-2 at 3; see also ECF No. \n20  65 at 14 (“Fear of the rule change and its effects on utilizing cancer-screening \n21  services for people of a variety of citizenship status can lead to grave consequences \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4035   Page 15 of 59\n \n1  both in lives lost from treatable cancers and intensive financial costs of late stage \n2  treatment and related care.”).  Delaying diagnosis and treatment until a condition \n3  results in a medical emergency compromises the health and wellbeing of individuals \n4  and families and increases the cost of health care for the hospitals, the Plaintiff \n5  States, and the Plaintiff States’ residents as a whole.  See ECF Nos. 35-2 at 3; 109 at \n6  18, 47.  \n7  Health care providers within the Plaintiff States’ health systems likely will \n8  incur harms as well.  A larger uninsured population is likely to “generate significant \n9  uncompensated care costs,” which, in turn, are likely to “fall disproportionately on \n10  providers in low-income communities who rely on Medicaid for financial support.”  \n11  ECF No. 109 at 48.  Service cuts to make up for the uncompensated care costs \n12  would then result in fewer patients being able to access primary care services.  Id.   \n13  Another filing supports that the Public Charge Rule likely will burden the \n14  doctor-patient relationship.  See ECF No. 151.  First, amici health care providers \n15  highlight the “well-established state interest in protecting doctor-patient \n16  consultations from state intrusion so that patients and doctors may work together to \n17  determine the best course of medical care.”  Id.  at 19.  By “entwining medical \n18  decision-making” with immigration considerations, the health care providers \n19  maintain that the Public Charge Rule will constrain “clinicians’ abilities to \n20  recommend public benefit programs as well as their access to reliable forthright \n21  disclosures from their patients.”  Id.; see also ECF No. 60 at 9 (“Families have asked \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4036   Page 16 of 59\n \n1  our providers about applying for Medicaid or SNAP in the past, but our providers \n2  note that they rescinded these requests” after hearing about the proposed public \n3  charge rule.).  Furthermore, health care providers anticipate that “forcing non-\n4  citizens to choose between medical treatment or potential deportation or family \n5  separation” will induce “patients to miss follow-up appointments or forego \n6  treatment” that a clinician has prescribed.  Id. at 20. \n7  The Plaintiff States submitted declarations and copies of the comments \n8  submitted to DHS during the rulemaking process supporting the conclusion that \n9  disenrollment from publicly-funded health insurance programs and related benefits \n10  already has begun to occur in anticipation of the effective date of the Public Charge \n11  Rule.  See ECF Nos. 35-2 at 3; 35-3 at 11; see also ECF Nos. 152 at 8; 153 at 17. \n12      2.  Health and Well-Being of Plaintiff State Residents \n13   The Plaintiff States’ evidence supports that decreased utilization of \n14  immunizations against communicable diseases “could lead to higher rates of \n15  contagion and worse community health,” both in the immigrant population and the \n16  U.S. citizen population because of the nature of epidemics.  ECF No. 65 at 14 \n17  (further recounting that “[d]isease prevention is dependent upon access to vaccines \n18  and high vaccination rates”); see also, e.g., ECF No. 44 at 9.   \n19  State health officials anticipate that the Public Charge Rule and its potential to \n20  incentivize disenrollment from “critical services” “will unduly increase the number \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4037   Page 17 of 59\n \n1  of people living in poverty and thus destabilize the economic health” of communities \n2  in the Plaintiff States.  ECF No. 37 at 14.   \n3  The amici briefs submitted for the Court’s consideration, in addition to the \n4  Plaintiff States’ submissions, detail harm specific to particular vulnerable groups in \n5  the Plaintiff States and throughout the country. \n6        a.  Children and Pregnant Women \n7  Perhaps best documented in the extensive submissions in support of the \n8  instant motion are the anticipated harms to children from disenrollment as a result of \n9  the Public Charge Rule.  DHS acknowledges in the Public Charge Rule notice that \n10  the Public Charge Rule may “increase the poverty of certain families and children, \n11  including U.S. citizen children.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,482.  The Plaintiff States focus \n12  on harm to children stemming from lack of access to health care, sufficient and \n13  nutritious food, and adequate housing.  \n14  A chilling effect from the Public Charge Rule will deter eligible people, \n15  including U.S. Citizen children of immigrant parents, from accessing non-cash \n16  public benefits, which will result in further injury to the Plaintiff States.  For \n17  instance, disenrolling from SNAP benefits and other supplemental nutrition services \n18  is likely to lead to food insecurity with resultant injuries.  See, e.g., ECF No. 35-2 at \n19  7.   Forgoing medical care for children or adult family members because of fear of \n20  using non-cash public benefits will lead to less preventative care and result in \n21  increased hospital admissions and medical costs, and poor health and developmental \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4038   Page 18 of 59\n \n1  delays in young children.  ECF No. 35-2 at 278−79.  Food insecurity and poor health \n2  care ultimately result in long-term health issues and lower math and reading \n3  achievement test scores among school children.  Id. \n4  With respect to housing, fair market rent without non-cash public benefits \n5  may be unaffordable in higher-cost areas of the Plaintiff States even for a family \n6  with two household members who each work full-time minimum wage jobs.  See \n7  ECF No. 77 at 17 (providing detail regarding the Massachusetts housing market).  \n8  Therefore, “[f]or immigrants who work low-wage jobs and their families, many of \n9  which include U.S. citizen children, dropping housing benefits to avoid adverse \n10  immigration consequences . . . can be reasonably expected to upend their financial \n11  stability and substantially increase homelessness.”  Id.  The Plaintiff States \n12  submitted evidence that homelessness and housing instability during childhood “can \n13  have lifelong effects on children’s physical and mental health.”  ECF No. 35-2 at 39.  \n14  When families lose their residences because they no longer receive financial \n15  assistance with rent, children in those households “are more likely to develop \n16  respiratory infections and asthma,” among other harms.  ECF No. 37 at 14. \n17  b.  Disabled Individuals \n18    Amici provide a compelling analysis of how the factors introduced by the \n19  Public Charge Rule disproportionately penalize disabled applicants by “triple-\n20  counting” the effects of being disabled.  ECF No. 110 at 23.  The medical condition \n21  and use of Medicaid or other services used to facilitate independence for disabled \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4039   Page 19 of 59\n \n1  individuals each may be assessed negatively against an applicant.  See 8 C.F.R. § \n2  212.22(b); see also ECF No. 110 at 23.  An individual who is disabled with a \n3  medical condition likely to require extensive medical treatment would be \n4  disqualified from the positive “health” factor, even if he or she is in good health \n5  apart from the disability.  See id.  Therefore, there is a significant possibility that \n6  disabled applicants who currently reside in the Plaintiff States, or legal permanent \n7  residents who return to the U.S. after a 180-day period outside of the U.S., would be \n8  deemed inadmissible primarily on the basis of their disability.   \n9    In addition, the chilling effect arising out of predictable confusion from the \n10  changes in the Public Charge Rule may cause immigrant parents to refuse benefits \n11  for their disabled U.S. citizen children or legal permanent resident children.  ECF \n12  No. 110 at 26.  Notably, disenrollment of disabled individuals from services in \n13  childhood is the type of harm that may result in extra costs to Plaintiff States far into \n14  the future because of the citizen and legal permanent resident children reaching \n15  adulthood with untreated disabilities. \n16  c.  Elderly \n17  Amici have argued convincingly that the Public Charge Rule will have a \n18  substantial negative impact on the elderly.  Many of the Public Charge Rule’s \n19  negative factors inherently apply to the elderly.  For instance, being over the age of \n20  sixty-two may be weighed negatively against an applicant.  ECF No. 150 at 16; see \n21  8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)(1)(i).  Additionally, many elderly people rely on their \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4040   Page 20 of 59\n \n1  families for support.  See id. at 19–20.  Although immigration law in the United \n2  States has traditionally favored family unification, the Public Charge Rule may \n3  penalize people for living with their families, counting their family reliance against \n4  them.  See ECF No. 150 at 19 (citing the “preference allocation for family-\n5  sponsored immigrants” in 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)).  Furthermore, the new rule \n6  penalizes people with a medical diagnosis that will require extensive treatment, \n7  and most adults over fifty years old have at least one chronic health condition.  Id. \n8  at 18 (citing AARP Public Policy Institute, Chronic Care: A Call to Action for \n9  Health Reform, 11–12, 16 (2009); University of New Hampshire Institute on \n10  Disability/ UCED, 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report (2018)); see 8 C.F.R. § \n11  212.22(b)(2)(ii)(B).  Many elderly people rely on non-cash forms of public \n12  assistance like Medicaid, SNAP, and public housing and rental assistance.  ECF \n13  No. 150 at 15.  That assistance will be counted against them by the Public Charge \n14  Rule, predictably leading to disenrollment from such programs.  See id. at 27; 8 \n15  C.F.R. § 212.22(d).  Amici persuasively argue that without assistance from \n16  important programs like Medicaid elderly people will experience additional and \n17  exacerbated medical problems, “creating a new and uncompensated care burden on \n18  society.”  ECF No. 150 at 27. \n19  Moreover, many elderly people do not satisfy the Public Charge Rule’s \n20  positive factors.  For instance, one of the Rule’s positive factors is having an \n21  income that exceeds 250 percent of the federal poverty level.  Id. at 16; 8 C.F.R. § \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4041   Page 21 of 59\n \n1  212.22(c)(2)(ii).  Amici state that most people over the age of sixty-two live in \n2  moderate to low-income households, making them ineligible for this positive \n3  factor.  See ECF No. 150 at 16 (citing Public Charge Proposed Rule: Potentially \n4  Chilled Population Data Dashboard, Mannat (Oct. 11, 2018)).  Many people also \n5  will have their income level counted negatively against them because having an \n6  income of less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level is a negative \n7  factor.  Id.; see 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)(4)(i).          \n8  d.  Domestic Violence Victims \n9    Amici organizations who support victims of domestic violence identify an \n10  overlap between the assistance a woman may seek or receive as she leaves an \n11  abusive relationship and establishes independence and the new definition of “public \n12  benefit” in the Public Charge Rule.  See ECF No. 111 at 20−32.  In addition, the \n13  Public Charge Rule does not except health issues resulting from abuse from the \n14  negative medical condition factors.  See id.; 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b).  The amici \n15  represent that the chilling effect is occurring in anticipation of the Public Charge \n16  Rule, with “victims . . . already foregoing critical housing, food, and healthcare \n17  assistance out of fear that it will jeopardize their immigration status.”  ECF No. 111 \n18  at 22.  Foregoing non-cash public benefits by domestic violence victims risks \n19  “broader impacts” to the health and wellbeing of residents throughout the Plaintiff \n20  States “as a result of unmitigated trauma to victims and their families.”  Id. at 24. \n21   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4042   Page 22 of 59\n \n1      3.   Financial Harm to Plaintiff States \n2    The Plaintiff States and the amici briefs make a cohesive showing of ongoing \n3  financial harm to the States as disenrollment from “safety net” benefits programs \n4  predictably occurs among vulnerable populations.  As noted above, both immigrant \n5  and U.S. citizen children of immigrants are more likely to experience poorer long-\n6  term outcomes, including impaired growth, compromised cognitive development, \n7  and obesity without access to non-cash public benefits.  ECF No. 149 at 21.  Further, \n8  exposure to housing insecurity and homelessness often is associated with increased \n9  vulnerability to a range of adult diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, and smoking-\n10  related cancers.  Id. at 22.  Even if the immigrant children no longer reside in the \n11  Plaintiff States, the affected U.S. citizen children will remain entitled to live in the \n12  Plaintiff States, or in other states not plaintiffs before this Court, once they are \n13  adults.  Therefore, the Plaintiff States face increased costs to address the predictable \n14  effects of the adverse childhood experiences over the course of these U.S. citizen \n15  children’s lifetimes, potentially fifty years or more down the road. \n16    The Plaintiff States further face likely pecuniary harm from contagion due to \n17  unvaccinated residents, resulting in outbreaks of influenza, measles, and a higher \n18  incidence of preventable disease among immigrants as well as U.S. citizens.  ECF \n19  No. 38 at 7−8.  It is reasonably certain that any outbreaks would result in “reduced \n20  days at work, reduced days at school, lower productivity, and long-term negative \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4043   Page 23 of 59\n \n1  economic consequences,” as well as the cost of responding to an epidemic for state \n2  and local health departments.  Id.   \n3  The Plaintiff States also allege that they will incur additional administrative \n4  costs as a result of the Public Charge Rule, including “training staff, responding to \n5  client inquiries related to the Final Rule, and modifying existing communications \n6  and forms.”  ECF No. 40 at 7−8 (declaration from the Deputy Commissioner of the \n7  New Jersey Department of Human Services, adding “Because the rules for \n8  determining whether someone is a public charge are technical and confusing, it will \n9  be extremely difficult to train frontline staff to have the requisite understanding \n10  necessary to help potential applicants determine whether they would be deemed a \n11  public charge under the proposed Final Rule.”).  The Plaintiff States also may incur \n12  the expense of developing alternative programming and enacting new eligibility \n13  rules across multiple systems of benefits to “mirror” the effect of Medicaid and other \n14  federal programs and to mitigate the negative effects from the Public Charge Rule \n15  on individual and community health.  See ECF No. 37 at 15. \n16  C.  Application of Harms to Standing Requirements \n17  The Plaintiff States argue that they have made a clear showing of each \n18  element of standing by showing that “the Rule will lead to a cascade of costs to \n19  states as immigrants disenroll from federal and state benefits programs, . . . thereby \n20  frustrating the States’ mission in creating such programs and harming state \n21  residents.”  ECF No. 158 at 11 (citing cases supporting state standing based on a \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4044   Page 24 of 59\n \n1  proprietary interest and a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and wellbeing of the \n2  state’s residents).   The Plaintiff States further allege future economic harm.  Id. at \n3  35 (citing a declaration at ECF No. 66 at 19 estimating an annual reduction in total \n4  economic output of $41.8 to $97.5 million and other damage to the Washington \n5  State economy alone). \n6  The Federal Defendants argue that the Plaintiff States’ alleged harm is not \n7  fairly traceable to the Public Charge Rule but would be the result of third-party \n8  decisions, such as “unnecessarily choosing to forgo all federal benefits.”  See ECF \n9  No. 155 at 19−21.  The Supreme Court recently addressed the Federal Defendants’ \n10  traceability argument in Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019), in \n11  which a group of states and other plaintiffs challenged the Secretary of Commerce’s \n12  decision to inquire about citizenship status on the census questionnaire.  Id. at 2557.  \n13  There, the Government argued “that any harm to respondents is not fairly traceable \n14  to the Secretary’s decision, because such harm depends on the independent action of \n15  third parties choosing to violate their legal duty to respond to the census.”  139 S. Ct. \n16  at 2565.  The Supreme Court rejected the Government’s argument, concluding: \n17  But we are satisfied that, in these circumstances, respondents have met \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely react in predictable \n18  ways to the citizenship question, even if they do so unlawfully and \ndespite the requirement that the Government keep individual answers \n19  confidential.  . . .  Respondents’ theory of standing . . . does not rest on \nmere speculation about the decisions of third parties; it relies instead on \n20  the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third \nparties.   \n21   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4045   Page 25 of 59\n \n1  139 S. Ct. at 2566. \n2  The Plaintiff States have made a strong showing of the predictable effect of \n3  the Government action on individual residents who are not parties in this action, and \n4  in turn, the predictable effect on the Plaintiff States.  The complexities of the multi-\n5  factor totality of the circumstances test and the new definition of “public charge” \n6  that USCIS officers must administer are not fully captured in this Order.  \n7  Nevertheless, from the components of the rule that the Court already has closely \n8  examined, it is predictable that applying the multi-factor Public Charge Rule would \n9  result in disparate results depending on each USCIS officer.  Moreover, the general \n10  message conveyed to USCIS officers, immigrants, legal permanent residents, and \n11  the general public alike is unmistakable: the Public Charge Rule creates a wider \n12  barrier to exclude individuals seeking to alter their immigration status. \n13  Therefore, it is further predictable that individuals who perceive that they or \n14  their children may fall within the broadened scope of the public charge \n15  inadmissibility ground will seek to reduce that risk by disenrolling from non-cash \n16  public benefits.  Otherwise stated, the chilling effect of the Public Charge Rule \n17  likely will lead individuals to disenroll from benefits, because receipt of those \n18  benefits likely would subject them to a public charge determination, and, equally \n19  foreseeably, because the Public Charge Rule will create fear and confusion regarding \n20  public charge inadmissibility. \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4046   Page 26 of 59\n \n1  Also predictable is that the chilling effect will negatively impact the Plaintiff \n2  States’ missions, the health and wellbeing of their residents, citizens and non-\n3  citizens alike, and the Plaintiff States’ budgets and economies. “‘A causal chain does \n4  not fail simply because it has several ‘links,’ provided those links are not \n5  hypothetical or tenuous.’”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571−72 (9th Cir. 2018) \n6  (quoting Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal \n7  quotation omitted)).  While the magnitude of the injuries may remain in dispute, the \n8  Plaintiff States have shown that their likely injuries are a predictable result of the \n9  Public Charge Rule.  See California, 911 F.3d at 572 (citing United States v. \n10  Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n. 14 \n11  (1973), for the proposition that injuries of only a few dollars can establish standing). \n12    D.  Ripeness \n13    A case is ripe for adjudication only if it presents “issues that are ‘definite and \n14  concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’”  Clark v. City of Seattle, 899 F.3d 802, 809 \n15  (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty., 863 F.3d. 1144, 1153 (9th \n16  Cir. 2017)).  Just as the Federal Defendants argue that the Plaintiff States’ alleged \n17  harms are not concrete or imminent, they make the same arguments for purposes of \n18  ripeness.  The Court applies the same analysis as discussed for standing and \n19  concludes that the alleged harms are sufficiently concrete and imminent to support \n20  ripeness. \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4047   Page 27 of 59\n \n1  The Federal Defendants also argue that the Court should decline to hear the \n2  case on the basis of prudential ripeness.  See ECF No. 155 at 25.  Courts resolve \n3  questions of prudential ripeness “in a twofold aspect,” evaluating “both the fitness of \n4  the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court \n5  consideration.”  Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967).  Where review \n6  of an administrative action is at issue, “[f]itness for resolution depends on the nature \n7  of the issue and the finality of the administrative agency’s action.”  Hotel Emples. & \n8  Rest. Emples. Int’l Union v. Nev. Gaming Comm’n, 984 F.2d 1507, 1513 (9th Cir. \n9  1993).  Once a court has found that constitutional ripeness is satisfied, the prudential \n10  ripeness bar is minimal, as “‘a federal court’s obligation to hear and decide’ cases \n11  within its jurisdiction is ‘virtually unflagging.’”  Susan B. Anthony List, 572 U.S. at \n12  167 (quoting Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n13  125−26 (2014) (internal quotation omitted)). \n14  The Federal Defendants misconstrue the issues raised by the Amended \n15  Complaint and the record on the instant motion.  Challenges to the validity of a rule \n16  under the judicial review provisions of the APA present issues fit for adjudication by \n17  a court.  See Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149−52 (review of a rule before it has \n18  been applied and enforced is available where “the regulations are clear-cut,” present \n19  a legal issue, and constitute the agency’s formal and definitive statement of policy).  \n20  Moreover, the Plaintiff States’ harm would only be exacerbated by delaying review.  \n21  For example, delaying review increases the potential for spread of infectious \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4048   Page 28 of 59\n \n1  diseases among the populations of the Plaintiff States, as well as to nearby states, as \n2  a result of reduced access to health care and vaccinations.  Therefore, the Court finds \n3  this matter is ripe for review.  \n4    E.  Zone of Interests  \n5    The Federal Defendants argue that the Plaintiff States do not fall within the \n6  “zone of interests” of the INA because: “It is aliens improperly determined \n7  inadmissible, not States, who ‘fall within the zone of interests protected’ by any \n8  limitations implicit in § 1182(a)(4)(A) and § 1183 because they are the \n9  ‘reasonable—indeed, predictable—challengers’ to DHS’s inadmissibility decisions.”  \n10  ECF No. 155 at 28 (citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians \n11  v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 227 (2012); 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (providing for appeal by an \n12  individual of a final order of removal based on a public charge determination)).   \n13    However, the zone of interests test is “not ‘especially demanding.’”  Lexmark \n14  Int’l, 572 U.S. at 130 (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225).  \n15  Particularly where a plaintiff pursues relief through the APA, the Supreme Court has \n16  directed that the test shall be applied “in keeping with Congress’s ‘evident intent’ \n17  when enacting the APA ‘to make agency action presumptively reviewable.’”  \n18  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish, 567 U.S. at 225 (quoting Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, \n19  479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987)).  There is no requirement that a plaintiff show “any \n20  ‘indication of congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff.’”  Id. (quoting \n21  Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399−400).  Moreover, the “benefit of any doubt goes to the \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4049   Page 29 of 59\n \n1  plaintiff.”  Id.  “The test forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s ‘interests are so \n2  marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it \n3  cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.’”  Id. \n4  (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399). \n5    The Plaintiff States meet this lenient standard by tracing the origins of the \n6  public charge exclusion enacted by Congress in 1882 “to protect state fiscs.”  ECF \n7  No. 158 at 14.  The concept of a “public charge” exclusion originally was \n8  incorporated into U.S. law by Congress in 1882 to protect states from having to \n9  spend state money to provide for immigrants who could not provide for themselves.  \n10  ECF No. 158 at 14−15 n. 3.  The Plaintiff States reasonably extrapolate: “By \n11  imposing significant uncompensated costs on the Plaintiff States and undermining \n12  their comprehensive public assistance programs, the Rule undermines the very \n13  interests advanced by the statutes on which DHS relies.”  ECF No. 158 at 14−15 \n14  (citing Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 124, 163 (5th Cir. 2015), aff’d, 136 S. Ct. \n15  2271 (2016) for the proposition that it “recogniz[es] states’ economic interests in \n16  immigration policy”).  Thus, states were at the center of the zone of interest for use \n17  of the term “public charge” from the beginning of the relevant statutory scheme, and \n18  the Plaintiff States continue to have interests that are sufficiently consistent with the \n19  purposes implicit in the public charge inadmissibility policy to challenge its \n20  application now. \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4050   Page 30 of 59\n \n1    The Court finds that the Plaintiff States have standing to pursue this action, \n2  that the issues are ripe for adjudication, and that the Plaintiff States are within the \n3  zone of interests of the Public Charge Rule.   \n4  IV.  LEGAL STANDARDS FOR STAYS AND PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTIONS IN CASES CHALLENGING AGENCY ACTION \n5   \nThe Administrative Procedure Act’s stay provision states, in relevant part: \n6 \nOn such conditions as may be required and to the extent necessary to \n7  prevent  irreparable  injury,  the  reviewing  court  .  .  .  may  issue  all \nnecessary and appropriate process to postpone the effective date of an \n8  agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the \nreview proceedings. \n9   \n5 U.S.C. § 705.5   \n10 \nThe Court applies a closely similar standard in deciding whether to stay the \n11 \neffect of a rule under section 705 as it does in deciding whether to issue a \n12 \npreliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 65(a).  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n13 \n418, 425−26 (2009); see also Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. v. United States FDA, 524 F. \n14 \nSupp.2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2007).  For a preliminary injunction, the moving party must \n15 \ndemonstrate: (1) likelihood of success on the merits; (2) likelihood of irreparable \n16 \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in the \n17 \nmoving party’s favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. \n18 \n19 \n \n5 Alternatively, Section 705 authorizes an agency itself to temporarily stay the \n20 \neffective date of its rule pending judicial review, when it “finds that justice so \n21  requires.”  5 U.S.C. § 705.   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4051   Page 31 of 59\n \n1  Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).   For a stay, the traditional \n2  test articulates the third factor in slightly different terms: “‘whether issuance of the \n3  stay will substantially injure the other parties.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 419 (quoting \n4  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)). \n5  Provided the Court considers all four parts of the Winter test, the Court may \n6  supplement its preliminary injunction inquiry by considering whether “the likelihood \n7  of success is such that ‘serious questions going to the merits were raised and the \n8  balance of hardships tips sharply in [the requesting party’s] favor.’”  Alliance for the \n9  Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Clear \n10  Channel Outdoor, Inc. v. City of L.A., 340 F.3d 810, 813 (9th Cir. 2003)).  The Ninth \n11  Circuit’s “sliding scale” approach survives Winter, “so long as the [movant] also \n12  shows that there is a likelihood of irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the \n13  public interest.”  Alliance for the Wild Rockies, 632 F.3d at 1135.   \n14  Both a stay under section 705 and a preliminary injunction serve the purpose \n15  of preserving the status quo until a trial on the merits can be held.  Univ. of Texas v. \n16  Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d \n17  1011, 1024 (9th Cir. 2016); Sierra Club v. Jackson, 833 F.Supp.2d 11, 28 (D.D.C. \n18  2012) (“Such a stay is not designed to do anything other than preserve the status \n19  quo.”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 705).   \n20  Section 705 and preliminary injunctions under Rule 65, although determined \n21  by application of similar standards, offer different forms of relief.  Nken, 556 U.S. at \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4052   Page 32 of 59\n \n1  428.  An injunction “is directed at someone, and governs that party’s conduct.”  Id. \n2  “By contrast, instead of directing the conduct of a particular actor, a stay operates \n3  upon the judicial proceeding itself.  It does so either by halting or postponing some \n4  portion of the proceeding, or by temporarily divesting an order of enforceability.”  \n5  Id.  “If nothing else, the terms are by no means synonymous.”  Id. \n6  One difference is that Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) requires the court to determine the \n7  amount that the movant must give in security for “the costs and damages sustained \n8  by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Section 705 \n9  contains no such requirement.   \n10   In granting preliminary injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, a \n11  court must consider whether the defendant shall be enjoined from enforcing the \n12  disputed rule against all persons nationwide, or solely against plaintiffs.  “Crafting a \n13  preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as \n14  much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.” \n15  Trump v. Intern. Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017).   \n16  There is “no bar against . . . nationwide relief in federal district or circuit court \n17  when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 1987); see \n18  also Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 289 (1952) (“[T]he District Court in \n19  exercising its equity powers may command persons properly before it to cease or \n20  perform acts outside its territorial jurisdiction.”); Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed \n21  Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 181 n. 12 (2010) (J. Stevens, dissenting) (“Although we have \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4053   Page 33 of 59\n \n1  not squarely addressed the issue, in my view there is no requirement that an \n2  injunction affect only the parties in the suit.  To limit an injunction against a federal \n3  agency to the named plaintiffs would only encourage numerous other regulated \n4  entities to file additional lawsuits in this and other federal jurisdictions.”) (internal \n5  quotations omitted).  The primary consideration is whether the injunctive relief is \n6  sufficiently narrow in scope to “‘be no more burdensome to the defendant than \n7  necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs’ before the court.”  L.A. Haven \n8  Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Califano v. \n9  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)). \n10  The Ninth Circuit has “upheld nationwide injunctions when ‘necessary to give \n11  Plaintiff a full expression of their rights.’”  City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, \n12  897 F.3d 1225, 1244 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 \n13  (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d on other grounds Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.

By contrast, the Ninth Circuit has vacated a nationwide injunction on a \n16  finding that the plaintiffs did not make “a sufficient showing of ‘nationwide impact’ \n17  demonstrating that a nationwide injunction is necessary to completely accord relief \n18  to them.’”  Id. \n19  /  /  / \n20  /  /  / \n21  /  /  / \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4054   Page 34 of 59\n \n1  V.  ANALYSIS \n2  A.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n3  For purposes of the Motion for a Stay and Preliminary Injunction, the Plaintiff \n4  States highlight the likelihood of success on the merits of their first and third causes \n5  of action, both of which are pursuant to the APA.  ECF No. 34 at 21−51. \n6  Under the APA, “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action. . \n7  . is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The APA further directs \n8  courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions \n9  found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n10  accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n11  1.  First Cause of Action: Violation of the Administrative \n12  Procedure Act—Action Not in Accordance with Law \n13  An administrative agency “may not exercise its authority ‘in a manner that is \n14  inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.’”  FDA \n15  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 125 (2000), superseded by \n16  statute on other grounds, 21 U.S.C. § 387a.  When an administrative agency’s action \n17  involves the construction of a statute that the agency administers, a court’s analysis \n18  is governed by the two-step framework set forth in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural \n19  Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  Id. at 125−26. \n20  A reviewing court’s first inquiry under Chevron is whether Congress has \n21  expressed its intent clearly and unambiguously in the statutory language at issue.  \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4055   Page 35 of 59\n \n1  Brown & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 132.  If Congress has spoken directly to the issue \n2  before the reviewing court, the court’s inquiry need not proceed further, and the \n3  court “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”  \n4  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.  If Congress has not addressed the specific question raised \n5  by the administrative agency’s construction of a statute, “a reviewing court must \n6  respect the agency’s construction of the statute so long as it is permissible.”  Brown \n7  & Williamson, 529 U.S. at 132 (citing INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 \n8  (1999); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 457 (1997)). \n9  In analyzing the first step of Chevron, “whether Congress has specifically \n10  addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court should not confine itself to \n11  examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.”  Brown & Williamson, 529 \n12  U.S. at 133.  The reviewing court must read the words of a statute “‘in their context \n13  and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.’”  Id. (quoting Davis \n14  v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989)).  A court must interpret a \n15  particular statutory provision both in the context of other parts of the same \n16  regulatory scheme and with respect to other statutes that may affect the meaning of \n17  the statutory provision at issue.  Id. \n18  In this case, the issue is whether Congress has expressed its intent regarding \n19  barring individuals from obtaining visas or changing their status to legal permanent \n20  residents based on a specific definition of public charge.  Congress has expressed its \n21  intent regarding the public charge statute in a variety of forms.  In 1986, Congress \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4056   Page 36 of 59\n \n1  included a special rule in a section of the INA addressing waivers of the public \n2  charge inadmissibility ground for applicants seeking legal permanent residency \n3  status.  8 U.S.C. § 1255a(d)(2)(B)(iii).  The “special rule for determination of public \n4  charge,” excepts an immigrant seeking relief under that section from inadmissibility \n5  as a public charge if he or she demonstrates “a history of employment in the United \n6  States evidencing self-support without receipt of public cash assistance.”  Id.   \n7  Later, as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n8  Reconciliation Act of 1996 (“Welfare Reform Act”), Congress enacted a statutory \n9  provision articulating the following “Statements of national policy concerning \n10  welfare and immigration”: \n11  The  Congress  makes  the  following  statements  concerning  national \npolicy with respect to welfare and immigration: \n12   \n(1)  Self-sufficiency  has  been  a  basic  principle  of  United  States \n13  immigration law since this country’s earliest immigration statutes. \n(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that— \n14    (A) aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public \nresources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities \n15  and  the  resources  of  their  families,  their  sponsors,  and  private \norganizations, and \n16    (B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive \nfor immigration to the United States. \n17  (3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying \nfor  and  receiving  public  benefits  from  Federal,  State,  and  local \n18  governments at increasing rates. \n(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable \n19  financial support agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring \nthat individual aliens not burden the public benefits system. \n20  (5)  It  is  a  compelling  government  interest  to  enact  new  rules  for \neligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be \n21  self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy. \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4057   Page 37 of 59\n \n1  (6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for \nillegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits. \n2  (7)  With  respect  to  the  State  authority  to  make  determinations \nconcerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits in this \n3  title,  a  State  that  chooses  to  follow  the  Federal  classification  in \ndetermining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be \n4  considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for \nachieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens \n5  be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy. \n \n6  8 U.S.C. § 1601. \n \n7  The Welfare Reform Act further limited eligibility for many “federal means-\n8  tested public benefits,” such as Medicaid and SNAP, to “qualified” immigrants, and \n9  Congress defined “qualified” to include lawful permanent residents and certain other \n10  legal statuses.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1641(b).  Most immigrants become “qualified” for \n11  benefits eligibility five years after their date of entry.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1612, 1613.  \n12  States retain a significant degree of authority to determine eligibility for state \n13  benefits.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1621−22, 1641. \n14  Thus, in the course of significantly restricting access to public benefits by \n15  non-citizens, Congress expressly states that part of its national immigration policy is \n16  allowing public benefits to qualified aliens in “the least restrictive means available” \n17  in order to achieve the goal that the aliens “be self-reliant.”  8 U.S.C. § 1601(7).  \n18  Congress did not state that there should be no public benefits provided to qualified \n19  aliens, but rather that public benefits be provided in “the least restrictive means \n20  available.”  See id.

See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).   \n9  In the course of enacting the Immigration Reform Act, members of Congress \n10  debated whether to expand the public charge definition to include use of non-cash \n11  public benefits.  See Immigration Control & Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, \n12  H.R. 2202, 104th Cong. § 202 (1996) (early House bill that would have defined \n13  public charge for purposes of removal to include receipt by a non-citizen of \n14  Medicaid, supplemental food assistance, SSI, and other means-tested public \n15  benefits).  However, in the Senate, at least one senator criticized the effort to include \n16  previously unconsidered, non-cash public benefits in the public charge test and to \n17  create a bright-line framework of considering whether the immigrant has received \n18  public benefits for an aggregate of twelve months as “too quick to label people as \n19  public charges for utilizing the same public assistance that many Americans need to \n20  get on their feet.”  S. Rep. No. 104-249, at *63−64 (1996) (Senator Leahy’s \n21  remarks).   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4059   Page 39 of 59\n \n1  Congress’s intent is reflected by the fact that the Immigration Reform Act that \n2  was enacted into law did not contain the provisions that would have incorporated \n3  into the public charge determination non-cash public benefits.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n4  1182(a)(4). \n5  After the Welfare Reform Act and the Immigration Reform Act took effect, \n6  Congress further demonstrated its intent regarding non-cash public benefits for \n7  immigrants by expanding access to SNAP benefits for certain immigrants who \n8  resided in the United States at the time that the Welfare Reform Act was enacted and \n9  to children and certain immigrants with disabilities regardless of how long they had \n10  been in the country.  See Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform \n11  Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-185, 112 Stat. 523; Farm Security and Rural \n12  Investment Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-171, 116 Stat. 134.   \n13  In 1999, to “help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of the term \n14  ‘public charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, \n15  State, and local public benefits,” the INS issued “field guidance” (“the 1999 field \n16  guidance”) and a proposed rule to guide public charge determinations by INS \n17  officers.  INS, Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge \n18  Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (Mar. 26, 1999).  The 1999 field guidance provided \n19  that a person may be deemed a public charge under the inadmissibility provision at 8 \n20  U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) if the person is “primarily dependent on the government for \n21  subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4060   Page 40 of 59\n \n1  income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government \n2  expense.”  Id. at 28,692.   \n3  In issuing the field guidance and proposed rule, the INS reasoned as follows: \n4  The Service is proposing this definition by regulation and adopting it \non  an  interim  basis  for  several  reasons. First,  confusion  about the \n5  relationship between the receipt of public benefits and the concept of \n‘‘public  charge’’  has  deterred  eligible  aliens  and  their  families, \n6  including U.S.  citizen  children, from  seeking  important health  and \nnutrition  benefits  that  they  are  legally  entitled  to  receive.    This \n7  reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not just on the \npotential  recipients,  but  on  public  health  and  the  general  welfare.  \n8  Second, non-cash benefits (other than institutionalization for long-term \ncare)  are  by  their  nature  supplemental  and  do  not,  alone  or  in \n9  combination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or \nfamily.  In addition to receiving non-cash benefits, an alien would have \n10  to have either additional income—such as wages, savings, or earned \nretirement benefits—or public cash assistance.  Thus, by focusing on \n11  cash assistance for income maintenance, the Service can identify those \nwho are primarily dependent on the government for subsistence without \n12  inhibiting  access  to  non-cash  benefits  that  serve  important  public \ninterests.    Finally,  certain  federal,  state,  and  local  benefits  are \n13  increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above \nthe  poverty  level,  reflecting  broad  public  policy  decisions  about \n14  improving general public health and nutrition, promoting education, \nand assisting working-poor families in the process of becoming self-\n15  sufficient.    Thus,  participation  in  such  noncash  programs  is  not \nevidence of poverty or dependence. \n16   \n64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. \n17 \nIn addition, the INS noted: “In adopting this new definition, the Service does \n18 \nnot expect to substantially change the number of aliens who will be found deportable \n19 \nor inadmissible as public charges.”  Id. \n20 \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4061   Page 41 of 59\n \n1  The proposed rule was never finalized, but the 1999 field guidance has \n2  applied to public charge determinations since it was issued twenty years ago.  See \n3  ECF No. 35-1 at 109.  During the past twenty-year period, Congress has not \n4  expressly altered the working definition of public charge or the field guidance as to \n5  how the public charge inadmissibility ground should be applied to applicants for \n6  visas or permanent legal residency.    \n7  In 2013, Congress again considered and rejected a proposal to broaden the \n8  public charge inadmissibility ground to require applicants to show that “they were \n9  not likely to qualify even for non-cash employment supports such as Medicaid, the \n10  SNAP program, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).” S. Rep. No. \n11  113-40 (Jun. 7, 2013).   \n12  The Plaintiff States also maintain that the Public Charge Rule “departs from \n13  the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress” in statutes other than the Welfare \n14  Reform Act and the INA, namely section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and a statute \n15  governing SNAP benefits.  ECF No. 31 at 169−71. \n16  With respect to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Plaintiff States assert that \n17  the Public Charge Rule is not in accordance with section 504, which provides that \n18  “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, \n19  solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be \n20  denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination . . . under any program or \n21  activity conducted by an Executive agency.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The SNAP statute \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4062   Page 42 of 59\n \n1  provides that “the value of benefits that may be provided under this chapter shall not \n2  be considered income or resources for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local \n3  laws.”  7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n4  The Federal Defendants broadly assert: “From the beginning, immigration \n5  authorities have recognized that the plain meaning of the public charge ground of \n6  inadmissibility encompasses all of those likely to become a financial burden on the \n7  public, and that the purpose of the provision is to exclude those who are not self-\n8  sufficient.”  ECF No. 155 at 35−36.  The Federal Defendants rely on the statements \n9  of the Secretary of Labor to the House Committee on Immigration and \n10  Naturalization in 1916 to support that the goal behind the public charge \n11  inadmissibility ground is to support self-sufficiency: \n12  [(1)]  a  person  is  ‘likely  to  become  a  public  charge’  when  ‘such \napplicant may be a charge (an economic burden) upon the community \n13  to which he is going.’[; and] \n[(2)] the public charge clause ‘for so many years has been the chief \n14  measure of protection in the law . . . intended to reach economic rather \nthan sanitary objections to the admission of certain classes of aliens.’ \n15   \nId. (citing H.R. Doc. No. 64-886, at 3−4 (1916)); see also ECF No. 155 at 37 (“As \n16 \nexplained above, Congress and the Executive Branch have long recognized the \n17 \n‘public charge’ ground as a ‘chief measure’ for ensuring the economic self-\n18 \nsufficiency of aliens.”). \n19 \nThe Federal Defendants’ arguments to this Court replicate DHS’s assertion in \n20 \nthe rulemaking record that “self-sufficiency is the rule’s ultimate aim.”  84 Fed. Reg. \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4063   Page 43 of 59\n \n1  at 41,313.  DHS attempts to reconcile the absence of the Welfare Reform Act’s \n2  “self-sufficiency” language in the public charge inadmissibility provision at 8 U.S.C. \n3  § 1182(a)(4) by noting the temporal proximity between the Welfare Reform Act and \n4  the Immigration Reform Act: \n5  Although the INA does not mention self-sufficiency in the context of . \n. . 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), DHS believes that there is a strong connection \n6  between the self-sufficiency policy statements [in the Welfare Reform \nAct] (even if not codified in the INA itself) at 8 U.S.C. 1601 and the \n7  public charge inadmissibility language in . . . 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), \nwhich were enacted within a month of each other. \n8   \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,355−56. \n9 \nNotably, DHS cites no basis for interpreting the policy statements at 8 U.S.C. \n10 \n§ 1601 beyond a belief in “a strong connection” between those policy statements and \n11 \nthe public charge rule inadmissibility ground. \n12 \nEssentially, at this early stage in the litigation, the Federal Defendants urge the \n13 \nCourt to take two unsupported leaps of statutory construction.  First, they seek a \n14 \nlegal conclusion that the purpose of the public charge inadmissibility provision is to \n15 \n“ensur[e] the economic self-sufficiency of aliens.”  ECF No. 155 at 37.  Second, the \n16 \nFederal Defendants argue that Congress has delegated to DHS the role of \n17 \ndetermining what benefits programs, income levels, and household sizes or \n18 \ncompositions, promote or undermine self-sufficiency.  However, the Federal \n19 \nDefendants have not cited any statute, legislative history, or other resource that \n20 \nsupports the interpretation that Congress has delegated to DHS the authority to \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 43 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4064   Page 44 of 59\n \n1  expand the definition of who is inadmissible as a public charge or to define what \n2  benefits undermine, rather than promote, the stated goal of achieving self-\n3  sufficiency.     \n4  By contrast, the Plaintiff States offer extensive support for the conclusion that \n5  Congress unambiguously rejected key components of the Public Charge Rule, \n6  including the consideration of non-cash public benefits and a rigid twelve-month \n7  aggregate approach in determining whether someone would be deemed a public \n8  charge.  In the pivotal legislative period of 1996, and again in 2013, Congress \n9  rejected the provisions that the Public Charge Rule now incorporates.  In 2013, as \n10  the Plaintiff States underscore, Congress rejected expansion of the benefits \n11  considered for public charge exclusion with full awareness of the 1999 field \n12  guidance in effect.  See ECF No. 158 at 18 (citing Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, \n13  580 (1978) (“Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial \n14  interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute \n15  without change.”)). \n16  Furthermore, the Plaintiff States make a strong showing in the record that \n17  DHS has overstepped its authority.  The Federal Defendants assert, without any \n18  citation to authority, that “an individual who relies on Medicaid benefits for an \n19  extended period of time in order ‘to get up, get dressed, and go to work,’ is not self-\n20  sufficient.’”  ECF No. 155 at 54 (quoting from Plaintiff’s motion at ECF No. 34).  \n21  Yet, again, the Federal Defendants offer no authority to support that DHS’s role, by \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 44 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4065   Page 45 of 59\n \n1  Congressional authorization, is to define self-sufficiency.  See Comcast Corp. v. \n2  FCC, 600 F.3d 642, 655 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (rejecting the FCC’s interpretation of its \n3  authority because “if accepted it would virtually free the Commission from its \n4  congressional tether.”).  The Federal Defendants also have not explained how DHS \n5  as an agency has the expertise necessary to make a determination of what promotes \n6  self-sufficiency and what amounts to self-sufficiency. \n7  As further illustration of DHS’s unmooring from its Congressionally \n8  delegated authority, DHS justifies including receipt of Medicaid in the public charge \n9  consideration by reciting that “‘the total Federal expenditure for the Medicaid \n10  program overall is by far larger than any other program for low-income people.’”  \n11  ECF No. 109 at 41 (brief from Health Law Advocates and other public health \n12  organizations, quoting 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,379).  However, “[t]he cost of Medicaid is \n13  not DHS’s concern[, as] Congress delegated the implementation and administration \n14  of Medicaid, including the cost of the program, to HHS and the states.”  Id. (citing \n15  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396, 1396-1, 1315(a)).  Congress cannot delegate authority that the \n16  Constitution does not allocate to the federal government in the first place, and the \n17  states exercise a central role in formulation and administration of health care policy.  \n18  See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 636 (“[T]he facets of \n19  governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives are normally administered by smaller \n20  governments closer to the governed.”); see also Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. \n21  470, 484 (1996) (noting the “historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 45 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4066   Page 46 of 59\n \n1  and safety”).   Therefore, the Court finds a likelihood that the Plaintiff States will be \n2  successful in proving that DHS acted beyond its Congressionally delegated authority \n3  when it promulgated the Public Charge Rule. \n4  Moreover, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits denying a person benefits, \n5  excluding a person from participating, or discriminating against a person “solely by \n6  reason of her or his disability[.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).   Although DHS acknowledges \n7  in the Public Charge Rule notice that the Public Charge Rule will have a “potentially \n8  outsized impact” on individuals with disabilities, DHS rationalizes that “Congress \n9  did not specifically provide for a public charge exemption for individuals with \n10  disabilities and in fact included health as a mandatory factor in the public charge \n11  inadmissibility consideration.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,368.  The Federal Defendants \n12  argue that the Public Charge Rule is consistent with the Rehabilitation Act because \n13  disability is “one factor (among many) that may be considered.”  ECF No. 155 at 61.   \n14  At this early stage in the litigation, the plain language of the Public Charge \n15  Rule casts doubt that DHS ultimately will be able to show that the Public Charge \n16  Rule is not contrary to the Rehabilitation Act.  First, contrary to the Federal \n17  Defendants’ assertion, the Public Charge Rule does not state that disability is a \n18  factor that “may” be considered.  Rather, if the “disability” is a “medical condition \n19  that is likely to require extensive medical treatment,” it is one of the minimum \n20  factors that the officer must consider.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b).  Second, as the \n21  amici highlighted, an individual with a disability is likely to have the disability \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 46 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4067   Page 47 of 59\n \n1  counted at least twice as a negative factor in the public charge determination because \n2  receipt of Medicaid is “essential” for millions of people in the United States with \n3  disabilities, and “a third of Medicaid’s adult recipients under the age of 65 are \n4  people with disabilities.”  ECF No. 110 at 19 (emphasis in original removed). \n5  Amici maintain that contrary to being an indicator of becoming a public \n6  charge, Medicaid is “positively associated with employment and the integration of \n7  individuals with disabilities, in part because Medicaid covers employment supports \n8  that enable people with disabilities to work.”  ECF No. 110 at 19−20; see also 42 \n9  U.S.C. § 1396-1 (providing that grants to states for medical assistance programs for \n10  families with dependent children and aged, blind, or disabled individuals are for the \n11  purpose of “help[ing] such families and individuals attain or retain capability for \n12  independence or self-care[.]”).  Therefore, accessing Medicaid logically would assist \n13  immigrants, not hinder them, in becoming self-sufficient, which is DHS’s stated goal \n14  of the Public Charge Rule.   \n15  Given the history of the public charge provision at 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B), \n16  particularly the two recent rejections by Congress of arguments in favor of \n17  expanding the rule to include consideration of non-cash benefits for exclusion as the \n18  Public Charge Rule now does, the Court finds a significant likelihood that the \n19  language of the final rule expands beyond the statutory framework of what a USCIS \n20  officer previously was to consider in applying the public charge test.  See INS v. \n21  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 442−43 (1987) (“‘Few principles of statutory \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 47 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4068   Page 48 of 59\n \n1  construction are more compelling than the proposition that Congress does not intend \n2  sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other \n3  language.’”) (quoting Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S. \n4  359 392−93 (1980) (Stewart, J. dissenting)).   \n5     The U.S. Constitution vests Congress with plenary power to create \n6  immigration law, subject only to constitutional limitations.  See U.S. Const. Art. I, \n7  sect. 8, cl. 4; Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 695 (2001).  An administrative \n8  agency may not make through rulemaking immigration law that Congress declined \n9  to enact.  See Cuomo v. Clearing House Ass’n, LLC, 557 U.S. 519, 533 (2009) \n10  (rejecting a federal agency’s interpretation of a statute and finding that the agency \n11  had “attempted to do what Congress declined to do”).   \n12  Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiff States have demonstrated a strong \n13  likelihood of success on the merits of their first cause of action. \n14  2.  Count 3: Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act—\n15  Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n16  Review of a rulemaking procedure under section 706(2)’s arbitrary and \n17  capricious standard is “narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of \n18  the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \n19  Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).   Nevertheless, an agency has a duty to examine \n20  “the relevant data” and to articulate “a satisfactory explanation for its action, \n21  ‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 48 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4069   Page 49 of 59\n \n1  Dep’t of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2569 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43  \n2  (internal quotation omitted)).  An agency rule is arbitrary and capricious “if the \n3  agency has ruled on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely \n4  failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \n5  decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that \n6  it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  \n7  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.    \n8  Further, when an agency’s prior policy has engendered “serious reliance \n9  interests,” an agency would be “arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matters,” and \n10  the agency must “provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a \n11  new policy created on a blank slate.”  FCC v. Fox TV Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n12  515−16 (2009).  For instance, in INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 29−30 \n13  (1996), the Supreme Court examined statutory text elsewhere in the INA \n14  establishing minimum requirements to be eligible for a waiver of deportation.  \n15  Although the Court found that the relevant provision of the INA “imposes no \n16  limitations on the factors that the Attorney General (or her delegate, the INS)  may \n17  consider,” the Court determined that the practices of the INS in exercising its \n18  discretion nonetheless were germane to whether the agency violated the APA.  Id. at \n19  31−32 (internal citation omitted).  “Though the agency’s discretion is unfettered at \n20  the outset, if it announces and follows—by rule or by settled course of \n21  adjudication—a general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed, \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 49 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4070   Page 50 of 59\n \n1  an irrational departure from that policy (as opposed to an avowed alteration of it) \n2  could constitute action that must be overturned as ‘arbitrary, capricious, [or] an \n3  abuse of discretion’ within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \n4  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).”  Id. at 32. \n5  The record on the instant motion raises concerns that the process that DHS \n6  followed in formulating the Public Charge Rule did not adhere to the requirements \n7  of the APA.  First, based on the statutory and agency history of the public charge \n8  inadmissibility ground discussed above, it is likely that the status quo has \n9  engendered “serious reliance interests” and DHS will be held to the higher standard \n10  of providing “a more detailed justification.”  FCC, 556 U.S. at 515−16.  Although \n11  DHS received over 266,000 comments, the agency’s responses to those comments \n12  appear conclusory.  Moreover, the repeated justification of the changes as promoting \n13  self-sufficiency of immigrants in the United States appears inconsistent with the new \n14  components of the Public Charge Rule, such as the negative weight attributed to \n15  disabled people who use Medicaid to become or remain self-sufficient.  See ECF \n16  No. 110; 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1. \n17  Therefore, the Court finds that there are serious questions going to the merits \n18  regarding whether DHS has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in \n19  formulating the Public Charge Rule.  Moreover, the Plaintiff States have \n20  demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of at least two of their \n21  causes of action in this matter. \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 50 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4071   Page 51 of 59\n \n1  B.  Likelihood of Irreparable Harm \n2    The Plaintiff States are likely to incur multiple forms of irreparable harm if \n3  the Public Charge Rule takes effect as scheduled on October 15, 2019, before this \n4  case can be resolved on the merits.   \n5  First, the Plaintiff States provide a strong basis for finding that disenrollment \n6  from non-cash benefits programs is predictable, not speculative.  See, e.g., ECF No. \n7  35-1 at 98−140 (detailing the chilling effects of the Public Charge Rule on the use of \n8  benefits by legal immigrant families including those with U.S. citizen children); see \n9  also Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding irreparable harm \n10  caused by denial of Medicaid and resulting lack of necessary treatment, increased \n11  pain, and medical complications).  Not only that, DHS’s predecessor agency noted \n12  the harms resulting from a chilling effect twenty years before publication of the \n13  Public Charge Rule.  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692 (“ . . . reluctance to access benefits has \n14  an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the \n15  general welfare.”).   \n16    As discussed in terms of standing, the Public Charge Rule threatens a wide \n17  variety of predictable harms to the Plaintiff States’ interests in promoting the \n18  missions of their health care systems, the health and wellbeing of their residents, and \n19  the Plaintiff States’ financial security.  The harms to children, including U.S. citizen \n20  children, from reduced access to medical care, food assistance, and housing support \n21  particularly threaten the Plaintiff States with a need to re-allocate resources that will \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 51 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4072   Page 52 of 59\n \n1  only compound over time.  Chronic hunger and housing insecurity in childhood is \n2  associated with disorders and other negative effects later in life that are likely to \n3  impose significant expenses on state funds.  See ECF No. 149 at 21−22.  As a \n4  natural consequence, the Plaintiff States are likely to lose tax revenue from affected \n5  children growing into adults with a compromised ability to contribute to their \n6  families and communities.  See ECF No. 35-1 at 171, 618. \n7  Second, the Public Charge Rule notice itself acknowledges many of the harms \n8  alleged by the Plaintiff States.  DHS recognizes that disenrollment or foregone \n9  enrollment will occur.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463.  DHS also acknowledges that more \n10  individuals will visit emergency rooms for emergent and primary care, resulting in \n11  “a potential for increases in uncompensated care” and that communities will \n12  experience increases in communicable diseases.  Id. at 41,384.  \n13  In the Public Charge Rule notice, DHS attempts to justify the likely harms by \n14  invoking the goal of promoting “the self-sufficiency of aliens within the United \n15  States.”  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. 41,309 (as underscored by the Plaintiff States at oral \n16  argument, the Public Charge Rule notice uses the word “self-sufficiency” 165 times \n17  and the word “self-sufficient” 135 times).  Whether DHS can use the stated goal of \n18  promoting self-sufficiency to justify this rulemaking remains an open question for a \n19  later determination, although, as the Court found above, the Plaintiff States have \n20  made a strong showing that DHS overstepped their Congressionally authorized role \n21  in interpreting and enforcing the policy statements in 8 U.S.C. § 1601.   \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 52 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4073   Page 53 of 59\n \n1  The operative question for this prong of both a section 705 stay and \n2  preliminary injunction analysis is whether there is a likelihood of irreparable injury.  \n3  The Court finds this prong satisfied and notes that DHS itself recognizes that \n4  irreparable injury will occur.  The Federal Defendants contest only the magnitude of \n5  the harms claimed by the Plaintiff States and the amici.  However, the Federal \n6  Defendants do not contest the existence of irreparable harm and DHS acknowledged \n7  many of the harms in its own rulemaking notice.  See Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., \n8  175 F.3d 716 (9th Cir. 1999) (requiring a party moving for a preliminary injunction \n9  to demonstrate “a significant threat of irreparable injury, irrespective of the \n10  magnitude of the injury”).   \n11  Therefore, the Court finds that immediate and ongoing harm to the Plaintiff \n12  States and their residents, both immigrant and non-immigrant, is predictable, and \n13  there is a significant likelihood of irreparable injury if the rule were to take effect as \n14  scheduled on October 15, 2019.   \n15  C.  Balance of the Equities, Substantial Injury to the Opposing Party, \n16  and the Public Interest6 \n17  The third and fourth factors of both a section 705 stay and preliminary \n18  injunction analysis also tip in favor of preserving the status quo until this litigation is \n19 \n \n6 When the federal government is a party, the balance of the equities and public \n20 \ninterest factors merge.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. \n21  2014) (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 435). \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 53 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4074   Page 54 of 59\n \n1  resolved.  The Federal Defendants assert that they have “a substantial interest in \n2  administering the national immigration system, a solely federal prerogative,” and \n3  that they “have made the assessment in their expertise that the ‘status quo’ referred \n4  to by Plaintiffs is insufficient or inappropriate to serve the purposes of proper \n5  immigration enforcement.’”  ECF No. 155 at 67−68 (emphasis in original). \n6  However, the Federal Defendants have made no showing of hardship, injury \n7  to themselves, or damage to the public interest from continuing to enforce the status \n8  quo with respect to the public charge ground of inadmissibility until these issues can \n9  be resolved on the merits.  See Sierra Forest Legacy v. Sherman, 646 F.3d 1161, \n10  1186 (9th Cir. 2011) (reasoning that automatically deferring to federal agencies’ \n11  expert assessment of the equities of an injunction would result in “nearly \n12  unattainable” relief from the federal government’s policies, “as government experts \n13  will likely attest that the public interest favors the federal government’s preferred \n14  policy, regardless of procedural failures.”).   \n15  In contrast, the Plaintiff States have shown a significant threat of irreparable \n16  injury as a result of the impending enactment of the Public Charge Rule by \n17  numerous individuals disenrolling from benefits for which they or their relatives \n18  were qualified, out of fear or confusion, that accepting those non-cash public \n19  benefits will deprive them of an opportunity for legal permanent residency.  The \n20  Plaintiff States have further demonstrated how that chilling effect predictably would \n21  cause  irreparable injury by creating long-term costs to the Plaintiff States from \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 54 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4075   Page 55 of 59\n \n1  providing ongoing triage for residents who have missed opportunities for timely \n2  diagnoses, vaccinations, or building a strong foundation in childhood that will allow \n3  U.S. citizen children and future U.S. citizens to flourish and contribute to their \n4  communities as taxpaying adults.   \n5  Further, the Court finds a significant threat of immediate and ongoing harm to \n6  all states because of the likelihood of residents of the Plaintiff States travelling \n7  through or relocating to other states.  Consequently, the balance of equities tips \n8  sharply in favor of the Plaintiff States, and the third factor for purposes of a stay, \n9  threat of substantial injury to the opposing party, favors the Plaintiff States, as well.    \n10  The Court finds that the Plaintiff States and the dozens of amici who \n11  submitted briefs in support of the stay and injunctive relief have established that “an \n12  injunction is in the public interest” because of the numerous detrimental effects that \n13  the Public Charge Rule may cause.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20; see also League of \n14  Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (“[T]here is a \n15  substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws \n16  that govern their existence and operations.”). \n17  VI.  FORM AND SCOPE OF RELIEF \n18    The Plaintiff States have shown under the four requisite considerations of the \n19  Winter test that they are entitled to both a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705 and a \n20  preliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65. \n21 \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 55 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4076   Page 56 of 59\n \n1    In section 705, Congress expressly created a mechanism for a reviewing court \n2  to intervene to suspend an administrative action until a challenge to the legality of \n3  that action can be judicially reviewed.  5 U.S.C. § 705.7  Here, postponing the \n4  effective date of the Public Charge Rule, in its entirety, provides the Plaintiff States’ \n5  the necessary relief to “prevent irreparable injury,” as section 705 instructs.  See \n6  Nken, 556 U.S. at 421 (“A stay does not make time stand still, but does hold a ruling \n7  in abeyance to allow an appellate court the time necessary to review it.”). \n8    Alternatively, if a reviewing court determines that a section 705 stay is not \n9  appropriate or timely, the Court also finds that the Plaintiff States offer substantial \n10  evidence to support a preliminary injunction from enforcement of the Public Charge \n11  Rule, without geographic limitation. \n12  Just as the remedy under section 705 for administrative actions is to preserve \n13  the status quo while the merits of a challenge to administrative action is resolved, an \n14  injunction must apply universally to workably maintain the status quo and \n15  adequately protect the Plaintiff States from irreparable harm.  Limiting the scope of \n16  the injunction to the fourteen Plaintiff States would not prevent those harms to the \n17  Plaintiff States, for several reasons.  First, any immigrant residing in one of the \n18 \n \n7 See Frank Chang, The Administrative Procedure Act’s Stay Provision: Bypassing \n19 \nScylla and Charybdis of Preliminary Injunctions, 85 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1529, \n1552 (2017) (“The nationwide stay is an acceptable and rational policy choice that \n20 \nCongress made: while it delegates certain rulemaking authority to the agencies, it \n21  does so on the premise that the judiciary will curb their excesses.”). \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 56 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4077   Page 57 of 59\n \n1  Plaintiff States may in the future need to move to a non-plaintiff state but would be \n2  deterred from accessing public benefits if relief were limited in geographic scope.  \n3  Second, a geographically limited injunction could spur immigrants now living in \n4  non-plaintiff states to move to one of the Plaintiff States, compounding the Plaintiff \n5  States’ economic injuries to accommodate a surge in social services enrollees.  \n6  Third, if the injunction applied only in the fourteen Plaintiff States, a lawful \n7  permanent resident returning to the United States from a trip abroad of more than \n8  180 days may be subject to the Public Charge Rule at a point of entry.  Therefore, \n9  the scope of the injunction must be universal to afford the Plaintiff States the relief \n10  to which they are entitled.  See, e.g., California, 911 F.3d at 582 (“Although there is \n11  no bar against nationwide relief in federal district court . . . such broad relief must be \n12  necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”) (internal \n13  quotation marks and citation omitted). \n14  Finally, the Court declines to limit the injunction to apply only in those states \n15  within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  In addition to the reasons \n16  discussed above, a Ninth Circuit-only injunction would deprive eleven of the \n17  fourteen Plaintiff States any relief at all.  Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, \n18  Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and \n19  Virginia are located in seven other judicial circuits (the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, \n20  Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits) and would derive no protection from \n21  irreparable injury from relief limited to jurisdictions within the Ninth Circuit.    \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 57 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4078   Page 58 of 59\n \n1  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \n2  1.  The Plaintiff States’ Motion for a Section 705 Stay Pending Judicial \n3  Review and for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 34, is GRANTED. \n4  2.  The Court finds that the Plaintiff States have established a likelihood of \n5  success on the merits of their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, that \n6  they would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay of the effective date of the Public \n7  Charge Rule or preliminary injunctive relief, that the lack of substantial injury to the \n8  opposing party and the public interest favor a stay, and that the balance of equities \n9  and the public interest favor an injunction. \n10  3.  The Court therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705, STAYS the \n11  implementation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Rule entitled  \n12  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (to \n13  be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248), in its entirety, \n14  pending entry of a final judgment on the Plaintiff States’ APA claims.  The effective \n15  date of the Final Rule is POSTPONED pending conclusion of these review \n16  proceedings.  \n17  4.   In the alternative, pursuant to Rule 65(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n18  Procedure, the Court PRELIMINARILY ENJOINS the Federal Defendants and \n19  their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any person in active \n20  concert or participation with them, from implementing or enforcing the Rule entitled \n21  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019), in \n \nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF STATES’ MOTION FOR SECTION 705 STAY \nAND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ~ 58 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 162    filed 10/11/19    PageID.4079   Page 59 of 59\n \n1  any manner or in any respect, and shall preserve the status quo pursuant to the \n2  regulations promulgated under 8 C.F.R. Parts 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, and 248, in \n3  effect as of the date of this Order, until further order of the Court. \n4  5.

INTRODUCTION \n12  1.  The Department’s Final Rule, Inadmissibility on Public Charge \n13  Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,2921 (August 14, 2019) (the Public Charge Rule or the \n14  Rule),  effects  a  radical  overhaul  of  federal  immigration  law  transforming  a \n15  system  that  promotes  economic  mobility  among  immigrants  into  one  that \n16  advantages immigrants with wealth. It does so by penalizing legally present \n17  immigrant families who access federally-funded health, nutrition, and housing \n18  programs, even briefly. The Rule achieves this sweeping change unlawfully: it \n19  expansively redefines the term “public charge”—a previously rare designation \n20                                             \n21  1  Inadmissibility  on  Public  Charge  Grounds,  84  Fed.  Reg.  41,292 \n22  (Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.20). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.531   Page 9 of 185\n \n1  that triggers exclusion from the United States—in a manner that is contrary to \n2  congressional intent and agency interpretation that has prevailed for nearly 70 \n3  years, and contrary to two 1996 federal statutes. \n4  2.  Since the late 19th century, federal immigration law has permitted \n5  the government to deny entry to any noncitizen “likely to become a public \n6  charge.”  From  colonial times  to the  present day,  “public  charge”  was  used \n7  consistently in American law to mean a pauper—that is, someone permanently \n8  and primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. Until the current \n9  Administration, the Department itself, its predecessor agency the Immigration \n10  and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. State \n11  Department have all adhered to the established definition of public charge. \n12  3.  The Rule departs from this original meaning by redefining a public \n13  charge as a noncitizen who receives common forms of federal and state public \n14  assistance, even in small amounts and for a short period of time. Never before \n15  has the Department considered in a public charge determination an immigrant’s \n16  receipt of non-cash public benefits for which they are legally eligible such as \n17  Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, public housing \n18  subsidies under the 1937 U.S. Housing Act, or Section 8 housing assistance. \n19  Under the Rule, however, participation in those benefits—which are commonly \n20  used by working families—would constitute a negative “heavily weighted factor” \n21  triggering a public charge determination. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.532   Page 10 of 185\n \n1  4.  People who receive those benefits are neither paupers nor primarily \n2  dependent on the government for subsistence. Over half of all non-elderly adults \n3  receiving Medicaid are employed, and almost 80% are from a home where at \n4  least  one  household  member  works.  Indeed,  more  than  20%  of  the  U.S. \n5  population participates in such benefits programs on average each month. Yet, \n6  under  the  Rule,  legally  present  immigrants’  participation  in  those  programs \n7  would block their path to citizenship under the public charge exclusion. \n8  5.  The  Public  Charge  Rule  is  contrary  to  law  and  arbitrary  and \n9  capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act for numerous reasons \n10  including: \n11  6.  First,  the  Department’s  new  definition  of  “public  charge”  is \n12  contrary to its longstanding meaning in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n13  Since its origin in colonial residency requirements and through its reception into \n14  state and then federal immigration laws, a “public charge” has been applied to \n15  mean a person primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The \n16  Department’s Rule is not a clarification of a well-established rule, but marks the \n17  rejection of the core principle underlying the long established unambiguous \n18  definition. \n19  7.  Second,  the  Personal  Responsibility  and  Work  Opportunity \n20  Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows many lawful immigrants to apply for public \n21  benefits  if  they  have  been  in  the  country  for  at  least  five  years.  The  Rule \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.533   Page 11 of 185\n \n1  eviscerates  Congress’s  intent  by  imposing  an  effective  “bait  and  \n2  switch”—punishing immigrants for using public benefits for which Congress \n3  itself made them eligible. The Rule is contrary to this statute, as well as several \n4  others. \n5  8.  Third, the Rule is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion \n6  because—among  other  reasons—it  reverses  a  decades-old,  consistent  policy \n7  without reasoned analysis, offers an explanation for the Rule that runs counter to \n8  the overwhelming weight of evidence before the Department, and disingenuously \n9  promotes as its purpose self-sufficiency in the immigrant population when, as \n10  abundantly  shown  by  the  administrative  record,  its  effect  is  precisely  the \n11  opposite. \n12  9.  The  radical  expansion  of  the public  charge  standard  will  cause \n13  irreparable harm to the working families and children who live in the Plaintiffs \n14  States, as well as the states themselves. The Rule will deter hundreds of thousands \n15  of noncitizens from utilizing essential public assistance programs for which they \n16  are legally eligible, so as not to jeopardize their hopes of becoming Americans. \n17  Those “chilling effects” are of two types.  \n18  10.  First,  the  Rule  will  deter  lawfully  present,  legally  eligible \n19  immigrants or their family members from participating in the enumerated “public \n20  benefit” programs. Many of these individuals will be forced into state emergency \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.534   Page 12 of 185\n \n1  programs—for example, many will be forced to obtain routine medical care in \n2  the far more expensive setting of state-funded emergency rooms. \n3  11.  Second, the Rule’s true impact sweeps more broadly by chilling \n4  immigrant families’ participation in state and local assistance programs that the \n5  Rule does not classify as public benefits in the public charge test. Out of both fear \n6  of the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant agenda and confusion over the \n7  byzantine  regulatory  scheme  that  the  Rule  would  create,  many  immigrant \n8  families will disenroll or forbear enrollment in all public benefit programs to \n9  avoid triggering the Department’s expansive and punitive public charge test. \n10  12.  Those chilling effects will lead to individuals and families forfeiting \n11  health insurance, medical care, nutrition assistance, and shelter not only for \n12  themselves but also for their entire households—including U.S. citizen adults and \n13  children. In Washington State alone, the state Medicaid agency projects that up \n14  to 140,000 families will lose health insurance, and State residents will forgo up \n15  to $198 million annually in medical care and up to $55 million annually in food \n16  and cash assistance. State and private hospitals will be forced to absorb the vastly \n17  more expensive uncompensated care, to the detriment of the State treasury.  \n18  13.  The resulting loss of economic activity will impose uncompensable \n19  social and economic costs on the Plaintiff States that the Department entirely fails \n20  to confront. Disenrollment and non-enrollment in health, nutrition, and other \n21  state-run assistance programs will make many working class immigrant families \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  5  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.535   Page 13 of 185\n \n1  less healthy, less productive, more reliant on state-covered emergency medical \n2  care, and more likely to experience economic dislocation and homelessness, \n3  which will result in increased strain on state agencies and programs. The broader \n4  chilling effects among all state-run assistance programs will undermine those \n5  programs’ administration and effectiveness. And direct costs to the States will \n6  result from immigrants who shift from federal programs to state programs that \n7  do not qualify as “public benefits” under the Rule. \n8  14.  In Washington State, for example, economic analysis points to the \n9  Rule reducing total economic output by up to $97.5 million annually, cutting \n10  wages by up to $36.7 million annually, and eliminating up to 782 jobs. Franklin \n11  County, less than five miles from where this Court sits and where, according to \n12  Census Bureau data, over half the population is Hispanic and over 15% legal \n13  noncitizen, will face particularly harsh increases in public costs and decreases in \n14  economic output as a result of the Rule. These consequences will be replicated \n15  across the Plaintiff States. \n16  15.  The Department’s expansive new public charge test applies to two \n17  groups of lawfully present non-citizens: immigrants such as visa-holders seeking \n18  to adjust to permanent resident status, and nonimmigrant visitors seeking to \n19  extend their visa or change their visa category. It would apply, for example, to:  \n20  •  An immigrant mother with a U.S. citizen spouse and U.S. \n21  citizen children who applies for lawful permanent residency. Even if she \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

If previously he had received Section 8 housing \n7  assistance vouchers for 12 months in any amount, upon his return to the \n8  United States six months later, he could be denied admission under the new \n9  public charge test, which applies to lawful permanent residents after a \n10  foreign trip longer than 180 days. Although a federal statute entitles this \n11  green card holder to receive federal, state, and local public benefits, the \n12  Rule would exclude him from the United States for taking advantage of his \n13  statutory right. \n14  •  And  an  immigrant  granted  entry  for  urgent  humanitarian \n15  reasons (a “humanitarian parolee”), who has two U.S. citizen children and \n16  files for permanent residency. If for just four months in the past three years \n17  she received Medicaid  coverage,  food stamps,  and  Section 8  housing \n18  assistance in any amounts, it could trigger a public charge determination \n19  and denial of her green card application because each separate benefit \n20  would count as an extra month towards the Rule’s 12-month threshold. \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Administration, unable to implement its restrictive immigration \n2  agenda through legislation, now attempts to implement its agenda through an \n3  administrative overhaul of immigration policy that cannot be squared with the \n4  terms of statutes duly enacted by Congress or with the United States Constitution. \n5  To avert irreparable injury to the Plaintiff States and their residents, the Plaintiff \n6  States bring this suit to vacate and set aside the Public Charge Rule.2 \n7  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8  17.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants pursuant to \n9  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Defendants are agencies and officers of the United \n10  States. \n11  18.  This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this lawsuit \n12  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under federal law. \n13  19.  Defendants’ publication of the Final Rule in the Federal Register on \n14  August 14, 2019, constitutes a final agency action and is therefore judicially \n15  reviewable within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 704, 706. \n16  20.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  Court  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § 1391(a) \n17  because this is a judicial district in which Plaintiff State of Washington resides, \n18  the Rule will adversely affect the health and welfare of residents in this district, \n19                                             \n20  2  This  Complaint  uses  the  terms  “immigrant”  and  “noncitizen” \n21  interchangeably to refer to a foreign national living in the United States, while \n22  the Rule generally refers to these individuals as “aliens.” \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  8  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  Plaintiff  States  bring  this  action  to  redress  harms  to  their \n14  sovereign, proprietary, and quasi-sovereign interests and their interests as parens \n15  patriae in protecting the health and well-being of their residents. The Plaintiff \n16  States are affected by the Public Charge Rule, are directly injured by it, and the \n17  relief requested will redress their injuries.3 \n18  37.  The power to create and enforce a legal code is a uniquely sovereign \n19  interest. The Plaintiff States have adopted health care programs as parts of their \n20  legal codes that operate to improve and protect the health of their residents. These \n21                                             \n22  3 A copy of the Final Rule is attached as Exhibit A.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  11  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The \n3  success and effectiveness of the Plaintiff States’ legislative health care programs \n4  will  be  significantly  undercut  by  the  Rule.  The  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign \n5  interests in enforcing their statutory codes and achieving their purposes are \n6  harmed by Defendants’ challenged action. \n7  38.  As a proprietor, a state is likely to have the same interests as other \n8  similarly  situated  proprietors.  The  Plaintiff  States  have  created  and  operate \n9  programs and institutions to promote and ensure the health, housing stability, \n10  nutrition and well-being of their residents. The success and effectiveness of these \n11  facilities  will  be  harmed  by  the  Rule.  The  Plaintiff  States’  proprietary  and \n12  financial interests in programs and institutions they paid for with state taxpayer \n13  funds, and which are managed by their employees and subcontractors are injured \n14  by the Rule. \n15  39.  A  state  has  a  quasi-sovereign  interest  in  the  health  and  \n16  well-being—both  physical  and  economic—of  its  residents  in  general.  The \n17  Plaintiff States’ have a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health, safety, \n18  and well-being of their residents. The Final Rule dissuades state residents from \n19  utilizing  the  benefits  of  the  Plaintiff  States’  benefits  programs.  It  therefore \n20  jeopardizes  the  health,  housing,  nutrition,  and  well-being  of  their  residents, \n21  citizen and noncitizen alike.  \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  12  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

HISTORY OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE EXCLUSION \n2  45.  The term “public charge” has an established meaning in American \n3  law that dates back to the 17th century. Since its origin in colonial residency \n4  requirements and through its reception into state and then federal immigration \n5  laws, a “public charge” has consistently meant a person primarily dependent on \n6  the government for subsistence. The Department’s Final Rule disregards that \n7  unambiguous, centuries-old definition. \n8  A.  Origins of Public Charge Exclusion in Colonial, State, and Federal \nStatutes \n9 \n46.  As early as the 1650s, the American colonies adopted “poor” laws \n10 \nrequiring each town to recognize its permanent residents’ claims for relief if they \n11 \nbecame destitute.5 Based on English models, colonial poor laws made the local \n12 \ngovernments responsible for supporting its poor residents, for whom the towns \n13 \ncared generously.6 At the same time, however, such laws permitted towns to \n14 \n15 \n16                                             \n17  5 Historians’ Cmt. at 2, DHS Notice of Proposed Rule “Inadmissibility on \n18  Public Charge Grounds,” FR 2018-21106 (Oct. 5, 2018) (Historians’ Cmt.); \n19  Gerald  L.

After the American Revolution, state governments came to play a \n3  greater role in administration of relief for the poor. When a person without a town \n4  “settlement” (or recognized residency right) fell into extreme need, he became a \n5  charge of the state or a “state pauper,” as distinguished from a “town pauper.”8 \n6  In each case, in its original public meaning, “public charge” was synonymous \n7  with “pauper.” \n8  48.  State measures against immigration of “foreign paupers” developed \n9  alongside the state poor laws of the early Republic. As European migration to the \n10  United States grew in the early 19th century, states enacted or expanded laws to \n11  “prevent the introduction of [p]aupers” at ports of entry as “liable to become \n12  chargeable,” i.e., public charges.9 For example, a New York statute prohibited \n13  landing of “any lunatic, idiot, deaf and dumb, blind or infirm persons . . . likely \n14                                             \n15  7  Historians’  Cmt.  at  2;  Shapiro  v.

Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down such state statutes \n4  under the Commerce Clause, ushering in the end of the era of state immigration \n5  laws.13 In their place, Congress enacted the Immigration Act of 1882, which \n6  borrowed from state laws in erecting a public charge ground of inadmissibility.14 \n7  The Act prohibited the landing of “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any other person \n8  unable  to  take  care  of  himself  .  .  .  without  becoming  a  public  charge.”15 \n9  Consistent  with  the  plain  text  and  historical  context,  the  legislative  history \n10  confirms  that  “public  charges”  were  those  living  in  “poor-houses  and \n11  alms-houses.”16 Indeed, in 1891, Congress amended the exclusion to preclude \n12  admission of “idiots, insane persons, paupers or persons likely to become a public \n13  charge.”17 \n14                                             \n15  12 City of Boston v.

Early Administrative and Judicial Precedent on Public Charge \n2  50.  Judicial and administrative decisions applying the federal public \n3  charge ground of inadmissibility interpreted the statute consistently with the \n4  original  public  meaning  of  the  term  “public  charge,”  namely,  as  a  person \n5  primarily and permanently dependent on the state for subsistence. \n6  51.  For example, in Gegiow v. Uhl, the U.S. Supreme Court read “public \n7  charge”  consistent  with  the  surrounding  statutory  categories  of  exclusions, \n8  including  “paupers  and  professional  beggars,  .  .  .  idiots,”  and  “persons \n9  dangerously diseased [or suffering from] . . . a physical defect of a nature to affect \n10  their ability to earn a living.”18 In a decision by Justice Holmes, the Court thus \n11  held that a public charge is excludable only “on the ground of permanent personal \n12 \n13                                             \n14  the present day. E.g., Immigration Act of 1903, § 2, 57th Cong. ch. 1012, 32 Stat. \n15  1213, 1214 (excluding from the United States “persons likely to become a public \n16  charge,” among others); Immigration Act of 1917, 64th Cong. Ch. 29, 39 Stat. \n17  874, 876 (same); Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 82nd Cong. ch. 477, \n18  66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952) (excluding noncitizens “who, in the opinion of the \n19  consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the \n20  Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time \n21  to become public charges”).     \n22  18 239 U.S. 3, 9–10 (1915). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  18  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Contemporaneous state court decisions are also consistent with that \n12  original public understanding of public charge, and expressly distinguished the \n13  mere receipt of “temporary relief” and a condition of permanent and primary \n14  dependency on the state. See, e.g., Davies v. State ex rel. Boyles, 27 Ohio C.C. \n15                                             \n16  19 Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10 (emphasis added).  \n17  20 Howe v. United States ex rel.

July 8, 1905) (“[P]ublic interests \n2  are subserved by the aiding of persons who might become a public charge, if left \n3  to their own resources, to such an extent that, by combining the small fund given \n4  them by the state with what they may be able to earn . . . they might be able to \n5  maintain themselves and avoid becoming a charge.”); Yeatman v. King, 51 N.W. \n6  721, 723 (1892) (emphasizing the “obligation” on the public “to keep a portion \n7  of the population destitute of means and credit from becoming a public charge by \n8  affording them temporary relief”).  \n9  53.  Federal  agencies  charged  with  enforcing  immigration  laws  also \n10  interpreted the public charge ground of inadmissibility in accordance with the \n11  settled meaning of the term. For example, in 1917, the Bureau of Immigration \n12  ruled that “moral perverts” were not “public charges” under the immigration \n13  laws, absent tangible proof of pauper status.23 \n14  54.  Consistent with this narrow understanding of public charge, early \n15  20th century immigration officials excluded on public charge grounds only a tiny \n16  fraction  of  arriving  immigrants.

In reenacting the federal public charge \n3  exclusion—which itself borrowed from earlier state laws—Congress adopted the \n4  settled  understanding  of  public  charge  and  ratified  the  judicial  precedents \n5  interpreting the term.27 In the 70 years since the INA’s enactment, numerous \n6  statutes and administrative decisions have comported with and confirmed the \n7  settled  meaning  of  public  charge  as  a  person  permanently  and  primarily \n8  dependent on government for survival. \n9  1.  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 \n10  56.  The INA overhauled federal immigration law, unifying previously \n11  scattered sections and adding new provisions in a statutory framework that exists \n12  to this day.28 Overriding President Truman’s veto, Congress declared its power \n13  to “provide for the elimination of undesirable aliens” and set forth numerous new \n14  categories  of  inadmissibility,  including  “anarchists,”  “Communist[s],”  or \n15  “affiliated with . . . any . . . totalitarian party.”29 \n16                                             \n17  26 Pub L. 82–414, 66 Stat. 163. \n18  27  Bragdon  v.

In  applying  the  modern  public  charge  exclusion,  federal \n8  immigration authorities considered the “totality of the alien’s circumstances,”31 \n9  including “economic factors” and “the alien’s physical and mental condition, as \n10  it affects ability to earn a living.”32 The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) \n11  held specifically that “[t]he fact that an alien has been on welfare does not, by \n12 \n13                                             \n14  30 66 Stat. 183, § 212(a)(15). \n15  31 In re Perez, 15 I. & N.

In 1989, DOJ issued a final rule establishing guidelines for public \n7  charge  determinations  in  various  contexts,  including  adjustment  to  lawful \n8  permanent resident status.35 In such determinations, the “financial responsibility \n9  of  the  alien  is  to  be  established  by  examining  the  totality  of  the  alien’s \n10  circumstances at the time of his or her application,” and the “existence or absence \n11  of a particular factor should never be the sole criteria for determining if an alien \n12  is  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.”36  The  determination  “should  be  a \n13  prospective evaluation based on the alien’s age, health, income, and vocation.”37 \n14  And even where an immigrant’s “income may be below the poverty level,” he is \n15                                             \n16  33 In re Perez, 15 I. & N.

Family unity and the Immigration Act of 1965 \n9  60.  To further the “well-established policy of maintaining family unity,” \n10  in 1921 Congress began expanding the categories of family members of citizens \n11  or lawful permanent residents who were eligible to seek admission or a green \n12  card through their relatives.40  \n13  61.  Building on that policy, the Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965 \n14  adopted  an  immigration  policy  designed  to  “first  reunite  families,”41  giving \n15 \n16 \n17                                             \n18  38 Id. § 245a.3(g)(4)(iii). \n19  39 Id. \n20  40 Revision of Immigration and Nationality Laws, S.

Current public charge legal framework \n6  62.  Congress  amended  the  INA  in  1990  to  drop  the  “paupers, \n7  professional beggars, or vagrants” exclusions, but retained the public-charge \n8  inadmissibility  ground.44  The  ranking  member  of  the  House  Judiciary \n9  Committee,  Representative  Hamilton  Fish  IV  (R-NY),  explained  that  in \n10  eliminating  the  “paupers,  professional  beggars,  or  vagrants”  inadmissibility \n11  ground, Congress was replacing an “antiquated” exclusion with  “one generic \n12  standard which exclude[s] aliens who are ‘likely to become a public charge.’ ”45 \n13  The legislative history to the 1990 Act indicates that Congress understood public \n14  charge consistent with the term’s original public meaning—for example, like a \n15 \n16                                             \n17  42 Pub.

That provision, INA Section 212(a)(4), is one of two public charge \n5  provisions in the INA. In its current form, Section 212(a)(4) provides that “[a]ny \n6  alien who, . . . in the opinion of the [Secretary of DHS] at the time of application \n7  for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public \n8  charge is inadmissible.”48 Under the INA, an application for “adjustment of \n9  status” means an application for lawful permanent residency (i.e., a green card).49 \n10  USCIS  is  the  agency  within  DHS  that  processes  applications  from  foreign \n11                                             \n12  46 Staff of the H.

The same INA provision also provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the \n5  opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa . . . is likely at \n6  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge  is  inadmissible.”51  This  public  charge \n7  exclusion  is  administered  by  U.S.  embassies  and  consulates  abroad,  which \n8  process  visa  applications  by  foreign  nationals  outside  the  Untied  States.52 \n9  Although the Secretary of State may “direct a consular officer to refuse a visa,”53 \n10  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 vests the DHS Secretary “exclusively with \n11  all  authorities  to  issue  regulations  . . .  relating  to  the  functions  of  consular \n12  officers . . . in connection with the granting or refusal of visas.”54  \n13  65.

The Immigration Reform Act is also important for what Congress \n12  did not do. The version of the law adopted by the House would have redefined \n13  “public charge” for deportability purposes in a manner strikingly similar to the \n14  Department’s new Rule. The unenacted bill defined “public charge” to “include[] \n15  any alien who receives [means-tested public] benefits for an aggregate period of \n16  at least 12 months.”61 Opponents of the new definition objected on the ground \n17  that it was “too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the same \n18 \n19                                             \n20  59 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \n21  60 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii), 1183a. \n22  61 H.R.

At no point did Congress ever indicate that it intended to alter the \n7  long-settled meaning of the term, “public charge.” Other than the codification of \n8  the totality of circumstances test, the INA has retained nearly identical language \n9  throughout its many amendments (the most recent in 2013).  \n10  5.  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 \n11  69.  The same year it enacted the Immigration Reform Act, Congress \n12  enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n13  1996 (Welfare Reform Act).65 Before 1996, lawfully present immigrants were \n14  generally eligible for public benefits on similar terms as U.S. citizens, provided \n15  they met the same means-tested eligibility criteria.

With  certain  exceptions,  non-qualified \n8  immigrants are ineligible for federal public benefits.68 \n9  70.  Qualified  immigrants,  however,  generally  may  be  eligible  for \n10  “federal means-tested public benefits” after five years of entry to the United \n11  States.69  Such  benefits  include  Medicaid,  TANF,  and  State  Child  Health \n12  Insurance Program (CHIP), and, with further limitations, food stamp benefits \n13  under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental \n14  Security Income (SSI).70 For certain “designated federal programs” (namely, \n15  TANF, social services block grants, and Medicaid), a “State is authorized to \n16                                             \n17  66 8 U.S.C. § 1641(b).  \n18  67 8 U.S.C. § 1641(b)–(c). \n19  68 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a). \n20  69 8 U.S.C. § 1613(a); Pimentel v.

State and local public benefits are less restricted under the Welfare \n3  Reform Act. Not only qualified immigrants, but also temporary, nonimmigrant \n4  visitors, are eligible for state and local public benefits.72 The Welfare Reform Act \n5  expressly authorizes each state to determine the eligibility for any state public \n6  benefits of any qualified alien or nonimmigrant.73 In addition, a state may provide \n7  by statute that “an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States is eligible \n8  for any State or local public benefit.”74 \n9  72.   In the wake of the Welfare Reform and Immigration Reform Acts, \n10  “public  confusion”  emerged  concerning  the  relationship  between  receipt  of \n11  federal,  state,  or  local  benefits  and  the  public  charge  provisions  of  federal \n12  immigration law.75 According to the U.S. Department of State, “such confusion \n13  led many persons in the immigrant community to choose not to sign up for \n14  important benefits, especially health-related benefits, which they were eligible to \n15 \n16                                             \n17  71 8 U.S.C. § 1612(b)(1). \n18  72 8 U.S.C. §§ 1621(a), 1622(a). \n19  73 8 U.S.C. § 1622(a). \n20  74 8 U.S.C. § 1621(d).  \n21  75 Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge \n22  Grounds, 64 Fed.

Agency guidance \n4  73.  To alleviate public confusion, INS (USCIS’s predecessor agency) \n5  issued a memorandum (Field Guidance) providing “new guidance on public \n6  charge  determinations  in  light  of  the  recent  changes  in  law.”77  The  Field \n7  Guidance defined a “public charge” as an immigrant who is “primarily dependent \n8                                             \n9  76 U.S. State Department Cable, INA 212(A)(4) Public Charge: Policy \n10  Guidance, Ref: 9 FAM 40.41 (hereinafter State Department cable). \n11  77 64 Fed. Reg. 28,690. On the same day it issued the Field Guidance, DOJ \n12  also  published  a  proposed  rule  adding  further  gloss  to  the  public  charge \n13  definition. See Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, \n14  64 Fed. Reg. 28,676 (May 26, 1999). That proposed rule observed that the \n15  “primary dependence model of public assistance was the backdrop against which \n16  the ‘public charge’ concept in immigration law developed in the late 1800s,” and \n17  “[h]istorically,  individuals  who became  dependent  on  the  Government  were \n18  institutionalized in asylums or placed in ‘almshouses’ . . . long before the array \n19  of  limited-purpose  public  benefits  now  available  existed.”  Id.  at  28,677. \n20  Although DOJ never published a final public charge rule, the Field Guidance’s \n21  public charge definition and policies were “adopt[ed] . . . immediately” and have \n22  guided DOJ—and, later, DHS—policy ever since. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

That definition was not a product of INS’s administrative discretion, \n5  but rather a direct application of the traditional, established meaning of the term \n6  “public charge.” As INS explained in a separate regulation it proposed alongside \n7  the Field Guidance, it based its definition on “the plain meaning of the word \n8  ‘charge’” and “the historical context of public dependency when the public \n9  charge immigration provisions were first adopted more than a century ago.”79 \n10  The ordinary meaning of the word “charge,” as used in the INA, is “a person or \n11  thing committed or entrusted to the care, custody, management, or support of \n12  another”—in the case of a public charge, to the government.80 Because a person \n13  who receives only supplemental public assistance is not “committed” to the \n14  government’s “care” or “custody,” INS concluded that the term “public charge” \n15  encompasses only instances of “complete, or nearly complete, dependence on the \n16  Government  rather  than  the  mere  receipt  of  some  lesser  level  of  financial \n17 \n18                                             \n19  78 64 Fed.

The  Field  Guidance  instructed  that  consular  and  immigration \n6  “officers should not place any weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits” \n7  other than long-term institutionalization.83 INS explained that because “non-cash \n8  benefits . . . are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in combination, \n9  provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family,” participation in \n10  such programs “is not evidence of poverty or dependence.”84 Among the list of \n11  benefits that should not be considered for public-charge purposes, the Field \n12  Guidance  expressly  listed  “Medicaid  and  other  health  insurance  and  health \n13  services,” CHIP, “[n]utrition programs,” and [h]ousing benefits.”85 Finally, the \n14  Field Guidance made clear that it was designed to address “adverse impact . . . on \n15  public health and the general welfare” caused by confusion over the public charge \n16  standard—namely,  that  it  had  “deterred  eligible  aliens  and  their  families, \n17                                             \n18  81 Id. \n19  82 64 Fed.

In sum, the Field Guidance embraced the traditional understanding \n4  of  a  public  charge  as  a  person  permanently  and  primarily  dependent  on \n5  government  for  subsistence.  That  definition  has  guided  the  government’s \n6  application  of  federal  immigration  law’s  public  charge  provisions  for  20  \n7  years—since  the  end  of  the  Clinton  Administration,  and  through  the  entire \n8  George  W.  Bush  and  Obama  Administrations,  and  even  through  the \n9  reorganization of the agencies responsible for enforcing the INA. \n10  77.  In 2009, DOJ issued a Public Charge Fact Sheet (DOJ Fact Sheet), \n11  which confirmed the Field Guidance’s definition of “public charge” to mean “an \n12  individual who is likely to become ‘primarily dependent on the government for \n13  subsistence.’ ”87 The DOJ Fact sheet reiterated that “a number of factors must be \n14  considered,” in the public charge determination, “including age, health, family \n15  status, assets, resources, financial status, education, and skills.”88 It also made \n16 \n17                                             \n18  86 64 Fed.

The DOJ Fact Sheet echoed the Field Guidance rule that a public \n4  charge  determination  may  not  be  based  on  “non-cash  benefits  and \n5  special-purpose cash benefits that are not intended for income maintenance.” \n6  Further reflecting the understanding of a public charge as someone permanently \n7  and  primarily  dependent  on  government  for  survival,  the  DOJ  Fact  Sheet \n8  specifically identified the following public benefit programs as irrelevant to a \n9  public charge determination:  \n10  •  Medicaid and other health insurance and health services other \n11  than support for long-term institutional care; \n12  •  Nutrition  programs,  including  SNAP,  the  Special \n13  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), \n14  the  National  School  Lunch  and  School  Breakfast  Program,  and  other \n15  supplementary and emergency food assistance programs; \n16  •  Housing benefits; \n17  •  Child care services; \n18  •  Job training programs; and \n19  •  Non-cash benefits under TANF such as subsidized child care \n20  or transit subsidies. \n21                                             \n22  89 Id. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  38  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The DOJ Fact Sheet further provided that while acceptance of “cash \n2  assistance for income maintenance”—including SSI, TANF, or local cash general \n3  assistance programs—could be considered in the public charge determination, \n4  “the mere receipt of these benefits does not automatically make an individual \n5  inadmissible”  or  “ineligible  to  adjust  status  to  lawful  permanent  resident.” \n6  Rather, “each determination is made on a case-by-case basis in the context of the \n7  totality of the circumstances.” \n8  80.  In 2011, USCIS issued its own Public Charge Fact Sheet (USCIS \n9  Fact Sheet) which affirmed that many common public benefits are not considered \n10  in  making  a  public  charge  inadmissibility  determination.90  Those  benefits \n11  included Medicaid and other health insurance and health services assistance \n12  (other than support for long-term care); CHIP; nutrition programs, such as food \n13  stamps;  housing  benefits;  child  care  services;  energy  assistance;  emergency \n14  disaster relief; foster care and adoption assistance; educational assistance; job \n15  training programs; non-cash benefits under TANF; community-based programs \n16  or services; and unemployment compensation. \n17  81.  Although the USCIS Fact Sheet explained certain cash assistance \n18  programs could be considered in a public charge determination, receiving such \n19  benefits could not, in and of itself, render an immigrant inadmissible on public \n20  charge grounds. Rather, every public charge determination, USCIS confirmed, \n21                                             \n22  90 Public Charge Fact Sheet, USCIS., Apr. 29, 2011.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  39  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In  sum,  from  the  colonial  era  through  115  Congresses  and  44 \n4  presidential administrations, American law uniformly interpreted and applied the \n5  term “public charge” to mean a “pauper” or a person permanently and “primarily \n6  dependent on the government for subsistence.” Specifically, federal agencies \n7  reached  consensus  that  an  immigrant’s  past  receipt  of  non-cash  public  \n8  benefits—such as health, nutrition, or housing assistance, all of which bolster \n9  overall  public  health  and  economic  growth—should  not  be  considered  for \n10  purposes of the public charge exclusion. The Department’s Public Charge Rule \n11  rejects  that  consensus,  defying  the  original  meaning  of  public  charge  and \n12  substituting its own definition and criteria that cannot be reconciled with statutory \n13  text, history, or precedent. \n14  V.  THE DEPARTMENT’S PUBLIC CHARGE RULE \n15  83.  During the 2016 campaign, President Trump ran on a platform to \n16  radically transform U.S. immigration policy. \n17  84.  Having failed to secure passage of any immigration legislation, the \n18  Trump  Administration  promulgated  the  Public  Charge  Rule  to  circumvent \n19  Congress and implement the President’s anti-immigration agenda through the \n20  regulatory backdoor. In issuing the Rule, the Department ignored hundreds of \n21  thousands  of  public  comments  warning  of  its  significant  costs  to  working \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  40  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Trump Administration’s Anti-Immigration Agenda \n5  85.  As a candidate and in office, President Trump endorsed significant \n6  cuts to legal immigration and challenged the centrality of family reunification to \n7  federal immigration policy. The official White House website states that “the \n8  President supports ending chain migration, eliminating the Visa Lottery, and \n9  moving  the  country  to  a  merit-based  entry  system.”91  President  Trump  has \n10  repeatedly  expressed  disapproval  of  family-based  immigration  preferences.92 \n11                                             \n12  91  White  House,  Immigration,  https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/ \n13  immigration/ (last visited July 27, 2019). \n14  92 President Trump has referred to family-based immigration with the \n15  derogatory term “chain migration,” calling it a “disaster” and falsely claiming \n16  that it allows citizens to bring in relatives who are “15 times removed.” Meghan \n17  Keneally, 8 Times Trump Slammed “Chain Migration” Before It Apparently \n18  Helped  His  Wife’s  Parents  Become  Citizens,  ABC  News  (Aug.  10,  2018), \n19  https://abcnews.go.com/US/times-trump-slammed-chain-migration-apparently-\n20  helped-wifes/story?id=57132429.

Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the \n5  media obtained a draft of an “Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources \n6  by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote Accountability and Responsibility.” \n7  The draft Executive Order instructed DHS to “rescind any field guidance” and \n8  “propose for notice and comment a rule that provides standards for determining \n9  which aliens are admissible or deportable on public charge grounds,” including \n10 \n11 \n12                                             \n13  He has called immigrants who arrive pursuant to family preferences “the opposite \n14  of [origin countries’] finest,” “truly EVIL,” and “not the people that we want.” \n15  Jessica Kwong, Donald Trump Says ‘Chain Migration’ Immigrants ‘Are Not the \n16  People That We Want’—That Includes Melania’s Parents, Newsweek (Jan. 14, \n17  2019),  https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-chain-migration-immigrants-\n18  melania-1291210.    \n19  93 Jie Zong et al., Frequently Requested Statistics on Immigrants and \n20  Immigration  in  the  United  States,  Migration  Policy  Institute, \n21  https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-\n22  immigrants-and-immigration-united-states (last updated July 10, 2019).   \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  42  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In 2017, two U.S. senators introduced a bill designed to significantly \n4  reduce  legal  immigration  by,  for  example,  curbing  the  government’s \n5  long-established policy favoring family reunification. The Reforming American \n6  Immigration  for  a  Strong  Economy  (RAISE)  Act  would  have  given  visa \n7  preference only to immediate family and eliminated the diversity visa lottery, \n8  which allots a limited number of visas to countries with historically low rates of \n9  immigration to the United States.95 It also proposed a “merit-based immigration \n10  system,” which gives preference to immigrants between the ages of 26 and 30, \n11  with doctoral degrees, high English proficiency, and a job offer with a high \n12  salary. The RAISE Act would have precluded parents of adult U.S. citizens from \n13  applying for Legal Permanent Resident status and, if they entered as temporary \n14 \n15                                             \n16  94 See Memorandum from Andrew Bremberg Regarding Executive Order \n17  on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote \n18  Accountability  and  Responsibility  (Jan.  23,  2017),  https://cdn3.vox-\n19  cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7872571/Protecting_Taxpayer_Resources_b\n20  y_Ensuring_Our_Immigration_Laws_Promote_Accountability_and_Responsibi\n21  lity.0.pdf.  \n22  95 S.B. 354, 115th Cong., 1st sess.

They’re not going to come in and just \n6  immediately go and collect welfare.” The White House also asserted falsely that \n7  “[m]ore than 50 percent of all immigrant households receive welfare benefits, \n8  compared to only 30 percent of native households in the United States that \n9  receive welfare benefits.”98 In fact, immigrants are less likely to consume public \n10  assistance benefits than native-born Americans and, when they do, they generally \n11  consume a lower dollar value of benefits. Overall, immigrants consume 27% \n12  fewer benefits on average than native-born Americans with similar incomes and \n13  ages.99 \n14                                             \n15  96 Id. § 4(d)(2)(B).  \n16  97 White House, Fact Sheets, President Donald J.

In June 2017, shortly before announcing his support for the RAISE \n2  Act, President Trump received a briefing on immigration from White House \n3  senior adviser Stephen Miller. (Miller, an ardent supporter of the Public Charge \n4  Rule, had reportedly once told a former White House communications aide, \n5  “I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever touched American soil.”100) \n6  At the briefing, after learning that 15,000 Haitians had received U.S. visas in \n7  2017, President Trump replied that they “all have AIDS.” When President Trump \n8  learned that 40,000 Nigerians had received visas, he said that they would never \n9  “go back to their huts.”101 \n10  90.  Defendant Cuccinelli has expressed similar sentiments. In a 2012 \n11  interview, Cuccinelli compared U.S. immigration policy to local laws governing \n12  treatment of rats, stating that a District of Columbia law prohibiting killing of rats \n13  or separating rat families is “worse than our immigration policy—you can’t break \n14  up rat families. Or raccoons or all the rest and you can’t even kill them.

In  reference  to  the  deal’s \n3  protections for immigrants from Haiti and Africa, President Trump asked why he \n4  should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” rather than from nations like \n5  “Norway.”108 \n6  93.  A detailed draft of DHS’s proposed public charge rule was leaked \n7  in March 2018. Under the draft proposed rule, new criteria would be considered \n8  as heavily weighted negative factors in public charge determinations, including \n9  whether  an  immigrant  has  received  non-cash  benefits  regardless  of  the \n10  immigrant’s legal entitlement to participate in the benefit program.109  \n11  94.  In spring 2018, shortly after the draft rule leaked, DHS informed the \n12  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  that  it  “will  propose  regulatory \n13  provisions guiding the inadmissibility determination on whether an alien is likely \n14                                             \n15  108 Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Sheryl Gay Stolberg & Thomas Kaplan, Trump \n16  Alarms Lawmakers With Disparaging Words for Haiti and Africa, N.Y.

The Department’s Proposed Public Charge Rule \n2  99.  On  October  10,  2018,  DHS  published  a  notice  of  proposed \n3  rulemaking and proposed rule entitled Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds \n4  (the Proposed Rule).118 The Proposed Rule sought to significantly expand the \n5  authority of the USCIS to designate an immigrant as inadmissible on the ground \n6  that he or she is likely to become a “public charge,” far beyond the long-settled \n7  meaning of the term and its prior application in the history of U.S. immigration \n8  law. \n9  100.  The Proposed Rule redefined the term “public charge” to mean “an \n10  alien who receives one or more public benefit[s].”119 The Proposed Rule defined \n11  “public benefit” to include not only a wide range of federal, state, local, or tribal \n12  cash benefits but also, in a reversal of decades of past practice and precedent, \n13  specific  federally-funded  non-cash  benefits—namely  SSI,  SNAP,  Section  8 \n14  housing assistance, and Medicaid.120 \n15                                             \n16  118 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n17  Security, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed.

In  fact,  the  Department’s  Final  Rule  allowing  consideration  of \n2  SNAP  benefits  is  directly  contrary  to  existing  federal  law  governing  those \n3  programs.121 \n4  102.  The Proposed Rule would have required DHS in making a public \n5  charge determination to consider the immigrant’s “past receipt of public benefits” \n6  above  certain  thresholds  as  a  “heavily  weighed  negative  factor”  favoring \n7  exclusion.122 The Proposed Rule’s thresholds differed based on whether the \n8  benefit was “monetizable” or “non-monetizable.” \n9  103.  For “monetizable” benefits such as SNAP or TANF, the Proposed \n10  Rule imposed a dollar-value and durational threshold: it would have weighed \n11  heavily against an immigrant’s application if, within any one-year period, the \n12  amount  of  public  benefits  received  exceeds  15%  of  the  Federal  Poverty \n13  Guidelines  (FPG)  for  a  household  of  one  (the  15%  threshold).123  For \n14  non-monetizable benefits such as Medicaid and subsidized housing, the Proposed \n15  Rule set a purely durational threshold: the heavily weighed negative factor would \n16  apply whenever an immigrant received such benefits for 12 months total in any \n17 \n18 \n19                                             \n20  121 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n21  122 83 Fed.

Any amount of cash assistance for income maintenance could be \n4  considered  as  a  negative  factor  favoring  exclusion  (though  not  “heavily \n5  weighed”) under the Proposed Rule.125 However, it would not have permitted the \n6  Department to consider at all an immigrant’s receipt of non-cash public benefits \n7  below the applicable durational or dollar-value thresholds.  \n8  105.  The Proposed Rule also sought to extend the public charge test into \n9  two areas not provided by statute—noncitizens’ applications for (1) extension of \n10  stay,  and  (2)  change  of  status.  Under  the  Proposed  Rule,  as  a  mandatory \n11  “condition of approval,” a noncitizen would have had to “demonstrate” that since \n12  obtaining the nonimmigrant status she seeks to change or extend she has not \n13  received, nor “is likely to receive,” a public benefit.126 \n14  106.  The Department acknowledged that it had issued the Proposed Rule \n15  despite “anticipat[ing] that a number of individuals would be likely to disenroll \n16  or forego enrollment in a number of public benefits program as a result of the \n17                                             \n18  124 83 Fed.

During the 60-day comment period, the Department received over \n12  260,000 comments on the Proposed Rule. The vast majority of those public \n13  comments  opposed  the  Proposed  Rule.  Many  comments  focused  on  the \n14  significant hardships the Proposed Rule would cause by deterring individuals and \n15  families—immigrants,  nonimmigrant  visitors,  and  U.S.  citizens  alike—from \n16  accessing public benefits for which they are eligible.

In addition to joining the Multistate Comment, Plaintiff State of \n6  Washington submitted its own comment letter opposing the Proposed Rule (the \n7  Washington  Comment).  Signed  by  Washington’s  Governor  and  Attorney \n8  General, as well as the Mayor of Seattle, the Washington Comment urged the \n9  Department to withdraw the Proposed Rule because, if adopted, it “will gravely \n10  harm Washingtonians, causing children in our State—noncitizens and citizens \n11  alike—to forfeit meals, health insurance and a roof over their heads.”136 The \n12  Washington Comment projected that the Proposed Rule would (1) cause “[o]ver \n13  140,000  Washington  residents  [to]  lose  health  insurance”;  (2)  cause \n14  Washingtonians to forgo up to $55.3 million in State food and cash benefits and \n15  $198.7 million in medical care annually; (3) reduce total state economic output \n16                                             \n17  134 Multistate Cmt. at 11. \n18  135 Multistate Cmt. at 2.  \n19  136 Comment of Governor Jay Inslee, Attorney General Bob Ferguson, and \n20  Mayor  Jenny  Durkan  re  DHS  Dkt.

On \n6  July 24, 2019, a coalition of 17 states, including the Plaintiff States, requested a \n7  meeting with OIRA—both through the OIRA online E.O. 12866 meeting request \n8  system and via letter transmitted by e-mail—to further express their “significant \n9  concerns about the severe impact that [the public charge] rule would have on our \n10  states’ residents.” Although OIRA held at least four E.O. 12,866 meetings on \n11  July 25, 2019, for a full week the Plaintiff States’ July 24 meeting request \n12  received no response from OIRA.143 \n13  115.

The Final Rule \n4  116.  On August 12, 2019, the Department announced the issuance of the \n5  Final Public Charge Rule and it was posted for public inspection. In a press \n6  conference at the White House, Acting USCIS Director Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II \n7  stated that in promulgating “President Trump’s public charge inadmissibility \n8  rule,”  the  Department  was  “promoting  our  shared  history”  and \n9  “implement[ing] . . . a law passed by Congress in 1996 that has not been given \n10  meaningful effect.”145 Asked about the 1903 plaque on the Statue of Liberty that \n11  invites  “your  tired, your  poor,  your  huddled  masses,”  Cuccinelli  said:  “I’m \n12  certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statute of Liberty.” \n13  117.  In response to questions about the Rule, Cuccinelli publicly stated \n14  that the famous Emma Lazarus Statue of Liberty sonnet inscribed on the Statue \n15  of Liberty “was referring back to people coming from Europe where they had \n16  class-based societies” not to people coming to the United States from outside \n17  Europe. He also reinterpreted it to “[g]ive me your tired and your poor who can \n18 \n19                                             \n20  145  Cuccinelli  on  “public  charge”  immigration  rule,  CBS  News, \n21  Aug. 12, 2019,  https://www.cbsnews.com/video/immigration-official-ken-\n22  cuccinelli-immigrants-public-charge-rule/. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  60  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

On August 14, 2019, the Department published the Final Rule in the \n8  Federal Register.149 \n9  1.  Summary of the Final Rule \n10 \na.  Applicability of the Rule \n11  119.  The Public Charge Rule applies to any noncitizen subject to section \n12  212(a)(4) of the INA who, after the October 15, 2019 effective date, applies to \n13                                             \n14  146 Rebecca Morin, Immigration official Ken Cuccinelli: Statue of Liberty \n15  poem refers to immigrants from Europe, USA Today Aug. 13, 2019. \n16  147 Sasha Ingber and Rachel Martin, Immigration Chief: ‘Give Me Your \n17  Tired, Your Poor Who Can Stand On Their Own 2 Feet’, Nat’l Pub.

Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.591   Page 69 of 185\n \n1  the Department for admission to the United States or for adjustment of status to \n2  that of lawful permanent resident.150 The Rule catalogues a list of immigrant \n3  groups that are exempted from its provisions, based on preexisting exemptions \n4  created by Congress or DHS regulations. These include, for example, refugees \n5  and asylees, certain Afghan or Iraqi nationals employed by or on behalf of the \n6  U.S. government, and certain Cuban and Haitian entrants. See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n7  41,504 (proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.23). \n8  120.  The Rule also applies to requests for extension of stay and change \n9  of status by nonimmigrant visitors to the United States. A nonimmigrant is \n10  generally admitted into the United States for a limited period and for a particular \n11  purpose. Section 212(a)(4) does not apply to an extension of stay or change of \n12  status. Nevertheless, the Department asserts authority to apply its expanded \n13  public charge provisions to a nonimmigrant’s application to extend his or her \n14  status or change it from one classification to another.151 \n15  b.  Definitions of “public charge” and “public benefit” \n16  121.  The Rule defines “public charge” to mean “an alien who receives \n17  one or more public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \n18 \n19 \n20                                             \n21  150 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.20). \n22  151 See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,507-08, (proposed 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1, 248.1). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  62  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.592   Page 70 of 185\n \n1  any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month \n2  counts as two months).” \n3  122.  “Public benefit” means any of the following six forms of public \n4  assistance: (1) “[a]ny Federal state, local or tribal cash assistance for income \n5  maintenance,” including SSI, TANF, or state “General Assistance”; (2) SNAP; \n6  (3) Section 8 housing assistance vouchers; (4) Section 8 project-based rental \n7  assistance; (5) Medicaid (with exceptions for benefits or services (i) for an \n8  emergency  medical  condition,  (ii)  under  the  Individuals  with  Disabilities \n9  Education Act, (iii) that are school-based, (iv) to immigrants who are under 21 \n10  years of age or a woman during pregnancy); and (6) public housing under section \n11  9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.152 \n12  123.  In several respects, those core definitions are even more draconian \n13  than the corresponding provisions of the Proposed Rule. First, the Department \n14  eliminated  the  Proposed  Rule’s  distinction  between  monetizable  and \n15  non-monetizable  benefits.  While  the  Proposed  Rule  would  have  considered \n16  monetizable benefits received only if they exceeded 15% threshold, in the Final \n17  Rule the Department applies the 12-month threshold to all public benefits. Thus, \n18  any amount of benefits received for a total of 12 months in the aggregate in a \n19  36-month period as a factor weighing “heavily” in favor of a public charge \n20 \n21                                             \n22  152 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8. C.F.R.§ 212.21(b)). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  63  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.593   Page 71 of 185\n \n1  determination.153 An additional benefit counts as an extra month, such that receipt \n2  of two benefits triggers the threshold after six months; three benefits, after four \n3  months; and four benefits, after just three months.  \n4  124.  Second, the Final Rule permits the Department to consider as a \n5  negative  factor  favoring  a  public  charge  determination  any  past  receipt  of \n6  non-cash public benefits, even if below the 12-month threshold.154 The Proposed \n7  Rule  would  have  only  permitted  consideration  of  cash  benefits  below  the \n8  applicable thresholds. \n9  c.  Heavily weighted negative factors \n10  125.  The Rule establishes four factors that will “generally weigh heavily \n11  in favor of a finding that an alien is likely to become a public charge.” \n12  126.  First, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the immigrant “is \n13  not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is unable to demonstrate \n14  current employment, recent employment history or no reasonable prospect of \n15  future employment.”155 \n16  127.  Second, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the immigrant \n17  “has received or has been certified or approved to receive one or more public \n18  benefits, as defined in § 212.21(b), for more than 12 months in the aggregate \n19                                             \n20  153 84 Fed.

Third, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if an immigrant both \n6  (a) “has  been  diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  that  is  likely  to  require \n7  extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with the \n8  alien’s ability to provide for him- or herself, attend school, or work”; and (b) “is \n9  uninsured and has neither the prospect of obtaining private health insurance, or \n10  the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to \n11  a the medical condition.”157 \n12  129.  Fourth, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the “alien had \n13  previously been found inadmissible or deportable on public charge grounds by \n14  an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals.”158 \n15  d.  Heavily weighted positive factors \n16  130.  The Rule establishes three factors that “will generally weigh heavily \n17  in favor of a finding that an alien is not likely to become a public charge.” First, \n18  it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the noncitizen’s “household has \n19                                             \n20  156 84 Fed.

Second, it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the “alien is \n4  authorized to work and is currently employed in a legal industry with an annual \n5  income . . . of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for the \n6  alien’s household size.”160 \n7  132.  Third, it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the “alien has \n8  private  health  insurance”  that  is  “appropriate  for  the  expected  period  of \n9  admission,” except health insurance for which an immigrant receives premium \n10  tax credits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).161  \n11  e.  Other criteria \n12  133.  The Rule requires DHS to consider various other criteria in any \n13  public charge determination. Those other criteria that will weigh in favor of a \n14  public charge determination include whether the immigrant: (1) is under the age \n15  of 18 or over the minimum early retirement age for Social Security (currently age \n16  62); (2) has a “medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \n17  treatment or institutionalization” or “interfere with [his] ability to provide and \n18  care for himself,” to “attend school,” or “to work”; (3) has an annual household \n19                                             \n20  159 84 Fed.

Under the Rule, the Department must also consider any required \n15  affidavit of support meeting the statutory sponsorship and income requirements. \n16  But an affidavit of support would not be dispositive, and its weight would depend \n17  on the “likelihood that the sponsor would actually provide the statutorily-required \n18  amount of financial support” in the judgment of USCIS.163 Again, this is a major \n19  departure from prior agency practice and precedent, which had long treated a \n20                                             \n21  162 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,502-04 (to be codified at 8. C.F.R.§ 212.22(b)). \n22  163 84 Fed.

Other provisions \n4  135.  The Rule would apply a more exacting standard to applications for \n5  adjustment  of  status  or  immigrant  visas  than  to  applications  for  temporary \n6  nonimmigrant visas. Specifically, USCIS would consider the “immigration status \n7  that the alien seeks and the expected period of admission as it relates to the alien’s \n8  ability to financially support for [sic] himself or herself during the duration of the \n9  alien’s stay.”165 \n10  136.  The  Rule  also  authorizes  the  Department  to  allow  a  lawful \n11  permanent resident applicant determined likely to become a public charge to \n12  submit a “public charge bond” as a condition of his or her green card approval. \n13  The decision to allow a public charge bond is discretionary, but the Department \n14  “generally will not favorably exercise discretion” if at least one heavily weighed \n15  negative factors applies. The amount of the bond must be at least $8,100, which \n16  is breached in full if the applicant receives any public benefits for more than 12 \n17  months in the aggregate within any 36-month period after becoming a lawful \n18  permanent resident.166 \n19                                             \n20  164 83 Fed.

Like the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule also imposes additional \n2  requirements on nonimmigrants applying for a change of status or an extension \n3  of stay, though the INA’s public charge exclusion applies in neither situation. \n4  The Rule provides that such applications will be denied unless the applicant \n5  demonstrates that he or she has not received public benefits since obtaining the \n6  nonimmigrant status that he is seeking to extend or change for 12 months total \n7  within a 36-month period.167 Unlike the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule does not \n8  require or permit consideration of whether a nonimmigrant applicant for change \n9  of status or extension of stay is “likely to receive public benefits” in the future.  \n10 \n2.  The Department’s failure to provide reasoned analysis, \nexamine relevant data, or address public comments’ significant \n11  concerns \n12  138.  As mentioned above, the Department received more than 260,000 \n13  public comments on the Proposed Rule, the “vast majority” in opposition.168 The \n14  public comments raised significant concerns regarding the legality and impact of \n15  the Department’s radical proposed transformation of the public charge exclusion. \n16  In the preamble to the Final Rule, the Department failed to provide reasoned \n17  analysis,  examine  the  relevant  data,  or  adequately  address  the  significant \n18  concerns raised in the public comments.  \n19                                             \n20  167 84 Fed.

Definition of public charge \n2  139.  First and foremost, the Department failed to account for its decision \n3  to redefine the term public charge in a manner inconsistent with the historical \n4  understanding of public charge, Congressional intent, and more than a century of \n5  judicial and administrative precedent. In response, the Department asserted that \n6  the  Rule  interprets  “ambiguous  terms  that  Congress  itself  left  undefined,” \n7  offering the ipse dixit that it “believes that its definition with what it means to be \n8  a public charge.”169 \n9  b.  The 12-month public benefit threshold \n10  140.  Many commenters criticized the Proposed Rule’s thresholds for \n11  consideration  of  public  benefits  as  arbitrary.  Under  the  Proposed  Rule, \n12  monetizable  public  benefits  would  weigh  in  favor  of  a  public  charge \n13  determination  if  they  exceeded  15%  of  FPG  in  a  12-month  period,  while \n14  non-monetizable benefits would be a negative factor if received for 12 months \n15  within a 36-month period. Commenters noted that the Department had provided \n16  no data to support its 15% threshold, which would have considered the receipt of \n17  just $150 per month (or $5 per day) in benefits as a heavily weighted factor \n18  favoring  a  public  charge  finding.  Commenters  also  criticized  the  12-month \n19  standard for non-monetizable benefits as arbitrary and irrational, particularly \n20 \n21                                             \n22  169 84 Fed.

Implicitly acknowledging the arbitrariness of the 15% threshold, the \n4  Department correctly abandoned it in the Final Rule—but only to adopt the \n5  flawed 12-month threshold for monetizable benefits as well. Under the Rule’s \n6  public charge test, the receipt of any public benefit—monetizable or not—for 12 \n7  or  more  months  in a  36-month period would  constitute  a heavily  weighted \n8  negative factor. Each additional benefit received in the same period would count \n9  as  an  additional  month,  such  that  just  three  months  of  Medicaid,  housing \n10  vouchers, food stamps, and income assistance could result in a public charge \n11  finding—no  matter  how  small  the  actual  dollar  value  of  the  benefits.  The \n12  Department acknowledged that by ignoring the value of benefits received, its \n13  12-month  threshold  could  result  in  a  public  charge  finding  based  on  an \n14  immigrant’s receipt of “only hundreds of dollars or less in public benefits.” The \n15  Department  did not provide  a  reasoned explanation  to  justify  the  12-month \n16  threshold’s “incongruities.”170  \n17  142.  Indeed, the only justification the Department provided for adopting \n18  this strict 12-month threshold for all public benefits is that it is “simpler and more \n19  administrable” than its 15% of FPG threshold.171 But just because a regulation is \n20                                             \n21  17084 Fed.

The Department fails to \n2  provide  data,  evidence,  or  reasoned  analysis  to  explain  why  it  believes  an \n3  immigrant’s past receipt of public assistance for as little as a few months is at all \n4  predictive  of  whether  she  will  become  a  public  charge  in  the  future.  The \n5  Department cited a Census Bureau study finding that 31.2% of participants in \n6  “one or more means-tested assistance programs” ended their participation within \n7  a year, ignoring that many of those participants may have received more than one \n8  benefit program—rendering the study entirely irrelevant to the Rule’s 12-month \n9  threshold.172  As  the  Department’s  own  analysis  reveals,  of  individuals  who \n10  receive the enumerated public benefits, “at least nearly 35 percent received two \n11  or more public benefits on average per month.”173 The Department’s decision to \n12  aggregate multiple benefits in the 12-month threshold overlooks its own findings \n13  on how beneficiaries utilize temporary public assistance in actual practice.   \n14  c.   Heavily weighted negative factors \n15  143.  The Department received multiple comments criticizing the use of \n16  “heavily weighted factors” (or “weighed,” in the Proposed Rule’s terminology), \n17  separate  from  the  enumerated  considerations  that  Congress  mandated  the \n18  Department  to  consider  in  the  totality  of  circumstances  test  codified  in  the \n19  Immigration  Reform  Act.

In  particular,  the  public  benefit  factor  is  likely  to  be \n8  outcome-determinative in most cases. That factor weighs heavily in a public \n9  charge determination if an immigrant receives one or more public benefits for 12 \n10  months total within a 36-month period. The Department asserts that the factor \n11  “will  not  necessarily  be  dispositive  in  the  inadmissibility  determination,” \n12  overlooking that whenever it applies, at least one other enumerated negative \n13  factor will always also apply. That is so because the Rule requires consideration \n14  of evidence that the immigrant has “applied for,” “received,” or “been certified \n15  or  approved  to  receive”  any  public  benefits.175  Furthermore,  because  the \n16  enumerated public benefits are all means-tested, the vast majority of recipients \n17  will also have an annual income below 125 percent of FPG, which would itself \n18  also “generally be a heavily weighed negative factor.”176  \n19                                             \n20  174 84 Fed.

So  too,  is  the  medical  condition  negative  factor  likely  to  be \n2  dispositive. That heavily weighted factor is triggered where an applicant (1) has \n3  a  medical  condition  “likely  to  require  extensive  medical  treatment  or \n4  institutionalization” and is (2) both uninsured and has neither the prospect of \n5  obtaining private health insurance nor the resources to pay for medical costs.177 \n6  That standard is literally duplicative with the ostensibly separate “health” factor, \n7  which weighs in favor of a public charge determination when an “alien has been \n8  diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \n9  treatment or institutionalization.”178 And a person who meets that standard is also \n10  likely to fail under the “assets, resources, and financial status factor,” which \n11  considers whether he has “sufficient household assets and resources to cover any \n12  reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”179 Here again, the Department stacks the \n13                                             \n14  177 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,445. \n15  178 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,502 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)(2)). These \n16  new  health-related  factors  though  go  far  beyond  the  narrow  “health-related \n17  grounds”  that  Congress  has  expressly  set  forth  as  basis  of  inadmissibility \n18  separately  in  INA  Section  212(a).  8  U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(1)(A).  Those  discrete \n19  statutory health-based grounds of inadmissibility strongly suggest that Congress \n20  did  not  intend  for  the  Department  to  engraft  much  broader  health-based \n21  exclusions through the public charge provisions. \n22  179 84 Fed.

These factors thus do not merely “coincide or relate to each other,” \n6  as the Department contends, but instead engender obvious double-counting.180 \n7  The Department does not provide a reasoned basis for creating duplicative—and \n8  effectively  dispositive—“heavily  weighted  factors”  that  outweigh  the \n9  considerations  Congress  has  expressly  set  forth  in  the  statutory  totality  of \n10  circumstances test.   \n11  d.  Private health insurance \n12  147.  Commenters  expressed  significant  concern  over  the  Proposed \n13  Rule’s consideration of private health insurance as a factor in the public charge \n14  test. As numerous commenters pointed out, many immigrants work in industries \n15  that tend not to provide employer-based health insurance. Many commenters also \n16  noted  that  considering  health  insurance  and  related  factors,  such  as  having \n17  sufficient  household  assets  and  resources  to  cover  “reasonably  foreseeable \n18  medical  costs,”  would  disproportionately  and  negatively  affect  certain \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  180 84 Fed.

The  Department  entirely  disregarded  those  concerns,  instead \n4  elevating private health insurance coverage to a heavily weighted positive factor \n5  in the Final Rule. The Department stated that it will proceed to consider “whether \n6  a person has health insurance or has the household assets and resources to pay \n7  for reasonably foreseeable medical costs,” and that having private insurance will \n8  generally be weighed as a heavily positive factor (provided the insurance is not \n9  for example offset by tax credits under the ACA).182 Further, the Department \n10  readily conceded that “certain individuals may choose to forego public health \n11  insurance, such as Medicaid, because of the impact on public charge.”183 The \n12  Department did not explain how such disenrollment from health coverage could \n13  possibly advance its purported goal to promote immigrants’ self-sufficiency and \n14  economic independence.  \n15  149.  Although  the  Department  notably  stated  it  would  not  consider \n16  programs other than Medicaid as public benefits, its response to these comments \n17  clarifies that the “evaluation may in some cases require DHS to consider an \n18  alien’s publicly funded or subsidized health insurance that is not defined as a \n19                                             \n20  181 84 Fed.

Nonimmigrant applications for change of status or \nextension of stay \n8 \n150.  Numerous commenters criticized the Proposed Rule for applying a \n9 \npublic charge-like test to nonimmigrant applicants for a change of status or \n10 \nextension  of  stay,  neither  of  which  is  subject  to  the  INA’s  public  charge \n11 \nexclusion. Under the Public Charge Rule, extension of stay and change of status \n12 \napplicants  must  establish  that  they  have  not  received  public  benefits  in  an \n13 \naggregate of 12 months in the prior 36-month period. The Department denies that \n14 \nit is “intended to “apply the public charge ground of inadmissibility to extension \n15 \nof stay or change of status applicants.” Rather, the Department claims that it is \n16 \nsimply “exercising its statutory authority to set a new condition for approval of \n17 \nextension of stay and change of status applications.”186  \n18 \n19                                             \n20  184 84 Fed.

The Department’s denial is implausible. Not only does this “new \n2  condition of approval” appear in the very regulation called “Inadmissibility on \n3  Public Charge Grounds,” but it bootstraps into change of status and extension of \n4  stay applications the central criterion of the Department’s new public charge test \n5  (i.e.,  the  receipt  of  public  benefits  above  the  12-month  threshold).  The \n6  Department fails to explain how expanding that core criterion beyond the public \n7  charge exclusion’s statutory bounds comports with its authority under the INA.  \n8  f.  Application to lawful permanent residents returning \nfrom 180-day trips abroad  \n9 \n152.  Commenters also criticized the Department for failing to estimate \n10 \nthe consequences or costs of applying its expansive new public charge standard \n11 \nto lawful permanent residents returning to the United States after 180 or more \n12 \ndays abroad. The Department’s only response is that it “does not believe such a \n13 \nquantitative estimate is necessary.”187 That brusque response fails to give due \n14 \nconsideration to a significant concern about how the regulation will affect lawful \n15 \npermanent residents on the path to U.S. citizenship. \n16 \ng.  Disparate impact \n17 \n153.  Numerous  commenters  pointed  to  the  racially  and  ethnically \n18 \ndisparate  impact  the  Department’s  public  charge  test  would  have  by \n19 \ndisproportionately  affecting  immigrants  of  color.  For  example,  one  analysis \n20 \n21                                             \n22  187 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,327. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  78  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Department did not dispute that the Rule would have a disparate \n7  impact  on  immigrants  of  color.  Instead,  the  Department  claimed  it  did  not \n8  intentionally “codify this final rule to discriminate”189 and that it “does not \n9  understand commenters’ statements about the ‘unequal application’ of the public \n10  charge  inadmissibility  rule.”190  Although  it  provided  no  evidence,  the \n11  Department “disagree[d] that the public charge inadmissibility rule would be \n12  unequally applied to different groups of aliens along the lines of race.”191 That \n13  bald  denial  fails  to  meaningfully  address  an  important  aspect  of  the  \n14  problem—the  Rule’s  discriminatory  effects—and  to  consider  the  significant \n15  disadvantages and injustice of its decision. \n16 \n17 \n18                                             \n19  188 84 Fed.

Credit history and financial liabilities \n2  155.  Several  commenters  expressed  concern  that  the  Proposed  Rule \n3  sought to consider an immigrant’s credit history as a factor in the determination \n4  of  whether  the  immigrant  is  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.  As  these \n5  commenters noted, credit scores and credit histories were not intended to be used \n6  in the immigration context; do not assess an immigrant’s likelihood of being \n7  self-sufficient; have no correlation with the evaluation factor; are often highly \n8  inaccurate; and may be affected by factors outside the immigrant’s control but \n9  from which they may recover. Further, commenters noted that credit reports \n10  contain irrelevant data, such as medical debts that do not measure an individual’s \n11  financial status, while at the same time omitting potentially more relevant data, \n12  such as consistency of rent payments. Other commenters noted that considering \n13  credit scores would essentially “double count” evidence already factoring into \n14  the public charge determination.  \n15  156.  The  Department  largely  disregarded  these  concerns,  however, \n16  instead stating in conclusory fashion that it believes such information is useful \n17  “in determining whether aliens are able to support themselves.” According to the \n18  Department, credit reports “generally assist creditors to determine the credit \n19  worthiness or risk of a person,” and the Department proposes its use of credit \n20  reports  “focuses  on  the  assessment  of  these  debts,  liabilities,  and  related \n21  indicators, as one indicator of an alien’s strong or weak financial status.” The \n22  Department’s decision is arbitrary and capricious, however, as it elevates private \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  80  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Immigration fee waiver \n5  157.  Many commentators criticized the Proposed Rule for taking into \n6  consideration whether an immigrant had ever received an immigration fee waiver \n7  as a negative factor weighing in favor of a public charge finding. As these \n8  commentators noted, there is no evidence to suggest the one-time receipt of an \n9  immigration fee waiver correlates to whether an immigrant is likely to become a \n10  public charge. For example, commenters noted that an immigrant’s financial \n11  condition often improves after receiving the immigration benefits for which they \n12  received the fee waiver. Further, commenters noted that considering the one-time \n13  receipt of a fee waiver leads to double counting income, which unduly punishes \n14  immigrants who received fee waivers based on temporarily adverse economic \n15  circumstances. Finally, other commentators noted that punishing immigrants for \n16  seeking fee waivers is counter-productive, as immigrants often seek such waivers \n17  for work authorization (as they have no income at the time they apply) or to \n18  ensure their immigration documents are timely filed when they have not had \n19  sufficient time to save enough money for the application fee (perhaps because \n20 \n21                                             \n22  192 84 Fed.

The Department largely brushed these concerns aside, however, \n4  essentially arguing that any problems resulting from consideration of fee waivers \n5  would be minimal, as they constitute “only one evidentiary consideration in the \n6  totality of the circumstances and [are] not heavily weighted.”193 But, injecting an \n7  arbitrary and unreliable factor into a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis does \n8  not make consideration of the factor any less arbitrary. Here, the Department has \n9  failed  to  proffer  any  non-arbitrary  or  capricious  basis  for  considering  the \n10  one-time receipt of a fee-waiver as a factor. \n11  j.  High school diploma \n12  159.  Many commenters stated that considering whether an immigrant has \n13  a high school diploma or comparable educational background will arbitrarily \n14  discriminate against large categories of immigrants, including farm workers and \n15  other trade workers who may have been lawfully present and working for many \n16  years without obtaining such a degree. Several commenters also noted the factor \n17  discriminates in particular against immigrant women, many of whom come from \n18  countries where women are discouraged or prevented from attending school. \n19  Other commenters expressed concerns over the arbitrary and undue burden such \n20  a  factor  would  place  on  disabled  immigrants,  many  of  whom  often  face \n21                                             \n22  193 84 Fed.

In  response,  the \n3  Department  noted  merely  that  it  was  required  to  consider  an  immigrant’s \n4  educational background in the totality of circumstances review. The Department \n5  conceded that “lack of formal education such as the lack of a high school diploma \n6  or  other  education  are  generally  a  negative  consideration,”  but  noted  that \n7  employment history and “occupational skills, certifications or licenses” may also \n8  be considered.194 The Department’s undue emphasis on a formal diploma—even \n9  despite  overwhelming  evidence  and  commentary  noting  that  immigrants \n10  frequently  work  and  contribute  without  any  such  educational  \n11  background—renders the factor arbitrary and capricious. \n12  k.  English proficiency \n13  160.  Many commenters objected to including an immigrant’s proficiency \n14  in English as a factor in the public charge determination, noting that “requiring \n15  English proficiency would mark a fundamental change from the nation’s historic \n16  commitment to welcoming and integrating immigrants.”195 Other commenters \n17  noted that English language learners often benefit from receipt of Medicaid or \n18  other non-cash public benefits in their pursuit of attending language classes and \n19  becoming fluent. As numerous commenters noted, the Rule will deter these \n20                                             \n21  194 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,430. \n22  195 84 Fed.

Other commenters argued that evaluating English \n3  proficiency  will  unduly  burden  immigrant  women  and  deaf  immigrants; \n4  constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin; and has no relation to \n5  the rule’s purported goal, as skilled immigrants may readily obtain employment \n6  in fields that do not require English proficiency. According to these commenters, \n7  the Rule would “improperly reject many people with practical job skills doing \n8  essential work in our economy that have limited formal education and English \n9  proficiency highlighted farmworkers as an example.”196 The Department largely \n10  shrugged  off  these  concerns,  however,  noting  repeatedly  that  it  was  not \n11  “mandating  English  proficiency  for  admissibility.”197  And,  although  the \n12  Department  conceded  that  individuals  who  lack  English  proficiency  might \n13  already be working or able to obtain employment, it nevertheless argued that \n14  “people  with  the  lowest  English  speaking  ability  tend  to  have  the  lowest \n15  employment  rate,  lowest  rate  of  full-time  employment,  and  lowest  median \n16  earnings.”198  The  Department’s  willful  disregard  of  these  comments \n17  demonstrates  that  the  English  proficiency  factor  is  entirely  arbitrary  and \n18 \n19                                             \n20  196 84 Fed.

Federalism summary impact statement \n4  161.  Although  Executive  Order  13,132  requires  the  Department  to \n5  produce a federalism summary impact statement, the Department summarily \n6  asserted that the Rule “does not have substantial direct effects on the States” and \n7  the Rule “requires no further agency action or analysis.”199 \n8  162.  The Department’s analysis of its obligations under Executive Order \n9  13,132 was insufficient because the Department did not identify the myriad costs \n10  and effects of the Rule on the Plaintiff States. As discussed throughout this \n11  complaint, the Rule has profound direct effects on state and local governments \n12  and will impose substantial costs on state and local governments. \n13  163.  The Plaintiff States raised the concern about the Proposed Rule’s \n14  lack of federalism summary impact statement in their comment letter—as did \n15  various  other  commentators.  Had  OIRA  granted  the  Plaintiff  States  an \n16  E.O. 12,866 meeting, the Plaintiff States could have discussed this issue with \n17  OIRA. \n18  m.  Cost-benefit analysis \n19  164.  DHS generally failed to conduct a true or adequate cost-benefit \n20  analysis, instead only aiming to quantify the direct reduction in transfer payments \n21                                             \n22  199 84 Fed.

For example, DHS failed to estimate the chilling effects \n2  of the Rule because it was “difficult to predict the rule’s disenrollment impacts \n3  with respect to people who are not regulated by this rule, such as people who \n4  erroneously believe themselves to be affected.”200 The preamble also repeatedly \n5  diminishes the significance of impacts to those people, businesses, and state \n6  governments that are  not  “directly”  regulated by  the  Rule. In neglecting to \n7  conduct deeper quantitative analysis of the costs to states or their economies, the \n8  preamble cites, for example, “great uncertainty” to “the broader economy” as a \n9  result of diminished transfer payments.201 \n10  165.  With  respect  to  chilling  effects,  the  preamble  makes  broad, \n11  unsupported assumptions. DHS dismisses widespread confusion that currently \n12  exists and that will be exacerbated by the Rule, saying only that it would be \n13  “unwarranted” for people to disenroll from a benefit if they were not subject to \n14  the Rule and that DHS “will not alter the rule to account for such unwarranted \n15  choices.”202 This significantly understates the impacts of a drastic change in \n16  agency  position,  particularly  when  combined  with  other  proposed  and  final \n17  regulatory actions publicized by federal officials. \n18 \n19                                             \n20  200 84 Fed.

In purporting  to  analyze  the number  of noncitizens  who  would \n2  choose to forego benefits to which they are legally entitled, DHS arbitrarily used \n3  a  figure  of  2.5%  of  the  estimated  number  of  foreign-born  noncitizens \n4  participating  in  any  particular  program.  Instead  of  actually  attempting  to \n5  determine the number of people who were expected to disenroll, DHS apparently \n6  selected this figure by using the number of individuals seeking to adjust status \n7  within a given time period.203 \n8  167.  DHS downplays the number of impacted individuals by the Rule in \n9  numerous  ways.  For  example,  the  preamble  states  that  most  applicants  are \n10  “unlikely to suffer negative consequences from past receipt of public benefits \n11  because  they  will  have been  residing outside the  United  States. . . .”204  The \n12  preamble then cites statistics showing that only about 33% of the relevant group \n13  of immigrants between fiscal years 2015 and 2017 adjusted their status while in \n14  the United States. However, because the United States admitted over 541 million \n15  nonimmigrants during this time period, this still leaves over 178 million people \n16  residing in the United States during the cited time period who could have been \n17                                             \n18  203 Department of Homeland Security, [CIS No. 2499-10; DHS Docket No. \n19  USCIS-2010-0012]; RIN 1615-AA22, Proposed Rule: Inadmissibility on Public \n20  Charge Grounds, Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of \n21  Public Benefits Program, Table 4, n. 1. \n22  204 84 Fed.

This is but one example of \n2  arbitrary qualitative analysis minimizing the reach of the Rule. \n3  168.  DHS  does  not  adequately  assess  the  costs  to  states.  While \n4  acknowledging that state and local governments would “incur costs,” DHS goes \n5  on  to  dismiss  these  costs  as  “unclear”  and  “indirect,”  with  no  substantive \n6  analysis.205 \n7  169.  DHS  repeatedly  cites  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s \n8  Circular A-4 as excusing quantitative or even qualitative analysis of various \n9  impacts. OMB’s Circular A-4 assists agencies in conducting a regulatory analysis \n10  of economically significant actions consistent with Executive Order 12866. Far \n11  from  excusing  analysis  of  “chilling  effects”  on  immigrants,  costs  to  state \n12  governments, private businesses such as hospitals, or the economy, Circular A-4 \n13  expressly  states  that  agencies  should  include  the  monetary  values  of \n14  “Private-sector compliance costs and savings” and “Government administrative \n15  costs and savings.” Circular A-4 also does not excuse analysis where there is \n16  uncertainty. Rather, it states that while the precise benefits and costs of regulatory \n17  options are not always known, “the probability of their occurrence can often be \n18  developed.” \n19  170.  By focusing only on the reduction in direct transfer payments, DHS \n20  greatly overstates the benefits of the Rule. In many instances, these “savings” \n21                                             \n22  205 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,469-70. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  88  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

DHS’s treatment of the impacts \n3  to the Medicaid program provides a clear example of this deficiency in analysis. \n4  DHS estimates a reduction in transfer payments related to Medicaid of over \n5  $1 billion.206 But this estimate fails to take into account increased costs from \n6  emergency services that will result from delaying health care until conditions \n7  become emergent and they are much more costly to treat. At that time, costs are \n8  borne by other federal programs, states, private hospitals and health providers, \n9  and  individuals  receiving  care.  For  example,  in  Washington,  the  Alien \n10  Emergency Medical Program covers certain emergency care for noncitizens. The \n11  program  is  funded  through  both  state  and  federal  sources.  Private  medical \n12  providers will also suffer costs by providing uncompensated care. By making no \n13  effort to analyze these resulting costs, DHS has overstated the actual benefits of \n14  the Rule in its cost-benefit analysis. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18                                             \n19  206 Department of Homeland Security, [CIS No. 2499-10; DHS Docket No. \n20  USCIS-2010-0012]; RIN 1615-AA22, Proposed Rule: Inadmissibility on Public \n21  Charge Grounds, Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of \n22  Public Benefits Program, Table 5. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  89  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

THE RULE’S CHILLING EFFECTS ON PARTICIPATION IN \nFEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS \n2 \n171.  As the Department itself recognizes, the Rule will cause lawfully \n3 \npresent noncitizens whom Congress specifically made eligible to participate in \n4 \nfederal benefit programs—and U.S. citizens with participating or eligible family \n5 \nmembers—to disenroll or forbear enrollment. The Rule does so by making the \n6 \nreceipt of benefits (including five non-cash federal benefits—SNAP, Medicaid, \n7 \nSection 8 vouchers, Section 8 rental assistance, and public housing subsidies) a \n8 \nground for designating a person a public charge. Even harsher, the Rule makes \n9 \nan immigrant beneficiary’s exclusion virtually inevitable by making receipt of \n10 \nsuch benefits a “heavily weighed negative factor” in the determination.  \n11 \n172.  The chilling effects of the Rule began to materialize long before its \n12 \npublication, and were observed quickly following the leaks in January 2017 of \n13 \nthe draft Executive Order and in March 2018 of the draft Rule. Due to the \n14 \nambiguity and complexity of the Rule, many noncitizens and their families have \n15 \nforegone and will forego participation in a wide swath of federal, state, and local \n16 \nbenefits.  Widespread  confusion  over  which  forms  of  “public  benefits”  will \n17 \ntrigger a public charge determination will exacerbate the Rule’s harms to the \n18 \nPlaintiff States and their residents.  \n19 \n173.  As eligible noncitizens and their families disenroll or refrain from \n20 \nseeking federal benefits for fear of jeopardizing their ability to immigrate, many \n21 \nwill turn to the Plaintiff States’ programs to fill the gap. Others will refrain from \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  90  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.620   Page 98 of 185\n \n1  seeking  any  government  assistance  at  all—including  state-funded  non-cash \n2  benefits that would not even be subject to the Rule—leading to increased poverty, \n3  homelessness,  hunger,  poor  health,  and  other  social  costs.  These  harms  to \n4  individuals and families will place increased downstream financial strain on the \n5  Plaintiff States, including their housing, public health, and education systems. \n6  174.  The  Department  admits  that  the  Rule  will  deter  immigrant \n7  participation  in  public  benefits  programs,  despite  Congress’s  express \n8  determination allowing immigrant participation.207 Indeed, in the Department’s \n9  view, the chilling effects are not a vice of the Rule but a virtue—regardless of the \n10  acknowledged decline in health, income, educational opportunities, housing, and \n11  overall quality of life they will cause among millions in our communities.208 The \n12  Department even suggests that state agencies “advise potential beneficiaries of \n13  the potential immigration consequences of receiving certain public benefits.”209 \n14  The manifest intent of the Rule is to exclude immigrants this Administration \n15  deems “undesirable” from the United States and, barring that, to exclude them \n16  and their families from the U.S. social safety net, contrary to congressional and \n17  state determinations regarding eligibility.  \n18 \n19                                             \n20  207 83 Fed.

As a result of those chilling effects, implementation of the Rule will \n2  also cause severe and irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States. First, States will \n3  lose federal dollars from benefits programs that they administer to the benefit of \n4  their residents. Additional direct costs to states will result from immigrants who \n5  shift from federal programs to state programs that do not qualify as “public \n6  benefits” under the Rule. At the same time, disenrollment and non-enrollment in \n7  nutrition, health, and other federal and state assistance programs will make many \n8  working class immigrant families less healthy, less productive, more reliant on \n9  state-covered  emergency  medical  care,  more  likely  to  experience  economic \n10  dislocation and homelessness—all of which will redound to greater strains on \n11  state agencies and programs. Further, the broader chilling effects among all state-\n12  run  assistance programs  will undermine  those programs’  administration  and \n13  effectiveness. Those affected programs include, but are not limited to, medical \n14  and healthcare services, food assistance programs, housing benefits, financial and \n15  cash assistance programs, long-term support services for elderly and disabled \n16  residents,  education  systems,  job  and  employment  training  programs,  and \n17  programs supporting crime victims. \n18  176.  For any immigrants reviewing this Complaint for guidance on the \n19  types of programs that are deemed a “public benefit” for purposes of the Rule, \n20  the Plaintiff States strongly urge the immigrant to contact the relevant State \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  92  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

As mentioned throughout, many state programs do not qualify as “public \n2  benefits” under the Rule. \n3  A.  Health Care Programs \n4  177.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer medical services and \n5  benefits programs such as Medicaid. Some of these programs are jointly funded \n6  by federal and state funds and others by only state funds. As set forth below, the \n7  Rule would imperil the effectiveness of these programs by reducing enrollment, \n8  jeopardizing public health, and dramatically increasing costs to the Plaintiff \n9  States. \n10  1.  Federal health care benefits \n11  178.  Congress created Medicaid in 1965 to assist states in furnishing \n12  medical assistance to individuals and families.210  \n13  179.  Medicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. \n14  A state’s participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but once a state chooses to \n15  participate it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements to \n16  receive federal matching funds.211  \n17  180.  Anyone who qualifies under program rules can receive Medicaid. \n18 \n19                                             \n20  210 See Pub. L. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \n21  § 1396-1). \n22  211 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396–1, 1396a, 1396b, 1396c. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  93  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

States  administer  Medicaid  and  generally  determine  financial \n2  eligibility criteria for participants. \n3  182.  Federal law requires coverage for certain groups of individuals, \n4  including some low-income families, qualified pregnant women and children, \n5  and  individuals  receiving  Supplemental  Security  Income.  States  may  offer \n6  coverage  for  additional  groups,  such  as  people  receiving  home  and \n7  community-based services and children in foster care who are not otherwise \n8  eligible.  States  may  extend  Medicaid  coverage  to  all  children  and pregnant \n9  women, including any immigrants lawfully residing in the United States.212 \n10  183.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  established  a  new  methodology  for \n11  determining  Medicaid  income  eligibility.  Some  individuals  are  eligible  for \n12  Medicaid based on methodology other than income, such as disability. These \n13  changes resulted in greater participation in the Medicaid Program. Thirty-six \n14  states, and the District of Columbia, participated in the Medicaid expansion. \n15  184.  Over  half  of  all  non-elderly  adults  receiving  Medicaid—about \n16  60%—are  working.  An  even  greater  number  of  Medicaid  recipients—about \n17  79%—are from a home where at least one household member works. Among \n18  adult Medicaid enrollees who work, over half (about 51%) work full-time for the \n19  entire year. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  212 42 U.S.C.§ 1396b(v)(4)(A). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  94  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act,  states  may  extend  Medicaid \n2  eligibility to lawful permanent residents and all other “qualified” immigrants \n3  after a five year waiting period.213 States may also elect to use state-only funds \n4  to cover qualified immigrants during the five-year ban.214 Many of the Plaintiff \n5  States have done so.215 Although such state-only health benefits do not constitute \n6  “public benefits” under the Rule’s public charge test, many noncitizens will fear \n7  that enrollment in state-funded programs (which often have the same name as the \n8  state’s Medicaid program) will carry adverse immigration consequences. \n9  2.  State health care benefits \n10  186.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer numerous health care \n11  services programs, including Medicaid.  \n12  187.  Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to participate \n13  in these state-run medical services programs. If implemented, the Rule would \n14  result in many otherwise eligible individuals—including citizens—disenrolling \n15                                             \n16  213 See 8 U.S.C. § 1613(a). \n17  214 8 U.S.C. § 1622(a). \n18  215 See ASPE Issue Brief: Overview of Immigrants’ Eligibility for SNAP, \n19  TANF, Medicaid, and CHIP, Office of the Ass’t Sec’y for Planning & Eval., U.S. \n20  Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. (Mar. 2012), https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/ \n21  overview-immigrants-eligibility-snap-tanf-medicaid-and-chip \n22  (HHS Issue Brief). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  95  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Individuals who are eligible to enroll in these programs but elect not \n4  to participate because of the Rule will likely delay seeking both routine and \n5  necessary  medical  treatment  (including  vital  preventative  services  such  as \n6  vaccinations)  until  they  require  emergency  care.  Indeed,  the  Department \n7  essentially concedes this fact, noting that “DHS acknowledges that increased use \n8  of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary healthcare due to \n9  delayed  treatment  is  possible  and  there  is  a  potential  for  increases  in \n10  uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for by an insurer \n11  or patient.”216 Individuals who resort to emergency care as a method of primary \n12  healthcare are more likely to experience severe medical conditions, creating \n13  public health concerns and requiring unnecessarily expensive emergency medical \n14  treatment, the overwhelming cost of which will be borne by the Plaintiff States \n15  and their private hospitals. \n16  189.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n17  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n18  these health care services programs. \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  216 84 Fed.

The Plaintiff States’ medical assistance programs \n2  190.  Each of the Plaintiff States manages and administers a Medicaid \n3  program for its residents. In addition, the Plaintiff States administer numerous \n4  other health care programs, some with combined federal and state funds and some \n5  with state-only funds. With community, state, and national partners, the Plaintiff \n6  States provide evidence-based, cost-effective services that support the health and \n7  well-being of individuals, families, and communities in their States. \n8  191.  Many of the Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs include coverage \n9  groups encompassing citizens and noncitizens, including adults between the ages \n10  of 19 and 65; certain parents and caretakers; the elderly; the blind and disabled; \n11  those  using  long-term  support  services  or  hospice;  and  Medicare  Savings \n12  Program enrollees. \n13  192.  The  Washington  Health  Care  Authority  (HCA)  administers \n14  Washington’s  Medicaid  program,  as  well  as  other  federal  and  state-funded \n15  medical assistance programs. HCA has over 1,300 employees and a biennial \n16  budget of over $20 billion.  \n17  193.  Washington Apple Health is the name for Washington’s medical \n18  assistance programs, which include not only the state Medicaid program, which \n19  is covered under the Rule, but also other programs that are not expressly covered \n20  but are likely to be affected, including because of the Rule’s chilling effect on \n21  eligible individuals. This chilling effect on programs not expressly covered under \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  97  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Through the Apple Health program, Washington purchases health \n4  care for approximately 1.9 million people. In state fiscal year 2019, Washington’s \n5  HCA  is  expected  to  spend  $10.1  billion  to  support  Apple  Health  and  its \n6  Community Behavioral Health Services program. Of this amount, $6.8 billion \n7  will come from federal contributions.  \n8  195.  Washington’s Apple Health currently covers adults with incomes up \n9  to 138 percent of the federal poverty level under the Adult Medical Program and \n10  provides these individuals with essential health coverage, including preventative \n11  care, inpatient hospitalization, prescription drugs, and many other health services. \n12  196.  The Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services \n13  (EOHHS) manages Massachusetts’s Medicaid program, which is covered by the \n14  Rule, as well as other health assistance programs that are not expressly covered \n15  but are likely to be affected by the Rule’s chilling effect on eligible individuals. \n16  EOHHS comprises 12 agencies, has over 22,000 employees, and oversees an \n17  annual budget of over $22 billion. \n18  197.  Massachusetts’s Medicaid program and CHIP are combined into \n19  one program, MassHealth, through which Massachusetts provides healthcare \n20  benefits to almost 1.8 million adults, children, and people with disabilities. In \n21  state fiscal year 2019, Massachusetts’s MassHealth spent $16.5 billion to support \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  98  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Of  this  amount,  $4.3  billion  came  from  state  contributions. \n3  Massachusetts’s MassHealth provides essential health coverage to adults and \n4  children, including inpatient and outpatient services, preventive care, mental \n5  health and addiction services, and various other services and benefits. \n6  198.  The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) \n7  administers Virginia’s Medicaid program, which is subject to the Rule, as well \n8  as various other programs that the Rule does not expressly cover. Virginia’s \n9  Medicaid program currently covers adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal \n10  poverty level and provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient services, \n11  pharmacy,  mental  health  and  addiction  treatment,  long  term  services  and \n12  supports. In 2018, 983,000 Virginians received Medicaid benefits. That number \n13  is projected to rise to as many as 1,406,000 people in 2019. \n14  199.  The  Maryland  Department  of  Health  runs  the  state  Medicaid \n15  program. Through Maryland’s medical assistance programs, the state provides \n16  assistance to 1,160,067 enrollees. \n17  200.  In New Mexico, 840,860 people were enrolled in the state Medicaid \n18  program in 2018. The program, which is covered by the Rule, is administered by \n19  the State’s Human Services Department. \n20  201.  In New Jersey, the State’s Medicaid and CHIP programs together \n21  serve approximately 1.8 million low- and moderate-income residents—or about \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  99  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Notably, New Jersey is one of the most diverse \n2  states in the country, with 22% of its residents having been born in a foreign \n3  country. \n4  202.  The Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services \n5  and the Department of Human Services administer the State’s Medicaid program, \n6  as well as other federal- and State- funded medical assistance programs. Under \n7  the State’s Medicaid expansion, eligible Rhode Island residents between the ages \n8  of 19 and 64 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level are eligible \n9  for Medicaid coverage. Rhode Island’s health care services cover approximately \n10  300,000 Rhode Island residents, including citizens and noncitizens. \n11  203.  The  Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services  administers \n12  Minnesota’s Medicaid program, known as Medical Assistance, as well as other \n13  related federal and state-funded health care assistance programs, collectively \n14  known  as  Minnesota  Health  Care  Programs.  Through  the  State’s  Medical \n15  Assistance  program,  Minnesota  purchases  health  care  for  approximately \n16  1,031,888 people. \n17  204.  The  State of  Hawai’i  Department  of  Human  Services  (HIDHS) \n18  contains  the  Med-QUEST  Division,  which  oversees  the  State’s  Medicaid \n19  Program and assists low income adults and children in obtaining health coverage \n20  through managed care plans. Additionally, Hawai’i is home to a large population \n21  of residents subject to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) between the \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  100  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The HIDHS provides Medicaid coverage for over 345,000 Hawai’i \n5  residents. Of that number, more than 30,000 are non-U.S. citizens, of which 5,246 \n6  are COFA residents. The state’s Medicaid program provides medical insurance \n7  coverage for nearly one-half of Hawai’i’s children. HIDHS has more than 2,300 \n8  employees deployed in 84 offices statewide, and manages an annual budget of \n9  nearly $3.6 billion, of which 64.5% are federal funds.    \n10  205.  The Plaintiff States also provide supplemental health care programs \n11  specifically targeted to children. Although the Rule exempts from its public \n12  charge test Medicaid benefits received by immigrants under age 21 and pregnant \n13  women,217 it nevertheless will likely undermine these supplemental children’s \n14  health care programs because of (1) the chilling effect the Rule will have on \n15  eligible participants; and (2) the programs’ close and intertwined relationship to \n16  Medicaid  benefits  (which  are  generally  considered  “public  benefits”).  For \n17  example, Virginia’s CHIP program, called Family Access to Medical Insurance \n18  Security (FAMIS), provides free health coverage to children in households at or \n19  below 205% of the poverty level. In fiscal year 2018, Virginia’s CHIP program \n20  alone provided medical care services to more than 200,000 children and pregnant \n21                                             \n22  217 84 Fed.

Virginia relies on the CHIP Program to assist in providing low-income \n2  children with health insurance coverage and keeping all children in Virginia \n3  healthy. In fiscal year 2017, Virginia received approximately $291.1 million \n4  federal allotment under the CHIP program. \n5  206.  Washington Apple Health for Kids similarly provides free coverage \n6  to children in households at or below 210% of the federal poverty level. For a \n7  monthly premium, the program also provides coverage to households at or below \n8  312% of the federal poverty level. Washington Apple Health for Kids is partially \n9  funded through CHIP, which receives matching federal funds under the Social \n10  Security Act218 and provides low-income children with essential health coverage, \n11  including preventive care, inpatient hospitalization, prescription drugs, and many \n12  other health services. \n13  207.  As  part  of  the  Washington  Apple  Health  for  Kids  program, \n14  Washington  uses  federal  funds  related  to  CHIP  to  provide  services  for \n15  low-income children whose families are slightly above the income cutoff for free \n16  child health coverage. CHIP dollars also fund other Washington programs and \n17  services, such as medical coverage for lawfully present noncitizen children, and \n18  prenatal coverage for pregnant women ineligible for Medicaid because of their \n19  citizenship status. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  218 See 42 U.S.C. § 1397dd. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  102  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  Plaintiff  States  also  manage  and  administer  several  related \n2  health care programs, which are not considered “public benefits” under the Rule \n3  but which will likely be affected by its chilling effect on eligible participants. For \n4  example, the Washington Family Medical Program provides coverage to adults \n5  with countable income at or below the applicable Medicaid standard who have \n6  dependent children living in their home under age 18. Similarly, Washington’s \n7  Pregnancy and Family Planning Program provides coverage to pregnant women \n8  at or below 193% of the federal poverty level without regard to citizenship or \n9  immigration status.  \n10  209.  Washington provides a host of other medical services programs that \n11  likewise are not directly covered by the Rule but are likely to be harmed by it, \n12  including the Community and Behavioral Health Services Program; the Breast \n13  and  Cervical  Cancer  Treatment  Program  for  Women;  the  Refugee  Medical \n14  Assistance Program; the Alien Emergency Medical Program; the Supplemental \n15  Security  Income  Program;  Healthcare  for  Workers  with  Disabilities;  the \n16  Medically  Needy  Program;  the  Medicare  Savings  Program;  and  Long-Term \n17  Services and Supports and Hospice. \n18  210.  Similarly, Virginia state agencies administer a host of additional \n19  medical services that are not covered by the Rule but are likely to be affected by \n20  it, including community  mental health services through Community Service \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  103  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Massachusetts similarly administers various other medical services \n4  programs that, while not covered by the Rule, are likely to be harmed by it. These \n5  include programs targeted towards infectious and chronic disease prevention, \n6  substance abuse treatment and prevention, cancer screening and diagnosis, and \n7  sexual and domestic violence prevention.   \n8  212.  Many of the Plaintiff States also provide state-only-funded health \n9  coverage to qualified immigrants prior to the five-year ban. Those states include \n10  Illinois,  Hawai’i,  Massachusetts,  Minnesota,  New  Mexico,  Virginia,  and \n11  Washington.219 \n12  b.  Irreparable harm to medical assistance programs \n13  213.  The Rule will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ medical \n14  assistance programs. For example, the Rule will result in (1) a loss of medical \n15  care and healthcare insurance for the Plaintiff States’ residents; (2) higher and \n16  more frequent emergency services costs and uncompensated care for the Plaintiff \n17  States;  (3)  severe  public  health  concerns,  including  by  deterring  eligible \n18  individuals  from  accessing  routine  preventative  medical  care  such  as \n19  vaccinations; and (4) significant harm to the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests \n20  in the effective administration of their health services programs. \n21                                             \n22  219 HHS Issue Brief at 5–6.  \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  104  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Rule will cause a devastating loss of health coverage under \n2  government-sponsored health programs in the Plaintiff States. If the Rule is \n3  implemented,  the  Plaintiff  States  will  experience  disenrollment  rates  for \n4  noncitizens ranging from 15 to 35%, based on metrics and data analysis from the \n5  Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on providing the \n6  United States public with unbiased research and journalism on major health care \n7  issues.220 \n8  215.  Below are specific examples of the types of harms the Plaintiff \n9  States and their residents will experience. \n10 \n(1)  Plaintiff States’ residents will lose medical care and \nbecome uninsured \n11 \n216.  In  Washington,  as  of  October  31,  2017,  there  were  107,244 \n12 \nnoncitizens insured for health coverage under Apple Health. These enrollees will \n13 \nbe deterred from using government health insurance and government-funded \n14 \nhealth services by the Rule. \n15 \n16 \n17                                             \n18  220  See  S.

An additional 140,612 Washington families had a member of a \n2  household who might be subject to a public charge determination while another \n3  household member is receiving Apple Health coverage. Although the Rule does \n4  not  expressly  consider  public  benefits  accessed  by  another  member  of  the \n5  immigrant’s  household,221  members  of  mixed-status  households  will  fear \n6  accessing  Apple  Health-covered  services  to  which  they  are  legally  entitled, \n7  resulting in public health concerns and increased costs due to delays in accessing \n8  preventative care, vaccinations, prenatal care, and wellness checks. \n9  218.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n10  result in an annual reduction in medical and behavioral care in Washington of \n11  between $42.6 million and $99.4 million. \n12  219.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n13  cause approximately 10,000 to 24,000 lawfully present adults to lose medical \n14  care annually and become uninsured. \n15  220.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n16  cause approximately 2,600 to 6,000 undocumented adults and children to lose \n17  Medicaid annually and become uninsured.  \n18  221.  The severe effects of such a loss of coverage could also result in a \n19  reduction of health care jobs and supporting services, particularly in rural regions \n20  of Washington. \n21                                             \n22  221 84 Fed.

In Massachusetts, as of December 2018, approximately 264,000 \n2  MassHealth members were noncitizens, including 52,000 children. Six thousand \n3  of these children were enrolled in CHIP. \n4  223.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Massachusetts the Rule \n5  will  cause  approximately  39,600  to  92,400  lawfully  present  MassHealth \n6  members to lose medical care annually and become uninsured.   \n7  224.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Massachusetts the Rule \n8  will cause approximately 7,800 to 18,200 citizen or lawfully present noncitizen \n9  children to lose MassHealth medical coverage annually and become uninsured. \n10  225.  The effects of the Rule, however, are not merely limited to deterring \n11  individuals  who  may  be  subject  to  a  public  charge  determination  from \n12  participating in assistance programs specifically defined as “public benefits.” The \n13  Rule will also likely have a chilling effect on individuals who are not subject to \n14  it and on assistance programs that are not considered “public benefits” under the \n15  analysis. \n16  226.  For example, for many families in Massachusetts, some household \n17  members will be subject to a public charge determination while others will not, \n18  and some family members may receive benefits that are part of the public charge \n19  analysis while others receive benefits not subject to the rule. The Massachusetts \n20  Health Connector estimates that as of December 2018, up to 60,000 enrollees live \n21  in  households  where  participation  in  Massachusetts’s  health  care  benefits \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  107  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Because of the complexity of determining \n3  these  impacts  and  disenrolling  only  those  family  members  from  only  those \n4  benefits that could have negative impacts, however, whole families may opt to \n5  simply withdraw their participation from the Massachusetts health insurance \n6  exchange. \n7  (2)  Shift of healthcare costs to the Plaintiff States \n8  227.  The  harms  to  the  Plaintiff  States  will  include  an  increase  in \n9  emergency  and  uncompensated  care,  which  refers  to  unreimbursed  medical \n10  services provided by hospitals to patients resulting in charity care or bad debts. \n11  228.  Individuals who lose their health insurance coverage will likely \n12  delay seeking medical care until their conditions require emergency treatment. \n13  When these individuals present at a hospital emergency room for such treatment, \n14  the Plaintiff States will ultimately bear the more expensive cost of their care.  \n15  Further, because their conditions are more serious, they will require greater \n16  resources to treat. \n17  229.  Many of the Plaintiff States have made significant gains in reducing \n18  their uninsured populations, all of which will be undermined by implementation \n19  of the Rule. Between 2013 and 2016, for example, Washington significantly \n20  reduced its rate of uninsured residents, from 14% in 2013 to 5.4% in 2016. The \n21  State’s reduction in its number of uninsured residents is associated with a parallel \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  108  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Similarly, Virginia has reduced its number of uninsured residents \n4  with the state’s January 1, 2019 expansion of its Medicaid program. As of \n5  July 2019, over 300,000 adults in the state have newly enrolled in the program. \n6  231.  In Maryland, the uninsured rate likewise fell by more than 64% \n7  between 2013  and 2017.  The drop in uninsured  rates  closely  aligns  with  a \n8  reduction  in  uncompensated  care:  From  fiscal  year  2013  to  2015,  hospital \n9  uncompensated care costs in Maryland declined by approximately $311 million. \n10  232.  Because of the Public Charge Rule, however, the Plaintiff States \n11  stand to lose all these gains. For example, Massachusetts foresees a substantial \n12  increase in the provision of uncompensated care across the Commonwealth due \n13  to loss of health coverage resulting from the Rule. Safety net providers such as \n14  hospitals and community health centers will disproportionately bear the financial \n15  burden  of  providing  uncompensated  care,  and in turn,  the demand  on  state \n16  programs that compensate providers for such care will increase. The state’s \n17  EOHHS estimates that Massachusetts hospitals are in danger of losing almost \n18  $457 million in Medicaid and CHIP funding because of the chilling effect of the \n19  Rule on otherwise-eligible individuals. \n20  233.

This increase will result in higher medical bills and health care costs charged \n3  by hospitals, undermining the Plaintiff States’ efforts to reduce their uninsured \n4  populations and harming their economies.  \n5  (3)  Significant public health concerns prompted by \nreduced preventive care \n6 \n234.  By deterring individuals from accessing the government-sponsored \n7 \nhealthcare coverage to which they are legally entitled, the Final Rule discourage \n8 \nthese individuals from engaging in routine medical care such as wellness exams \n9 \nand vaccinations. \n10 \n235.  A  general  decline  in  engagement  with  such  routine  medical \n11 \npreventive services, including vaccinations, risks increasing the spread of viruses \n12 \nand communicable diseases in the Plaintiff States. As a result, the Rule threatens \n13 \nto  cause  dangerous  public  health  hazards  for  the  Plaintiff  States  and  their \n14 \nresidents. \n15 \n236.  DOJ  has  previously  recognized  that  discouraging  eligible \n16 \nimmigrants from accessing these health care benefits may lead to the very same \n17 \npublic health concerns cited by the Plaintiff States. As noted above, in 1999 DOJ \n18 \nproposed a rule, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, stating: “Immigrants’ fears of obtaining \n19 \nthese  necessary  medical  and  other  benefits  are  not  only  causing  them \n20 \nconsiderable harm, but are also jeopardizing the general public. For example, \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  110  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In addition to the above costs, implementation of the Rule will also \n6  harm the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests in administering their health benefits \n7  systems. \n8  238.  The Plaintiff States have carefully developed state-funded health \n9  care programs to fill gaps in Medicaid and to provide coverage to financially or \n10  medically  vulnerable  individuals,  including  noncitizens.  Although  the  Rule \n11  expressly applies only to Medicaid-related health benefits, the Plaintiff States’ \n12  own programs are often closely intertwined with their Medicaid programs, and \n13  the  Rule  will  cause  noncitizens  and  mixed-status  families  to  forgo  health \n14  coverage to which they are legally entitled—even when such coverage would not \n15  be considered a negative factor under the Department’s public charge test. This \n16  chilling effect will undermine the comprehensive network of services the Plaintiff \n17  States have developed to address their unique public health needs. \n18  239.  The Rule would, for example, undermine Massachusetts’s ability to \n19  achieve its policy of universal health coverage among its residents. As of 2017, \n20  97.2% of Massachusetts residents are covered by health insurance, the highest \n21  insurance coverage rate in the nation. This is largely due to watershed health \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  111  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Department’s highly restrictive, complex, and vague treatment \n5  of public benefits, however, threatens to upend the system of incentives and \n6  disincentives that informs the choices of individuals and families enrolling in \n7  health insurance through Massachusetts’s health insurance marketplace. \n8  241.  Since  2006,  Massachusetts  has  required  that  most  adult \n9  Massachusetts residents have health coverage or pay a penalty through their tax \n10  returns.    The  Rule,  however,  will  interfere  with  Massachusetts’s  ability  to \n11  maintain this requirement, particularly for any residents who would face adverse \n12  immigration consequences by virtue of accessing health coverage. \n13  242.  About  260,000  Massachusetts  residents  individually  purchase \n14  health coverage through the Health Connector, which procures high-quality plans \n15  at competitive prices that residents can access. Any disenrollment that will follow \n16  from the Rule will diminish the collective impact of individuals purchasing health \n17  coverage  and  make  Massachusetts’s  health  insurance  marketplace  less \n18  competitive. A less competitive health insurance marketplace will put at risk the \n19  progress Massachusetts has made towards universal health coverage for all its \n20  residents. \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  112  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.642   Page 120 of 185\n \n1  243.  In Massachusetts, individuals and small businesses share the same \n2  risk  pool,  insurance  products,  and  premiums.  The  Massachusetts  Health \n3  Connector’s data shows that on average, noncitizen enrollees have 25% lower \n4  medical claims than their citizen counterparts, which is attributable to the overall \n5  lower age of noncitizens and their lower utilization of medical services. A decline \n6  in enrollment or retention of coverage for noncitizens as a result of the Rule could \n7  impact the overall risk pool in Massachusetts, which could in turn lead to monthly \n8  premium  increases  for  citizens  and  noncitizens  alike.  Based  on  the  merged \n9  structure of the insurance risk pool in Massachusetts, such impacts can flow \n10  beyond the Health Connector and cause premiums to increase for not only the \n11  small  business  community  but  potentially  throughout  the  health  insurance \n12  market. \n13  244.  Federal regulation requires that state health exchanges use a single \n14  streamlined application that collects the information needed to determine an \n15  applicant’s  eligibility  for  a  qualified  health  plan,  health  coverage  subsidies, \n16  Medicaid, CHIP, or a basic health plan. \n17  245.  In  Massachusetts,  all  applicants  for  federally  funded  and  state \n18  funded health insurance—including Medicaid, CHIP, and ConnectorCare—use \n19  a uniform application portal, and after applying are matched with the appropriate \n20  program for which they are determined eligible. The chilling effect of the Rule \n21  will likely require Massachusetts to create new forms, policies, and procedures \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  113  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Additionally,  MassHealth  and  Health  Connector  may  have  to \n6  expand its customer service support to answer questions about public charge \n7  consequences from potentially affected individuals. MassHealth and the Health \n8  Connector would have to absorb the costs and administrative burden for these \n9  modifications. \n10  247.  Further,  the  Plaintiff  States  will  be  required  to  cover  expenses \n11  associated with adopting new laws, regulations, and administrative practices, \n12  policies, and procedures as a result of the Public Charge Rule. Those changes \n13  will be necessary to adapt to and mitigate the effects of enrollment decisions by \n14  noncitizens and mixed-status families, as well as the public health consequences \n15  for their reduced access to health care services. \n16  B.  Food Assistance Programs \n17  248.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n18  federally funded food assistance programs for eligible individuals and families, \n19  including noncitizens.

This  reduction  in  participation  will  lead  to  significant  public  health \n3  concerns, including child hunger and malnourishment. \n4  1.  Federal Food Assistance Benefits \n5  249.  In 1977, Congress created the federal Food Stamp Program, known \n6  since 2008 as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which \n7  provides food purchasing assistance to low-income individuals and families.222  \n8  250.  SNAP benefits are provided on a “household” basis. For purposes \n9  of SNAP eligibility, a “household” is defined as “an individual who lives alone \n10  or who, while living with others, customarily purchases food and prepares meals \n11  for home consumption separate and apart from others; or a group of individuals \n12  who live together and customarily purchase food and prepare meals together for \n13  home consumption.”223 \n14  251.  Under federal law, SNAP is available to households with income at \n15  or  below  130%  of  the  federal  poverty  level;  a  net  monthly  income  after \n16  deductions for housing, child care and other expenses at less than or equal to \n17  100% of the federal poverty level; and with assets under the amount set in the \n18  applicable federal regulations. \n19 \n20                                             \n21  222 See 7 U.S.C. § 2013 (2018). \n22  223 7 U.S.C. § 2012(m). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  115  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  average  monthly  SNAP  benefit  per  household  is  \n2  $253—or $8.40 per day, per household. SNAP households may purchase food \n3  by using the benefit at one of the quarter million retailers authorized by the \n4  federal Food and Nutrition Service to participate in the program. \n5  253.  SNAP imposes work requirements on program participants. Federal \n6  law requires that able-bodied adult SNAP recipients who are not exempt register \n7  to work, accept a job if offered, and not quit a job without good cause. The \n8  Welfare  Reform  Act  limits  SNAP  benefits  for  able-bodied  adults  without \n9  dependents to 3 months of assistance within a 36 month period unless they are \n10  participating in work activities for at least 20 hours per week. States also operate \n11  SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, which help participants build \n12  job skills, receive training, find work, and increase work experience.  \n13  254.  About  14.9  million  workers—or  about  10%  of  workers \n14  nationwide—are from households that received SNAP benefits over the past \n15  year. \n16  255.  Under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act,  adult  immigrants  with  lawful \n17  permanent residency status, and other “qualified” immigrants, are eligible for \n18  SNAP  after  five  years.224  The  five-year  ban  does  not  apply  to  children, \n19  immigrants with 40 qualifying quarters of work, or to members of the military \n20 \n21                                             \n22  224 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2)(L). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  116  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

States have the authority to use state-only funds to provide nutrition \n4  assistance benefits to non-qualified immigrants and qualified immigrants before \n5  the five-year SNAP ban. Plaintiff States Minnesota and Washington have done \n6  so. Although such state-only nutrition benefits do not constitute “public benefits” \n7  under  the  Department’s  public  charge  test,  many  noncitizens  will  fear  that \n8  enrollment  in  state-funded  programs  will  carry  adverse  immigration \n9  consequences, and therefore disenroll or forbear enrollment. \n10  257.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n11  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n12  these food assistance programs. \n13  2.  State food assistance programs \n14  258.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer various food assistance \n15  programs,  including  SNAP.  These  programs  are  intended  to  reduce  food \n16  insecurity and assist in fulfilling the food and nutritional needs of some of the \n17  states’ most vulnerable populations. \n18  259.  Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to participate \n19  in these state-run food assistance programs. If implemented, the Rule would \n20  result in many otherwise eligible individuals—including citizens—disenrolling \n21                                             \n22  225 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2)(B)–(C) & (J). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  117  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n4  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n5  their food assistance programs. \n6  a.  The Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs \n7  261.  All Plaintiff States manage and administer a SNAP program for their \n8  residents.  In  addition,  the  Plaintiff  States  administer  numerous  other  food \n9  assistance programs, some using combined federal and state funds and some \n10  using state-only funds. While the Rule considers only SNAP-related benefits as \n11  “public benefits” under the public charge test, other state-only food assistance \n12  programs are likely to be harmed because of the broad chilling effects on eligible \n13  individuals. \n14  262.  Washington’s  Basic  Food  program  assists  eligible  children  and \n15  adults in purchasing food. The Basic Food program combines federally funded \n16  SNAP  benefits  with  the  state-funded  Food  Assistance  Program  for  legal \n17  immigrants (FAP). FAP is available to individuals who are lawfully present and \n18  meet  all  eligibility  requirements  for  SNAP  except  for  their  citizenship  or \n19  immigration status. \n20  263.  Virginia’s food assistance program includes SNAP (including debit \n21  card technology for accessing SNAP benefits); nutrition education; supplemental \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  118  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Massachusetts’s Department of Transitional Assistance (MA-DTA) \n5  assists and empowers low-income individuals and families to meet their basic \n6  needs,  improve  their  quality  of  life,  and  achieve  long-term  economic \n7  self-sufficiency through training programs, and cash and food benefits, such as \n8  SNAP. Massachusetts also funds a supplement to SNAP through the state budget. \n9  In state fiscal year 2019, the SNAP state supplement was $300,000. Another \n10  $300,000 for the state supplement has been appropriated for state fiscal year \n11  2020. \n12  265.  Maryland’s Food Supplement Program reached 684,000 Maryland \n13  residents  in  fiscal  year  2017,  or  11%  of  the  state  population.  The  state \n14  supplemented the program with approximately $3.3 million in state funds during \n15  state fiscal year 2019, and over $4.1 million in fiscal year 2020. \n16  266.  In New Mexico, approximately 25% of the State’s residents receive \n17  SNAP benefits, with enrollment capped for a family of four at the federal poverty \n18  limit of $25,100. In March 2018, for example, there were 456,190 people enrolled \n19  in the state’s program. \n20  267.

In Rhode Island, the Department of Human Services administers the \n4  SNAP program to low-income families and individuals with income less than \n5  185% of the federal poverty level. Rhode Island residents who meet eligibility \n6  requirements may receive up to $642 per month in food-assistance based on their \n7  family size and income level. \n8  269.  The State of Hawai’i Department of Human Services includes the \n9  Benefit, Employment and Support Services Division, which administers General \n10  Assistance, SNAP, TANF, TAONF, and Child Care Subsidies in the state. In \n11  state fiscal year 2018, HIDHS provided SNAP benefits to 142,991 individuals \n12  across the state, of which 5,160 are non-U.S. citizen individuals.  \n13  b.  Irreparable harm to food assistance programs \n14  270.  The Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs will be irreparably \n15  harmed by the Rule, which will result in, among other things, (1) more vulnerable \n16  families and individuals in the Plaintiff States experiencing food insecurity; and \n17  (2) severe public health concerns, including child hunger and malnutrition. \n18  271.  The Rule will cause a devastating loss of food assistance for working \n19  families and individuals in the Plaintiff States. This will occur in SNAP-related \n20  programs that are “public benefits” under the Rule as well as other state-only \n21  food assistance programs that are not “public benefits” under the Rule. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  120  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

For example, using metrics and data analysis from the above-noted \n2  Kaiser Family Foundation study, the Washington State Department of Social and \n3  Health Services (DSHS) has estimated the effects the Rule will have on food \n4  assistance participation in the state.226 Specifically, DSHS estimates the Rule will \n5  lead to disenrollment rates ranging from 15 to 35% among food assistance \n6  enrollees  in  cases  involving  a  noncitizen.  DSHS  further  estimates  that  full \n7  implementation of the Rule will reduce combined food and cash assistance to \n8  Washington families by up to $55.3 million. \n9  273.  In Massachusetts, each year between 2009 and 2012, SNAP benefits \n10  kept 141,000 residents out of poverty, including 57,000 children. It is estimated \n11  the Rule will jeopardize approximately $122 million in SNAP benefits, or almost \n12  10 percent of Massachusetts’s SNAP program. \n13  274.  In New Jersey, it is estimated that as many as 50,000 residents who \n14  are eligible for and receiving SNAP benefits might be affected by the chilling \n15  effect of the Rule. \n16  275.  Below are examples of the specific types of harms the Plaintiff \n17  States and their residents will experience. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  226 See S.

The  Plaintiff  States’  food  assistance  programs  are  specifically \n3 \ntailored to provide food assistance to low-income individuals who otherwise \n4 \nlikely could not afford to purchase sufficient food for themselves and their \n5 \nfamilies. \n6 \n277.  Individuals who are eligible to participate in the Plaintiff States’ \n7 \nfood assistance programs but who forgo participation because of the Rule are \n8 \nlikely to experience greater food insecurity and will struggle to provide food for \n9 \nthemselves and their families. \n10 \n278.  In Massachusetts, speculation about the impact of the Rule has \n11 \nalready spurred a decline in numbers of participants in public nutrition programs \n12 \nsuch as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \n13 \nChildren (WIC), even though the program is not a “public benefit” under the \n14 \nRule. Since February 2018, when Reuters released a draft of the Proposed Rule, \n15 \nwhich included WIC as a public benefit, there has been a 2,000 person decrease \n16 \nfrom 2017 levels in WIC participation in Massachusetts. \n17 \n279.  The number of individuals and households disenrolling from or \n18 \nforgoing  participation  in  the  Plaintiff  States’  SNAP  programs,  which  are \n19 \nconsidered “public benefits” under the Rule, is likely to be even greater. \n20 \n280.  This increase in food insecurity and hunger directly undermines the \n21 \npurposes and effectiveness of the Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs, \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  122  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.652   Page 130 of 185\n \n1  which are intended to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition for the States’ most \n2  vulnerable residents. \n3  (2)  Significant public health concerns \n4  281.  The  Plaintiff  States’  food  assistance  programs  are  specifically \n5  tailored to assist working families who might not otherwise be able to afford \n6  sufficient food for their children. \n7  282.  The  projected  reduction  in  the  number  of  immigrants  and \n8  mixed-status families participating in these programs because of fears associated \n9  with the Rule will undermine the programs and lead to significant public health \n10  concerns, including increases in child hunger and malnutrition. \n11  283.  Children  who  experience  hunger,  food  insecurity,  and \n12  malnourishment are more likely to suffer deficits in cognitive development, \n13  behavioral problems, and poor health, along with reduced learning and academic \n14  achievement, all of which tends to diminish future earning potential. Children \n15  who are hungry will experience more difficulty in school and will require greater \n16  resources from the Plaintiff States’ educational systems.  \n17  284.  Further,  eligibility  for  many  federal  school  breakfast  and  lunch \n18  programs—which provide free or reduced price meals to eligible students—are \n19  based at least in part on enrollment in SNAP. Thus, although the Rule does not \n20  expressly consider receipt of free or reduced price school meals as a “public \n21  benefit” under the public charge test, the Rule will undoubtedly have a negative \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  123  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In \n2  this way, the Rule will negatively affect far more assistance programs than only \n3  the limited programs it expressly identifies as public benefits. \n4  285.  The Plaintiff States will ultimately bear the higher healthcare and \n5  other costs associated with treating the medical conditions resulting from this \n6  unnecessary child malnourishment. \n7  286.  For this reason, the increase in food insecurity resulting from the \n8  Rule would undermine not only the Plaintiff States’ interests in healthy, stable, \n9  productive  residents  and  workforces,  but  also  a  purported  goal of  the  Rule \n10  itself—to “better ensure” that immigrants “are self-sufficient, i.e., do not depend \n11  on public resources to meet their needs.”  \n12  C.  Housing Assistance Programs \n13  287.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n14  federally  funded  housing  assistance  programs  for  eligible  individuals  and \n15  families, including noncitizens. The Rule, however, will irreparably harm the \n16  Plaintiff States by undermining the effectiveness of these programs, as eligible \n17  individuals and their families will disenroll or refrain from seeking housing \n18  assistance for fear of jeopardizing their ability to immigrate. \n19  1.  Federal housing assistance benefits \n20  288.  In general, individuals and families with incomes at or below 50 to \n21  80% of their area median income are eligible for federal housing assistance. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  124  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Thus, federal housing assistance serves only about 25% of eligible \n4  households. \n5  289.  The Housing Act of 1937227 provides for subsidies to be paid from \n6  the  U.S.  government  to  local  public  housing  agencies  to  improve  living \n7  conditions for low-income families (Subsidized Housing Program). There are \n8  currently approximately 1 million units in the federal public housing subsidies \n9  program.  Nearly  two-thirds  of  public  housing  subsidies  households  are \n10  considered  “extremely  low  income,”  with  incomes  below  30%  of  the  Area \n11  Median Income and an average annual income of $14,605. Approximately 3.3 \n12  million children live in such subsidized public housing.228 \n13  290.  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (Housing Voucher \n14  Program) is the federal government’s major program for assisting low-income \n15  families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing \n16  in the private market.229 Housing choice vouchers are administered locally by \n17 \n18                                             \n19  227 Pub.

The Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program \n4  also provides housing assistance to low-income families.230 This HUD program \n5  provides critical affordable housing stock to more than 2 million people—in 1.2 \n6  million households—across the country. HUD contracts with private owners to \n7  rent units in their housing developments, paying a subsidy that helps pay tenants’ \n8  rent. \n9  292.  The Housing Voucher and PBRA programs (together, Section 8 \n10  programs) and the Subsidized Housing Program help prevent homelessness and \n11  other kinds of housing instabilities. To participate in the Section 8 programs, \n12  families  must  demonstrate  incomes  at  or  below  certain threshold  levels;  an \n13  absence  of  criminal-  or  drug-related  records  and  evictions;  and  proof  of \n14  citizenship or eligible immigrant status. \n15  293.  Under the Welfare Reform Act and the Housing and Community \n16  Development Act of 1980, lawful permanent residents and certain other qualified \n17  immigrants are eligible for Section 8 programs.231 The Welfare Reform Act’s five \n18 \n19                                             \n20  230 42 U.S.C. 1437f; 24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880–81, 883–84, and 886. \n21  231  Pub.

The  Rule  treats  as  “public  benefits”  (1)  Section  8  Housing \n4  Assistance  under  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher  program;  (2)  Section  8 \n5  Project-Based Rental Assistance; and (3) Public Housing under Section 9 of the \n6  Housing Act of 1937. Under the Rule, an immigrant’s participation in any of \n7  these programs could constitute a heavily weighed negative factor favoring a \n8  public charge determination, even though Congress has explicitly authorized \n9  eligible noncitizens to participate in those programs.233 \n10  2.  State housing assistance programs \n11  295.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer a variety of housing \n12  assistance programs, including by using a combination of state, federal, and \n13  private funding to provide safe and stable shelter options for eligible individuals \n14  and their families. Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to \n15  participate in these housing assistance programs. \n16                                             \n17  232  8  U.S.C.  § 1613(a);  8  C.F.R.  §  213a.1;  Eligibility  Restrictions  on \n18  Noncitizens:  Inapplicability  of  Welfare  Reform  Act  Restrictions  on  Federal \n19  Means-Tested Public Benefits, Dep’t of Housing and Urban Devel., 65 Fed.

The chilling effect of the Rule, however, will deprive vulnerable \n2  individuals of opportunities to obtain such housing assistance, and irreparably \n3  harm the functioning of the Plaintiff States’ programs. \n4  a.  The Plaintiff States’ housing assistance programs \n5  297.  All  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  housing  assistance \n6  programs. Working together with community, state, and national partners, the \n7  Plaintiff  States  provide  effective  programs  seeking  to  prevent  and  alleviate \n8  homelessness  and  housing  instability  for  their  most  vulnerable  residents. \n9  Although  the  Department  does  not  consider  receipt  of  state-only  housing \n10  assistance  as  a  “public  benefit”—unlike  the  federal  programs  described  \n11  above— these state programs are likely to be harmed by the Rule’s broad chilling \n12  effects on eligible individuals and families who forgo participation for fear of \n13  jeopardizing their ability to immigrate. \n14  298.  For example, the Washington Department of Commerce administers \n15  Washington’s state and federal housing assistance funding. The Department of \n16  Commerce manages the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, a 33-year-old \n17  source of capital to develop and preserve affordable housing for low-income and \n18  vulnerable Washingtonians. County governments act as lead grantees and are \n19  responsible for directing and managing the local homeless response system. \n20  These local homeless response systems assist homeless families and individuals \n21  who need help obtaining or maintaining permanent housing. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  128  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Washington’s housing assistance programs receive approximately \n2  $196 million per year in funding from a variety of sources, including private \n3  funders as well as federal, state, and local governments. Using these funds, the \n4  programs seek to both (1) stabilize households that are currently in permanent \n5  housing but are at risk of homelessness; and (2) provide homeless individuals and \n6  families  with  emergency  shelter,  temporary  housing,  or  placement  into \n7  permanent housing. \n8  300.  DSHS administers the Washington Housing and Essential Needs \n9  (HEN) Referral Program, which provides access to essential needs items and \n10  potential  rental assistance  for low income  individuals  and families  who  are \n11  unable to work for at least 90 days due to a physical and/or mental incapacity. \n12  DSHS provides this assistance even if the individuals are ineligible to receive \n13  federal funds. \n14  301.  The  Massachusetts  Department  of  Housing  and  Community \n15  Development (MA-DHCD) similarly administers numerous federal and state \n16  housing  programs  and  services  to  promote  safe  and  affordable  housing  for \n17  residents. In particular, MA-DHCD oversees the operations of approximately 240 \n18  local  housing  authorities  as  well  as  programs  that  provide  federal-  and \n19  state-funded rental vouchers to low-income families; assist families in moving \n20  from shelter into housing or in avoiding homelessness altogether; and provide \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  129  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Massachusetts’s  state  budget  allocated  over  $500  million  for \n4  homelessness and housing safety net programs and services in fiscal year 2019. \n5  The  Massachusetts  Rental  Voucher  Program  (MRVP),  which  provides  both \n6  mobile and project-based vouchers, alone received $100 million in state funding, \n7  and Massachusetts’s Emergency Assistance (MA-EA) program, through which \n8  MA-DHCD funds family shelters, received over $175 million. \n9  303.  The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development \n10  (VDHCD) and Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA), under the \n11  oversight of Virginia’s Secretary of Commerce and Trade, administer Virginia’s \n12  housing assistance programs. VDHCD creates safe and affordable housing by \n13  regulating building and fire codes while investing more than $100 million each \n14  year into affordable housing and community development projects throughout \n15  Virginia. VHDA promotes access to home loans, homeowner and homebuyer \n16  education to ensure quality, affordable housing for all in Virginia. \n17  304.  VDHA also administers the federal Housing Choice Voucher and \n18  Housing Credit programs in Virginia, and administers multiple programs that \n19  offer  state  and  federal  funding  to  address  homelessness.  For  example,  the \n20  Virginia Homeless Solutions Programs is a homeless and special needs housing \n21  funding source that supports the development and implementation of localized \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  130  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

VDHCD also administers the housing opportunities \n3  for persons with AIDS program, HUD funding dedicated to the housing needs of \n4  low income people living with HIV/AIDS. \n5  b.  Irreparable harms to the Plaintiff States’ housing \nassistance programs \n6 \n305.  The Rule will lead to reduced immigrant participation in federal \n7 \nhousing assistance programs for eligible residents of the Plaintiff States. \n8 \n306.  Further,  while  the  Rule  does  not  treat  the  above  state  housing \n9 \nassistance  programs  as  “public  benefits,”  because  of  the  complexity  of  the \n10 \nregulatory regime and widespread public confusion and fear, it will nevertheless \n11 \ndeter many immigrants and mixed-status families from participating in state-\n12 \nfunded housing assistance programs for which they are eligible. \n13 \n307.  For  these  reasons,  the  Rule  will  cause  irreparable  harm  to  the \n14 \nPlaintiff States. Among other harms, the Rule will (1) lead to increased numbers \n15 \nof homeless individuals and families in the Plaintiff States; and (2) result in \n16 \npoorer health, educational, and other outcomes for vulnerable children who reside \n17 \nin  the  Plaintiff  States  and  who,  because  of  their  or  their  family  member’s \n18 \nimmigration status, will be deprived of opportunities for emergency shelter or \n19 \nplacement into permanent housing. \n20 \n308.  Below are examples of the specific types of harms the Plaintiff \n21 \nStates and their residents will experience. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  131  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.661   Page 139 of 185\n \n1  (1)  Homelessness and other public health consequences \n2  309.  If  the  Rule  is implemented,  it  will cause  increased numbers  of \n3  individuals and families to experience homelessness in the Plaintiff States, as \n4  individuals who are otherwise eligible for such assistance will forgo seeking it \n5  for fear of jeopardizing their or their family member’s ability to immigrate. \n6  310.  The Rule provides that officials will consider Public Housing and \n7  Section 8 participation in making a determination regarding whether someone is \n8  likely to become a public charge. This will deter many eligible households from \n9  seeking benefits and will delay placement of homeless families into permanent \n10  housing. \n11  311.  For example, in Washington, over 78,000 low-income households \n12  use Public Housing and Section 8 assistance to afford modest rents and make \n13  ends meet. Most of these individuals are either working themselves or come from \n14  working families that cannot afford fair market rents.  \n15  312.  In  Massachusetts,  approximately  175,000  households  receive \n16  Section 8 or Public Housing assistance. Massachusetts’s MRVP supported 5,100 \n17  households as of January 2013. \n18  313.  In Maryland, approximately 84,000 households receive Section 8 or \n19  Public Housing assistance. Approximately 48,000 Maryland households receive \n20  federal rental assistance through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  132  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Further,  many  immigrant  workers  are  employed  in  typically \n2  low-wage fields such as agriculture, construction, building and grounds cleaning \n3  and maintenance, and food service, which make it difficult for them to afford \n4  current market-based rents. \n5  315.  In Massachusetts, large numbers of low-wage immigrant workers \n6  are employed in the health care system, serving in positions such as home health \n7  aides and nursing assistants. A minimum wage worker in Massachusetts would \n8  need to work, on average, at least 104 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom \n9  apartment.  \n10  316.  Washington currently provides 50,000 families per year with rental \n11  assistance, and about 15,000 of these families have children. About 14% of these \n12  families who receive rental assistance and have children are immigrant families.  \n13  317.  Washington has recently faced increased homelessness, with an \n14  estimated 3,285  homeless  families  with  children.  About 14%  of  the State’s \n15  homeless families with children are immigrant families. Available data suggests \n16  the  Rule  is  likely  to  compel  over  10,000  immigrants  and  their  families  in \n17  Washington to give up the lifeline assistance that prevents them from suffering \n18  homelessness.  For  other  eligible  families,  implementation  of  the  Rule  will \n19  significantly delay their placement into permanent housing. \n20  318.  The  homeless  population  in  Massachusetts  increased  by  2,500 \n21  people, or 14%, in 2018. Massachusetts estimates that about 3,600 families with \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  133  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

This number does not include families who are doubled up, living in unsafe \n3  conditions, or sleeping in their cars. \n4  319.  Further, because many of the placements into permanent housing \n5  are related to Public Housing or Section 8 programs (17% of placements in \n6  Washington  last  year),  the  Rule  will  hinder  the  Plaintiff  States’  ability  to \n7  successfully transition homeless individuals and their families into permanent \n8  housing, significantly harming their residents who are otherwise unable to obtain \n9  permanent housing. \n10  (2)  Poorer health, educational, and other outcomes \n11  320.  The Rule will also lead to other harmful related costs for the Plaintiff \n12  States and their homeless and housing-insecure populations. \n13  321.  Access to good housing is well-recognized as a social determinant \n14  of public health, as families and individuals without stable housing are more \n15  likely to use emergency services and require hospitalizations.  \n16  322.  Data shows that children who suffer homelessness and housing \n17  insecurity experience dramatically poorer health outcomes, including having \n18  twice as many respiratory infections and being three times more likely to be \n19  hospitalized for asthma. This creates significant public health concerns for the \n20  Plaintiff States. \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  134  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.664   Page 142 of 185\n \n1  323.  Further,  children  who  experience  homelessness  and  housing \n2  insecurity also tend to suffer worse educational outcomes and generally have \n3  access to fewer and less profitable work opportunities. This results in harm to the \n4  Plaintiff States’ economies and job markets.  \n5  324.  Directly contrary to the supposed purpose of the Rule, needlessly \n6  depriving children of access to housing assistance only makes it more likely these \n7  children will require additional assistance as they grow older and will carry with \n8  them the adverse effects of their childhood homelessness. \n9  325.  The many negative effects of increased homelessness in families \n10  with children will irreparably harm the families, their children, and the Plaintiff \n11  States, which will ultimately bear responsibility for the many increased costs and \n12  other consequences associated with childhood homelessness.  \n13  D.  Cash Assistance Programs \n14  326.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n15  federally funded cash assistance programs for eligible individuals and families, \n16  including noncitizens. Under the Rule, however, eligible individuals and their \n17  families will opt not to seek critical financial assistance for fear of jeopardizing \n18  their immigration status. \n19  1.  Federal cash assistance benefits \n20  327.  Congress  created  the  Temporary  Assistance  to  Needy  Families \n21  (TANF) program in 1996 as part of the Welfare Reform Act. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  135  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.665   Page 143 of 185\n \n1  328.  TANF  provides  grant  funds  to  states  to  provide  families  with \n2  financial assistance and related support services including childcare assistance, \n3  job preparation, and work assistance. \n4  329.  To  qualify  for  TANF,  individuals  must  either  be  pregnant  or \n5  responsible  for  a  child  under  19,  have  a  low  or  very  low  income,  and  be \n6  unemployed, under-employed, or about to be unemployed.  \n7  330.  As the first word in the program name suggests, TANF was designed \n8  as a temporary benefit to help otherwise self-sufficient, working families get back \n9  on their feet while experiencing joblessness, unanticipated adverse life events, or \n10  other hard times.  \n11  331.  Federal  law  imposes  work  requirements  applicable  to  TANF \n12  participants.  It  requires  states  administering  TANF  to  (1)  ensure  that  cash \n13  assistance recipients are working within 24 months of receiving assistance, or \n14  sooner if the state deems them ready for work, and (2) achieve annual work \n15  participation rates. Fifty percent of all TANF families with one work-eligible \n16  adult and 90 percent of families with two work-eligible adults must engage in \n17  specified work or work-related activities for a minimum number of weekly hours.  \n18  332.  The Welfare Reform Act allows qualified immigrants, including \n19  lawful permanent residents, to participate in TANF after five years in qualified \n20  immigrant status. Certain qualified immigrants are exempt from the five year ban, \n21  including members of the military and veterans (and their spouses and children).  \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  136  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.666   Page 144 of 185\n \n1  333.   States  are permitted  under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act  to  provide \n2  state-funded cash assistance benefits to nonexempt qualified immigrants during \n3  the five year TANF ban to replace the loss of federal benefits, as well as to \n4  provide state-only-funded assistance to nonqualified immigrants. \n5  334.  The Rule treats TANF as a “public benefit” program in which an \n6  immigrant’s participation could constitute a heavily weighed negative factor \n7  favoring a public charge determination. \n8  335.  The  Rule  also  treats  some  state-only-funded  cash  assistance  as \n9  “public benefits” in which an immigrant’s participation could constitute a heavily \n10  weighed negative factor favoring a public charge determination. The Rule’s \n11  definition of public benefit includes “[s]tate or local cash benefit programs for \n12  income maintenance (often called ‘General Assistance in the State context, but \n13  which may exist under other names).”234 That ambiguous definition does not \n14  provide  clear  notice  of  the  state  cash  assistance  programs  in  which  an \n15  immigrant’s  participation  may  “heavily”  weigh  in  favor  of  a  public  charge \n16  determination. \n17  336.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n18  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functioning and effectiveness of \n19  their cash assistance programs. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  234 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b)(1)(iii)). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  137  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.667   Page 145 of 185\n \n1  2.  State cash assistance programs \n2  337.  All  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  financial \n3  assistance programs intended to provide modest monetary assistance to eligible \n4  residents  and  their  families  for  maintaining  financial  stability  in  certain \n5  circumstances.  Certain  classes  of  citizens  and  noncitizens  are  eligible  to \n6  participate in these programs. \n7  338.  The Rule, however, considers as “public benefits” not only federal \n8  cash assistance programs such as TANF but also state and local cash benefit \n9  programs for income maintenance. As a result, the Rule will deprive vulnerable \n10  individuals and their families of opportunities to access these programs and \n11  achieve financial stability. \n12  a.  The Plaintiff States’ cash assistance programs \n13  339.  All Plaintiff States manage and administer cash assistance programs \n14  to assist eligible individuals and their families in dealing with financial hardship. \n15  340.  For  example, the  Washington  Department of Social  and  Health \n16  Services administers Washington’s TANF program as well as several other cash \n17  assistance programs for eligible individuals. \n18  341.  Washington’s TANF program provides cash assistance to certain \n19  parents or caregivers and pregnant individuals to bolster their ability to support \n20  their families’ foundational needs, including a safe home, healthy food, reliable \n21  transportation, and school supplies. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  138  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.668   Page 146 of 185\n \n1  342.  During the 2017 to 2019 biennium, the Washington TANF program \n2  cost over $300 million in combined federal and state service and administrative \n3  costs, including over $90 million in total state funding. \n4  343.  Washington  complements  TANF  with  a  state-funded  program \n5  called State Family Assistance (SFA). SFA is available to individuals who meet \n6  TANF’s income requirements but are ineligible for TANF for other reasons, \n7  including  certain  noncitizens.  Washington  extends  SFA  cash  assistance  to \n8  qualified immigrants during the five year TANF ban, as well as to non-qualified \n9  immigrants who are residents of Washington and legally present in the United \n10  States.235 Some families receive a mix of TANF and SFA based on the eligibility \n11  or immigrant status of each family member. Under the Rule, SFA constitutes a \n12  state cash benefit program for income maintenance in which an immigrant’s \n13  participation could constitute a “heavily weighed negative factor” favoring a \n14  public charge determination. \n15  344.  The Virginia Department of Social Services administers Virginia’s \n16  TANF program. Virginia’s TANF program provides eligible families with a \n17  monthly cash payment to meet their basic needs. Virginia’s TANF program \n18  emphasizes personal responsibility. Participants may be provided with services \n19  such as job skills training, work experience, job readiness training, child care \n20  assistance, transportation and other work related expenses. The Virginia TANF \n21                                             \n22  235 WAC 388-400-0010, 388-424-0001, 388-468-0005. \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  139  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.669   Page 147 of 185\n \n1  program also includes an employment advancement program that is designed to \n2  provide proven service approaches and strategies to help current and former \n3  TANF clients to prepare to enter, succeed, and advance in the workplace. The \n4  expected outcome of this program are improved job placement, improved job \n5  retention, higher employment wages upon entry, and increased wage gains from \n6  job advancement. \n7  345.  In Massachusetts, MA-DTA manages aid programs designed to help \n8  low-income individuals and families escape poverty, including the Transitional \n9  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), Massachusetts’s TANF cash \n10  assistance program. \n11  346.  Massachusetts’s TAFDC program provides cash assistance, child \n12  care, and transportation support for job assistance to families with children and \n13  pregnant women with little or no assets or income, to meet their emergency and \n14  transitional needs. \n15  347.  In state fiscal year 2019, Massachusetts’s TAFDC program spent \n16  $841 million, including $382 million in state funds. \n17  348.  The Hawai’i Department of Human Services’ Benefit, Employment \n18  and Support Services Division administers the General Assistance (GA) program \n19  which provides cash benefits for food, clothing, shelter, and other essentials to \n20  adults ages 18 through 64 years, without minor dependents, who are temporarily \n21  disabled and who do not qualify for Social Security. As a 100% state-funded \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  140  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  Hawai’i  Department  of  Human  Services  also  administers \n9  Temporary  Assistance  for  Other  Needy  Families  (TAONF)  in  Hawai’i. \n10  Approximately 1,695 individuals receive TAONF benefits, of which 988 are non-\n11  U.S. citizen individuals. Approximately 848 COFA residents are recipients of \n12  TAONF, with a corresponding state fiscal note of $1,700,382.74. \n13  350.  The Plaintiff States administer other programs that, due to the Rule’s \n14  ambiguity,  may  or  may  not  be  considered  “public  benefits”  in  which  an \n15  immigrant’s participation would weigh in favor of a public charge determination.  \n16  351.  For  example,  Washington’s  Aged,  Blind,  or  Disabled  Cash \n17  Assistance Program is a state-funded program that provides financial assistance \n18  to certain eligible, low-income individuals who are age 65 or older, blind, or are \n19  determined  likely  to  meet  specific  Supplemental  Security  Income  disability \n20  criteria  expected  to  last  at  least  12 consecutive  months.  Washington  also \n21  administers  the  state-funded  Pregnant  Women  Assistance  Program,  which \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  141  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.671   Page 149 of 185\n \n1  provides financial assistance to certain pregnant noncitizens ineligible for TANF; \n2  the Consolidated Emergency Assistance Program, which provides emergency \n3  assistance  to  families  and  pregnant  women;  the  Diversion  Cash  Assistance \n4  Program,  which  provides  alternative  assistance  to  TANF  for  families  with \n5  short-term financial needs; the State Supplemental Program, which assists certain \n6  individuals while the Social Security Administration determines their eligibility \n7  for  Supplemental  Security  Income;  and  the  Additional  Requirements  for \n8  Emergent  Needs  Program,  which  assists  individuals  in  keeping  housing  or \n9  utilities. \n10  352.  In Massachusetts, MA-DTA similarly administers Emergency Aid \n11  for  Elderly,  Disabled,  and  Children  (EAEDC),  a  wholly  state-funded  cash \n12  assistance  program  for  persons  who  are  age  65  or  older,  disabled  adults, \n13  caretakers, and children who are not able to get TAFDC. \n14  353.  In Hawai’i, the Assistance to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) \n15  program is 100% state-funded and provides cash benefits for food, clothing, \n16  shelter, and other essentials to a gap group of Hawai’i residents. They are elderly \n17  adults (65 years of age or older) or individuals who meet the Social Security \n18  Administration definition of disabled or blind. Most are not eligible for federal \n19  Social Security benefits and living below the poverty line but at least having some \n20  form  of  assistance,  will  be  adversely  affected  and  become  destitute.  \n21  Approximately 924 individuals receive ABD benefits, of which 753 are non-U.S. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  142  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.672   Page 150 of 185\n \n1  citizen individuals. Approximately 492 COFA residents receive ABD, with a \n2  corresponding state fiscal note of $1,852,454.69. \n3  354.  Due to the Rule’s ambiguity, it is uncertain whether the Department \n4  would  treat  an  immigrant’s  participation  in  these  state-only  cash  assistance \n5  programs  as  a  “heavily  weighed  negative  factor”  favoring  a  public  charge \n6  determination.  Regardless,  the  chilling  effect  of  such  ambiguity  will  be \n7  substantial, resulting in many individuals opting not to seek state-funded cash-\n8  assistance benefits for which they may be eligible. \n9  b.  Irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ cash assistance \nprograms \n10 \n355.  The Rule will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States and their \n11 \ncash assistance programs, as eligible individuals and families facing financial \n12 \nhardship will elect not to access the program benefits for fear of jeopardizing \n13 \ntheir own or a family member’s immigration status. Due to the Rule’s ambiguity, \n14 \nas well as widespread fear and confusion among immigrant communities, those \n15 \nchilling effects will reduce enrollment both in cash assistance programs in which \n16 \na noncitizen’s participation could trigger a public charge determination and in \n17 \nprograms the Department would not consider a state or local cash benefit program \n18 \nfor income maintenance. \n19 \n356.  The Rule will thus irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by increasing \n20 \nthe number of their residents whose financial hardships lead to loss of medical \n21 \ncoverage or housing. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  143  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.673   Page 151 of 185\n \n1  357.  For  example,  Washington’s  DSHS  estimates  that  full \n2  implementation of the Rule will reduce combined food and cash assistance to \n3  Washington  families  by  approximately  $23.7  to  $55.3  million  as  eligible \n4  individuals either terminate their benefits or decline to seek assistance. \n5  358.  The Rule will irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by deterring \n6  individuals from seeking temporary, hardship-based cash assistance they are \n7  otherwise eligible to receive. Without access to temporary financial assistance, \n8  these  individuals  and  their  families  are  less  likely  to  be  able  to  weather \n9  unexpected financial hardships, increasing the likelihood they will lose valuable \n10  stability in the form of housing, transportation, or medical coverage or care. \n11  359.  The resulting economic dislocations will cause significant harm to \n12  the Plaintiff States, which will ultimately bear the greater costs associated with \n13  noncitizens’  or  mixed-status  families’  loss  of  financial  stability,  medical \n14  coverage, or housing. \n15  E.  Other State Benefits Programs \n16  360.  In  addition  to  irreparably  harming  the  Plaintiff  States  by \n17  undermining the proper functioning and effectiveness of their medical, housing, \n18  food, and cash assistance programs, implementation of the Rule will also imperil \n19  a host of other critical, state-managed assistance programs.  \n20  361.  These  various  state-administered  programs  include  but  are  not \n21  limited to long-term care for elderly and disabled residents, job and employment \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  144  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.674   Page 152 of 185\n \n1  training programs, support and advocacy services for crime victims and energy \n2  assistance.  \n3  362.  Although the Rule does not expressly consider participation in these \n4  programs as a “public benefit” under the public charge test, the programs will \n5  nevertheless be harmed by the chilling effect the Rule has on eligible individuals. \n6  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable harm to the \n7  Plaintiff States and their residents by undermining the functions and effectiveness \n8  of these and similar assistance programs. \n9  1.  Long term services and supports for elderly and disabled \nresidents \n10 \n363.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer various programs to \n11 \nprovide care for elderly and disabled residents. \n12 \n364.  Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is a specific category of \n13 \ncare that includes both paid and unpaid medical and personal care services, which \n14 \nmay be provided in a person’s home, a community residential setting, or an \n15 \ninstitution such as a nursing home. \n16 \n365.  For example, in Washington, the Aging and Long-Term Support \n17 \nAdministration (ALTSA) is an agency within DSHS that administers LTSS \n18 \nservices to the State’s low-income elderly and disabled individuals. \n19 \n366.  In Virginia, DMAS and the Department of Aging and Rehabilitative \n20 \nServices  (DARS)  are  agencies  with  the  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  145  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.675   Page 153 of 185\n \n1  Resources  (HSS)  that  administer  long  terms  services  and  supports  for \n2  low-income elderly people and people with disabilities. \n3  367.  There is rapidly growing demand for workers who provide LTSS \n4  (called Direct Care Workers) because of the increasing population of individuals \n5  over the age of 65. \n6  368.  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n7  demand for Direct Care Workers nationally will grow from 2.3 million in 2015 \n8  to 3.4 million in 2030. Without a ready supply of workers, Plaintiff States’ \n9  programs and elderly and disabled residents will struggle to recruit sufficient \n10  staff. \n11  369.  According  to  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office, \n12  approximately 23% of Direct Care Workers are immigrants. \n13  370.  The average annual earnings for these jobs are at or below the \n14  federal  poverty  level.  Accordingly,  many  of  these  workers  rely  on  public \n15  assistance for health care, food, and housing. For example, in Massachusetts over \n16  40 percent of direct care workers depend on Medicaid, SNAP, or other benefits. \n17  Under the Rule, however, these workers will be discouraged from seeking such \n18  benefits, as doing so might jeopardize their immigration status. \n19  371.  Other  factors  for consideration  under the  Rule, including  credit \n20  history, education, and language, are all likely to increase the chances many \n21  Direct Care Workers will be considered a “public charge.” \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  146  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.676   Page 154 of 185\n \n1  372.  Under the Rule, many immigrants who are currently Direct Care \n2  Workers  or  would  become  employed  in  such  positions  would  likely  be \n3  considered a public charge. A decrease in LTSS labor will increase the risk of \n4  injury, institutionalization, and death for the Plaintiff States’ many vulnerable \n5  elderly and disabled residents, including citizens and noncitizens. \n6  373.  This will also increase costs for states like Washington to ensure that \n7  their elderly and disabled residents are properly cared for, including by increasing \n8  costs to Medicaid in the Apple Health program. \n9  374.  The  resulting  labor  shortage  will  also  force  more  citizens  into \n10  nursing homes, destroying decades of federal and state efforts to keep aging \n11  individuals  in  their  own  homes.  The  Plaintiff  States  will  therefore  suffer  a \n12  diminished ability to administer elderly and disabled support services in a manner \n13  approved by the States’ residents, legislatures, and governors. \n14  2.  Job and employment training programs \n15  375.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  job  and \n16  employment training programs. Although these programs are not identified as \n17  “public benefits” under the Rule, they are likely to be affected by the chilling \n18  effect the rule will have on eligible populations. \n19  376.  For example, in Washington, DSHS administers employment and \n20  training programs designed to provide recipients of cash and food benefits with \n21  opportunities to gain skills, secure employment, and escape poverty. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  147  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nFOR DECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 31    filed 09/05/19    PageID.677   Page 155 of 185\n \n1  377.  In combination with other state agencies and community partners, \n2  DSHS  develops  custom  plans  to  support  people  in  building  skills  through \n3  employment  and  education  training.  DSHS  tailors  these  programs  to  serve \n4  particular  populations,  including  programs  specifically  designed  to  assist \n5  noncitizen families. \n6  378.  Washington also has a WorkFirst program for families receiving \n7  TANF  or  SFA  benefits.  The  WorkFirst  program  provides  families  with \n8  opportunities to engage in work activities that support financial stability and \n9  resilience, including a Limited English Proficiency Pathway Program offering \n10  employment  services,  job  skills  training,  and  English-as-a-Second-Language \n11  services to nearly 5,000 people every year. DSHS infuses state funding into this \n12  program to serve noncitizens who are ineligible for federally-funded services. \n13  379.  Further,  the  Washington  State  Basic  Food  Employment  and \n14  Training program (BFET) provides job search training, self-directed job search, \n15  educational services, skills training, and other employment opportunities to Basic \n16  Food (SNAP) recipients. This is an example of a program that, although not \n17  directly identified as a “public benefit” itself under the Rule, is likely to be \n18  severely affected because of its close relation to programs that are considered \n19  public benefits, such as SNAP. \n20  380.  BFET is an important part of the State’s comprehensive workforce \n21  development system, as the program serves the needs of low-income individuals, \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  148  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Washington dedicates state funding to support a BFET program \n5  designed specifically to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services \n6  to more than 1,000 noncitizens in Washington. This program is available only to \n7  those individuals eligible to receive other federal benefits. \n8  382.  In Virginia, the Department of Social Services (DSS) administers \n9  employment and training programs designed to provide recipients of cash and \n10  food benefits with opportunities to gain skills, secure employment, and get out of \n11  poverty.  The  Department  for  Aging  and  Rehabilitative  Services  provides \n12  employment and vocational rehabilitation services for low-income elderly people \n13  and individuals with disabilities and their families. The Virginia Department for \n14  the Blind and Vision Impaired provides employment services for low-income \n15  blind and visually impaired individuals and their families. In combination with \n16  other state agencies and community partners, DSS supports people in building \n17  skills through employment and education training. DSS has specific programs \n18  that service particular populations, including programs specifically designed to \n19  assist noncitizen families. \n20  383.

Virginia also provides former TANF clients opportunities to \n2  prepare to enter, succeed, and advance in the workplace.  \n3  384.  In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth’s Department of Transitional \n4  Assistance administers and funds, in cooperation with the federal government, a \n5  skills and employment program, Path to Work, for SNAP recipients who need \n6  help  finding  work.  The  program  reflects  the  agency’s  statutory  mandate  to \n7  connect participating SNAP recipients with “education, employment and training \n8  activities.” Because of the program’s close relationship to SNAP, however, it is \n9  likely to be severely affected by implementation of the Rule. Even though the \n10  program is not itself identified as a “public benefit” under the Rule, SNAP \n11  benefits are considered to be “public benefits” that may result in a public charge \n12  determination. Thus, eligible immigrants are likely to forgo participating in either \n13  program, particularly where participation in one is contingent on participation in \n14  the other. \n15  385.  Due  to  the  Rule’s  ambiguity  and  because  it  considers  SNAP \n16  enrollment  in  making  public  charge  determinations,  eligible  immigrants  are \n17  likely  to  be  uncertain  of  whether  their  participation  in  one  of  the  above \n18  employment training programs would be a negative factor weighing in favor of a \n19  public charge determination. Immigrants will therefore be strongly discouraged \n20  from  accessing  the  above  programs,  many  of  which  are  based  on  SNAP \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  150  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In this way, the Rule affects far more benefits programs than are \n2  identified in the text of the rule. \n3  386.  Reduced  participation  in  the  above  training  programs  will \n4  negatively  impact  the  Plaintiff  States’  residents,  employers,  economy,  and \n5  pursuit of their policy priorities. \n6  387.  Residents who might otherwise have participated in the programs \n7  will be deprived of the opportunity to develop their skills, increase their earning \n8  potential, and improve their quality of life. Ironically, the change will leave these \n9  residents more vulnerable and more likely, in the long term, to rely on emergency \n10  public assistance. Employers will lose access to a more highly trained pool of \n11  potential employees. The Plaintiff States’ economies will lose the benefits of \n12  would-be participants’ increased productivity. The Plaintiff States will be unable \n13  to  achieve  their  policy  goals  of  providing  the  greatest  possible  access  to \n14  workforce development in order to maximize the public welfare. \n15  388.  Lower participation in job and employment training programs will \n16  also have the self-defeating result of making fewer people capable of becoming \n17  independent from public benefits, directly contradicting the supposed purpose of \n18  the Rule. \n19  389.  In sum, the Rule will harm the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests \n20  in  administering  comprehensive  work  training  programs  critical  to  their \n21  continued economic growth and success. \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  151  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ support services for \ncrime victims \n2 \n390.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  services  to \n3 \nadvocate on behalf of and provide support for crime victims. Although these and \n4 \nsimilar programs are not considered “public benefits” under the Rule, they are \n5 \nnevertheless likely to be negatively affected by the chilling effect the Rule will \n6 \nhave on individuals who are eligible to access these programs.  \n7 \n391.  For example, Washington State has established the Office of Crime \n8 \nVictims  Advocacy  (OCVA)  to  serve  as  an  advocate  for  crime  victims  in \n9 \nWashington. OCVA’s mission is to support, heal, and assist crime victims in \n10 \nreaching their full potential. \n11 \n392.  OCVA supports crime victims in obtaining services and resources, \n12 \nassists communities with planning and implementing the provision of services to \n13 \ncrime victims, advises local and state government agencies that assist crime \n14 \nvictims, and administers grant funds for community programs that support crime \n15 \nvictims. \n16 \n393.  The Virginia General Assembly promulgated the Virginia Victim \n17 \nand Witness of Crime Act to service crime victims, including providing support \n18 \nrelated  to  financial  assistance  and  social  services  in  Virginia.  The  Virginia \n19 \nVictims Fund (VVF) is a state program created to help victims of violent crimes \n20 \nwith  out  of  pocket  expenses,  including  medical  bills,  prescriptions,  funeral \n21 \nexpenses, lost wages, temporary housing, counseling services, and many other \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  152  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  Victims  Services  Team  within  the  Virginia’s  Department  of \n2  Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) provides grant funding, training, technical \n3  assistance, and written resources to programs and individuals serving crime \n4  victims. The DCJS and the VVF are the lead coordinating agencies in Virginia \n5  for  crime  victims  during  critical  events  and  emergencies  under  emergency \n6  management plans. \n7  394.  The Rule will deter immigrant crime victims from accessing vital \n8  benefits for themselves or their families, including children and elderly relatives \n9  trying to escape from or address the trauma of domestic violence, sexual assault, \n10  unlawful labor or sex trafficking, and other crimes. \n11  395.  The Rule will significantly harm the Plaintiff States’ efforts to assist \n12  crime victims, as many victims and their families will sacrifice basic needs, \n13  safety, and health in the form of food assistance, housing assistance, and medical \n14  insurance, all to avoid potentially adverse immigration consequences. \n15  VII.  THE RULE’S OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS \n16  396.  As set forth in detail above, the Rule’s chilling effects will cause \n17  far-reaching harms to the Plaintiff States and their residents due to the loss of \n18  public benefits and services to which they are legally entitled. In addition to those \n19  harms,  the  Rule  will  have  a  vast  array  of  other  adverse  impacts,  including \n20  (1) wrongfully denying marriage-based green cards to half of applicants due to \n21  the irrationally  high  income  threshold;  (2)  destabilizing the  Plaintiff  States’ \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  153  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Family Reunification Impacts \n7  397.  The  INA  requires  most  green  card  applicants  to  have  a  \n8  sponsor—typically a U.S. citizen-spouse or other family member—with a high \n9  enough income to ensure the immigrant would not become a public charge.236 By \n10  statute, the sponsor must “agree[] to provide support to maintain the sponsored \n11  alien at an annual income that is not less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty \n12  [guide]line” (FPG) based on household size.237 When the sponsor is the green \n13  card applicant’s spouse, the applicant’s income may be included “to meet the \n14  income requirement” of 125%of FPG.238 The affidavit of support provision thus \n15 \n16                                             \n17  236 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(C), 1183a.  \n18  237 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A); see also 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2 (“In order for the \n19  intending immigrant to overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility, the \n20  sponsor must demonstrate the means to maintain the intending immigrant at an \n21  annual income of at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line.”). \n22  238 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(i)(3). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  154  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Rule eviscerates Congress’s intent in establishing the 125% of \n4  FPG threshold for an affidavit of support. It does so by doubling the income \n5  threshold to 250% of FPG at which an immigrant’s household income would \n6  constitute a “heavily weighed positive factor” in the public charge test.239 Even \n7  with  a  household  income  exceeding  250%  of  FPG,  the  Department  would \n8  apparently retain the discretion to deny the sponsored immigrant’s green card \n9  application based on its other public charge factors.240 The Department provides \n10  no  rational  reason  for  disregarding  the  statutory  125%  FPG  threshold  and \n11  adopting  the  significantly  higher  250%  threshold  instead.  In  doing  so,  the \n12  Department is attempting to rewrite the INA by regulation. \n13  399.  The Department’s new 250% FPG threshold would significantly \n14  inhibit the goal of family reunification that has long been a cornerstone of U.S. \n15  immigration policy. According to the analysis of one public commenter, 54%of \n16  the foreign-born spouses who are currently eligible for green cards would become \n17  ineligible under the  Rule’s  higher  income  threshold.241  The  Rule  will  force \n18                                             \n19  239 84 Fed.

Workforce Impacts \n4  400.  Non-cash public assistance benefits are essential for workers to \n5  remain employed, employable, and productive. For example, access to affordable \n6  health insurance helps workers to enter and remain in the workforce.242 Workers \n7  with health insurance miss approximately 75% fewer work days and are more \n8  productive at work than their uninsured peers.243 The Rule will therefore make \n9  the workforces in the Plaintiff States less healthy and less productive, reducing \n10  overall economic output. \n11  401.  As explained above, the Rule will significantly reduce the labor \n12  supply of direct care workers, who provide LTSS to low-income elderly and \n13  disabled individuals. The resulting shortage in the direct care worker labor market \n14  will increase costs for Plaintiff States to administer LTSS programs, endangering \n15  the safety of their elderly and disabled residents.  \n16                                             \n17  242 Larisa Antonisse and Rachel Garfield, The Relationship Between Work \n18  and  Health:  Findings  from  a  Literature  Review,  Kaiser  Fam.

Other Macroeconomic Impacts \n2  402.  The mass disenrollment from and forgone participation in public \n3  assistance  programs  by  immigrants  and  their  families  will  have  significant \n4  adverse impacts on the Plaintiff States’ economies. The loss of medical, food, \n5  cash, and other benefits will reduce revenue to numerous health care providers, \n6  grocers, farmers’ markets, and other market participants providing basic goods \n7  and services—constraining overall economic output in the Plaintiff States both \n8  directly and indirectly.  \n9  403.  For example, Washington State estimates that the Rule will directly \n10  reduce total economic output by as much as nearly $100 million. Economists with \n11  Washington’s DSHS used an input-output model to calculate indirect economic \n12  impacts from multiplier effects flowing from the reduced assistance to eligible \n13  families.  Under  this  model,  implementation  of  the  Rule  will  reduce  total \n14  economic output in Washington from between $41.8 million and $97.5 million. \n15  Under Washington’s projections, this will also result in an annual reduction in \n16  wages, salaries, and benefits for workers in the amount of $15.7 million to $36.7 \n17  million, as well as a loss of approximately 334 to 782 Washington jobs. \n18  404.  State  and  local  governments  benefit  from  the  significant  tax \n19  revenues  from  immigrant  taxpayers.  Between  2011  and  2013,  tax  revenues \n20  received from immigrants were $130 billion higher than public money spent on \n21 \n22 \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  157  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Those  state  and  local  tax  revenues  are  likely  to  decrease \n4  substantially as a result of the Rule, which will cause eligible immigrants to \n5  disenroll  from  public  benefits  programs,  limit  their  participation  in  the \n6  workforce, and not fully participate in the economy.  \n7  D.  Disparate Impacts \n8  406.  The effects of the Rule will have a disparate impact on communities \n9  of color, most severely on Latinos. It is well established that income and wealth \n10  disparities across racial and ethnic groups are substantial. The Rule, by selecting \n11  for wealthy immigrants and punishing the working class—including participation \n12  in common social safety net programs—would severely disadvantage non-white \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16                                             \n17  244 Nat’l Academies.

By  one  estimate,  the  chilling  effects  of  the  Rule  would \n4  disproportionately fall on people of color, prompting as many as 18.3 million \n5  Latino noncitizens or their family members to disenroll or forgo enrollment in \n6  public benefit programs—roughly 70% of the total noncitizen families at risk.247 \n7  The Department’s arbitrarily high 250% FPG income threshold would have \n8  disproportionate effects based on national origin and ethnicity, blocking 71% of \n9  applicants from Mexico and Central America, 69% from Africa, and 52% from \n10  Asia—compared to only 36% from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.248  \n11  408.  Other factors in the Public Charge Rule will cause a disparate impact \n12  on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin. Credit scores are lower among \n13  blacks and Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites and Asians.249   \n14                                             \n15  246 That is, the Rule would effectively enact the President’s policy of \n16  preferring white immigrants like those from “Norway.” See supra ¶ X. \n17  247  Boundless  Cmt.  at  65;  Public  Charge  Proposed  Rule:  Potentially \n18  Chilled  Population  Data,  Manatt,  Phelps  &  Phillips,  LLP  (Oct.  11,  2018), \n19  goo.gl/nWawDr. \n20  248 Boundless Cmt. at 65–66.  \n21  249 Bd. of Governors of the Fed.

The high school degree factor will also have a disparate impact, \n2  since 54% of immigrants from Mexico and 46% of immigrants from Central \n3  America have not obtained a high school degree, while only 10% of immigrants \n4  from Europe or Canada have not obtained one.250  \n5  410.  Finally,  the  English  proficiency  factor  will  also  exacerbate  the \n6  Rule’s disparate impact on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin. Of the \n7  seven countries with the highest rates of English proficiency, six are in Europe \n8  and none is in Latin America or Africa. Conversely, none of the 24 countries with \n9  the lowest rates of English proficiency is in Europe, while all but one are in Latin \n10  America, Africa, or the Middle East.251 \n11  411.

Through Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress \n2  statutorily barred discrimination based on disability in any program or activity of \n3  any federal executive branch agencies.252 \n4  413.  Despite Section 504’s prohibition on disability discrimination, the \n5  Public  Charge  Rule  subjects  individuals  with  disabilities  to  an  increased \n6  likelihood of a public charge determination. It does so by, for example, requiring \n7  immigration officers to consider in the negative any medical condition that may \n8  interfere with self-care or restricts the individual’s ability to attend school or \n9  work, and by targeting non-monetary public benefits, such as Medicaid, which \n10  such individuals are likelier to receive to pay for medical costs related to their \n11  conditions. \n12  414.  DHS knowingly maintained these elements in the Rule despite the \n13  disproportionate impact it will have on individuals with disabilities. \n14  VIII.

The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n2  agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with \n3  law.”253 \n4  417.  Congress used the term “public charge” in the INA consistent with \n5  its original public meaning which includes determining whether an immigrant is \n6  likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government for subsistence.254 By \n7  redefining  “public  charge”  as  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more  public \n8  benefit[s],”255 in even modest amounts, the Rule unmoors the term from its \n9  original public meaning and departs from the unambiguously expressed intent of \n10  Congress in numerous statutes. The Rule’s redefinition of public charge and new \n11  standards governing public charge determinations are not in accordance with the \n12  following statutes:  \n13  a.  INA Section 212(a)(4);256 \n14  b.  INA Section 202(a)(1);257  \n15  c.  INA Section 212(a)(1);258 \n16                                             \n17  253 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n18  254 64 Fed.

The  Final  Rule’s  inclusion  of  SNAP  as  a  negatively  weighted \n2  consideration for public charge is contrary to federal statutes governing those \n3  programs.  Specifically,  the  Final  Rule’s  allowance  of  consideration  of  a \n4  noncitizen’s  receipt  of  SNAP  benefits  is  contrary  to  the  express  statutory \n5  provision prohibiting consideration of those benefits “[as] income or resources \n6  for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local laws.” 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n7  Count II: \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—Ultra Vires Conduct \n8 \n419.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n9 \nfully set forth herein. \n10 \n420.  The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n11 \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory \n12 \njurisdiction [or] authority.”267 \n13 \n421.  The Rule expands the public charge exclusion to reach applicants \n14 \nfor extension of stay and change of status. The INA does not permit—either \n15 \nexpressly or impliedly—the Department to expand its authority in this regard. As \n16 \nthe Department itself acknowledges, the public charge exclusion statute “by its \n17 \nterms only applies to applicants for visas, admission, and adjustment of status, \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  267 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  164  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Congress has specifically confined the categories of immigration \n4  applications to which the “public charge” designation applies. DHS may not \n5  expand those statutory limitations by regulation. Its attempt to do so is ultra vires \n6  and unlawful.269 \n7  Count III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary or Capricious \n8  Agency Action \n9  423.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n10  fully set forth herein. \n11  424.  The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n12  agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, \n13  [or] an abuse of discretion.”270 \n14  425.  In general, a rule is arbitrary and capricious where the agency “relied \n15  on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to \n16  consider  an  important aspect  of  the problem,  offered  an  explanation  for  its \n17  decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible \n18                                             \n19  268 83 Fed.

When  an  agency  reverses  position,  it  must  “supply  a  reasoned \n5  analysis for the change,”273 and may not “depart from a prior policy sub silentio \n6  or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.”274 Further, any “serious \n7  reliance interests must be taken into account,”275 particularly where “decades \n8  of . . . reliance on the Department’s prior policy” demand a fulsome explanation \n9  for the reversal.276 \n10  427.  Under  the  standards  set  forth  above,  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  or \n11  capricious in its entirety, including in the following particular respects:  \n12  a.  the  redefinition  of  public  charge  to  mean  “an  alien  who \n13  receives one or more public benefits”;277 \n14                                             \n15  271 Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  U.S. \n15 \nConstitution forbids the federal government from denying equal protection of \n16 \nthe laws.279  It is an equal protection violation where a “discriminatory purpose” \n17 \n18 \n19                                             \n20  278 84 Fed.

The  Rule  was  motivated  by  Administration  officials’  intent  to \n3  discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin.  \n4  431.  That  discriminatory  intent  is  evidenced  by  the  Rule’s \n5  disproportionate adverse impacts on communities of color, including affecting \n6  as many as 18.3 million Latinos in the United States.281 While people of color \n7  account for approximately 36% of the total U.S. population, approximately 90% \n8  of those chilled from seeking public services would be people of color (70% of \n9  whom are Latino). In other words, the Rule will cause Latinos and other people \n10  of color to be disproportionately excluded from the United States under the \n11  INA’s public charge provision. \n12  432.  In addition to that anticipated disparate racial and ethnic impact, \n13  other circumstantial evidence indicates that discrimination against people of \n14  color was a motivating factor behind the Rule. That evidence includes the \n15  historical background of the Rule, the specific sequence of events leading up to \n16  the  Rule,  departures  from  normal  rulemaking  procedures,  the  rulemaking \n17                                             \n18  280 Vill. of Arlington Heights v.

McAleenan, in his official \n8  capacity; its sub-agency United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n9  (USCIS); and USCIS’s Acting Director Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, in his official \n10  capacity. \n11  I.  INTRODUCTION \n12  1.  The Department’s Final Rule, Inadmissibility on Public Charge \n13  Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,2921 (August 14, 2019) (the Public Charge Rule or the \n14  Rule),  effects  a  radical  overhaul  of  federal  immigration  law  transforming  a \n15  system  that  promotes  economic  mobility  among  immigrants  into  one  that \n16  advantages immigrants with wealth. It does so by penalizing legally present \n17  immigrant families who access federally-funded health, nutrition, and housing \n18  programs, even briefly. The Rule achieves this sweeping change unlawfully: it \n19  expansively redefines the term “public charge”—a previously rare designation \n20                                             \n21  1  Inadmissibility  on  Public  Charge  Grounds,  84  Fed.  Reg.  41,292 \n22  (Aug. 14, 2019) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.20). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  1  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.9   Page 9 of 176\n \n1  that triggers exclusion from the United States—in a manner that is contrary to \n2  congressional intent and agency interpretation that has prevailed for nearly 70 \n3  years, and contrary to two 1996 federal statutes. \n4  2.  Since the late 19th century, federal immigration law has permitted \n5  the government to deny entry to any noncitizen “likely to become a public \n6  charge.”  From  colonial times  to the  present day,  “public  charge”  was  used \n7  consistently in American law to mean a pauper—that is, someone permanently \n8  and primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. Until the current \n9  Administration, the Department itself, its predecessor agency the Immigration \n10  and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. State \n11  Department have all adhered to the established definition of public charge. \n12  3.  The Rule departs from this original meaning by redefining a public \n13  charge as a noncitizen who receives common forms of federal and state public \n14  assistance, even in small amounts and for a short period of time. Never before \n15  has the Department considered in a public charge determination an immigrant’s \n16  receipt of non-cash public benefits for which they are legally eligible such as \n17  Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, public housing \n18  subsidies under the 1937 U.S. Housing Act, or Section 8 housing assistance. \n19  Under the Rule, however, participation in those benefits—which are commonly \n20  used by working families—would constitute a negative “heavily weighted factor” \n21  triggering a public charge determination. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  2  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.10   Page 10 of 176\n \n1  4.  People who receive those benefits are neither paupers nor primarily \n2  dependent on the government for subsistence. Over half of all non-elderly adults \n3  receiving Medicaid are employed, and almost 80% are from a home where at \n4  least  one  household  member  works.  Indeed,  more  than  20%  of  the  U.S. \n5  population participates in such benefits programs on average each month. Yet, \n6  under  the  Rule,  legally  present  immigrants’  participation  in  those  programs \n7  would block their path to citizenship under the public charge exclusion. \n8  5.  The  Public  Charge  Rule  is  contrary  to  law  and  arbitrary  and \n9  capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act for numerous reasons \n10  including: \n11  6.  First,  the  Department’s  new  definition  of  “public  charge”  is \n12  contrary to its longstanding meaning in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n13  Since its origin in colonial residency requirements and through its reception into \n14  state and then federal immigration laws, a “public charge” has been applied to \n15  mean a person primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. The \n16  Department’s Rule is not a clarification of a well-established rule, but marks the \n17  rejection of the core principle underlying the long established unambiguous \n18  definition. \n19  7.  Second,  the  Personal  Responsibility  and  Work  Opportunity \n20  Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows many lawful immigrants to apply for public \n21  benefits  if  they  have  been  in  the  country  for  at  least  five  years.  The  Rule \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  3  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Rule is contrary to this statute, as well as several \n4  others. \n5  8.  Third, the Rule is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion \n6  because—among  other  reasons—it  reverses  a  decades-old,  consistent  policy \n7  without reasoned analysis, offers an explanation for the Rule that runs counter to \n8  the overwhelming weight of evidence before the Department, and disingenuously \n9  promotes as its purpose self-sufficiency in the immigrant population when, as \n10  abundantly  shown  by  the  administrative  record,  its  effect  is  precisely  the \n11  opposite. \n12  9.  The  radical  expansion  of  the public  charge  standard  will  cause \n13  irreparable harm to the working families and children who live in the Plaintiffs \n14  States, as well as the states themselves. The Rule will deter hundreds of thousands \n15  of noncitizens from utilizing essential public assistance programs for which they \n16  are legally eligible, so as not to jeopardize their hopes of becoming Americans. \n17  Those “chilling effects” are of two types.  \n18  10.  First,  the  Rule  will  deter  lawfully  present,  legally  eligible \n19  immigrants or their family members from participating in the enumerated “public \n20  benefit” programs. Many of these individuals will be forced into state emergency \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  4  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Second, the Rule’s true impact sweeps more broadly by chilling \n4  immigrant families’ participation in state and local assistance programs that the \n5  Rule does not classify as public benefits in the public charge test. Out of both fear \n6  of the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant agenda and confusion over the \n7  byzantine  regulatory  scheme  that  the  Rule  would  create,  many  immigrant \n8  families will disenroll or forbear enrollment in all public benefit programs to \n9  avoid triggering the Department’s expansive and punitive public charge test. \n10  12.  Those chilling effects will lead to individuals and families forfeiting \n11  health insurance, medical care, nutrition assistance, and shelter not only for \n12  themselves but also for their entire households—including U.S. citizen adults and \n13  children. In Washington State alone, the state Medicaid agency projects that up \n14  to 140,000 families will lose health insurance, and State residents will forgo up \n15  to $198 million annually in medical care and up to $55 million annually in food \n16  and cash assistance. State and private hospitals will be forced to absorb the vastly \n17  more expensive uncompensated care, to the detriment of the State treasury.  \n18  13.  The resulting loss of economic activity will impose uncompensable \n19  social and economic costs on the Plaintiff States that the Department entirely fails \n20  to confront. Disenrollment and non-enrollment in health, nutrition, and other \n21  state-run assistance programs will make many working class immigrant families \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  5  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The broader \n4  chilling effects among all state-run assistance programs will undermine those \n5  programs’ administration and effectiveness. And direct costs to the States will \n6  result from immigrants who shift from federal programs to state programs that \n7  do not qualify as “public benefits” under the Rule. \n8  14.  In Washington State, for example, economic analysis points to the \n9  Rule reducing total economic output by up to $97.5 million annually, cutting \n10  wages by up to $36.7 million annually, and eliminating up to 782 jobs. Franklin \n11  County, less than five miles from where this Court sits and where, according to \n12  Census Bureau data, over half the population is Hispanic and over 15% legal \n13  noncitizen, will face particularly harsh increases in public costs and decreases in \n14  economic output as a result of the Rule. These consequences will be replicated \n15  across the Plaintiff States. \n16  15.  The Department’s expansive new public charge test applies to two \n17  groups of lawfully present non-citizens: immigrants such as visa-holders seeking \n18  to adjust to permanent resident status, and nonimmigrant visitors seeking to \n19  extend their visa or change their visa category. It would apply, for example, to:  \n20  •  An immigrant mother with a U.S. citizen spouse and U.S. \n21  citizen children who applies for lawful permanent residency. Even if she \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  6  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

If previously he had received Section 8 housing \n7  assistance vouchers for 12 months in any amount, upon his return to the \n8  United States six months later, he could be denied admission under the new \n9  public charge test, which applies to lawful permanent residents after a \n10  foreign trip longer than 180 days. Although a federal statute entitles this \n11  green card holder to receive federal, state, and local public benefits, the \n12  Rule would exclude him from the United States for taking advantage of his \n13  statutory right. \n14  •  And  an  immigrant  granted  entry  for  urgent  humanitarian \n15  reasons (a “humanitarian parolee”), who has two U.S. citizen children and \n16  files for permanent residency. If for just four months in the past three years \n17  she received Medicaid  coverage,  food stamps,  and  Section 8  housing \n18  assistance in any amounts, it could trigger a public charge determination \n19  and denial of her green card application because each separate benefit \n20  would count as an extra month towards the Rule’s 12-month threshold. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  7  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The  Plaintiff  States  bring  this  action  to  redress  harms  to  their \n11  sovereign, proprietary, and quasi-sovereign interests and their interests as parens \n12  patriae in protecting the health and well-being of their residents. The Plaintiff \n13  States are affected by the Public Charge Rule, are directly injured by it, and the \n14  relief requested will redress their injuries.3 \n15  36.  The power to create and enforce a legal code is a uniquely sovereign \n16  interest. The Plaintiff States have adopted health care programs as parts of their \n17  legal codes that operate to improve and protect the health of their residents. These \n18  include cooperative federal-state programs such as Medicaid, which Congress \n19  has given them substantial financial incentives to establish and administer.

The  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign \n2  interests in enforcing their statutory codes and achieving their purposes are \n3  harmed by Defendants’ challenged action. \n4  37.  As a proprietor, a state is likely to have the same interests as other \n5  similarly  situated  proprietors.  The  Plaintiff  States  have  created  and  operate \n6  programs and institutions to promote and ensure the health, housing stability, \n7  nutrition and well-being of their residents. The success and effectiveness of these \n8  facilities  will  be  harmed  by  the  Rule.  The  Plaintiff  States’  proprietary  and \n9  financial interests in programs and institutions they paid for with state taxpayer \n10  funds, and which are managed by their employees and subcontractors are injured \n11  by the Rule. \n12  38.  A  state  has  a  quasi-sovereign  interest  in  the  health  and  \n13  well-being—both  physical  and  economic—of  its  residents  in  general.  The \n14  Plaintiff States’ have a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health, safety, \n15  and well-being of their residents. The Final Rule dissuades state residents from \n16  utilizing  the  benefits  of  the  Plaintiff  States’  benefits  programs.  It  therefore \n17  jeopardizes  the  health,  housing,  nutrition,  and  well-being  of  their  residents, \n18  citizen and noncitizen alike.  \n19  39.

The Department’s Final Rule disregards that \n4  unambiguous, centuries-old definition. \n5  A.  Origins of Public Charge Exclusion in Colonial, State, and Federal \nStatutes \n6 \n45.  As early as the 1650s, the American colonies adopted “poor” laws \n7 \nrequiring each town to recognize its permanent residents’ claims for relief if they \n8 \nbecame destitute.5 Based on English models, colonial poor laws made the local \n9 \ngovernments responsible for supporting its poor residents, for whom the towns \n10 \ncared generously.6 At the same time, however, such laws permitted towns to \n11 \nexpel transient beggars or vagrants as “public charges.”7 \n12 \n13 \n14                                             \n15  5 Historians’ Cmt. at 2, DHS Notice of Proposed Rule “Inadmissibility on \n16  Public Charge Grounds,” FR 2018-21106 (Oct. 5, 2018) (Historians’ Cmt.); \n17  Gerald  L.

After the American Revolution, state governments came to play a \n2  greater role in administration of relief for the poor. When a person without a town \n3  “settlement” (or recognized residency right) fell into extreme need, he became a \n4  charge of the state or a “state pauper,” as distinguished from a “town pauper.”8 \n5  In each case, in its original public meaning, “public charge” was synonymous \n6  with “pauper.” \n7  47.  State measures against immigration of “foreign paupers” developed \n8  alongside the state poor laws of the early Republic. As European migration to the \n9  United States grew in the early 19th century, states enacted or expanded laws to \n10  “prevent the introduction of [p]aupers” at ports of entry as “liable to become \n11  chargeable,” i.e., public charges.9 For example, a New York statute prohibited \n12  landing of “any lunatic, idiot, deaf and dumb, blind or infirm persons . . . likely \n13  to become permanently a public charge.”10 Under that law and similar ones in \n14                                             \n15  (1974) (“Newcomers to a city, town, or county who might become public charges \n16  were ‘warned out’ or ‘passed on’ to the next locality.”).  \n17  8  Kunal  M.

Early Administrative and Judicial Precedent on Public Charge \n11  49.  Judicial and administrative decisions applying the federal public \n12  charge ground of inadmissibility interpreted the statute consistently with the \n13  original  public  meaning  of  the  term  “public  charge,”  namely,  as  a  person \n14  primarily and permanently dependent on the state for subsistence. \n15 \n16                                             \n17  13 See, e.g., Passenger Cases, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283 (1849); Henderson v. \n18  Mayor of New York, 92 U.S. 259, 274 (1875). \n19  14 22 Stat. 214 (1882).  \n20  15 Id. \n21  16 13 Cong.

For example, in Gegiow v. Uhl, the U.S. Supreme Court read “public \n2  charge”  consistent  with  the  surrounding  statutory  categories  of  exclusions, \n3  including  “paupers  and  professional  beggars,  .  .  .  idiots,”  and  “persons \n4  dangerously diseased [or suffering from] . . . a physical defect of a nature to affect \n5  their ability to earn a living.”18 In a decision by Justice Holmes, the Court thus \n6  held that a public charge is excludable only “on the ground of permanent personal \n7  objections accompanying them.”19 Likewise, an early Second Circuit case held \n8  that the public charge category only “exclude[s] persons who were likely to \n9  become occupants of almshouses.”20 Following those precedents, federal courts \n10  in the first half of the 20th century consistently interpreted “public charge” as \n11  “generically similar to ‘paupers,’ . . . ‘professional beggars,’ [and] . . . ‘occupants \n12  of almshouses.’ ”21 In the context of the public charge deportability provision, \n13  one  court  defined  “public  charge”  even  more  narrowly  to  mean  “a  person \n14  committed to the custody of a department of the government by due course of \n15                                             \n16  18 239 U.S. 3, 9–10 (1915). \n17  19 Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10 (emphasis added).  \n18  20 Howe v.

Federal  agencies  charged  with  enforcing  immigration  laws  also \n4  interpreted the public charge ground of inadmissibility in accordance with the \n5  settled meaning of the term. For example, in 1917, the Bureau of Immigration \n6  ruled that “moral perverts” were not “public charges” under the immigration \n7  laws, absent tangible proof of pauper status.23 \n8  C.  Modern Regulatory Framework \n9  52.  It was against the foregoing legal backdrop that Congress enacted \n10  the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA),24 which codified the current \n11  public charge ground of inadmissibility.

Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 \n6  53.  The INA overhauled federal immigration law, unifying previously \n7  scattered sections and adding new provisions in a statutory framework that exists \n8  to this day.26 Overriding President Truman’s veto, Congress declared its power \n9  to “provide for the elimination of undesirable aliens” and set forth numerous new \n10  categories  of  inadmissibility,  including  “anarchists,”  “Communist[s],”  or \n11  “affiliated with . . . any . . . totalitarian party.”27 \n12  54.  The INA also reenacted the public charge exclusion that had been \n13  part  of  federal  immigration  law  since  1882.  Section  212(a)  excluded  from \n14  admission into the United States “[a]liens who, in the opinion of the consular \n15  officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney \n16 \n17 \n18                                             \n19  25  Bragdon  v.

In  applying  the  modern  public  charge  exclusion,  federal \n4  immigration authorities considered the “totality of the alien’s circumstances,”29 \n5  including “economic factors” and “the alien’s physical and mental condition, as \n6  it affects ability to earn a living.”30 The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) \n7  held specifically that “[t]he fact that an alien has been on welfare does not, by \n8  itself, establish that he or she is likely to become a public charge.”31 And in the \n9  government’s  appeal  from  a  BIA  decision  overturning  a  public  charge \n10  determination, Attorney General Robert F.

In 1989, DOJ issued a final rule establishing guidelines for public \n4  charge  determinations  in  various  contexts,  including  adjustment  to  lawful \n5  permanent resident status.33 In such determinations, the “financial responsibility \n6  of  the  alien  is  to  be  established  by  examining  the  totality  of  the  alien’s \n7  circumstances at the time of his or her application,” and the “existence or absence \n8  of a particular factor should never be the sole criteria for determining if an alien \n9  is  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.”34  The  determination  “should  be  a \n10  prospective evaluation based on the alien’s age, health, income, and vocation.”35 \n11  And even where an immigrant’s “income may be below the poverty level,” he is \n12  “not excludable” as a public charge if he “has a consistent employment history \n13  which  shows  the  ability  to  support  himself.”36  Though  a  noncitizen’s  past \n14  acceptance of “public cash assistance” may “enter into this decision,” the 1989 \n15                                             \n16  32 In re Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N.

Current public charge legal framework \n6  57.  Congress  amended  the  INA  in  1990  to  drop  the  “paupers, \n7  professional beggars, or vagrants” exclusions, but retained the public-charge \n8  inadmissibility  ground.38  The  ranking  member  of  the  House  Judiciary \n9  Committee,  Representative  Hamilton  Fish  IV  (R-NY),  explained  that  in \n10  eliminating  the  “paupers,  professional  beggars,  or  vagrants”  inadmissibility \n11  ground, Congress was replacing an “antiquated” exclusion with  “one generic \n12  standard which exclude[s] aliens who are ‘likely to become a public charge.’ ”39 \n13  58.  That provision, INA Section 212(a)(4), is one of two public charge \n14  provisions in the INA. In its current form, Section 212(a)(4) provides that “[a]ny \n15  alien who, . . . in the opinion of the [Secretary of DHS] at the time of application \n16  for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public \n17 \n18                                             \n19  37 Id. \n20  38 See Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.

The same INA provision also provides that “[a]ny alien who, in the \n8  opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa . . . is likely at \n9  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge  is  inadmissible.”43  This  public  charge \n10  exclusion  is  administered  by  U.S.  embassies  and  consulates  abroad,  which \n11 \n12                                             \n13  40 Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Pub L. 82–414, 66 Stat. 163., \n14  § 212(a)(4), codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(4).

The unenacted bill defined “public charge” to “include[] \n3  any alien who receives [means-tested public] benefits for an aggregate period of \n4  at least 12 months.”53 That public charge definition was stricken from the bill \n5  adopted by the full Congress and signed by the President.54  \n6  63.  At no point did Congress ever indicate that it intended to alter the \n7  long-settled meaning of the term, “public charge.” Other than the codification of \n8  the totality of circumstances test, the INA has retained nearly identical language \n9  throughout its many amendments (the most recent in 2013).  \n10  4.  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 \n11  64.  The same year it enacted the Immigration Reform Act, Congress \n12  enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n13  1996 (Welfare Reform Act).55 Before 1996, lawfully present immigrants were \n14  generally eligible for public benefits on similar terms as U.S. citizens, provided \n15  they met the same means-tested eligibility criteria. The Welfare Reform Act \n16  significantly altered that general rule, classifying immigrants into two general \n17  categories:  “qualified”  and  “non-qualified.”56  Qualified  immigrants  include \n18                                             \n19  53 H.R.

With  certain  exceptions,  non-qualified \n6  immigrants are ineligible for federal public benefits.58 \n7  65.  Qualified  immigrants,  however,  generally  may  be  eligible  for \n8  “federal means-tested public benefits” after five years of entry to the United \n9  States.59  Such  benefits  include  Medicaid,  TANF,  and  State  Child  Health \n10  Insurance Program (CHIP), and, with further limitations, food stamp benefits \n11  under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Supplemental \n12  Security Income (SSI).60 For certain “designated federal programs” (namely, \n13  TANF, social services block grants, and Medicaid), a “State is authorized to \n14  determine the eligibility of” qualified immigrants.61  \n15 \n16                                             \n17  57 8 U.S.C. § 1641(b)–(c). \n18  58 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a). \n19  59 8 U.S.C. § 1613(a); Pimentel v.

State and local public benefits are less restricted under the Welfare \n2  Reform Act. Not only qualified immigrants, but also temporary, nonimmigrant \n3  visitors, are eligible for state and local public benefits.62 The Welfare Reform Act \n4  expressly authorizes each state to determine the eligibility for any state public \n5  benefits of any qualified alien or nonimmigrant.63 In addition, a state may provide \n6  by statute that “an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States is eligible \n7  for any State or local public benefit.”64 \n8  67.   In the wake of the Welfare Reform and Immigration Reform Acts, \n9  “public  confusion”  emerged  concerning  the  relationship  between  receipt  of \n10  federal,  state,  or  local  benefits  and  the  public  charge  provisions  of  federal \n11  immigration law.65 According to the U.S. Department of State, “such confusion \n12  led many persons in the immigrant community to choose not to sign up for \n13  important benefits, especially health-related benefits, which they were eligible to \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17                                             \n18  62 8 U.S.C. §§ 1621(a), 1622(a). \n19  63 8 U.S.C. § 1622(a). \n20  64 8 U.S.C. § 1621(d).  \n21  65 Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge \n22  Grounds, 64 Fed.

Agency guidance \n4  68.  To alleviate public confusion, the Immigration and Naturalization \n5  Service (INS) issued a memorandum (Field Guidance) providing “new guidance \n6  on public charge determinations in light of the recent changes in law.”67 The Field \n7  Guidance defined a “public charge” as an immigrant who is “primarily dependent \n8                                             \n9  66 U.S. State Department Cable, INA 212(A)(4) Public Charge: Policy \n10  Guidance, Ref: 9 FAM 40.41 (hereinafter State Department cable). \n11  67 64 Fed. Reg. 28,690. On the same day it issued the Field Guidance, DOJ \n12  also  published  a  proposed  rule  adding  further  gloss  to  the  public  charge \n13  definition. See Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, \n14  64 Fed. Reg. 28,676 (May 26, 1999). That proposed rule observed that the \n15  “primary dependence model of public assistance was the backdrop against which \n16  the ‘public charge’ concept in immigration law developed in the late 1800s,” and \n17  “[h]istorically,  individuals  who became  dependent  on  the  Government  were \n18  institutionalized in asylums or placed in ‘almshouses’ . . . long before the array \n19  of  limited-purpose  public  benefits  now  available  existed.”  Id.  at  28,677. \n20  Although DOJ never published a final public charge rule, the Field Guidance’s \n21  public charge definition and policies were “adopt[ed] . . . immediately” and have \n22  guided DOJ—and, later, DHS—policy ever since. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  30  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

That definition was not a product of INS’s administrative discretion, \n5  but rather a direct application of the traditional, established meaning of the term \n6  “public charge.” As INS explained in a separate regulation it proposed alongside \n7  the Field Guidance, it based its definition on “the plain meaning of the word \n8  ‘charge’” and “the historical context of public dependency when the public \n9  charge immigration provisions were first adopted more than a century ago.”69 \n10  The ordinary meaning of the word “charge,” as used in the INA, is “a person or \n11  thing committed or entrusted to the care, custody, management, or support of \n12  another”—in the case of a public charge, to the government.70 Because a person \n13  who receives only supplemental public assistance is not “committed” to the \n14  government’s “care” or “custody,” INS concluded that the term “public charge” \n15  encompasses only instances of “complete, or nearly complete, dependence on the \n16  Government  rather  than  the  mere  receipt  of  some  lesser  level  of  financial \n17 \n18                                             \n19  68 64 Fed.

The  Field  Guidance  instructed  that  consular  and  immigration \n6  “officers should not place any weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits” \n7  other than long-term institutionalization.73 INS explained that because “non-cash \n8  benefits . . . are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in combination, \n9  provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family,” participation in \n10  such programs “is not evidence of poverty or dependence.”74 Among the list of \n11  benefits that should not be considered for public-charge purposes, the Field \n12  Guidance  expressly  listed  “Medicaid  and  other  health  insurance  and  health \n13  services,” CHIP, “[n]utrition programs,” and [h]ousing benefits.”75 Finally, the \n14  Field Guidance made clear that it was designed to address “adverse impact . . . on \n15  public health and the general welfare” caused by confusion over the public charge \n16  standard—namely,  that  it  had  “deterred  eligible  aliens  and  their  families, \n17                                             \n18  71 Id. \n19  72 64 Fed.

In sum, the Field Guidance embraced the traditional understanding \n4  of  a  public  charge  as  a  person  permanently  and  primarily  dependent  on \n5  government  for  subsistence.  That  definition  has  guided  the  government’s \n6  application  of  federal  immigration  law’s  public  charge  provisions  for  20  \n7  years—since  the  end  of  the  Clinton  Administration,  and  through  the  entire \n8  George  W.  Bush  and  Obama  Administrations,  and  even  through  the \n9  reorganization of the agencies responsible for enforcing the INA. \n10  72.  In 2009, DOJ issued a Public Charge Fact Sheet (DOJ Fact Sheet), \n11  which confirmed the Field Guidance’s definition of “public charge” to mean “an \n12  individual who is likely to become ‘primarily dependent on the government for \n13  subsistence.’ ”77 The DOJ Fact sheet reiterated that “a number of factors must be \n14  considered,” in the public charge determination, “including age, health, family \n15  status, assets, resources, financial status, education, and skills.”78 It also made \n16 \n17                                             \n18  76 64 Fed.

The DOJ Fact Sheet echoed the Field Guidance rule that a public \n4  charge  determination  may  not  be  based  on  “non-cash  benefits  and \n5  special-purpose cash benefits that are not intended for income maintenance.” \n6  Further reflecting the understanding of a public charge as someone permanently \n7  and  primarily  dependent  on  government  for  survival,  the  DOJ  Fact  Sheet \n8  specifically identified the following public benefit programs as irrelevant to a \n9  public charge determination:  \n10  •  Medicaid and other health insurance and health services other \n11  than support for long-term institutional care; \n12  •  Nutrition  programs,  including  SNAP,  the  Special \n13  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), \n14  the  National  School  Lunch  and  School  Breakfast  Program,  and  other \n15  supplementary and emergency food assistance programs; \n16  •  Housing benefits; \n17  •  Child care services; \n18  •  Job training programs; and \n19  •  Non-cash benefits under TANF such as subsidized child care \n20  or transit subsidies. \n21                                             \n22  79 Id. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  34  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The DOJ Fact Sheet further provided that while acceptance of “cash \n2  assistance for income maintenance”—including SSI, TANF, or local cash general \n3  assistance programs—could be considered in the public charge determination, \n4  “the mere receipt of these benefits does not automatically make an individual \n5  inadmissible”  or  “ineligible  to  adjust  status  to  lawful  permanent  resident.” \n6  Rather, “each determination is made on a case-by-case basis in the context of the \n7  totality of the circumstances.” \n8  75.  In 2011, USCIS issued its own Public Charge Fact Sheet (USCIS \n9  Fact Sheet) which affirmed that many common public benefits are not considered \n10  in  making  a  public  charge  inadmissibility  determination.80  Those  benefits \n11  included Medicaid and other health insurance and health services assistance \n12  (other than support for long-term care); CHIP; nutrition programs, such as food \n13  stamps;  housing  benefits;  child  care  services;  energy  assistance;  emergency \n14  disaster relief; foster care and adoption assistance; educational assistance; job \n15  training programs; non-cash benefits under TANF; community-based programs \n16  or services; and unemployment compensation. \n17  76.  Although the USCIS Fact Sheet explained certain cash assistance \n18  programs could be considered in a public charge determination, receiving such \n19  benefits could not, in and of itself, render an immigrant inadmissible on public \n20  charge grounds. Rather, every public charge determination, USCIS confirmed, \n21                                             \n22  80 Public Charge Fact Sheet, USCIS., Apr. 29, 2011.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  35  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In  sum,  from  the  colonial  era  through  115  Congresses  and  44 \n4  presidential administrations, American law uniformly interpreted and applied the \n5  term “public charge” to mean a “pauper” or a person permanently and “primarily \n6  dependent on the government for subsistence.” Specifically, federal agencies \n7  reached  consensus  that  an  immigrant’s  past  receipt  of  non-cash  public  \n8  benefits—such as health, nutrition, or housing assistance, all of which bolster \n9  overall  public  health  and  economic  growth—should  not  be  considered  for \n10  purposes of the public charge exclusion. The Department’s Public Charge Rule \n11  rejects  that  consensus,  defying  the  original  meaning  of  public  charge  and \n12  substituting its own definition and criteria that cannot be reconciled with statutory \n13  text, history, or precedent. \n14  V.  THE DEPARTMENT’S PUBLIC CHARGE RULE \n15  78.  During the 2016 campaign, President Trump ran on a platform to \n16  radically transform U.S. immigration policy. \n17  79.  Having failed to secure passage of any immigration legislation, the \n18  Trump  Administration  promulgated  the  Public  Charge  Rule  to  circumvent \n19  Congress and implement the President’s anti-immigration agenda through the \n20  regulatory backdoor. In issuing the Rule, the Department ignored hundreds of \n21  thousands  of  public  comments  warning  of  its  significant  costs  to  working \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  36  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Trump Administration’s Anti-Immigration Agenda \n5  80.  As a candidate and in office, President Trump endorsed significant \n6  cuts to legal immigration and challenged the centrality of family reunification to \n7  federal immigration policy. The official White House website states that “the \n8  President supports ending chain migration, eliminating the Visa Lottery, and \n9  moving the country to a merit-based entry system.”81 \n10  81.  Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the \n11  media obtained a draft of an “Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources \n12  by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote Accountability and Responsibility.” \n13  The draft Executive Order instructed DHS to “rescind any field guidance” and \n14  “propose for notice and comment a rule that provides standards for determining \n15  which aliens are admissible or deportable on public charge grounds,” including \n16  if a noncitizen receives or is likely to receive non-cash public benefits. The draft \n17  Executive Order was never issued.82 \n18                                             \n19  81  White  House,  Immigration,  https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/ \n20  immigration/ (last visited July 27, 2019). \n21  82 See Memorandum from Andrew Bremberg Regarding Executive Order \n22  on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws Promote \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  37  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In 2017, two U.S. senators introduced a bill designed to significantly \n2  reduce  legal  immigration  by,  for  example,  curbing  the  government’s \n3  long-established policy favoring family reunification. The Reforming American \n4  Immigration  for  a  Strong  Economy  (RAISE)  Act  would  have  given  visa \n5  preference only to immediate family and eliminated the diversity visa lottery, \n6  which allots a limited number of visas to countries with historically low rates of \n7  immigration to the United States.83 It also proposed a “merit-based immigration \n8  system,” which gives preference to immigrants between the ages of 26 and 30, \n9  with doctoral degrees, high English proficiency, and a job offer with a high \n10  salary. The RAISE Act would have precluded parents of adult U.S. citizens from \n11  applying for Legal Permanent Resident status and, if they entered as temporary \n12  nonimmigrants, barred those parents from receiving federal, state, or local public \n13  benefit.84 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17                                             \n18  Accountability  and  Responsibility  (Jan.  23,  2017),  https://www.nafsa.org \n19  /uploadedFiles/NAFSA_Dojo/Professional_Resources/Browse_by_Interest/Inte\n20  rnational_Students_and_Scholars/DraftEOtaxprograms.pdf. \n21  83 S.B. 354, 115th Cong., 1st sess.

They’re not going to come in and just \n4  immediately go and collect welfare.” The White House also asserted falsely that \n5  “[m]ore than 50 percent of all immigrant households receive welfare benefits, \n6  compared to only 30 percent of native households in the United States that \n7  receive welfare benefits.”86 In fact, immigrants are less likely to consume public \n8  assistance benefits than native-born Americans and, when they do, they generally \n9  consume a lower dollar value of benefits. Overall, immigrants consume 27% \n10  fewer benefits on average than native-born Americans with similar incomes and \n11  ages.87 \n12  84.  In June 2017, shortly before announcing his support for the RAISE \n13  Act, President Trump received a briefing on immigration from White House \n14  senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Defendant Cuccinelli has expressed similar sentiments. In a 2012 \n8  interview, Cuccinelli compared U.S. immigration policy to local laws governing \n9  treatment of rats, stating that a District of Columbia law prohibiting killing of rats \n10  or separating rat families is “worse than our immigration policy—you can’t break \n11  up rat families.

Rulemaking History \n2  86.  In December 2017, DHS noted in the Unified Agenda of Federal \n3  Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions its intent to publish a Notice for Public \n4  Rulemaking regarding the public charge ground of inadmissibility. In early 2018, \n5  it was widely reported that the new rule would dramatically expand the types of \n6  public assistance programs that could be considered in the public charge test, \n7  including non-cash benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.91 In January 2018, the \n8  State Department revised the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) to instruct consular \n9  officers to consider a wider range of public benefits when determining whether \n10  visa  applicants  who  have  received  or  are  currently  receiving  benefits  are \n11 \n12                                             \n13  91 See, e.g., Nick Miroff, Trump proposal would penalize immigrants who \n14  use  tax  credits  and  other  benefits,  Wash.

Also  in  January  2018,  President  Trump  rejected  a  bipartisan \n5  immigration  proposal  by  members  of  Congress.  In  reference  to  the  deal’s \n6  protections for immigrants from Haiti and Africa, President Trump asked why he \n7  should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” rather than from nations like \n8  “Norway.”94 \n9  88.  A detailed draft of DHS’s proposed public charge rule was leaked \n10  in March 2018. Under the draft proposed rule, new criteria would be considered \n11  as heavily weighted negative factors in public charge determinations, including \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15                                             \n16  92  U.S.  Dep’t  of  State,  “Public  Charge”  Update  to  9  FAM  302.8 \n17  (Jan. 4, 2018), https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030208.html#M302_8. \n18  93 Id. at 302.8-2(B)(2)(f)(2)(b)(i).  \n19  94 Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Sheryl Gay Stolberg & Thomas Kaplan, Trump \n20  Alarms Lawmakers With Disparaging Words for Haiti and Africa, N.Y.

In spring 2018, shortly after the draft rule leaked, DHS informed the \n4  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  that  it  “will  propose  regulatory \n5  provisions guiding the inadmissibility determination on whether an alien is likely \n6  at any time to become a public charge.”96 As first provided to OMB, the proposed \n7  rule was not classified as a “significant regulatory action”97 or a “major” rule \n8  pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.98  \n9  90.  The same month, President Trump said in a meeting at the White \n10  House that the United States has “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world” \n11  and exhorted his administration officials to “do much better” in keeping out \n12                                             \n13  95 Read the Trump administration’s draft proposal penalizing immigrants \n14  who  accept  almost  any  public  benefit,  Wash.

Miller wrote, “Francis – The timeline on \n5  public charge is unacceptable.” Miller continued, “I don’t care what you need to \n6  do to finish it on time.” Miller also wrote, “It’s an embarrassment that we’ve been \n7  here for 18 months and USCIS hasn’t published a single major reg.”100  \n8  92.

The Department’s Proposed Public Charge Rule \n6  94.  On  October  10,  2018,  DHS  published  a  notice  of  proposed \n7  rulemaking and proposed rule entitled Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds \n8  (the Proposed Rule).104 The Proposed Rule sought to significantly expand the \n9  authority of the USCIS to designate an immigrant as inadmissible on the ground \n10  that he or she is likely to become a “public charge,” far beyond the long-settled \n11  meaning of the term and its prior application in the history of U.S. immigration \n12  law. \n13                                             \n14  102 Katie Rogers & Jonathan Martin, ‘We’re Sending Them the Hell Back,’ \n15  Trump Says of Securing the Country’s Borders, N.Y.

The Proposed Rule redefined the term “public charge” to mean “an \n2  alien who receives one or more public benefit[s].”105 The Proposed Rule defined \n3  “public benefit” to include not only a wide range of federal, state, local, or tribal \n4  cash benefits but also, in a reversal of decades of past practice and precedent, \n5  specific  federally-funded  non-cash  benefits—namely  SSI,  SNAP,  Section  8 \n6  housing assistance, and Medicaid.106 \n7  96.  In  fact,  the  Department’s  Final  Rule  allowing  consideration  of \n8  SNAP  benefits  is  directly  contrary  to  existing  federal  law  governing  those \n9  programs.107 \n10  97.  The Proposed Rule would have required DHS in making a public \n11  charge determination to consider the immigrant’s “past receipt of public benefits” \n12  above  certain  thresholds  as  a  “heavily  weighed  negative  factor”  favoring \n13  exclusion.108 The Proposed Rule’s thresholds differed based on whether the \n14  benefit was “monetizable” or “non-monetizable.” \n15  98.  For “monetizable” benefits such as SNAP or TANF, the Proposed \n16  Rule imposed a dollar-value and durational threshold: it would have weighed \n17                                             \n18  105  83  Fed.

Any amount of cash assistance for income maintenance could be \n10  considered  as  a  negative  factor  favoring  exclusion  (though  not  “heavily \n11  weighed”) under the Proposed Rule.111 However, it would not have permitted the \n12  Department to consider at all an immigrant’s receipt of non-cash public benefits \n13  below the applicable durational or dollar-value thresholds.  \n14  100.  The Proposed Rule also sought to extend the public charge test into \n15  two areas not provided by statute—noncitizens’ applications for (1) extension of \n16  stay,  and  (2)  change  of  status.  Under  the  Proposed  Rule,  as  a  mandatory \n17  “condition of approval,” a noncitizen would have had to “demonstrate” that since \n18 \n19                                             \n20  109 83 Fed.

The vast majority of those public \n5  comments  opposed  the  Proposed  Rule.  Many  comments  focused  on  the \n6  significant hardships the Proposed Rule would cause by deterring individuals and \n7  families—immigrants,  nonimmigrant  visitors,  and  U.S.  citizens  alike—from \n8  accessing public benefits for which they are eligible. Commenters also described \n9  the  significant  administrative  and  financial  burden  the  Proposed  Rule,  if \n10  finalized, would impose on state and local government agencies, U.S. businesses, \n11  families, and individuals. \n12  103.

Signed  by  Washington’s  Governor  and  Attorney \n14  General, as well as the Mayor of Seattle, the Washington Comment urged the \n15  Department to withdraw the Proposed Rule because, if adopted, it “will gravely \n16  harm Washingtonians, causing children in our State—noncitizens and citizens \n17 \n18                                             \n19  118 Multistate Cmt. at 2.  \n20  119 Multistate Cmt. at 5. \n21  120 Multistate Cmt. at 11. \n22  121 Multistate Cmt. at 2.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  50  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

White House involvement and review \n2  107.  By March 2019, the Department had not yet published a final rule. \n3  At a meeting in the White House Situation Room that month, senior adviser \n4  Stephen Miller expressed his frustration that the “transformative” public charge \n5  rule had not yet been finalized. “You ought to be working on this regulation all \n6  day every day,” Miller shouted. “It should be the first thought you have when \n7  you wake up. And it should be the last thought you have before you go to bed. \n8  And sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed.”125  \n9  108.  Within weeks of the Situation Room  meeting, President Trump \n10  removed  multiple  DHS  senior  officials  from  their  positions,  including \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14                                             \n15  https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/Utilities/faq.myjsp  (last  visited \n16  July 28, 2019).

On July 12, 2019, the Department transmitted the Rule to the White \n4  House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for regulatory review pursuant \n5  to Executive Order 12,866 (E.O. 12,866).127 As required by law, the OMB Office \n6  of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) held E.O. 12,866 meetings with \n7  interested  parties  in  the  two  weeks  following  its  receipt  of  the  Rule.  On \n8  July 24, 2019, a coalition of 17 states, including the Plaintiff States, requested a \n9  meeting with OIRA—both through the OIRA online E.O. 12866 meeting request \n10  system and via letter transmitted by e-mail—to further express their “significant \n11  concerns about the severe impact that [the public charge] rule would have on our \n12  states’ residents.” Although OIRA held at least four E.O. 12,866 meetings on \n13  July 25, 2019, for a full week the Plaintiff States’ July 24 meeting request \n14  received no response from OIRA.128 \n15                                             \n16  126  Id.;  Geneva  Sands  &  Priscilla  Alvarez,  Trump’s  Citizenship  and \n17  Immigration Services director out, CNN, May 24, 2019, https://www.cnn.com \n18  /2019/05/24/politics/l-francis-cissna-citizenship-and-immigration-\n19  services/index.html. \n20  127 See E.O. 12,866 of Sept. 30, 1993. \n21  128  EO  12866  Meetings  Search  Results,  Office  of  Information  and \n22  Regulatory  Affairs,  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  https:// \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  53  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

On August 12, 2019, the Department announced the issuance of the \n6  Final Public Charge Rule and it was posted for public inspection. In a press \n7  conference at the White House, Acting USCIS Director Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II \n8  stated that in promulgating “President Trump’s public charge inadmissibility \n9  rule,”  the  Department  was  “promoting  our  shared  history”  and \n10  “implement[ing] . . . a law passed by Congress in 1996 that has not been given \n11  meaningful effect.”130 Asked about the 1903 plaque on the Statue of Liberty that \n12  invites  “your  tired, your  poor,  your  huddled  masses,”  Cuccinelli  said:  “I’m \n13  certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statute of Liberty.” \n14                                             \n15  www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eom12866SearchResults?pubId=201904&rin=1615\n16  -AA22&viewRule=true (last visited July 28, 2019). \n17  129  OIRA  Conclusion  of  EO  12866  Regulatory  Review,  Office  of \n18  Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, https:// \n19  www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid=129323 (last visited Aug. 2, 2019). \n20  130  Cuccinelli  on  “public  charge”  immigration  rule,  CBS  News, \n21  Aug. 12, 2019,  https://www.cbsnews.com/video/immigration-official-ken-\n22  cuccinelli-immigrants-public-charge-rule/. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  54  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In response to questions about the Rule, Cuccinelli publicly stated \n2  that the famous Emma Lazarus Statue of Liberty sonnet inscribed on the Statue \n3  of Liberty “was referring back to people coming from Europe where they had \n4  class-based societies” not to people coming to the United States from outside \n5  Europe. He also reinterpreted it to “[g]ive me your tired and your poor who can \n6  stand  on  their  own  two  feet  . . . .”131  When  asked  if  the  Rule  changes  the \n7  definition of the American dream, Cuccinelli said,  “[n]o one has a right to \n8  become an American who isn’t born here as an American” and that “it is a \n9  privilege to become an American, not a right for anybody who is not already an \n10  American citizen.”132 He also said the Rule was “part of President Trump keeping \n11  his promises.”133 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16                                             \n17  131 Rebecca Morin, Immigration official Ken Cuccinelli: Statue of Liberty \n18  poem refers to immigrants from Europe, USA Today Aug. 13, 2019. \n19  132 Sasha Ingber and Rachel Martin, Immigration Chief: ‘Give Me Your \n20  Tired, Your Poor Who Can Stand On Their Own 2 Feet’, Nat’l Pub.

On August 14, 2019, the Department published the Final Rule in the \n2  Federal Register.134 \n3  1.  Summary of the Final Rule \n4 \na.  Applicability of the Rule \n5  114.  The Public Charge Rule applies to any noncitizen subject to section \n6  212(a)(4) of the INA who, after the October 15, 2019 effective date, applies to \n7  the Department for admission to the United States or for adjustment of status to \n8  that of lawful permanent resident.135 The Rule catalogues a list of immigrant \n9  groups that are exempted from its provisions, based on preexisting exemptions \n10  created by Congress or DHS regulations. These include, for example, refugees \n11  and asylees, certain Afghan or Iraqi nationals employed by or on behalf of the \n12  U.S. government, and certain Cuban and Haitian entrants. See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n13  41,504 (proposed 8 C.F.R. § 212.23). \n14  115.  The Rule also applies to requests for extension of stay and change \n15  of status by nonimmigrant visitors to the United States. A nonimmigrant is \n16  generally admitted into the United States for a limited period and for a particular \n17  purpose. Section 212(a)(4) does not apply to an extension of stay or change of \n18                                             \n19  134 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland \n20  Security, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed.

Nevertheless, the Department asserts authority to apply its expanded \n2  public charge provisions to a nonimmigrant’s application to extend his or her \n3  status or change it from one classification to another.136 \n4  b.  Definitions of “public charge” and “public benefit” \n5  116.  The Rule defines “public charge” to mean “an alien who receives \n6  one or more public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within \n7  any 36-month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month \n8  counts as two months).” \n9  117.  “Public benefit” means any of the following six forms of public \n10  assistance: (1) “[a]ny Federal state, local or tribal cash assistance for income \n11  maintenance,” including SSI, TANF, or state “General Assistance”; (2) SNAP; \n12  (3) Section 8 housing assistance vouchers; (4) Section 8 project-based rental \n13  assistance; (5) Medicaid (with exceptions for benefits or services (i) for an \n14  emergency  medical  condition,  (ii)  under  the  Individuals  with  Disabilities \n15  Education Act, (iii) that are school-based, (iv) to immigrants who are under 21 \n16  years of age or a woman during pregnancy); and (6) public housing under section \n17  9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.137 \n18  118.  In several respects, those core definitions are even more draconian \n19  than the corresponding provisions of the Proposed Rule. First, the Department \n20                                             \n21  136 See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,507-08, (proposed 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1, 248.1). \n22  137 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,501 (to be codified at 8. C.F.R.§ 212.21(b)). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  57  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.65   Page 65 of 176\n \n1  eliminated  the  Proposed  Rule’s  distinction  between  monetizable  and \n2  non-monetizable  benefits.  While  the  Proposed  Rule  would  have  considered \n3  monetizable benefits received only if they exceeded 15% threshold, in the Final \n4  Rule the Department applies the 12-month threshold to all public benefits. Thus, \n5  any amount of benefits received for a total of 12 months in the aggregate in a \n6  36-month period as a factor weighing “heavily” in favor of a public charge \n7  determination.138 An additional benefit counts as an extra month, such that receipt \n8  of two benefits triggers the threshold after six months; three benefits, after four \n9  months; and four benefits, after just three months.  \n10  119.  Second, the Final Rule permits the Department to consider as a \n11  negative  factor  favoring  a  public  charge  determination  any  past  receipt  of \n12  non-cash public benefits, even if below the 12-month threshold.139 The Proposed \n13  Rule  would  have  only  permitted  consideration  of  cash  benefits  below  the \n14  applicable thresholds. \n15  c.  Heavily weighted negative factors \n16  120.  The Rule establishes four factors that will “generally weigh heavily \n17  in favor of a finding that an alien is likely to become a public charge.” \n18  121.  First, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the immigrant “is \n19  not a full-time student and is authorized to work, but is unable to demonstrate \n20                                             \n21  138 84 Fed.

Second, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the immigrant \n4  “has received or has been certified or approved to receive one or more public \n5  benefits, as defined in § 212.21(b), for more than 12 months in the aggregate \n6  within any 36 month period, beginning no earlier than 36 months immediately \n7  preceding the alien’s application for admission or adjustment of status.141 The \n8  lookback period can begin no earlier than 36 months before an immigrant’s \n9  application for admission or adjustment of status on or after October 15, 2019. \n10  123.  Third, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if an immigrant both \n11  (a) “has  been  diagnosed  with  a  medical  condition  that  is  likely  to  require \n12  extensive medical treatment or institutionalization or that will interfere with the \n13  alien’s ability to provide for him- or herself, attend school, or work”; and (b) “is \n14  uninsured and has neither the prospect of obtaining private health insurance, or \n15  the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to \n16  a the medical condition.”142 \n17 \n18 \n19                                             \n20  140 84 Fed.

Fourth, it is a “heavily weighted negative factor” if the “alien had \n2  previously been found inadmissible or deportable on public charge grounds by \n3  an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals.”143 \n4  d.  Heavily weighted positive factors \n5  125.  The Rule establishes three factors that “will generally weigh heavily \n6  in favor of a finding that an alien is not likely to become a public charge.” First, \n7  it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the noncitizen’s “household has \n8  income, assets, or resources, and support . . . of at least 250 percent of the Federal \n9  Poverty Guidelines for the alien’s household size.”144  \n10  126.  Second, it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the “alien is \n11  authorized to work and is currently employed in a legal industry with an annual \n12  income . . . of at least 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for the \n13  alien’s household size.”145 \n14  127.  Third, it is a “heavily weighted positive factor” if the “alien has \n15  private  health  insurance”  that  is  “appropriate  for  the  expected  period  of \n16  admission,” except health insurance for which an immigrant receives premium \n17  tax credits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).146  \n18                                             \n19  143 84 Fed.

Those other criteria that will weigh in favor of a \n4  public charge determination include whether the immigrant: (1) is under the age \n5  of 18 or over the minimum early retirement age for Social Security (currently age \n6  62); (2) has a “medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \n7  treatment or institutionalization” or “interfere with [his] ability to provide and \n8  care for himself,” to “attend school,” or “to work”; (3) has an annual household \n9  gross income under 125% of the Federal poverty guideline (FPG) (or 100% for \n10  active duty service members); (4) has a household size that makes the immigrant \n11  “more likely than not to become a public charge at any time in the future”; \n12  (5) lacks “significant assets, such as savings accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates \n13  of deposit, real estate or other assets”; (6) lacks “sufficient household assets and \n14  resources to cover any reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to a medical \n15  condition,” (7) has “any financial liabilities”; (8) has applied for, “been certified \n16  to receive” or received “public benefits” since [October 15, 2019]; (9) has applied \n17  for or has received a USCIS fee waiver for an immigration benefit request since \n18  [October 15, 2019]; has a lower “credit history and credit score”; (10) lacks \n19  private  health  insurance  or  other  sufficient  assets  and  resources  to  cover \n20 \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  61  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Under the Rule, the Department must also consider any required \n4  affidavit of support meeting the statutory sponsorship and income requirements. \n5  But an affidavit of support would not be dispositive, and its weight would depend \n6  on the “likelihood that the sponsor would actually provide the statutorily-required \n7  amount of financial support” in the judgment of USCIS.148 Again, this is a major \n8  departure from prior agency practice and precedent, which had long treated a \n9  compliant affidavit of support as a significant, if not outcome-determinative \n10  factor in favor of the applicant.149 \n11  f.  Other provisions \n12  130.  The Rule would apply a more exacting standard to applications for \n13  adjustment  of  status  or  immigrant  visas  than  to  applications  for  temporary \n14  nonimmigrant visas. Specifically, USCIS would consider the “immigration status \n15  that the alien seeks and the expected period of admission as it relates to the alien’s \n16  ability to financially support for [sic] himself or herself during the duration of the \n17  alien’s stay.”150 \n18                                             \n19  147 84 Fed.

The  Rule  also  authorizes  the  Department  to  allow  a  lawful \n2  permanent resident applicant determined likely to become a public charge to \n3  submit a “public charge bond” as a condition of his or her green card approval. \n4  The decision to allow a public charge bond is discretionary, but the Department \n5  “generally will not favorably exercise discretion” if at least one heavily weighed \n6  negative factors applies. The amount of the bond must be at least $8,100, which \n7  is breached in full if the applicant receives any public benefits for more than 12 \n8  months in the aggregate within any 36-month period after becoming a lawful \n9  permanent resident.151 \n10  132.  Like the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule also imposes additional \n11  requirements on nonimmigrants applying for a change of status or an extension \n12  of stay, though the INA’s public charge exclusion applies in neither situation. \n13  The Rule provides that such applications will be denied unless the applicant \n14  demonstrates that he or she has not received public benefits since obtaining the \n15  nonimmigrant status that he is seeking to extend or change for 12 months total \n16  within a 36-month period.152 Unlike the Proposed Rule, the Final Rule does not \n17  require or permit consideration of whether a nonimmigrant applicant for change \n18  of status or extension of stay is “likely to receive public benefits” in the future.  \n19                                             \n20  151 84 Fed.

The Department’s failure to provide reasoned analysis, \nexamine relevant data, or address public comments’ significant \n2  concerns \n3  133.  As mentioned above, the Department received more than 260,000 \n4  public comments on the Proposed Rule, the “vast majority” in opposition.153 The \n5  public comments raised significant concerns regarding the legality and impact of \n6  the Department’s radical proposed transformation of the public charge exclusion. \n7  In the preamble to the Final Rule, the Department failed to provide reasoned \n8  analysis,  examine  the  relevant  data,  or  adequately  address  the  significant \n9  concerns raised in the public comments.  \n10  a.  Definition of public charge \n11  134.  First and foremost, the Department failed to account for its decision \n12  to redefine the term public charge in a manner inconsistent with the historical \n13  understanding of public charge, Congressional intent, and more than a century of \n14  judicial and administrative precedent. In response, the Department asserted that \n15  the  Rule  interprets  “ambiguous  terms  that  Congress  itself  left  undefined,” \n16  offering the ipse dixit that it “believes that its definition with what it means to be \n17  a public charge.”154 \n18 \n19 \n20                                             \n21  153 84 Fed.

The 12-month public benefit threshold \n2  135.  Many commenters criticized the Proposed Rule’s thresholds for \n3  consideration  of  public  benefits  as  arbitrary.  Under  the  Proposed  Rule, \n4  monetizable  public  benefits  would  weigh  in  favor  of  a  public  charge \n5  determination  if  they  exceeded  15%  of  FPG  in  a  12-month  period,  while \n6  non-monetizable benefits would be a negative factor if received for 12 months \n7  within a 36-month period. Commenters noted that the Department had provided \n8  no data to support its 15% threshold, which would have considered the receipt of \n9  just $150 per month (or $5 per day) in benefits as a heavily weighted factor \n10  favoring  a  public  charge  finding.  Commenters  also  criticized  the  12-month \n11  standard for non-monetizable benefits as arbitrary and irrational, particularly \n12  with respect to specific programs like Medicaid, which is designed for continuous \n13  enrollment. \n14  136.  Implicitly acknowledging the arbitrariness of the 15% threshold, the \n15  Department correctly abandoned it in the Final Rule—but only to adopt the \n16  flawed 12-month threshold for monetizable benefits as well. Under the Rule’s \n17  public charge test, the receipt of any public benefit—monetizable or not—for 12 \n18  or  more  months  in a  36-month period would  constitute  a heavily  weighted \n19  negative factor. Each additional benefit received in the same period would count \n20  as  an  additional  month,  such  that  just  three  months  of  Medicaid,  housing \n21  vouchers, food stamps, and income assistance could result in a public charge \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  65  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The \n2  Department acknowledged that by ignoring the value of benefits received, its \n3  12-month  threshold  could  result  in  a  public  charge  finding  based  on  an \n4  immigrant’s receipt of “only hundreds of dollars or less in public benefits.” The \n5  Department  did not provide  a  reasoned explanation  to  justify  the  12-month \n6  threshold’s “incongruities.”155  \n7  137.  Indeed, the only justification the Department provided for adopting \n8  this strict 12-month threshold for all public benefits is that it is “simpler and more \n9  administrable” than its 15% of FPG threshold.156 But just because a regulation is \n10  administrable does not make it rational or non-arbitrary. The Department fails to \n11  provide  data,  evidence,  or  reasoned  analysis  to  explain  why  it  believes  an \n12  immigrant’s past receipt of public assistance for as little as a few months is at all \n13  predictive  of  whether  she  will  become  a  public  charge  in  the  future.  The \n14  Department cited a Census Bureau study finding that 31.2% of participants in \n15  “one or more means-tested assistance programs” ended their participation within \n16  a year, ignoring that many of those participants may have received more than one \n17  benefit program—rendering the study entirely irrelevant to the Rule’s 12-month \n18  threshold.157  As  the  Department’s  own  analysis  reveals,  of  individuals  who \n19                                             \n20  15584 Fed.

Heavily weighted negative factors \n6  138.  The Department received multiple comments criticizing the use of \n7  “heavily weighted factors” (or “weighed,” in the Proposed Rule’s terminology), \n8  separate  from  the  enumerated  considerations  that  Congress  mandated  the \n9  Department  to  consider  in  the  totality  of  circumstances  test  codified  in  the \n10  Immigration  Reform  Act.  Attempting  to  defend  its  decision  to  create \n11  non-statutory heavily weighted factors, the Department asserts that it “does not \n12  change that the public charge inadmissibility determination is one that is made \n13  based on the totality of the alien’s individual facts and circumstances.”159 Yet the \n14  Department fails to account for the fact that the Rule’s heavily weighted negative \n15  factors—which overlap considerably to the point of double-counting—will often \n16  be dispositive in operation, contrary to Congressional intent.  \n17  139.  In  particular,  the  public  benefit  factor  is  likely  to  be \n18  outcome-determinative in most cases. That factor weighs heavily in a public \n19  charge determination if an immigrant receives one or more public benefits for 12 \n20                                             \n21  158 84 Fed.

The Department asserts that the factor \n2  “will  not  necessarily  be  dispositive  in  the  inadmissibility  determination,” \n3  overlooking that whenever it applies, at least one other enumerated negative \n4  factor will always also apply. That is so because the Rule requires consideration \n5  of evidence that the immigrant has “applied for,” “received,” or “been certified \n6  or  approved  to  receive”  any  public  benefits.160  Furthermore,  because  the \n7  enumerated public benefits are all means-tested, the vast majority of recipients \n8  will also have an annual income below 125 percent of FPG, which would itself \n9  also “generally be a heavily weighed negative factor.”161  \n10  140.  So  too,  is  the  medical  condition  negative  factor  likely  to  be \n11  dispositive. That heavily weighted factor is triggered where an applicant (1) has \n12  a  medical  condition  “likely  to  require  extensive  medical  treatment  or \n13  institutionalization” and is (2) both uninsured and has neither the prospect of \n14  obtaining private health insurance nor the resources to pay for medical costs.162 \n15  That standard is literally duplicative with the ostensibly separate “health” factor, \n16  which weighs in favor of a public charge determination when an “alien has been \n17  diagnosed with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical \n18 \n19                                             \n20  160 84 Fed.

These factors thus do not merely “coincide or relate to each other,” \n10  as the Department contends, but instead engender obvious double-counting.165 \n11  The Department does not provide a reasoned basis for creating duplicative—and \n12  effectively  dispositive—“heavily  weighted  factors”  that  outweigh  the \n13  considerations  Congress  has  expressly  set  forth  in  the  statutory  totality  of \n14  circumstances test.   \n15  d.  Private health insurance \n16  142.  Commenters  expressed  significant  concern  over  the  Proposed \n17  Rule’s consideration of private health insurance as a factor in the public charge \n18  test. As numerous commenters pointed out, many immigrants work in industries \n19                                             \n20  163 84 Fed.

Many commenters also \n2  noted  that  considering  health  insurance  and  related  factors,  such  as  having \n3  sufficient  household  assets  and  resources  to  cover  “reasonably  foreseeable \n4  medical  costs,”  would  disproportionately  and  negatively  affect  certain \n5  populations,  including  people  with  disabilities;  people  with  chronic  health \n6  conditions; the elderly; and immigrants of color.166 \n7  143.  The  Department  entirely  disregarded  those  concerns,  instead \n8  elevating private health insurance coverage to a heavily weighted positive factor \n9  in the Final Rule. The Department stated that it will proceed to consider “whether \n10  a person has health insurance or has the household assets and resources to pay \n11  for reasonably foreseeable medical costs,” and that having private insurance will \n12  generally be weighed as a heavily positive factor (provided the insurance is not \n13  for example offset by tax credits under the ACA).167 Further, the Department \n14  readily conceded that “certain individuals may choose to forego public health \n15  insurance, such as Medicaid, because of the impact on public charge.”168 The \n16  Department did not explain how such disenrollment from health coverage could \n17  possibly advance its purported goal to promote immigrants’ self-sufficiency and \n18  economic independence.  \n19                                             \n20  166 84 Fed.

Although  the  Department  notably  stated  it  would  not  consider \n2  programs other than Medicaid as public benefits, its response to these comments \n3  clarifies that the “evaluation may in some cases require DHS to consider an \n4  alien’s publicly funded or subsidized health insurance that is not defined as a \n5  public  benefit  under  this  rule.”169  Finally,  regarding  the  potentially \n6  disproportionate  impact  on  certain  populations  such  as  the  disabled,  the \n7  Department responded simply that it “does not intend to disproportionately affect \n8  such groups.”170 Such a cursory explanation does not justify the arbitrary and \n9  capricious  nature  of  the  factor,  which  double  counts  certain  evidence  to \n10  disadvantage immigrants who use medical benefits they are entitled to receive.  \n11  e.  Nonimmigrant applications for change of status or \nextension of stay \n12 \n145.  Numerous commenters criticized the Proposed Rule for applying a \n13 \npublic charge-like test to nonimmigrant applicants for a change of status or \n14 \nextension  of  stay,  neither  of  which  is  subject  to  the  INA’s  public  charge \n15 \nexclusion. Under the Public Charge Rule, extension of stay and change of status \n16 \napplicants  must  establish  that  they  have  not  received  public  benefits  in  an \n17 \naggregate of 12 months in the prior 36-month period. The Department denies that \n18 \nit is “intended to “apply the public charge ground of inadmissibility to extension \n19 \n20                                             \n21  169 84 Fed.

The Department’s denial is implausible. Not only does this “new \n5  condition of approval” appear in the very regulation called “Inadmissibility on \n6  Public Charge Grounds,” but it bootstraps into change of status and extension of \n7  stay applications the central criterion of the Department’s new public charge test \n8  (i.e.,  the  receipt  of  public  benefits  above  the  12-month  threshold).  The \n9  Department fails to explain how expanding that core criterion beyond the public \n10  charge exclusion’s statutory bounds comports with its authority under the INA.  \n11  f.  Application to lawful permanent residents returning \nfrom 180-day trips abroad  \n12 \n147.  Commenters also criticized the Department for failing to estimate \n13 \nthe consequences or costs of applying its expansive new public charge standard \n14 \nto lawful permanent residents returning to the United States after 180 or more \n15 \ndays abroad. The Department’s only response is that it “does not believe such a \n16 \nquantitative estimate is necessary.”172 That brusque response fails to give due \n17 \nconsideration to a significant concern about how the regulation will affect lawful \n18 \npermanent residents on the path to U.S. citizenship. \n19 \n20                                             \n21  171 84 Fed.

For  example,  one  analysis \n5  predicted  that  the  public  charge  test’s  income  thresholds  would  have \n6  “disproportionate effects based on national origin and ethnicity, blocking 71 \n7  percent of applicants from Mexico and Central America, 69 percent from Africa, \n8  and  52  percent  from  Asia—but  only  36  percent  from  Europe,  Canada  and \n9  Oceania.”173  \n10  149.  The Department did not dispute that the Rule would have a disparate \n11  impact  on  immigrants  of  color.  Instead,  the  Department  claimed  it  did  not \n12  intentionally “codify this final rule to discriminate”174 and that it “does not \n13  understand commenters’ statements about the ‘unequal application’ of the public \n14  charge  inadmissibility  rule.”175  Although  it  provided  no  evidence,  the \n15  Department “disagree[d] that the public charge inadmissibility rule would be \n16  unequally applied to different groups of aliens along the lines of race.”176 That \n17  bald  denial  fails  to  meaningfully  address  an  important  aspect  of  the  \n18                                             \n19  173 84 Fed.

Credit history and financial liabilities \n4  150.  Several  commenters  expressed  concern  that  the  Proposed  Rule \n5  sought to consider an immigrant’s credit history as a factor in the determination \n6  of  whether  the  immigrant  is  likely  to  become  a  public  charge.  As  these \n7  commenters noted, credit scores and credit histories were not intended to be used \n8  in the immigration context; do not assess an immigrant’s likelihood of being \n9  self-sufficient; have no correlation with the evaluation factor; are often highly \n10  inaccurate; and may be affected by factors outside the immigrant’s control but \n11  from which they may recover. Further, commenters noted that credit reports \n12  contain irrelevant data, such as medical debts that do not measure an individual’s \n13  financial status, while at the same time omitting potentially more relevant data, \n14  such as consistency of rent payments. Other commenters noted that considering \n15  credit scores would essentially “double count” evidence already factoring into \n16  the public charge determination.  \n17  151.  The  Department  largely  disregarded  these  concerns,  however, \n18  instead stating in conclusory fashion that it believes such information is useful \n19  “in determining whether aliens are able to support themselves.” According to the \n20  Department, credit reports “generally assist creditors to determine the credit \n21  worthiness or risk of a person,” and the Department proposes its use of credit \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  74  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Immigration fee waiver \n8  152.  Many commentators criticized the Proposed Rule for taking into \n9  consideration whether an immigrant had ever received an immigration fee waiver \n10  as a negative factor weighing in favor of a public charge finding. As these \n11  commentators noted, there is no evidence to suggest the one-time receipt of an \n12  immigration fee waiver correlates to whether an immigrant is likely to become a \n13  public charge. For example, commenters noted that an immigrant’s financial \n14  condition often improves after receiving the immigration benefits for which they \n15  received the fee waiver. Further, commenters noted that considering the one-time \n16  receipt of a fee waiver leads to double counting income, which unduly punishes \n17  immigrants who received fee waivers based on temporarily adverse economic \n18  circumstances. Finally, other commentators noted that punishing immigrants for \n19  seeking fee waivers is counter-productive, as immigrants often seek such waivers \n20  for work authorization (as they have no income at the time they apply) or to \n21                                             \n22  177 84 Fed.

The Department largely brushed these concerns aside, however, \n6  essentially arguing that any problems resulting from consideration of fee waivers \n7  would be minimal, as they constitute “only one evidentiary consideration in the \n8  totality of the circumstances and [are] not heavily weighted.”178 But, injecting an \n9  arbitrary and unreliable factor into a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis does \n10  not make consideration of the factor any less arbitrary. Here, the Department has \n11  failed  to  proffer  any  non-arbitrary  or  capricious  basis  for  considering  the \n12  one-time receipt of a fee-waiver as a factor. \n13  j.  High school diploma \n14  154.  Many commenters stated that considering whether an immigrant has \n15  a high school diploma or comparable educational background will arbitrarily \n16  discriminate against large categories of immigrants, including farm workers and \n17  other trade workers who may have been lawfully present and working for many \n18  years without obtaining such a degree. Several commenters also noted the factor \n19  discriminates in particular against immigrant women, many of whom come from \n20  countries where women are discouraged or prevented from attending school. \n21                                             \n22  178 84 Fed.

In  response,  the \n5  Department  noted  merely  that  it  was  required  to  consider  an  immigrant’s \n6  educational background in the totality of circumstances review. The Department \n7  conceded that “lack of formal education such as the lack of a high school diploma \n8  or  other  education  are  generally  a  negative  consideration,”  but  noted  that \n9  employment history and “occupational skills, certifications or licenses” may also \n10  be considered.179 The Department’s undue emphasis on a formal diploma—even \n11  despite  overwhelming  evidence  and  commentary  noting  that  immigrants \n12  frequently  work  and  contribute  without  any  such  educational  \n13  background—renders the factor arbitrary and capricious. \n14  k.  English proficiency \n15  155.  Many commenters objected to including an immigrant’s proficiency \n16  in English as a factor in the public charge determination, noting that “requiring \n17  English proficiency would mark a fundamental change from the nation’s historic \n18  commitment to welcoming and integrating immigrants.”180 Other commenters \n19  noted that English language learners often benefit from receipt of Medicaid or \n20                                             \n21  179 84 Fed.

As numerous commenters noted, the Rule will deter these \n3  immigrants from accepting the very benefits that would better enable them to \n4  improve their employability. Other commenters argued that evaluating English \n5  proficiency  will  unduly  burden  immigrant  women  and  deaf  immigrants; \n6  constitutes discrimination on the basis of national origin; and has no relation to \n7  the rule’s purported goal, as skilled immigrants may readily obtain employment \n8  in fields that do not require English proficiency. According to these commenters, \n9  the Rule would “improperly reject many people with practical job skills doing \n10  essential work in our economy that have limited formal education and English \n11  proficiency highlighted farmworkers as an example.”181 The Department largely \n12  shrugged  off  these  concerns,  however,  noting  repeatedly  that  it  was  not \n13  “mandating  English  proficiency  for  admissibility.”182  And,  although  the \n14  Department  conceded  that  individuals  who  lack  English  proficiency  might \n15  already be working or able to obtain employment, it nevertheless argued that \n16  “people  with  the  lowest  English  speaking  ability  tend  to  have  the  lowest \n17  employment  rate,  lowest  rate  of  full-time  employment,  and  lowest  median \n18  earnings.”183  The  Department’s  willful  disregard  of  these  comments \n19                                             \n20  181 84 Fed.

Federalism summary impact statement \n5  156.  Although  Executive  Order  13,132  requires  the  Department  to \n6  produce a federalism summary impact statement, the Department summarily \n7  asserted that the Rule “does not have substantial direct effects on the States” and \n8  the Rule “requires no further agency action or analysis.”184 \n9  157.  The Department’s analysis of its obligations under Executive Order \n10  13,132 was insufficient because the Department did not identify the myriad costs \n11  and effects of the Rule on the Plaintiff States. As discussed throughout this \n12  complaint, the Rule has profound direct effects on state and local governments \n13  and will impose substantial costs on state and local governments. \n14  158.  The Plaintiff States raised the concern about the Proposed Rule’s \n15  lack of federalism summary impact statement in their comment letter—as did \n16  various  other  commentators.

Cost-benefit analysis \n2  159.  DHS generally failed to conduct a true or adequate cost-benefit \n3  analysis, instead only aiming to quantify the direct reduction in transfer payments \n4  resulting from the Rule. For example, DHS failed to estimate the chilling effects \n5  of the Rule because it was “difficult to predict the rule’s disenrollment impacts \n6  with respect to people who are not regulated by this rule, such as people who \n7  erroneously believe themselves to be affected.”185 The preamble also repeatedly \n8  diminishes the significance of impacts to those people, businesses, and state \n9  governments that are  not  “directly”  regulated by  the  Rule. In neglecting to \n10  conduct deeper quantitative analysis of the costs to states or their economies, the \n11  preamble cites, for example, “great uncertainty” to “the broader economy” as a \n12  result of diminished transfer payments.186 \n13  160.  With  respect  to  chilling  effects,  the  preamble  makes  broad, \n14  unsupported assumptions. DHS dismisses widespread confusion that currently \n15  exists and that will be exacerbated by the Rule, saying only that it would be \n16  “unwarranted” for people to disenroll from a benefit if they were not subject to \n17  the Rule and that DHS “will not alter the rule to account for such unwarranted \n18  choices.”187 This significantly understates the impacts of a drastic change in \n19                                             \n20  185 84 Fed.

In purporting  to  analyze  the number  of noncitizens  who  would \n4  choose to forego benefits to which they are legally entitled, DHS arbitrarily used \n5  a  figure  of  2.5%  of  the  estimated  number  of  foreign-born  noncitizens \n6  participating  in  any  particular  program.  Instead  of  actually  attempting  to \n7  determine the number of people who were expected to disenroll, DHS apparently \n8  selected this figure by using the number of individuals seeking to adjust status \n9  within a given time period.188 \n10  162.  DHS downplays the number of impacted individuals by the Rule in \n11  numerous  ways.  For  example,  the  preamble  states  that  most  applicants  are \n12  “unlikely to suffer negative consequences from past receipt of public benefits \n13  because  they  will  have been  residing outside the  United  States. . . .”189  The \n14  preamble then cites statistics showing that only about 33% of the relevant group \n15  of immigrants between fiscal years 2015 and 2017 adjusted their status while in \n16  the United States. However, because the United States admitted over 541 million \n17                                             \n18  188 Department of Homeland Security, [CIS No. 2499-10; DHS Docket No. \n19  USCIS-2010-0012]; RIN 1615-AA22, Proposed Rule: Inadmissibility on Public \n20  Charge Grounds, Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of \n21  Public Benefits Program, Table 4, n. 1. \n22  189 84 Fed.

This is but one example of \n4  arbitrary qualitative analysis minimizing the reach of the Rule. \n5  163.  DHS  does  not  adequately  assess  the  costs  to  states.  While \n6  acknowledging that state and local governments would “incur costs,” DHS goes \n7  on  to  dismiss  these  costs  as  “unclear”  and  “indirect,”  with  no  substantive \n8  analysis.190 \n9  164.  DHS  repeatedly  cites  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget’s \n10  Circular A-4 as excusing quantitative or even qualitative analysis of various \n11  impacts. OMB’s Circular A-4 assists agencies in conducting a regulatory analysis \n12  of economically significant actions consistent with Executive Order 12866. Far \n13  from  excusing  analysis  of  “chilling  effects”  on  immigrants,  costs  to  state \n14  governments, private businesses such as hospitals, or the economy, Circular A-4 \n15  expressly  states  that  agencies  should  include  the  monetary  values  of \n16  “Private-sector compliance costs and savings” and “Government administrative \n17  costs and savings.” Circular A-4 also does not excuse analysis where there is \n18  uncertainty. Rather, it states that while the precise benefits and costs of regulatory \n19  options are not always known, “the probability of their occurrence can often be \n20  developed.” \n21                                             \n22  190 84 Fed.

By focusing only on the reduction in direct transfer payments, DHS \n2  greatly overstates the benefits of the Rule. In many instances, these “savings” \n3  will be offset by even greater costs that are simply shifted to others, including \n4  other federal or state programs, or private parties. DHS’s treatment of the impacts \n5  to the Medicaid program provides a clear example of this deficiency in analysis. \n6  DHS estimates a reduction in transfer payments related to Medicaid of over \n7  $1 billion.191 But this estimate fails to take into account increased costs from \n8  emergency services that will result from delaying health care until conditions \n9  become emergent and they are much more costly to treat. At that time, costs are \n10  borne by other federal programs, states, private hospitals and health providers, \n11  and  individuals  receiving  care.  For  example,  in  Washington,  the  Alien \n12  Emergency Medical Program covers certain emergency care for noncitizens. The \n13  program  is  funded  through  both  state  and  federal  sources.  Private  medical \n14  providers will also suffer costs by providing uncompensated care. By making no \n15  effort to analyze these resulting costs, DHS has overstated the actual benefits of \n16  the Rule in its cost-benefit analysis. \n17 \n18                                             \n19  191 Department of Homeland Security, [CIS No. 2499-10; DHS Docket No. \n20  USCIS-2010-0012]; RIN 1615-AA22, Proposed Rule: Inadmissibility on Public \n21  Charge Grounds, Economic Analysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of \n22  Public Benefits Program, Table 5. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  83  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

THE RULE’S CHILLING EFFECTS ON PARTICIPATION IN \nFEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS \n2 \n166.  As the Department itself recognizes, the Rule will cause lawfully \n3 \npresent noncitizens whom Congress specifically made eligible to participate in \n4 \nfederal benefit programs—and U.S. citizens with participating or eligible family \n5 \nmembers—to disenroll or forbear enrollment. The Rule does so by making the \n6 \nreceipt of benefits (including five non-cash federal benefits—SNAP, Medicaid, \n7 \nSection 8 vouchers, Section 8 rental assistance, and public housing subsidies) a \n8 \nground for designating a person a public charge. Even harsher, the Rule makes \n9 \nan immigrant beneficiary’s exclusion virtually inevitable by making receipt of \n10 \nsuch benefits a “heavily weighed negative factor” in the determination.  \n11 \n167.  The chilling effects of the Rule began to materialize long before its \n12 \npublication, and were observed quickly following the leaks in January 2017 of \n13 \nthe draft Executive Order and in March 2018 of the draft Rule. Due to the \n14 \nambiguity and complexity of the Rule, many noncitizens and their families have \n15 \nforegone and will forego participation in a wide swath of federal, state, and local \n16 \nbenefits.  Widespread  confusion  over  which  forms  of  “public  benefits”  will \n17 \ntrigger a public charge determination will exacerbate the Rule’s harms to the \n18 \nPlaintiff States and their residents.  \n19 \n168.  As eligible noncitizens and their families disenroll or refrain from \n20 \nseeking federal benefits for fear of jeopardizing their ability to immigrate, many \n21 \nwill turn to the Plaintiff States’ programs to fill the gap. Others will refrain from \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  84  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

These  harms  to \n4  individuals and families will place increased downstream financial strain on the \n5  Plaintiff States, including their housing, public health, and education systems. \n6  169.  The  Department  admits  that  the  Rule  will  deter  immigrant \n7  participation  in  public  benefits  programs,  despite  Congress’s  express \n8  determination allowing immigrant participation.192 Indeed, in the Department’s \n9  view, the chilling effects are not a vice of the Rule but a virtue—regardless of the \n10  acknowledged decline in health, income, educational opportunities, housing, and \n11  overall quality of life they will cause among millions in our communities.193 The \n12  Department even suggests that state agencies “advise potential beneficiaries of \n13  the potential immigration consequences of receiving certain public benefits.”194 \n14  The manifest intent of the Rule is to exclude immigrants this Administration \n15  deems “undesirable” from the United States and, barring that, to exclude them \n16  and their families from the U.S. social safety net, contrary to congressional and \n17  state determinations regarding eligibility.  \n18 \n19                                             \n20  192 83 Fed.

As a result of those chilling effects, implementation of the Rule will \n2  also cause severe and irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States. First, States will \n3  lose federal dollars from benefits programs that they administer to the benefit of \n4  their residents. Additional direct costs to states will result from immigrants who \n5  shift from federal programs to state programs that do not qualify as “public \n6  benefits” under the Rule. At the same time, disenrollment and non-enrollment in \n7  nutrition, health, and other federal and state assistance programs will make many \n8  working class immigrant families less healthy, less productive, more reliant on \n9  state-covered  emergency  medical  care,  more  likely  to  experience  economic \n10  dislocation and homelessness—all of which will redound to greater strains on \n11  state agencies and programs. Further, the broader chilling effects among all state-\n12  run  assistance programs  will undermine  those programs’  administration  and \n13  effectiveness. Those affected programs include, but are not limited to, medical \n14  and healthcare services, food assistance programs, housing benefits, financial and \n15  cash assistance programs, long-term support services for elderly and disabled \n16  residents,  education  systems,  job  and  employment  training  programs,  and \n17  programs supporting crime victims. \n18  171.  For any immigrants reviewing this Complaint for guidance on the \n19  types of programs that are deemed a “public benefit” for purposes of the Rule, \n20  the Plaintiff States strongly urge the immigrant to contact the relevant State \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  86  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

As mentioned throughout, many state programs do not qualify as “public \n2  benefits” under the Rule. \n3  A.  Health Care Programs \n4  172.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer medical services and \n5  benefits programs such as Medicaid. Some of these programs are jointly funded \n6  by federal and state funds and others by only state funds. As set forth below, the \n7  Rule would imperil the effectiveness of these programs by reducing enrollment, \n8  jeopardizing public health, and dramatically increasing costs to the Plaintiff \n9  States. \n10  1.  Federal health care benefits \n11  173.  Congress created Medicaid in 1965 to assist states in furnishing \n12  medical assistance to individuals and families.195  \n13  174.  Medicaid is jointly funded by the states and the federal government. \n14  A state’s participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but once a state chooses to \n15  participate it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements to \n16  receive federal matching funds.196  \n17  175.  Anyone who qualifies under program rules can receive Medicaid. \n18 \n19                                             \n20  195 See Pub.

States  administer  Medicaid  and  generally  determine  financial \n2  eligibility criteria for participants. \n3  177.  Federal law requires coverage for certain groups of individuals, \n4  including some low-income families, qualified pregnant women and children, \n5  and  individuals  receiving  Supplemental  Security  Income.  States  may  offer \n6  coverage  for  additional  groups,  such  as  people  receiving  home  and \n7  community-based services and children in foster care who are not otherwise \n8  eligible.  States  may  extend  Medicaid  coverage  to  all  children  and pregnant \n9  women, including any immigrants lawfully residing in the United States.197 \n10  178.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  established  a  new  methodology  for \n11  determining  Medicaid  income  eligibility.  Some  individuals  are  eligible  for \n12  Medicaid based on methodology other than income, such as disability. These \n13  changes resulted in greater participation in the Medicaid Program. Thirty-six \n14  states, and the District of Columbia, participated in the Medicaid expansion. \n15  179.  Over  half  of  all  non-elderly  adults  receiving  Medicaid—about \n16  60%—are  working.  An  even  greater  number  of  Medicaid  recipients—about \n17  79%—are from a home where at least one household member works. Among \n18  adult Medicaid enrollees who work, over half (about 51%) work full-time for the \n19  entire year. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  197 42 U.S.C.§ 1396b(v)(4)(A). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  88  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act,  states  may  extend  Medicaid \n2  eligibility to lawful permanent residents and all other “qualified” immigrants \n3  after a five year waiting period.198 States may also elect to use state-only funds \n4  to cover qualified immigrants during the five-year ban.199 Many of the Plaintiff \n5  States have done so.200 Although such state-only health benefits do not constitute \n6  “public benefits” under the Rule’s public charge test, many noncitizens will fear \n7  that enrollment in state-funded programs (which often have the same name as the \n8  state’s Medicaid program) will carry adverse immigration consequences. \n9  2.  State health care benefits \n10  181.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer numerous health care \n11  services programs, including Medicaid.  \n12  182.  Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to participate \n13  in these state-run medical services programs. If implemented, the Rule would \n14  result in many otherwise eligible individuals—including citizens—disenrolling \n15                                             \n16  198 See 8 U.S.C. § 1613(a). \n17  199 8 U.S.C. § 1622(a). \n18  200 See ASPE Issue Brief: Overview of Immigrants’ Eligibility for SNAP, \n19  TANF, Medicaid, and CHIP, Office of the Ass’t Sec’y for Planning & Eval., U.S. \n20  Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. (Mar. 2012), https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/ \n21  overview-immigrants-eligibility-snap-tanf-medicaid-and-chip \n22  (HHS Issue Brief). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  89  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Individuals who are eligible to enroll in these programs but elect not \n4  to participate because of the Rule will likely delay seeking both routine and \n5  necessary  medical  treatment  (including  vital  preventative  services  such  as \n6  vaccinations)  until  they  require  emergency  care.  Indeed,  the  Department \n7  essentially concedes this fact, noting that “DHS acknowledges that increased use \n8  of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary healthcare due to \n9  delayed  treatment  is  possible  and  there  is  a  potential  for  increases  in \n10  uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for by an insurer \n11  or patient.”201 Individuals who resort to emergency care as a method of primary \n12  healthcare are more likely to experience severe medical conditions, creating \n13  public health concerns and requiring unnecessarily expensive emergency medical \n14  treatment, the overwhelming cost of which will be borne by the Plaintiff States \n15  and their private hospitals. \n16  184.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n17  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n18  these health care services programs. \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  201 84 Fed.

The Plaintiff States’ medical assistance programs \n2  185.  Each of the Plaintiff States manages and administers a Medicaid \n3  program for its residents. In addition, the Plaintiff States administer numerous \n4  other health care programs, some with combined federal and state funds and some \n5  with state-only funds. With community, state, and national partners, the Plaintiff \n6  States provide evidence-based, cost-effective services that support the health and \n7  well-being of individuals, families, and communities in their States. \n8  186.  Many of the Plaintiff States’ Medicaid programs include coverage \n9  groups encompassing citizens and noncitizens, including adults between the ages \n10  of 19 and 65; certain parents and caretakers; the elderly; the blind and disabled; \n11  those  using  long-term  support  services  or  hospice;  and  Medicare  Savings \n12  Program enrollees. \n13  187.  The  Washington  Health  Care  Authority  (HCA)  administers \n14  Washington’s  Medicaid  program,  as  well  as  other  federal  and  state-funded \n15  medical assistance programs. HCA has over 1,300 employees and a biennial \n16  budget of over $20 billion.  \n17  188.  Washington Apple Health is the name for Washington’s medical \n18  assistance programs, which include not only the state Medicaid program, which \n19  is covered under the Rule, but also other programs that are not expressly covered \n20  but are likely to be affected, including because of the Rule’s chilling effect on \n21  eligible individuals. This chilling effect on programs not expressly covered under \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  91  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Through the Apple Health program, Washington purchases health \n4  care for approximately 1.9 million people. In state fiscal year 2019, Washington’s \n5  HCA  is  expected  to  spend  $10.1  billion  to  support  Apple  Health  and  its \n6  Community Behavioral Health Services program. Of this amount, $6.8 billion \n7  will come from federal contributions.  \n8  190.  Washington’s Apple Health currently covers adults with incomes up \n9  to 138 percent of the federal poverty level under the Adult Medical Program and \n10  provides these individuals with essential health coverage, including preventative \n11  care, inpatient hospitalization, prescription drugs, and many other health services. \n12  191.  The Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services \n13  (EOHHS) manages Massachusetts’s Medicaid program, which is covered by the \n14  Rule, as well as other health assistance programs that are not expressly covered \n15  but are likely to be affected by the Rule’s chilling effect on eligible individuals. \n16  EOHHS comprises 12 agencies, has over 22,000 employees, and oversees an \n17  annual budget of over $22 billion. \n18  192.  Massachusetts’s Medicaid program and CHIP are combined into \n19  one program, MassHealth, through which Massachusetts provides healthcare \n20  benefits to almost 1.8 million adults, children, and people with disabilities. In \n21  state fiscal year 2019, Massachusetts’s MassHealth spent $16.5 billion to support \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  92  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Of  this  amount,  $4.3  billion  came  from  state  contributions. \n3  Massachusetts’s MassHealth provides essential health coverage to adults and \n4  children, including inpatient and outpatient services, preventive care, mental \n5  health and addiction services, and various other services and benefits. \n6  193.  The Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) \n7  administers Virginia’s Medicaid program, which is subject to the Rule, as well \n8  as various other programs that the Rule does not expressly cover. Virginia’s \n9  Medicaid program currently covers adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal \n10  poverty level and provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient services, \n11  pharmacy,  mental  health  and  addiction  treatment,  long  term  services  and \n12  supports. In 2018, 983,000 Virginians received Medicaid benefits. That number \n13  is projected to rise to as many as 1,406,000 people in 2019. \n14  194.  The  Maryland  Department  of  Health  runs  the  state  Medicaid \n15  program. Through Maryland’s medical assistance programs, the state provides \n16  assistance to 1,160,067 enrollees. \n17  195.  In New Mexico, 840,860 people were enrolled in the state Medicaid \n18  program in 2018. The program, which is covered by the Rule, is administered by \n19  the State’s Human Services Department. \n20  196.

Notably, New Jersey is one of the most diverse \n2  states in the country, with 22% of its residents having been born in a foreign \n3  country. \n4  197.  The Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services \n5  and the Department of Human Services administer the State’s Medicaid program, \n6  as well as other federal- and State- funded medical assistance programs. Under \n7  the State’s Medicaid expansion, eligible Rhode Island residents between the ages \n8  of 19 and 64 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level are eligible \n9  for Medicaid coverage. Rhode Island’s health care services cover approximately \n10  300,000 Rhode Island residents, including citizens and noncitizens. \n11  198.  The  Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services  administers \n12  Minnesota’s Medicaid program, known as Medical Assistance, as well as other \n13  related federal and state-funded health care assistance programs, collectively \n14  known  as  Minnesota  Health  Care  Programs.  Through  the  State’s  Medical \n15  Assistance  program,  Minnesota  purchases  health  care  for  approximately \n16  1,031,888 people. \n17  199.  The Plaintiff States also provide supplemental health care programs \n18  specifically targeted to children. Although the Rule exempts from its public \n19  charge test Medicaid benefits received by immigrants under age 21 and pregnant \n20  women,202 it nevertheless will likely undermine these supplemental children’s \n21                                             \n22  202 84 Fed.

For \n4  example, Virginia’s CHIP program, called Family Access to Medical Insurance \n5  Security (FAMIS), provides free health coverage to children in households at or \n6  below 205% of the poverty level. In fiscal year 2018, Virginia’s CHIP program \n7  alone provided medical care services to more than 200,000 children and pregnant \n8  women. Virginia relies on the CHIP Program to assist in providing low-income \n9  children with health insurance coverage and keeping all children in Virginia \n10  healthy. In fiscal year 2017, Virginia received approximately $291.1 million \n11  federal allotment under the CHIP program. \n12  200.  Washington Apple Health for Kids similarly provides free coverage \n13  to children in households at or below 210% of the federal poverty level. For a \n14  monthly premium, the program also provides coverage to households at or below \n15  312% of the federal poverty level. Washington Apple Health for Kids is partially \n16  funded through CHIP, which receives matching federal funds under the Social \n17  Security Act203 and provides low-income children with essential health coverage, \n18  including preventive care, inpatient hospitalization, prescription drugs, and many \n19  other health services. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  203 See 42 U.S.C. § 1397dd. \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  95  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

As  part  of  the  Washington  Apple  Health  for  Kids  program, \n2  Washington  uses  federal  funds  related  to  CHIP  to  provide  services  for \n3  low-income children whose families are slightly above the income cutoff for free \n4  child health coverage. CHIP dollars also fund other Washington programs and \n5  services, such as medical coverage for lawfully present noncitizen children, and \n6  prenatal coverage for pregnant women ineligible for Medicaid because of their \n7  citizenship status. \n8  202.  The  Plaintiff  States  also  manage  and  administer  several  related \n9  health care programs, which are not considered “public benefits” under the Rule \n10  but which will likely be affected by its chilling effect on eligible participants. For \n11  example, the Washington Family Medical Program provides coverage to adults \n12  with countable income at or below the applicable Medicaid standard who have \n13  dependent children living in their home under age 18. Similarly, Washington’s \n14  Pregnancy and Family Planning Program provides coverage to pregnant women \n15  at or below 193% of the federal poverty level without regard to citizenship or \n16  immigration status.  \n17  203.  Washington provides a host of other medical services programs that \n18  likewise are not directly covered by the Rule but are likely to be harmed by it, \n19  including the Community and Behavioral Health Services Program; the Breast \n20  and  Cervical  Cancer  Treatment  Program  for  Women;  the  Refugee  Medical \n21  Assistance Program; the Alien Emergency Medical Program; the Supplemental \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  96  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Similarly, Virginia state agencies administer a host of additional \n5  medical services that are not covered by the Rule but are likely to be affected by \n6  it, including community  mental health services through Community Service \n7  Boards; newcomer refugee health program; breast and cervical cancer prevention \n8  and treatment; labor and delivery services, and dialysis services. \n9  205.  Massachusetts similarly administers various other medical services \n10  programs that, while not covered by the Rule, are likely to be harmed by it. These \n11  include programs targeted towards infectious and chronic disease prevention, \n12  substance abuse treatment and prevention, cancer screening and diagnosis, and \n13  sexual and domestic violence prevention.   \n14  206.  Many of the Plaintiff States also provide state-only-funded health \n15  coverage to qualified immigrants prior to the five-year ban. Those states include \n16  Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia, and Washington.204 \n17  b.  Irreparable harm to medical assistance programs \n18  207.  The Rule will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ medical \n19  assistance programs. For example, the Rule will result in (1) a loss of medical \n20  care and healthcare insurance for the Plaintiff States’ residents; (2) higher and \n21                                             \n22  204 HHS Issue Brief at 5–6.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  97  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Rule will cause a devastating loss of health coverage under \n7  government-sponsored health programs in the Plaintiff States. If the Rule is \n8  implemented,  the  Plaintiff  States  will  experience  disenrollment  rates  for \n9  noncitizens ranging from 15 to 35%, based on metrics and data analysis from the \n10  Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit foundation focused on providing the \n11  United States public with unbiased research and journalism on major health care \n12  issues.205 \n13  209.

Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.106   Page 106 of 176\n \n1  (1)  Plaintiff States’ residents will lose medical care and \nbecome uninsured \n2 \n210.  In  Washington,  as  of  October  31,  2017,  there  were  107,244 \n3 \nnoncitizens insured for health coverage under Apple Health. These enrollees will \n4 \nbe deterred from using government health insurance and government-funded \n5 \nhealth services by the Rule. \n6 \n211.  An additional 140,612 Washington families had a member of a \n7 \nhousehold who might be subject to a public charge determination while another \n8 \nhousehold member is receiving Apple Health coverage. Although the Rule does \n9 \nnot  expressly  consider  public  benefits  accessed  by  another  member  of  the \n10 \nimmigrant’s  household,206  members  of  mixed-status  households  will  fear \n11 \naccessing  Apple  Health-covered  services  to  which  they  are  legally  entitled, \n12 \nresulting in public health concerns and increased costs due to delays in accessing \n13 \npreventative care, vaccinations, prenatal care, and wellness checks. \n14 \n212.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n15 \nresult in an annual reduction in medical and behavioral care in Washington of \n16 \nbetween $42.6 million and $99.4 million. \n17 \n213.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n18 \ncause approximately 10,000 to 24,000 lawfully present adults to lose medical \n19 \ncare annually and become uninsured. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  206 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,370.  \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  99  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.107   Page 107 of 176\n \n1  214.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Washington the Rule will \n2  cause approximately 2,600 to 6,000 undocumented adults and children to lose \n3  Medicaid annually and become uninsured.  \n4  215.  The severe effects of such a loss of coverage could also result in a \n5  reduction of health care jobs and supporting services, particularly in rural regions \n6  of Washington. \n7  216.  In Massachusetts, as of December 2018, approximately 264,000 \n8  MassHealth members were noncitizens, including 52,000 children. Six thousand \n9  of these children were enrolled in CHIP. \n10  217.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Massachusetts the Rule \n11  will  cause  approximately  39,600  to  92,400  lawfully  present  MassHealth \n12  members to lose medical care annually and become uninsured.   \n13  218.  Based on projected disenrollment rates in Massachusetts the Rule \n14  will cause approximately 7,800 to 18,200 citizen or lawfully present noncitizen \n15  children to lose MassHealth medical coverage annually and become uninsured. \n16  219.  The effects of the Rule, however, are not merely limited to deterring \n17  individuals  who  may  be  subject  to  a  public  charge  determination  from \n18  participating in assistance programs specifically defined as “public benefits.” The \n19  Rule will also likely have a chilling effect on individuals who are not subject to \n20  it and on assistance programs that are not considered “public benefits” under the \n21  analysis. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  100  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.108   Page 108 of 176\n \n1  220.  For example, for many families in Massachusetts, some household \n2  members will be subject to a public charge determination while others will not, \n3  and some family members may receive benefits that are part of the public charge \n4  analysis while others receive benefits not subject to the rule. The Massachusetts \n5  Health Connector estimates that as of December 2018, up to 60,000 enrollees live \n6  in  households  where  participation  in  Massachusetts’s  health  care  benefits \n7  programs could result in negative immigration consequences under the Final \n8  Rule for at least one family member. Because of the complexity of determining \n9  these  impacts  and  disenrolling  only  those  family  members  from  only  those \n10  benefits that could have negative impacts, however, whole families may opt to \n11  simply withdraw their participation from the Massachusetts health insurance \n12  exchange. \n13  (2)  Shift of healthcare costs to the Plaintiff States \n14  221.  The  harms  to  the  Plaintiff  States  will  include  an  increase  in \n15  emergency  and  uncompensated  care,  which  refers  to  unreimbursed  medical \n16  services provided by hospitals to patients resulting in charity care or bad debts. \n17  222.  Individuals who lose their health insurance coverage will likely \n18  delay seeking medical care until their conditions require emergency treatment. \n19  When these individuals present at a hospital emergency room for such treatment, \n20  the Plaintiff States will ultimately bear the more expensive cost of their care.  \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  101  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.109   Page 109 of 176\n \n1  Further, because their conditions are more serious, they will require greater \n2  resources to treat. \n3  223.  Many of the Plaintiff States have made significant gains in reducing \n4  their uninsured populations, all of which will be undermined by implementation \n5  of the Rule. Between 2013 and 2016, for example, Washington significantly \n6  reduced its rate of uninsured residents, from 14% in 2013 to 5.4% in 2016. The \n7  State’s reduction in its number of uninsured residents is associated with a parallel \n8  reduction in  uncompensated  care  for  medical services,  which  dropped from \n9  $2.638 billion in 2013 to $932 million in 2016.  \n10  224.  Similarly, Virginia has reduced its number of uninsured residents \n11  with the state’s January 1, 2019 expansion of its Medicaid program. As of \n12  July 2019, over 300,000 adults in the state have newly enrolled in the program. \n13  225.  In Maryland, the uninsured rate likewise fell by more than 64% \n14  between 2013  and 2017.  The drop in uninsured  rates  closely  aligns  with  a \n15  reduction  in  uncompensated  care:  From  fiscal  year  2013  to  2015,  hospital \n16  uncompensated care costs in Maryland declined by approximately $311 million. \n17  226.  Because of the Public Charge Rule, however, the Plaintiff States \n18  stand to lose all these gains. For example, Massachusetts foresees a substantial \n19  increase in the provision of uncompensated care across the Commonwealth due \n20  to loss of health coverage resulting from the Rule. Safety net providers such as \n21  hospitals and community health centers will disproportionately bear the financial \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  102  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.110   Page 110 of 176\n \n1  burden  of  providing  uncompensated  care,  and in turn,  the demand  on  state \n2  programs that compensate providers for such care will increase. The state’s \n3  EOHHS estimates that Massachusetts hospitals are in danger of losing almost \n4  $457 million in Medicaid and CHIP funding because of the chilling effect of the \n5  Rule on otherwise-eligible individuals. \n6  227.  Because the Rule will reduce the number of insured residents and \n7  increase the amount of individuals who rely on emergency treatment for their \n8  primary source of medical care, uncompensated care in the Plaintiff States will \n9  rise. This increase will result in higher medical bills and health care costs charged \n10  by hospitals, undermining the Plaintiff States’ efforts to reduce their uninsured \n11  populations and harming their economies.  \n12  (3)  Significant public health concerns prompted by \nreduced preventive care \n13 \n228.  By deterring individuals from accessing the government-sponsored \n14 \nhealthcare coverage to which they are legally entitled, the Final Rule discourage \n15 \nthese individuals from engaging in routine medical care such as wellness exams \n16 \nand vaccinations. \n17 \n229.  A  general  decline  in  engagement  with  such  routine  medical \n18 \npreventive services, including vaccinations, risks increasing the spread of viruses \n19 \nand communicable diseases in the Plaintiff States. As a result, the Rule threatens \n20 \nto  cause  dangerous  public  health  hazards  for  the  Plaintiff  States  and  their \n21 \nresidents. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  103  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.111   Page 111 of 176\n \n1  230.  DOJ  has  previously  recognized  that  discouraging  eligible \n2  immigrants from accessing these health care benefits may lead to the very same \n3  public health concerns cited by the Plaintiff States. As noted above, in 1999 DOJ \n4  proposed a rule, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676, stating: “Immigrants’ fears of obtaining \n5  these  necessary  medical  and  other  benefits  are  not  only  causing  them \n6  considerable harm, but are also jeopardizing the general public. For example, \n7  infectious  diseases  may  spread  as  the  numbers  of  immigrants  who  decline \n8  immunization services increase.” \n9  (4)  Harm to the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests in \nthe successful operation of their health care \n10 \nsystems \n11  231.  In addition to the above costs, implementation of the Rule will also \n12  harm the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests in administering their health benefits \n13  systems. \n14  232.  The Plaintiff States have carefully developed state-funded health \n15  care programs to fill gaps in Medicaid and to provide coverage to financially or \n16  medically  vulnerable  individuals,  including  noncitizens.  Although  the  Rule \n17  expressly applies only to Medicaid-related health benefits, the Plaintiff States’ \n18  own programs are often closely intertwined with their Medicaid programs, and \n19  the  Rule  will  cause  noncitizens  and  mixed-status  families  to  forgo  health \n20  coverage to which they are legally entitled—even when such coverage would not \n21  be considered a negative factor under the Department’s public charge test. This \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  104  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.112   Page 112 of 176\n \n1  chilling effect will undermine the comprehensive network of services the Plaintiff \n2  States have developed to address their unique public health needs. \n3  233.  The Rule would, for example, undermine Massachusetts’s ability to \n4  achieve its policy of universal health coverage among its residents. As of 2017, \n5  97.2% of Massachusetts residents are covered by health insurance, the highest \n6  insurance coverage rate in the nation. This is largely due to watershed health \n7  reform legislation enacted by the state in 2006, including state subsidy programs \n8  for low- and moderate-income individuals and a state-level individual mandate \n9  to have health insurance. \n10  234.  The Department’s highly restrictive, complex, and vague treatment \n11  of public benefits, however, threatens to upend the system of incentives and \n12  disincentives that informs the choices of individuals and families enrolling in \n13  health insurance through Massachusetts’s health insurance marketplace. \n14  235.  Since  2006,  Massachusetts  has  required  that  most  adult \n15  Massachusetts residents have health coverage or pay a penalty through their tax \n16  returns.    The  Rule,  however,  will  interfere  with  Massachusetts’s  ability  to \n17  maintain this requirement, particularly for any residents who would face adverse \n18  immigration consequences by virtue of accessing health coverage. \n19  236.  About  260,000  Massachusetts  residents  individually  purchase \n20  health coverage through the Health Connector, which procures high-quality plans \n21  at competitive prices that residents can access. Any disenrollment that will follow \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  105  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.113   Page 113 of 176\n \n1  from the Rule will diminish the collective impact of individuals purchasing health \n2  coverage  and  make  Massachusetts’s  health  insurance  marketplace  less \n3  competitive. A less competitive health insurance marketplace will put at risk the \n4  progress Massachusetts has made towards universal health coverage for all its \n5  residents. \n6  237.  In Massachusetts, individuals and small businesses share the same \n7  risk  pool,  insurance  products,  and  premiums.  The  Massachusetts  Health \n8  Connector’s data shows that on average, noncitizen enrollees have 25% lower \n9  medical claims than their citizen counterparts, which is attributable to the overall \n10  lower age of noncitizens and their lower utilization of medical services. A decline \n11  in enrollment or retention of coverage for noncitizens as a result of the Rule could \n12  impact the overall risk pool in Massachusetts, which could in turn lead to monthly \n13  premium  increases  for  citizens  and  noncitizens  alike.  Based  on  the  merged \n14  structure of the insurance risk pool in Massachusetts, such impacts can flow \n15  beyond the Health Connector and cause premiums to increase for not only the \n16  small  business  community  but  potentially  throughout  the  health  insurance \n17  market. \n18  238.  Federal regulation requires that state health exchanges use a single \n19  streamlined application that collects the information needed to determine an \n20  applicant’s  eligibility  for  a  qualified  health  plan,  health  coverage  subsidies, \n21  Medicaid, CHIP, or a basic health plan. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  106  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.114   Page 114 of 176\n \n1  239.  In  Massachusetts,  all  applicants  for  federally  funded  and  state \n2  funded health insurance—including Medicaid, CHIP, and ConnectorCare—use \n3  a uniform application portal, and after applying are matched with the appropriate \n4  program for which they are determined eligible. The chilling effect of the Rule \n5  will likely require Massachusetts to create new forms, policies, and procedures \n6  for its various health care programs and services to ensure that benefits applicants \n7  are aware of the potential public charge consequences of their application and \n8  can choose to apply only for those programs which are not considered as part of \n9  the public charge analysis. \n10  240.  Additionally,  MassHealth  and  Health  Connector  may  have  to \n11  expand its customer service support to answer questions about public charge \n12  consequences from potentially affected individuals. MassHealth and the Health \n13  Connector would have to absorb the costs and administrative burden for these \n14  modifications. \n15  241.  Further,  the  Plaintiff  States  will  be  required  to  cover  expenses \n16  associated with adopting new laws, regulations, and administrative practices, \n17  policies, and procedures as a result of the Public Charge Rule. Those changes \n18  will be necessary to adapt to and mitigate the effects of enrollment decisions by \n19  noncitizens and mixed-status families, as well as the public health consequences \n20  for their reduced access to health care services. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  107  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Food Assistance Programs \n2  242.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n3  federally funded food assistance programs for eligible individuals and families, \n4  including noncitizens. Implementation of the Public Charge Rule, however, will \n5  irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by undermining the effectiveness of these \n6  programs,  as  eligible  individuals—including  working  families  and  their \n7  children—will opt not to participate for fear of jeopardizing their immigration \n8  status.  This  reduction  in  participation  will  lead  to  significant  public  health \n9  concerns, including child hunger and malnourishment. \n10  1.  Federal Food Assistance Benefits \n11  243.  In 1977, Congress created the federal Food Stamp Program, known \n12  since 2008 as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which \n13  provides food purchasing assistance to low-income individuals and families.207  \n14  244.  SNAP benefits are provided on a “household” basis. For purposes \n15  of SNAP eligibility, a “household” is defined as “an individual who lives alone \n16  or who, while living with others, customarily purchases food and prepares meals \n17  for home consumption separate and apart from others; or a group of individuals \n18  who live together and customarily purchase food and prepare meals together for \n19  home consumption.”208 \n20                                             \n21  207 See 7 U.S.C. § 2013 (2018). \n22  208 7 U.S.C. § 2012(m). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  108  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.116   Page 116 of 176\n \n1  245.  Under federal law, SNAP is available to households with income at \n2  or  below  130%  of  the  federal  poverty  level;  a  net  monthly  income  after \n3  deductions for housing, child care and other expenses at less than or equal to \n4  100% of the federal poverty level; and with assets under the amount set in the \n5  applicable federal regulations. \n6  246.  The  average  monthly  SNAP  benefit  per  household  is  \n7  $253—or $8.40 per day, per household. SNAP households may purchase food \n8  by using the benefit at one of the quarter million retailers authorized by the \n9  federal Food and Nutrition Service to participate in the program. \n10  247.  SNAP imposes work requirements on program participants. Federal \n11  law requires that able-bodied adult SNAP recipients who are not exempt register \n12  to work, accept a job if offered, and not quit a job without good cause. The \n13  Welfare  Reform  Act  limits  SNAP  benefits  for  able-bodied  adults  without \n14  dependents to 3 months of assistance within a 36 month period unless they are \n15  participating in work activities for at least 20 hours per week. States also operate \n16  SNAP Employment and Training (E&T) programs, which help participants build \n17  job skills, receive training, find work, and increase work experience.  \n18  248.  About  14.9  million  workers—or  about  10%  of  workers \n19  nationwide—are from households that received SNAP benefits over the past \n20  year. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  109  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act,  adult  immigrants  with  lawful \n2  permanent residency status, and other “qualified” immigrants, are eligible for \n3  SNAP  after  five  years.209  The  five-year  ban  does  not  apply  to  children, \n4  immigrants with 40 qualifying quarters of work, or to members of the military \n5  and veterans (or their spouses), all of whom are immediately eligible for SNAP \n6  benefits upon adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.210  \n7  250.  States have the authority to use state-only funds to provide nutrition \n8  assistance benefits to non-qualified immigrants and qualified immigrants before \n9  the five-year SNAP ban. Plaintiff States Minnesota and Washington have done \n10  so. Although such state-only nutrition benefits do not constitute “public benefits” \n11  under  the  Department’s  public  charge  test,  many  noncitizens  will  fear  that \n12  enrollment  in  state-funded  programs  will  carry  adverse  immigration \n13  consequences, and therefore disenroll or forbear enrollment. \n14  251.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n15  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n16  these food assistance programs. \n17  2.  State food assistance programs \n18  252.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer various food assistance \n19  programs,  including  SNAP.  These  programs  are  intended  to  reduce  food \n20                                             \n21  209 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2)(L). \n22  210 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2)(B)–(C) & (J). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  110  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to participate \n4  in these state-run food assistance programs. If implemented, the Rule would \n5  result in many otherwise eligible individuals—including citizens—disenrolling \n6  or refraining from participating for fear of jeopardizing their or their family \n7  members’ immigration status. \n8  254.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n9  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functions and effectiveness of \n10  their food assistance programs. \n11  a.  The Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs \n12  255.  All Plaintiff States manage and administer a SNAP program for their \n13  residents.  In  addition,  the  Plaintiff  States  administer  numerous  other  food \n14  assistance programs, some using combined federal and state funds and some \n15  using state-only funds. While the Rule considers only SNAP-related benefits as \n16  “public benefits” under the public charge test, other state-only food assistance \n17  programs are likely to be harmed because of the broad chilling effects on eligible \n18  individuals. \n19  256.  Washington’s  Basic  Food  program  assists  eligible  children  and \n20  adults in purchasing food.

Virginia’s food assistance program includes SNAP (including debit \n5  card technology for accessing SNAP benefits); nutrition education; supplemental \n6  nutrition program for women, infants, and children; nutrition program for seniors \n7  (Fresh Market Fresh for Seniors), national school lunch program, food banks, and \n8  meals on wheels. \n9  258.  Massachusetts’s Department of Transitional Assistance (MA-DTA) \n10  assists and empowers low-income individuals and families to meet their basic \n11  needs,  improve  their  quality  of  life,  and  achieve  long-term  economic \n12  self-sufficiency through training programs, and cash and food benefits, such as \n13  SNAP. Massachusetts also funds a supplement to SNAP through the state budget. \n14  In state fiscal year 2019, the SNAP state supplement was $300,000. Another \n15  $300,000 for the state supplement has been appropriated for state fiscal year \n16  2020. \n17  259.  Maryland’s Food Supplement Program reached 684,000 Maryland \n18  residents  in  fiscal  year  2017,  or  11%  of  the  state  population.  The  state \n19  supplemented the program with approximately $3.3 million in state funds during \n20  state fiscal year 2019, and over $4.1 million in fiscal year 2020. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  112  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In New Mexico, approximately 25% of the State’s residents receive \n2  SNAP benefits, with enrollment capped for a family of four at the federal poverty \n3  limit of $25,100. In March 2018, for example, there were 456,190 people enrolled \n4  in the state’s program. \n5  261.  New Jersey administers a SNAP program that helps provide food \n6  assistance to residents suffering from food insecurity. An estimated 1 in 10 New \n7  Jersey  residents  are  food  insecure—which  translates  to  more  than  900,000 \n8  residents, including nearly 270,000 children. \n9  262.  In Rhode Island, the Department of Human Services administers the \n10  SNAP program to low-income families and individuals with income less than \n11  185% of the federal poverty level. Rhode Island residents who meet eligibility \n12  requirements may receive up to $642 per month in food-assistance based on their \n13  family size and income level. \n14  b.  Irreparable harm to food assistance programs \n15  263.  The Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs will be irreparably \n16  harmed by the Rule, which will result in, among other things, (1) more vulnerable \n17  families and individuals in the Plaintiff States experiencing food insecurity; and \n18  (2) severe public health concerns, including child hunger and malnutrition. \n19  264.  The Rule will cause a devastating loss of food assistance for working \n20  families and individuals in the Plaintiff States. This will occur in SNAP-related \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  113  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

For example, using metrics and data analysis from the above-noted \n4  Kaiser Family Foundation study, the Washington State Department of Social and \n5  Health Services (DSHS) has estimated the effects the Rule will have on food \n6  assistance participation in the state.211 Specifically, DSHS estimates the Rule will \n7  lead to disenrollment rates ranging from 15 to 35% among food assistance \n8  enrollees  in  cases  involving  a  noncitizen.  DSHS  further  estimates  that  full \n9  implementation of the Rule will reduce combined food and cash assistance to \n10  Washington families by up to $55.3 million. \n11  266.  In Massachusetts, each year between 2009 and 2012, SNAP benefits \n12  kept 141,000 residents out of poverty, including 57,000 children. It is estimated \n13  the Rule will jeopardize approximately $122 million in SNAP benefits, or almost \n14  10 percent of Massachusetts’s SNAP program. \n15  267.  In New Jersey, it is estimated that as many as 50,000 residents who \n16  are eligible for and receiving SNAP benefits might be affected by the chilling \n17  effect of the Rule. \n18  268.  Below are examples of the specific types of harms the Plaintiff \n19  States and their residents will experience. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  211 See S. Artiga, R.

The  Plaintiff  States’  food  assistance  programs  are  specifically \n3 \ntailored to provide food assistance to low-income individuals who otherwise \n4 \nlikely could not afford to purchase sufficient food for themselves and their \n5 \nfamilies. \n6 \n270.  Individuals who are eligible to participate in the Plaintiff States’ \n7 \nfood assistance programs but who forgo participation because of the Rule are \n8 \nlikely to experience greater food insecurity and will struggle to provide food for \n9 \nthemselves and their families. \n10 \n271.  In Massachusetts, speculation about the impact of the Rule has \n11 \nalready spurred a decline in numbers of participants in public nutrition programs \n12 \nsuch as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and \n13 \nChildren (WIC), even though the program is not a “public benefit” under the \n14 \nRule. Since February 2018, when Reuters released a draft of the Proposed Rule, \n15 \nwhich included WIC as a public benefit, there has been a 2,000 person decrease \n16 \nfrom 2017 levels in WIC participation in Massachusetts. \n17 \n272.  The number of individuals and households disenrolling from or \n18 \nforgoing  participation  in  the  Plaintiff  States’  SNAP  programs,  which  are \n19 \nconsidered “public benefits” under the Rule, is likely to be even greater. \n20 \n273.  This increase in food insecurity and hunger directly undermines the \n21 \npurposes and effectiveness of the Plaintiff States’ food assistance programs, \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  115  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.123   Page 123 of 176\n \n1  which are intended to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition for the States’ most \n2  vulnerable residents. \n3  (2)  Significant public health concerns \n4  274.  The  Plaintiff  States’  food  assistance  programs  are  specifically \n5  tailored to assist working families who might not otherwise be able to afford \n6  sufficient food for their children. \n7  275.  The  projected  reduction  in  the  number  of  immigrants  and \n8  mixed-status families participating in these programs because of fears associated \n9  with the Rule will undermine the programs and lead to significant public health \n10  concerns, including increases in child hunger and malnutrition. \n11  276.  Children  who  experience  hunger,  food  insecurity,  and \n12  malnourishment are more likely to suffer deficits in cognitive development, \n13  behavioral problems, and poor health, along with reduced learning and academic \n14  achievement, all of which tends to diminish future earning potential. Children \n15  who are hungry will experience more difficulty in school and will require greater \n16  resources from the Plaintiff States’ educational systems.  \n17  277.  Further,  eligibility  for  many  federal  school  breakfast  and  lunch \n18  programs—which provide free or reduced price meals to eligible students—are \n19  based at least in part on enrollment in SNAP. Thus, although the Rule does not \n20  expressly consider receipt of free or reduced price school meals as a “public \n21  benefit” under the public charge test, the Rule will undoubtedly have a negative \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  116  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In \n2  this way, the Rule will negatively affect far more assistance programs than only \n3  the limited programs it expressly identifies as public benefits. \n4  278.  The Plaintiff States will ultimately bear the higher healthcare and \n5  other costs associated with treating the medical conditions resulting from this \n6  unnecessary child malnourishment. \n7  279.  For this reason, the increase in food insecurity resulting from the \n8  Rule would undermine not only the Plaintiff States’ interests in healthy, stable, \n9  productive  residents  and  workforces,  but  also  a  purported  goal of  the  Rule \n10  itself—to “better ensure” that immigrants “are self-sufficient, i.e., do not depend \n11  on public resources to meet their needs.”  \n12  C.  Housing Assistance Programs \n13  280.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n14  federally  funded  housing  assistance  programs  for  eligible  individuals  and \n15  families, including noncitizens. The Rule, however, will irreparably harm the \n16  Plaintiff States by undermining the effectiveness of these programs, as eligible \n17  individuals and their families will disenroll or refrain from seeking housing \n18  assistance for fear of jeopardizing their ability to immigrate. \n19  1.  Federal housing assistance benefits \n20  281.  In general, individuals and families with incomes at or below 50 to \n21  80% of their area median income are eligible for federal housing assistance. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  117  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Thus, federal housing assistance serves only about 25% of eligible \n4  households. \n5  282.  The Housing Act of 1937212 provides for subsidies to be paid from \n6  the  U.S.  government  to  local  public  housing  agencies  to  improve  living \n7  conditions for low-income families (Subsidized Housing Program). There are \n8  currently approximately 1 million units in the federal public housing subsidies \n9  program.  Nearly  two-thirds  of  public  housing  subsidies  households  are \n10  considered  “extremely  low  income,”  with  incomes  below  30%  of  the  Area \n11  Median Income and an average annual income of $14,605. Approximately 3.3 \n12  million children live in such subsidized public housing.213 \n13  283.  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (Housing Voucher \n14  Program) is the federal government’s major program for assisting low-income \n15  families, the elderly, and the disabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing \n16  in the private market.214 Housing choice vouchers are administered locally by \n17 \n18                                             \n19  212 Pub.

The Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program \n4  also provides housing assistance to low-income families.215 This HUD program \n5  provides critical affordable housing stock to more than 2 million people—in 1.2 \n6  million households—across the country. HUD contracts with private owners to \n7  rent units in their housing developments, paying a subsidy that helps pay tenants’ \n8  rent. \n9  285.  The Housing Voucher and PBRA programs (together, Section 8 \n10  programs) and the Subsidized Housing Program help prevent homelessness and \n11  other kinds of housing instabilities. To participate in the Section 8 programs, \n12  families  must  demonstrate  incomes  at  or  below  certain threshold  levels;  an \n13  absence  of  criminal-  or  drug-related  records  and  evictions;  and  proof  of \n14  citizenship or eligible immigrant status. \n15  286.  Under the Welfare Reform Act and the Housing and Community \n16  Development Act of 1980, lawful permanent residents and certain other qualified \n17  immigrants are eligible for Section 8 programs.216 The Welfare Reform Act’s five \n18 \n19                                             \n20  215 42 U.S.C. 1437f; 24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880–81, 883–84, and 886. \n21  216  Pub.

The  Rule  treats  as  “public  benefits”  (1)  Section  8  Housing \n4  Assistance  under  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher  program;  (2)  Section  8 \n5  Project-Based Rental Assistance; and (3) Public Housing under Section 9 of the \n6  Housing Act of 1937. Under the Rule, an immigrant’s participation in any of \n7  these programs could constitute a heavily weighed negative factor favoring a \n8  public charge determination, even though Congress has explicitly authorized \n9  eligible noncitizens to participate in those programs.218 \n10  2.  State housing assistance programs \n11  288.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer a variety of housing \n12  assistance programs, including by using a combination of state, federal, and \n13  private funding to provide safe and stable shelter options for eligible individuals \n14  and their families. Certain classes of citizens and noncitizens are eligible to \n15  participate in these housing assistance programs. \n16                                             \n17  217  8  U.S.C.  § 1613(a);  8  C.F.R.  §  213a.1;  Eligibility  Restrictions  on \n18  Noncitizens:  Inapplicability  of  Welfare  Reform  Act  Restrictions  on  Federal \n19  Means-Tested Public Benefits, Dep’t of Housing and Urban Devel., 65 Fed.

The chilling effect of the Rule, however, will deprive vulnerable \n2  individuals of opportunities to obtain such housing assistance, and irreparably \n3  harm the functioning of the Plaintiff States’ programs. \n4  a.  The Plaintiff States’ housing assistance programs \n5  290.  All  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  housing  assistance \n6  programs. Working together with community, state, and national partners, the \n7  Plaintiff  States  provide  effective  programs  seeking  to  prevent  and  alleviate \n8  homelessness  and  housing  instability  for  their  most  vulnerable  residents. \n9  Although  the  Department  does  not  consider  receipt  of  state-only  housing \n10  assistance  as  a  “public  benefit”—unlike  the  federal  programs  described  \n11  above— these state programs are likely to be harmed by the Rule’s broad chilling \n12  effects on eligible individuals and families who forgo participation for fear of \n13  jeopardizing their ability to immigrate. \n14  291.  For example, the Washington Department of Commerce administers \n15  Washington’s state and federal housing assistance funding. The Department of \n16  Commerce manages the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, a 33-year-old \n17  source of capital to develop and preserve affordable housing for low-income and \n18  vulnerable Washingtonians. County governments act as lead grantees and are \n19  responsible for directing and managing the local homeless response system. \n20  These local homeless response systems assist homeless families and individuals \n21  who need help obtaining or maintaining permanent housing. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  121  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Washington’s housing assistance programs receive approximately \n2  $196 million per year in funding from a variety of sources, including private \n3  funders as well as federal, state, and local governments. Using these funds, the \n4  programs seek to both (1) stabilize households that are currently in permanent \n5  housing but are at risk of homelessness; and (2) provide homeless individuals and \n6  families  with  emergency  shelter,  temporary  housing,  or  placement  into \n7  permanent housing. \n8  293.  DSHS administers the Washington Housing and Essential Needs \n9  (HEN) Referral Program, which provides access to essential needs items and \n10  potential  rental assistance  for low income  individuals  and families  who  are \n11  unable to work for at least 90 days due to a physical and/or mental incapacity. \n12  DSHS provides this assistance even if the individuals are ineligible to receive \n13  federal funds. \n14  294.  The  Massachusetts  Department  of  Housing  and  Community \n15  Development (MA-DHCD) similarly administers numerous federal and state \n16  housing  programs  and  services  to  promote  safe  and  affordable  housing  for \n17  residents. In particular, MA-DHCD oversees the operations of approximately 240 \n18  local  housing  authorities  as  well  as  programs  that  provide  federal-  and \n19  state-funded rental vouchers to low-income families; assist families in moving \n20  from shelter into housing or in avoiding homelessness altogether; and provide \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  122  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Massachusetts’s  state  budget  allocated  over  $500  million  for \n4  homelessness and housing safety net programs and services in fiscal year 2019. \n5  The  Massachusetts  Rental  Voucher  Program  (MRVP),  which  provides  both \n6  mobile and project-based vouchers, alone received $100 million in state funding, \n7  and Massachusetts’s Emergency Assistance (MA-EA) program, through which \n8  MA-DHCD funds family shelters, received over $175 million. \n9  296.  The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development \n10  (VDHCD) and Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA), under the \n11  oversight of Virginia’s Secretary of Commerce and Trade, administer Virginia’s \n12  housing assistance programs. VDHCD creates safe and affordable housing by \n13  regulating building and fire codes while investing more than $100 million each \n14  year into affordable housing and community development projects throughout \n15  Virginia. VHDA promotes access to home loans, homeowner and homebuyer \n16  education to ensure quality, affordable housing for all in Virginia. \n17  297.  VDHA also administers the federal Housing Choice Voucher and \n18  Housing Credit programs in Virginia, and administers multiple programs that \n19  offer  state  and  federal  funding  to  address  homelessness.

Irreparable harms to the Plaintiff States’ housing \nassistance programs \n6 \n298.  The Rule will lead to reduced immigrant participation in federal \n7 \nhousing assistance programs for eligible residents of the Plaintiff States. \n8 \n299.  Further,  while  the  Rule  does  not  treat  the  above  state  housing \n9 \nassistance  programs  as  “public  benefits,”  because  of  the  complexity  of  the \n10 \nregulatory regime and widespread public confusion and fear, it will nevertheless \n11 \ndeter many immigrants and mixed-status families from participating in state-\n12 \nfunded housing assistance programs for which they are eligible. \n13 \n300.  For  these  reasons,  the  Rule  will  cause  irreparable  harm  to  the \n14 \nPlaintiff States. Among other harms, the Rule will (1) lead to increased numbers \n15 \nof homeless individuals and families in the Plaintiff States; and (2) result in \n16 \npoorer health, educational, and other outcomes for vulnerable children who reside \n17 \nin  the  Plaintiff  States  and  who,  because  of  their  or  their  family  member’s \n18 \nimmigration status, will be deprived of opportunities for emergency shelter or \n19 \nplacement into permanent housing. \n20 \n301.

If  the  Rule  is implemented,  it  will cause  increased numbers  of \n3  individuals and families to experience homelessness in the Plaintiff States, as \n4  individuals who are otherwise eligible for such assistance will forgo seeking it \n5  for fear of jeopardizing their or their family member’s ability to immigrate. \n6  303.  The Rule provides that officials will consider Public Housing and \n7  Section 8 participation in making a determination regarding whether someone is \n8  likely to become a public charge. This will deter many eligible households from \n9  seeking benefits and will delay placement of homeless families into permanent \n10  housing. \n11  304.  For example, in Washington, over 78,000 low-income households \n12  use Public Housing and Section 8 assistance to afford modest rents and make \n13  ends meet. Most of these individuals are either working themselves or come from \n14  working families that cannot afford fair market rents.  \n15  305.  In  Massachusetts,  approximately  175,000  households  receive \n16  Section 8 or Public Housing assistance. Massachusetts’s MRVP supported 5,100 \n17  households as of January 2013. \n18  306.  In Maryland, approximately 84,000 households receive Section 8 or \n19  Public Housing assistance. Approximately 48,000 Maryland households receive \n20  federal rental assistance through the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  125  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.133   Page 133 of 176\n \n1  307.  Further,  many  immigrant  workers  are  employed  in  typically \n2  low-wage fields such as agriculture, construction, building and grounds cleaning \n3  and maintenance, and food service, which make it difficult for them to afford \n4  current market-based rents. \n5  308.  In Massachusetts, large numbers of low-wage immigrant workers \n6  are employed in the health care system, serving in positions such as home health \n7  aides and nursing assistants. A minimum wage worker in Massachusetts would \n8  need to work, on average, at least 104 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom \n9  apartment.  \n10  309.  Washington currently provides 50,000 families per year with rental \n11  assistance, and about 15,000 of these families have children. About 14% of these \n12  families who receive rental assistance and have children are immigrant families.  \n13  310.  Washington has recently faced increased homelessness, with an \n14  estimated 3,285  homeless  families  with  children.  About 14%  of  the State’s \n15  homeless families with children are immigrant families. Available data suggests \n16  the  Rule  is  likely  to  compel  over  10,000  immigrants  and  their  families  in \n17  Washington to give up the lifeline assistance that prevents them from suffering \n18  homelessness.  For  other  eligible  families,  implementation  of  the  Rule  will \n19  significantly delay their placement into permanent housing. \n20  311.  The  homeless  population  in  Massachusetts  increased  by  2,500 \n21  people, or 14%, in 2018. Massachusetts estimates that about 3,600 families with \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  126  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

This number does not include families who are doubled up, living in unsafe \n3  conditions, or sleeping in their cars. \n4  312.  Further, because many of the placements into permanent housing \n5  are related to Public Housing or Section 8 programs (17% of placements in \n6  Washington  last  year),  the  Rule  will  hinder  the  Plaintiff  States’  ability  to \n7  successfully transition homeless individuals and their families into permanent \n8  housing, significantly harming their residents who are otherwise unable to obtain \n9  permanent housing. \n10  (2)  Poorer health, educational, and other outcomes \n11  313.  The Rule will also lead to other harmful related costs for the Plaintiff \n12  States and their homeless and housing-insecure populations. \n13  314.  Access to good housing is well-recognized as a social determinant \n14  of public health, as families and individuals without stable housing are more \n15  likely to use emergency services and require hospitalizations.  \n16  315.  Data shows that children who suffer homelessness and housing \n17  insecurity experience dramatically poorer health outcomes, including having \n18  twice as many respiratory infections and being three times more likely to be \n19  hospitalized for asthma. This creates significant public health concerns for the \n20  Plaintiff States. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  127  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.135   Page 135 of 176\n \n1  316.  Further,  children  who  experience  homelessness  and  housing \n2  insecurity also tend to suffer worse educational outcomes and generally have \n3  access to fewer and less profitable work opportunities. This results in harm to the \n4  Plaintiff States’ economies and job markets.  \n5  317.  Directly contrary to the supposed purpose of the Rule, needlessly \n6  depriving children of access to housing assistance only makes it more likely these \n7  children will require additional assistance as they grow older and will carry with \n8  them the adverse effects of their childhood homelessness. \n9  318.  The many negative effects of increased homelessness in families \n10  with children will irreparably harm the families, their children, and the Plaintiff \n11  States, which will ultimately bear responsibility for the many increased costs and \n12  other consequences associated with childhood homelessness.  \n13  D.  Cash Assistance Programs \n14  319.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  state  and \n15  federally funded cash assistance programs for eligible individuals and families, \n16  including noncitizens. Under the Rule, however, eligible individuals and their \n17  families will opt not to seek critical financial assistance for fear of jeopardizing \n18  their immigration status. \n19  1.  Federal cash assistance benefits \n20  320.  Congress  created  the  Temporary  Assistance  to  Needy  Families \n21  (TANF) program in 1996 as part of the Welfare Reform Act. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  128  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.136   Page 136 of 176\n \n1  321.  TANF  provides  grant  funds  to  states  to  provide  families  with \n2  financial assistance and related support services including childcare assistance, \n3  job preparation, and work assistance. \n4  322.  To  qualify  for  TANF,  individuals  must  either  be  pregnant  or \n5  responsible  for  a  child  under  19,  have  a  low  or  very  low  income,  and  be \n6  unemployed, under-employed, or about to be unemployed.  \n7  323.  As the first word in the program name suggests, TANF was designed \n8  as a temporary benefit to help otherwise self-sufficient, working families get back \n9  on their feet while experiencing joblessness, unanticipated adverse life events, or \n10  other hard times.  \n11  324.  Federal  law  imposes  work  requirements  applicable  to  TANF \n12  participants.  It  requires  states  administering  TANF  to  (1)  ensure  that  cash \n13  assistance recipients are working within 24 months of receiving assistance, or \n14  sooner if the state deems them ready for work, and (2) achieve annual work \n15  participation rates. Fifty percent of all TANF families with one work-eligible \n16  adult and 90 percent of families with two work-eligible adults must engage in \n17  specified work or work-related activities for a minimum number of weekly hours.  \n18  325.  The Welfare Reform Act allows qualified immigrants, including \n19  lawful permanent residents, to participate in TANF after five years in qualified \n20  immigrant status. Certain qualified immigrants are exempt from the five year ban, \n21  including members of the military and veterans (and their spouses and children).  \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  129  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.137   Page 137 of 176\n \n1  326.   States  are permitted  under  the  Welfare  Reform  Act  to  provide \n2  state-funded cash assistance benefits to nonexempt qualified immigrants during \n3  the five year TANF ban to replace the loss of federal benefits, as well as to \n4  provide state-only-funded assistance to nonqualified immigrants. \n5  327.  The Rule treats TANF as a “public benefit” program in which an \n6  immigrant’s participation could constitute a heavily weighed negative factor \n7  favoring a public charge determination. \n8  328.  The  Rule  also  treats  some  state-only-funded  cash  assistance  as \n9  “public benefits” in which an immigrant’s participation could constitute a heavily \n10  weighed negative factor favoring a public charge determination. The Rule’s \n11  definition of public benefit includes “[s]tate or local cash benefit programs for \n12  income maintenance (often called ‘General Assistance in the State context, but \n13  which may exist under other names).”219 That ambiguous definition does not \n14  provide  clear  notice  of  the  state  cash  assistance  programs  in  which  an \n15  immigrant’s  participation  may  “heavily”  weigh  in  favor  of  a  public  charge \n16  determination. \n17  329.  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable \n18  harm to the Plaintiff States by undermining the functioning and effectiveness of \n19  their cash assistance programs. \n20 \n21                                             \n22  219 84 Fed.

State cash assistance programs \n2  330.  All  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  financial \n3  assistance programs intended to provide modest monetary assistance to eligible \n4  residents  and  their  families  for  maintaining  financial  stability  in  certain \n5  circumstances.  Certain  classes  of  citizens  and  noncitizens  are  eligible  to \n6  participate in these programs. \n7  331.  The Rule, however, considers as “public benefits” not only federal \n8  cash assistance programs such as TANF but also state and local cash benefit \n9  programs for income maintenance. As a result, the Rule will deprive vulnerable \n10  individuals and their families of opportunities to access these programs and \n11  achieve financial stability. \n12  a.  The Plaintiff States’ cash assistance programs \n13  332.  All Plaintiff States manage and administer cash assistance programs \n14  to assist eligible individuals and their families in dealing with financial hardship. \n15  333.  For  example, the  Washington  Department of Social  and  Health \n16  Services administers Washington’s TANF program as well as several other cash \n17  assistance programs for eligible individuals. \n18  334.  Washington’s TANF program provides cash assistance to certain \n19  parents or caregivers and pregnant individuals to bolster their ability to support \n20  their families’ foundational needs, including a safe home, healthy food, reliable \n21  transportation, and school supplies. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  131  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.139   Page 139 of 176\n \n1  335.  During the 2017 to 2019 biennium, the Washington TANF program \n2  cost over $300 million in combined federal and state service and administrative \n3  costs, including over $90 million in total state funding. \n4  336.  Washington  complements  TANF  with  a  state-funded  program \n5  called State Family Assistance (SFA). SFA is available to individuals who meet \n6  TANF’s income requirements but are ineligible for TANF for other reasons, \n7  including  certain  noncitizens.  Washington  extends  SFA  cash  assistance  to \n8  qualified immigrants during the five year TANF ban, as well as to non-qualified \n9  immigrants who are residents of Washington and legally present in the United \n10  States.220 Some families receive a mix of TANF and SFA based on the eligibility \n11  or immigrant status of each family member. Under the Rule, SFA constitutes a \n12  state cash benefit program for income maintenance in which an immigrant’s \n13  participation could constitute a “heavily weighed negative factor” favoring a \n14  public charge determination. \n15  337.  The Virginia Department of Social Services administers Virginia’s \n16  TANF program. Virginia’s TANF program provides eligible families with a \n17  monthly cash payment to meet their basic needs. Virginia’s TANF program \n18  emphasizes personal responsibility. Participants may be provided with services \n19  such as job skills training, work experience, job readiness training, child care \n20  assistance, transportation and other work related expenses.

The \n4  expected outcome of this program are improved job placement, improved job \n5  retention, higher employment wages upon entry, and increased wage gains from \n6  job advancement. \n7  338.  In Massachusetts, MA-DTA manages aid programs designed to help \n8  low-income individuals and families escape poverty, including the Transitional \n9  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), Massachusetts’s TANF cash \n10  assistance program. \n11  339.  Massachusetts’s TAFDC program provides cash assistance, child \n12  care, and transportation support for job assistance to families with children and \n13  pregnant women with little or no assets or income, to meet their emergency and \n14  transitional needs. \n15  340.  In state fiscal year 2019, Massachusetts’s TAFDC program spent \n16  $841 million, including $382 million in state funds. \n17  341.  The Plaintiff States administer other programs that, due to the Rule’s \n18  ambiguity,  may  or  may  not  be  considered  “public  benefits”  in  which  an \n19  immigrant’s participation would weigh in favor of a public charge determination.  \n20  342.  For  example,  Washington’s  Aged,  Blind,  or  Disabled  Cash \n21  Assistance Program is a state-funded program that provides financial assistance \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  133  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Washington  also \n4  administers  the  state-funded  Pregnant  Women  Assistance  Program,  which \n5  provides financial assistance to certain pregnant noncitizens ineligible for TANF; \n6  the Consolidated Emergency Assistance Program, which provides emergency \n7  assistance  to  families  and  pregnant  women;  the  Diversion  Cash  Assistance \n8  Program,  which  provides  alternative  assistance  to  TANF  for  families  with \n9  short-term financial needs; the State Supplemental Program, which assists certain \n10  individuals while the Social Security Administration determines their eligibility \n11  for  Supplemental  Security  Income;  and  the  Additional  Requirements  for \n12  Emergent  Needs  Program,  which  assists  individuals  in  keeping  housing  or \n13  utilities. \n14  343.  In Massachusetts, MA-DTA similarly administers Emergency Aid \n15  for  Elderly,  Disabled,  and  Children  (EAEDC),  a  wholly  state-funded  cash \n16  assistance  program  for  persons  who  are  age  65  or  older,  disabled  adults, \n17  caretakers, and children who are not able to get TAFDC. \n18  344.  Due to the Rule’s ambiguity, it is uncertain whether the Department \n19  would  treat  an  immigrant’s  participation  in  these  state-only  cash  assistance \n20  programs  as  a  “heavily  weighed  negative  factor”  favoring  a  public  charge \n21  determination.  Regardless,  the  chilling  effect  of  such  ambiguity  will  be \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  134  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.142   Page 142 of 176\n \n1  substantial, resulting in many individuals opting not to seek state-funded cash-\n2  assistance benefits for which they may be eligible. \n3  b.  Irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ cash assistance \nprograms \n4 \n345.  The Rule will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States and their \n5 \ncash assistance programs, as eligible individuals and families facing financial \n6 \nhardship will elect not to access the program benefits for fear of jeopardizing \n7 \ntheir own or a family member’s immigration status. Due to the Rule’s ambiguity, \n8 \nas well as widespread fear and confusion among immigrant communities, those \n9 \nchilling effects will reduce enrollment both in cash assistance programs in which \n10 \na noncitizen’s participation could trigger a public charge determination and in \n11 \nprograms the Department would not consider a state or local cash benefit program \n12 \nfor income maintenance. \n13 \n346.  The Rule will thus irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by increasing \n14 \nthe number of their residents whose financial hardships lead to loss of medical \n15 \ncoverage or housing. \n16 \n347.  For  example,  Washington’s  DSHS  estimates  that  full \n17 \nimplementation of the Rule will reduce combined food and cash assistance to \n18 \nWashington  families  by  approximately  $23.7  to  $55.3  million  as  eligible \n19 \nindividuals either terminate their benefits or decline to seek assistance. \n20 \n348.  The Rule will irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by deterring \n21 \nindividuals from seeking temporary, hardship-based cash assistance they are \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  135  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Without access to temporary financial assistance, \n2  these  individuals  and  their  families  are  less  likely  to  be  able  to  weather \n3  unexpected financial hardships, increasing the likelihood they will lose valuable \n4  stability in the form of housing, transportation, or medical coverage or care. \n5  349.  The resulting economic dislocations will cause significant harm to \n6  the Plaintiff States, which will ultimately bear the greater costs associated with \n7  noncitizens’  or  mixed-status  families’  loss  of  financial  stability,  medical \n8  coverage, or housing. \n9  E.  Other State Benefits Programs \n10  350.  In  addition  to  irreparably  harming  the  Plaintiff  States  by \n11  undermining the proper functioning and effectiveness of their medical, housing, \n12  food, and cash assistance programs, implementation of the Rule will also imperil \n13  a host of other critical, state-managed assistance programs.  \n14  351.  These  various  state-administered  programs  include  but  are  not \n15  limited to long-term care for elderly and disabled residents, job and employment \n16  training programs, support and advocacy services for crime victims and energy \n17  assistance.  \n18  352.  Although the Rule does not expressly consider participation in these \n19  programs as a “public benefit” under the public charge test, the programs will \n20  nevertheless be harmed by the chilling effect the Rule has on eligible individuals. \n21  As set forth below, implementing the Rule will cause irreparable harm to the \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  136  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Long term services and supports for elderly and disabled \nresidents \n4 \n353.  The Plaintiff States manage and administer various programs to \n5 \nprovide care for elderly and disabled residents. \n6 \n354.  Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is a specific category of \n7 \ncare that includes both paid and unpaid medical and personal care services, which \n8 \nmay be provided in a person’s home, a community residential setting, or an \n9 \ninstitution such as a nursing home. \n10 \n355.  For example, in Washington, the Aging and Long-Term Support \n11 \nAdministration (ALTSA) is an agency within DSHS that administers LTSS \n12 \nservices to the State’s low-income elderly and disabled individuals. \n13 \n356.  In Virginia, DMAS and the Department of Aging and Rehabilitative \n14 \nServices  (DARS)  are  agencies  with  the  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human \n15 \nResources  (HSS)  that  administer  long  terms  services  and  supports  for \n16 \nlow-income elderly people and people with disabilities. \n17 \n357.  There is rapidly growing demand for workers who provide LTSS \n18 \n(called Direct Care Workers) because of the increasing population of individuals \n19 \nover the age of 65. \n20 \n358.  According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \n21 \ndemand for Direct Care Workers nationally will grow from 2.3 million in 2015 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  137  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Without a ready supply of workers, Plaintiff States’ \n2  programs and elderly and disabled residents will struggle to recruit sufficient \n3  staff. \n4  359.  According  to  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office, \n5  approximately 23% of Direct Care Workers are immigrants. \n6  360.  The average annual earnings for these jobs are at or below the \n7  federal  poverty  level.  Accordingly,  many  of  these  workers  rely  on  public \n8  assistance for health care, food, and housing. For example, in Massachusetts over \n9  40 percent of direct care workers depend on Medicaid, SNAP, or other benefits. \n10  Under the Rule, however, these workers will be discouraged from seeking such \n11  benefits, as doing so might jeopardize their immigration status. \n12  361.  Other  factors  for consideration  under the  Rule, including  credit \n13  history, education, and language, are all likely to increase the chances many \n14  Direct Care Workers will be considered a “public charge.” \n15  362.  Under the Rule, many immigrants who are currently Direct Care \n16  Workers  or  would  become  employed  in  such  positions  would  likely  be \n17  considered a public charge. A decrease in LTSS labor will increase the risk of \n18  injury, institutionalization, and death for the Plaintiff States’ many vulnerable \n19  elderly and disabled residents, including citizens and noncitizens. \n20 \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  138  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

This will also increase costs for states like Washington to ensure that \n2  their elderly and disabled residents are properly cared for, including by increasing \n3  costs to Medicaid in the Apple Health program. \n4  364.  The  resulting  labor  shortage  will  also  force  more  citizens  into \n5  nursing homes, destroying decades of federal and state efforts to keep aging \n6  individuals  in  their  own  homes.  The  Plaintiff  States  will  therefore  suffer  a \n7  diminished ability to administer elderly and disabled support services in a manner \n8  approved by the States’ residents, legislatures, and governors. \n9  2.  Job and employment training programs \n10  365.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  job  and \n11  employment training programs. Although these programs are not identified as \n12  “public benefits” under the Rule, they are likely to be affected by the chilling \n13  effect the rule will have on eligible populations. \n14  366.  For example, in Washington, DSHS administers employment and \n15  training programs designed to provide recipients of cash and food benefits with \n16  opportunities to gain skills, secure employment, and escape poverty. \n17  367.  In combination with other state agencies and community partners, \n18  DSHS  develops  custom  plans  to  support  people  in  building  skills  through \n19  employment  and  education  training.  DSHS  tailors  these  programs  to  serve \n20  particular  populations,  including  programs  specifically  designed  to  assist \n21  noncitizen families. \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  139  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.147   Page 147 of 176\n \n1  368.  Washington also has a WorkFirst program for families receiving \n2  TANF  or  SFA  benefits.  The  WorkFirst  program  provides  families  with \n3  opportunities to engage in work activities that support financial stability and \n4  resilience, including a Limited English Proficiency Pathway Program offering \n5  employment  services,  job  skills  training,  and  English-as-a-Second-Language \n6  services to nearly 5,000 people every year. DSHS infuses state funding into this \n7  program to serve noncitizens who are ineligible for federally-funded services. \n8  369.  Further,  the  Washington  State  Basic  Food  Employment  and \n9  Training program (BFET) provides job search training, self-directed job search, \n10  educational services, skills training, and other employment opportunities to Basic \n11  Food (SNAP) recipients. This is an example of a program that, although not \n12  directly identified as a “public benefit” itself under the Rule, is likely to be \n13  severely affected because of its close relation to programs that are considered \n14  public benefits, such as SNAP. \n15  370.  BFET is an important part of the State’s comprehensive workforce \n16  development system, as the program serves the needs of low-income individuals, \n17  displaced workers, and employers by encouraging financial independence from \n18  public assistance through skill acquisition, personal responsibility, and gainful \n19  employment. \n20  371.  Washington dedicates state funding to support a BFET program \n21  designed specifically to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  140  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

This program is available only to \n2  those individuals eligible to receive other federal benefits. \n3  372.  In Virginia, the Department of Social Services (DSS) administers \n4  employment and training programs designed to provide recipients of cash and \n5  food benefits with opportunities to gain skills, secure employment, and get out of \n6  poverty.  The  Department  for  Aging  and  Rehabilitative  Services  provides \n7  employment and vocational rehabilitation services for low-income elderly people \n8  and individuals with disabilities and their families. The Virginia Department for \n9  the Blind and Vision Impaired provides employment services for low-income \n10  blind and visually impaired individuals and their families. In combination with \n11  other state agencies and community partners, DSS supports people in building \n12  skills through employment and education training. DSS has specific programs \n13  that service particular populations, including programs specifically designed to \n14  assist noncitizen families. \n15  373.  Virginia provides job skills, work experience, job readiness training, \n16  child care assistance, transportation, and other work related expenses to families \n17  receiving TANF. Virginia also provides former TANF clients opportunities to \n18  prepare to enter, succeed, and advance in the workplace.  \n19  374.  In Massachusetts, the Commonwealth’s Department of Transitional \n20  Assistance administers and funds, in cooperation with the federal government, a \n21  skills and employment program, Path to Work, for SNAP recipients who need \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  141  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.149   Page 149 of 176\n \n1  help  finding  work.  The  program  reflects  the  agency’s  statutory  mandate  to \n2  connect participating SNAP recipients with “education, employment and training \n3  activities.” Because of the program’s close relationship to SNAP, however, it is \n4  likely to be severely affected by implementation of the Rule. Even though the \n5  program is not itself identified as a “public benefit” under the Rule, SNAP \n6  benefits are considered to be “public benefits” that may result in a public charge \n7  determination. Thus, eligible immigrants are likely to forgo participating in either \n8  program, particularly where participation in one is contingent on participation in \n9  the other. \n10  375.  Due  to  the  Rule’s  ambiguity  and  because  it  considers  SNAP \n11  enrollment  in  making  public  charge  determinations,  eligible  immigrants  are \n12  likely  to  be  uncertain  of  whether  their  participation  in  one  of  the  above \n13  employment training programs would be a negative factor weighing in favor of a \n14  public charge determination. Immigrants will therefore be strongly discouraged \n15  from  accessing  the  above  programs,  many  of  which  are  based  on  SNAP \n16  enrollment. In this way, the Rule affects far more benefits programs than are \n17  identified in the text of the rule. \n18  376.  Reduced  participation  in  the  above  training  programs  will \n19  negatively  impact  the  Plaintiff  States’  residents,  employers,  economy,  and \n20  pursuit of their policy priorities. \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  142  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.150   Page 150 of 176\n \n1  377.  Residents who might otherwise have participated in the programs \n2  will be deprived of the opportunity to develop their skills, increase their earning \n3  potential, and improve their quality of life. Ironically, the change will leave these \n4  residents more vulnerable and more likely, in the long term, to rely on emergency \n5  public assistance. Employers will lose access to a more highly trained pool of \n6  potential employees. The Plaintiff States’ economies will lose the benefits of \n7  would-be participants’ increased productivity. The Plaintiff States will be unable \n8  to  achieve  their  policy  goals  of  providing  the  greatest  possible  access  to \n9  workforce development in order to maximize the public welfare. \n10  378.  Lower participation in job and employment training programs will \n11  also have the self-defeating result of making fewer people capable of becoming \n12  independent from public benefits, directly contradicting the supposed purpose of \n13  the Rule. \n14  379.  In sum, the Rule will harm the Plaintiff States’ sovereign interests \n15  in  administering  comprehensive  work  training  programs  critical  to  their \n16  continued economic growth and success. \n17  3.  Irreparable harm to the Plaintiff States’ support services for \ncrime victims \n18 \n380.  The  Plaintiff  States  manage  and  administer  various  services  to \n19 \nadvocate on behalf of and provide support for crime victims. Although these and \n20 \nsimilar programs are not considered “public benefits” under the Rule, they are \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  143  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W. Klamath Court, Suite A \nDECLARATORY AND  Kennewick, WA 99336 \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF  (509) 734-7285 \n \n \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-05210-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 08/14/19    PageID.151   Page 151 of 176\n \n1  nevertheless likely to be negatively affected by the chilling effect the Rule will \n2  have on individuals who are eligible to access these programs.  \n3  381.  For example, Washington State has established the Office of Crime \n4  Victims  Advocacy  (OCVA)  to  serve  as  an  advocate  for  crime  victims  in \n5  Washington. OCVA’s mission is to support, heal, and assist crime victims in \n6  reaching their full potential. \n7  382.  OCVA supports crime victims in obtaining services and resources, \n8  assists communities with planning and implementing the provision of services to \n9  crime victims, advises local and state government agencies that assist crime \n10  victims, and administers grant funds for community programs that support crime \n11  victims. \n12  383.  The Virginia General Assembly promulgated the Virginia Victim \n13  and Witness of Crime Act to service crime victims, including providing support \n14  related  to  financial  assistance  and  social  services  in  Virginia.  The  Virginia \n15  Victims Fund (VVF) is a state program created to help victims of violent crimes \n16  with  out  of  pocket  expenses,  including  medical  bills,  prescriptions,  funeral \n17  expenses, lost wages, temporary housing, counseling services, and many other \n18  expenses.  The  Victims  Services  Team  within  the  Virginia’s  Department  of \n19  Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) provides grant funding, training, technical \n20  assistance, and written resources to programs and individuals serving crime \n21  victims. The DCJS and the VVF are the lead coordinating agencies in Virginia \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  144  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

The Rule will deter immigrant crime victims from accessing vital \n4  benefits for themselves or their families, including children and elderly relatives \n5  trying to escape from or address the trauma of domestic violence, sexual assault, \n6  unlawful labor or sex trafficking, and other crimes. \n7  385.  The Rule will significantly harm the Plaintiff States’ efforts to assist \n8  crime victims, as many victims and their families will sacrifice basic needs, \n9  safety, and health in the form of food assistance, housing assistance, and medical \n10  insurance, all to avoid potentially adverse immigration consequences. \n11  VII.  THE RULE’S OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS \n12  386.  As set forth in detail above, the Rule’s chilling effects will cause \n13  far-reaching harms to the Plaintiff States and their residents due to the loss of \n14  public benefits and services to which they are legally entitled. In addition to those \n15  harms,  the  Rule  will  have  a  vast  array  of  other  adverse  impacts,  including \n16  (1) wrongfully denying marriage-based green cards to half of applicants due to \n17  the irrationally  high  income  threshold;  (2)  destabilizing the  Plaintiff  States’ \n18  workforces by erecting arbitrary new barriers to immigration and adjustment or \n19  change of status; (3) reducing overall economic output and tax revenues in the \n20  Plaintiff  States;  (4)  imposing  a  disparate  burden  on  communities  of  color, \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  145  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Family Reunification Impacts \n4  387.  The  INA  requires  most  green  card  applicants  to  have  a  \n5  sponsor—typically a U.S. citizen-spouse or other family member—with a high \n6  enough income to ensure the immigrant would not become a public charge.221 By \n7  statute, the sponsor must “agree[] to provide support to maintain the sponsored \n8  alien at an annual income that is not less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty \n9  [guide]line” (FPG) based on household size.222 When the sponsor is the green \n10  card applicant’s spouse, the applicant’s income may be included “to meet the \n11  income requirement” of 125%of FPG.223 The affidavit of support provision thus \n12  reflects a Congressional determination that an income of at least 125% of FPG is \n13  sufficient to ensure a lawful permanent resident will not become a public charge. \n14  388.  The Rule eviscerates Congress’s intent in establishing the 125% of \n15  FPG threshold for an affidavit of support. It does so by doubling the income \n16                                             \n17  221 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(C), 1183a.  \n18  222 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A); see also 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2 (“In order for the \n19  intending immigrant to overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility, the \n20  sponsor must demonstrate the means to maintain the intending immigrant at an \n21  annual income of at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line.”). \n22  223 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(i)(3). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  146  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

In  doing  so,  the \n8  Department is attempting to rewrite the INA by regulation. \n9  389.  The Department’s new 250% FPG threshold would significantly \n10  inhibit the goal of family reunification that has long been a cornerstone of U.S. \n11  immigration policy. According to the analysis of one public commenter, 54%of \n12  the foreign-born spouses who are currently eligible for green cards would become \n13  ineligible under the  Rule’s  higher  income  threshold.226  The  Rule  will  force \n14  200,000 U.S. citizens to choose whether to leave the United States or live apart \n15  from their spouse, disrupting family cohesion and stability in the Plaintiff States. \n16 \n17 \n18                                             \n19  224 84 Fed.

Workforce Impacts \n2  390.  Non-cash public assistance benefits are essential for workers to \n3  remain employed, employable, and productive. For example, access to affordable \n4  health insurance helps workers to enter and remain in the workforce.227 Workers \n5  with health insurance miss approximately 75% fewer work days and are more \n6  productive at work than their uninsured peers.228 The Rule will therefore make \n7  the workforces in the Plaintiff States less healthy and less productive, reducing \n8  overall economic output. \n9  391.  As explained above, the Rule will significantly reduce the labor \n10  supply of direct care workers, who provide LTSS to low-income elderly and \n11  disabled individuals. The resulting shortage in the direct care worker labor market \n12  will increase costs for Plaintiff States to administer LTSS programs, endangering \n13  the safety of their elderly and disabled residents.  \n14 \n15 \n16                                             \n17  227 Larisa Antonisse and Rachel Garfield, The Relationship Between Work \n18  and  Health:  Findings  from  a  Literature  Review,  Kaiser  Fam.

Other Macroeconomic Impacts \n2  392.  The mass disenrollment from and forgone participation in public \n3  assistance  programs  by  immigrants  and  their  families  will  have  significant \n4  adverse impacts on the Plaintiff States’ economies. The loss of medical, food, \n5  cash, and other benefits will reduce revenue to numerous health care providers, \n6  grocers, farmers’ markets, and other market participants providing basic goods \n7  and services—constraining overall economic output in the Plaintiff States both \n8  directly and indirectly.  \n9  393.  For example, Washington State estimates that the Rule will directly \n10  reduce total economic output by as much as nearly $100 million. Economists with \n11  Washington’s DSHS used an input-output model to calculate indirect economic \n12  impacts from multiplier effects flowing from the reduced assistance to eligible \n13  families.  Under  this  model,  implementation  of  the  Rule  will  reduce  total \n14  economic output in Washington from between $41.8 million and $97.5 million. \n15  Under Washington’s projections, this will also result in an annual reduction in \n16  wages, salaries, and benefits for workers in the amount of $15.7 million to $36.7 \n17  million, as well as a loss of approximately 334 to 782 Washington jobs. \n18  394.  State  and  local  governments  benefit  from  the  significant  tax \n19  revenues  from  immigrant  taxpayers.  Between  2011  and  2013,  tax  revenues \n20  received from immigrants were $130 billion higher than public money spent on \n21 \n22 \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  149  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Those  state  and  local  tax  revenues  are  likely  to  decrease \n4  substantially as a result of the Rule, which will cause eligible immigrants to \n5  disenroll  from  public  benefits  programs,  limit  their  participation  in  the \n6  workforce, and not fully participate in the economy.  \n7  D.  Disparate Impacts \n8  396.  The effects of the Rule will have a disparate impact on communities \n9  of color, most severely on Latinos. It is well established that income and wealth \n10  disparities across racial and ethnic groups are substantial. The Rule, by selecting \n11  for wealthy immigrants and punishing the working class—including participation \n12  in common social safety net programs—would severely disadvantage non-white \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16                                             \n17  229 Nat’l Academies.

By  one  estimate,  the  chilling  effects  of  the  Rule  would \n4  disproportionately fall on people of color, prompting as many as 18.3 million \n5  Latino noncitizens or their family members to disenroll or forgo enrollment in \n6  public benefit programs—roughly 70% of the total noncitizen families at risk.232 \n7  The Department’s arbitrarily high 250% FPG income threshold would have \n8  disproportionate effects based on national origin and ethnicity, blocking 71% of \n9  applicants from Mexico and Central America, 69% from Africa, and 52% from \n10  Asia—compared to only 36% from Europe, Canada, and Oceania.233  \n11  398.  Other factors in the Public Charge Rule will cause a disparate impact \n12  on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin.

The high school degree factor will also have a disparate impact, \n2  since 54% of immigrants from Mexico and 46% of immigrants from Central \n3  America have not obtained a high school degree, while only 10% of immigrants \n4  from Europe or Canada have not obtained one.235  \n5  400.  Finally,  the  English  proficiency  factor  will  also  exacerbate  the \n6  Rule’s disparate impact on the basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin. Of the \n7  seven countries with the highest rates of English proficiency, six are in Europe \n8  and none is in Latin America or Africa. Conversely, none of the 24 countries with \n9  the lowest rates of English proficiency is in Europe, while all but one are in Latin \n10  America, Africa, or the Middle East.236 \n11  401.

Through Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress \n2  statutorily barred discrimination based on disability in any program or activity of \n3  any federal executive branch agencies.237 \n4  403.  Despite Section 504’s prohibition on disability discrimination, the \n5  Public  Charge  Rule  subjects  individuals  with  disabilities  to  an  increased \n6  likelihood of a public charge determination. It does so by, for example, requiring \n7  immigration officers to consider in the negative any medical condition that may \n8  interfere with self-care or restricts the individual’s ability to attend school or \n9  work, and by targeting non-monetary public benefits, such as Medicaid, which \n10  such individuals are likelier to receive to pay for medical costs related to their \n11  conditions. \n12  404.  DHS knowingly maintained these elements in the Rule despite the \n13  disproportionate impact it will have on individuals with disabilities. \n14  VIII.

The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n2  agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with \n3  law.”238 \n4  407.  Congress used the term “public charge” in the INA consistent with \n5  its original public meaning which includes determining whether an immigrant is \n6  likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government for subsistence.239 By \n7  redefining  “public  charge”  as  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more  public \n8  benefit[s],”240 in even modest amounts, the Rule unmoors the term from its \n9  original public meaning and departs from the unambiguously expressed intent of \n10  Congress in numerous statutes. The Rule’s redefinition of public charge and new \n11  standards governing public charge determinations are not in accordance with the \n12  following statutes:  \n13  a.  INA Section 212(a)(4);241 \n14  b.  INA Section 202(a)(1);242  \n15 \n16                                             \n17  238 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n18  239 64 Fed.

The  Final  Rule’s  inclusion  of  SNAP  as  a  negatively  weighted \n2  consideration for public charge is contrary to federal statutes governing those \n3  programs.  Specifically,  the  Final  Rule’s  allowance  of  consideration  of  a \n4  noncitizen’s  receipt  of  SNAP  benefits  is  contrary  to  the  express  statutory \n5  provision prohibiting consideration of those benefits “[as] income or resources \n6  for any purpose under any Federal, State, or local laws.” 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n7  Count II: \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—Ultra Vires Conduct \n8 \n409.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n9 \nfully set forth herein. \n10 \n410.  The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n11 \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory \n12 \njurisdiction [or] authority.”251 \n13 \n411.  The Rule expands the public charge exclusion to reach applicants \n14 \nfor extension of stay and change of status. The INA does not permit—either \n15 \nexpressly or impliedly—the Department to expand its authority in this regard. As \n16 \nthe Department itself acknowledges, the public charge exclusion statute “by its \n17 \nterms only applies to applicants for visas, admission, and adjustment of status, \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21                                             \n22  251 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR  156  ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON \n  8127 W.

Congress has specifically confined the categories of immigration \n4  applications to which the “public charge” designation applies. DHS may not \n5  expand those statutory limitations by regulation. Its attempt to do so is ultra vires \n6  and unlawful.253 \n7  Count III \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary or Capricious \n8  Agency Action \n9  413.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though \n10  fully set forth herein. \n11  414.  The APA requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n12  agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, \n13  [or] an abuse of discretion.”254 \n14  415.  In general, a rule is arbitrary and capricious where the agency “relied \n15  on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to \n16  consider  an  important aspect  of  the problem,  offered  an  explanation  for  its \n17  decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible \n18                                             \n19  252 83 Fed.

When  an  agency  reverses  position,  it  must  “supply  a  reasoned \n5  analysis for the change,”257 and may not “depart from a prior policy sub silentio \n6  or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.”258 Further, any “serious \n7  reliance interests must be taken into account,”259 particularly where “decades \n8  of . . . reliance on the Department’s prior policy” demand a fulsome explanation \n9  for the reversal.260 \n10  417.  Under  the  standards  set  forth  above,  the  Rule  is  arbitrary  or \n11  capricious in its entirety, including in the following particular respects:  \n12  a.  the  redefinition  of  public  charge  to  mean  “an  alien  who \n13  receives one or more public benefits”;261 \n14                                             \n15  255 Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  to  the  U.S. \n15 \nConstitution forbids the federal government from denying equal protection of \n16 \nthe laws.263  It is an equal protection violation where a “discriminatory purpose” \n17 \n18 \n19                                             \n20  262 84 Fed.

The  Rule  was  motivated  by  Administration  officials’  intent  to \n3  discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin.  \n4  421.  That  discriminatory  intent  is  evidenced  by  the  Rule’s \n5  disproportionate adverse impacts on communities of color, including affecting \n6  as many as 18.3 million Latinos in the United States.265 While people of color \n7  account for approximately 36% of the total U.S. population, approximately 90% \n8  of those chilled from seeking public services would be people of color (70% of \n9  whom are Latino). In other words, the Rule will cause Latinos and other people \n10  of color to be disproportionately excluded from the United States under the \n11  INA’s public charge provision. \n12  422.  In addition to that anticipated disparate racial and ethnic impact, \n13  other circumstantial evidence indicates that discrimination against people of \n14  color was a motivating factor behind the Rule. That evidence includes the \n15  historical background of the Rule, the specific sequence of events leading up to \n16  the  Rule,  departures  from  normal  rulemaking  procedures,  the  rulemaking \n17                                             \n18  264 Vill. of Arlington Heights v.

CITY AND COUNTY  \nOF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, ET  AL. \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT  \n[June 15, 2022] \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE  THOMAS,  \nJUSTICE ALITO, and JUSTICE GORSUCH join, concurring.  \n  This  case  involves  a  regulation  known  as  the  Public \nCharge Rule, promulgated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in 2019.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41292 (2019).  The Rule \nset out the test the Department planned to use to determine \nwhether an applicant for admission into the country or ad-\njustment to lawful permanent resident status is “likely at \nany time to become a public charge,” which would make him  \nineligible.  8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(4)(A).  Several parties filed \nlawsuits arguing that the Rule was unlawful because it de-\nfined “public charge” too broadly. \n  We granted certiorari in this case not to address the mer-\nits of that argument, but to decide whether the petition-\ners—13 States which support the Rule—should have been \npermitted to intervene in this litigation to defend the Rule’s\nlegality in the Court of Appeals. Petitioners argue that the \nanswer is yes, in light of the Government’s actions. \n  When this and other suits challenging the Rule were first \nbrought in 2019, the Government defended it.  And when  \nmultiple lower courts, including the District Court here,  \nfound the Rule unlawful, the Government appealed those\ndecisions.  After a change in administrations, though, the \nGovernment reversed course and opted to voluntarily dis-\n \n\n2  ARIZONA v.  CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO \n   \nROBERTS,  C.  J., concurring  \nmiss those appeals, leaving in place the relief already en-\ntered. \n  A new administration is of course as a general matter en-\ntitled to do that.  But the Government then took a further  \nstep.  It seized upon one of the now-consent judgments\nagainst it—a final judgment vacating the Rule nationwide, \nissued in a different litigation—and leveraged it as a basis \nto immediately repeal the Rule, without using notice-and-\ncomment procedures.  86 Fed. Reg. 14221 (2021) (“Because \nthis rule simply implements the district court’s vacatur of \nthe August 2019 rule . . . DHS is not required to provide  \nnotice and comment.”). This allowed the Government to cir-\ncumvent the usual and important requirement, under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, that a regulation originally \npromulgated  using  notice  and  comment  (as  the  Public \nCharge Rule was) may only be repealed through notice and \ncomment, 5 U. S. C. §551(5); see Perez v. Mortgage Bankers  \nAssn., 575 U. S. 92, 101 (2015).  As part of this tactic of \n“rulemaking-by-collective-acquiescence,” City and County  \nof San Francisco v. United States Citizenship and Immigra-\ntion Servs., 992 F. 3d 742, 744 (CA9 2021) (VanDyke, J., \ndissenting), the Government successfully opposed efforts by \nother interested parties—including petitioners here—to in-\ntervene in order to carry on the defense of the  Rule, includ-\ning possibly before this Court. \n  These maneuvers raise a host of important questions.  \nThe most fundamental is whether the Government’s ac-\ntions, all told, comport with the principles of administrative \nlaw.  But bound up in that inquiry are a great many issues \nbeyond the question of appellate intervention on which we \ngranted certiorari, among them standing; mootness; vaca-\ntur under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36  \n(1950); the scope of injunctive relief in an APA action;  \nwhether, contrary to what “[t]he government has long ar-\ngued,” the APA “authorize[s] district courts to vacate regu-\nlations or other agency actions on a nationwide basis,” Brief \n \n\n  Cite as:  596 U. S. ____ (2022)  3 \n \nROBERTS,  C.  J., concurring  \nfor Federal Respondents 5, n. 3; how the APA’s procedural \nrequirements  apply  in  this  unusual  circumstance,  cf.  \n§551(5); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,  \n515 (2009); and more.\n  It has become clear that this mare’s nest could stand in  \nthe way of our reaching the question presented on which we \ngranted certiorari, or at the very least, complicate our reso-\nlution of that question.  I therefore concur in the Court’s \ndismissal of the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  \nBut that resolution should not be taken as reflective of a  \nview on any of the foregoing issues, or on the appropriate \nresolution of other litigation, pending or future, related to \nthe 2019 Public Charge Rule, its repeal, or its replacement \nby a new rule.  See Cook County v.  Mayorkas, 340 F. R. D.  \n35 (ND Ill. 2021), appeal pending, No. 21–2561 (CA7); 87 \nFed. Reg. 10571 (2022) (new proposed rule that would “im-\nplement a different policy than the 2019 Final Rule”). \n ",

It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g5e   5 P oafg 4e7 5 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 5\nUnder 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A), any alien who, in the\nopinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, at the time of\napplication for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at\nany time to become a “public charge,” is inadmissible.  No\nstatute has ever defined the term.  In 1999, the Immigration\nand  Naturalization  Service  issued  guidance  (Guidance)\ndefining the term as one who “is or is likely to become\nprimarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”  The\nGuidance expressly excluded non-cash benefits intended to\nsupplement income.\nIn August 2019, the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) issued a rule (the Rule) that defines “public charge” to\ninclude those who are likely to participate, even for a limited\nperiod of time, in non-cash federal government assistance\nprograms.  The Rule defines the term “public charge” to\nmean “an alien who receives one or more [specified] public\nbenefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within\nany 36-month period.”   Inadmissibility on Public Charge\nGrounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  The Rule\nalso  directs  officials  to  consider  English  proficiency  in\nmaking the public charge determination.\nStates and municipalities brought suits in California and\nWashington,  asserting  claims  under  the  Administrative\nProcedure Act.  The District Court for the Northern District\nof California issued a preliminary injunction covering the\nterritory  of the plaintiffs, and the District Court for the\nEastern  District  of  Washington  issued  a  nationwide\ninjunction.  A divided motions panel of this court granted\nDHS’s motion for a stay of those injunctions pending appeal.\nThe  panel  first  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs  had\nestablished Article III standing.  The plaintiffs are states and\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g6e   6 P oafg 4e7 6 of 47\n6 CITY & CTY.

USCIS\nmunicipalities that alleged that the Rule is causing them\ncontinuing financial harm, as lawful immigrants eligible for\nfederal cash, food, and housing assistance withdraw from\nthese programs and instead turn to state and local programs. \nThe panel concluded that this constituted sufficient injury. \nAddressing whether the injury is apparent or imminent, the\npanel explained that: 1) the Rule itself predicts a 2.5 percent\ndecrease  in  enrollment  in  federal  programs  and  a\ncorresponding reduction in Medicaid payments of over one\nbillion  dollars  per  year;  2)  the  Rule  acknowledges  that\ndisenrollment will cause other indirect financial harm to state\nand local entities; and 3) declarations in the record show that\nsuch entities are already experiencing disenrollment.\nNext, the panel concluded that the interest of the plaintiffs\nin preserving immigrants’ access to supplemental benefits is\nwithin the zone of interests protected by the “public charge”\nstatute.  The panel rejected DHS’s suggestion that only the\nfederal government and individuals seeking to immigrate are\nwithin the zone of interest.  The panel also rejected DHS’s\nsuggestion that the purpose of the public charge statute is to\nreduce  immigrants’  use  of  public  benefits.    Addressing\nDHS’s contention that the statute’s overall purpose is to\npromote self-sufficiency, the panel concluded that providing\naccess  to  better  health  care,  nutrition,  and  supplemental\nhousing benefits is consistent with precisely that purpose.  \nThe  panel  next  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs  had\ndemonstrated a high likelihood of success in showing that the\nRule is inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the\npublic charge statute and therefore contrary to law.  The\nplaintiffs pointed to repeated congressional reenactment of\nthe provision after it had been interpreted to mean long-term\ndependence on government support, noting that the statute\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g7e   7 P oafg 4e7 7 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 7\nhad never been interpreted to encompass temporary resort to\nsupplemental non-cash benefits.  The plaintiffs contended that\nthis  repeated  reenactment  amounted  to  congressional\nratification of the historically consistent interpretation.\nThe panel concluded that the history of the provision\nsupported the plaintiffs’ position, noting that: 1) from the\nVictorian Workhouse through the 1999 Guidance, the concept\nof becoming a “public charge” has meant dependence on\npublic  assistance  for  survival;  2)  the  term  had  never\nencompassed persons likely to make short-term use of in-kind\nbenefits that are neither intended nor sufficient to provide\nbasic sustenance; and 3) the Rule introduces a lack of English\nproficiency.  The panel also noted that the opinions of the\nSecond  Circuit  and  the  Seventh  Circuit,  in  affirming\npreliminary injunctions of the Rule, agreed that the Rule’s\ninterpretation  was  outside  any  historically  accepted  or\nsensible understanding of the term.  \nThe panel next concluded that the Rule’s promulgation\nwas arbitrary and capricious, explaining that DHS: 1) failed\nto adequately consider the financial effects of the Rule;\n2) failed to address concerns about the Rule’s effect on public\nsafety, health, and nutrition, as well its effect on hospital\nresources and vaccination rates in the general population; and\n3) failed to explain its abrupt change in policy from the 1999\nGuidance. \nThe panel also concluded that the remaining preliminary\ninjunction factors favored the plaintiffs. The panel explained\nthat the plaintiffs had established that they likely are bearing\nand will continue to bear heavy financial costs because of\nwithdrawal of immigrants from federal assistance programs\nand consequent dependence on state and local programs.

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nOPINION\nSCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:\nThe  phrase  “public  charge”  enjoys  a  rich  history  in\nAnglo-American lore and literature, one more colorful than\nour American law on the subject.  There have been relatively\nfew published court decisions construing the phrase, even\nthough our immigration statutes have barred admission to\nimmigrants who are likely to become a “public charge” for\nmore  than  a  century.    Until  recently,  the  judicial  and\nadministrative  guidance  has  reflected  the  traditional\nconcept—rooted in the English Poor Laws and immortalized\nby Dickens in the workhouse of Oliver Twist—of incapacity\nand reliance on public support for subsistence.  The first\ncomprehensive federal immigration law barred entry to “any\nconvict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of\nhimself  or  herself  without  becoming  a  public  charge.” \nImmigration Act of 1882, 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2 (1882). \nThe 1999 Guidance (the Guidance) issued by the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service (INS), the predecessor of the\ncurrent agency, defined a “public charge” as one who “is or\nis likely to become primarily dependent on the government\nfor subsistence.”  See Field Guidance on Deportability and\nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg.\n28,689 (May 26, 1999).\nIn 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nchanged direction, however, and issued a rule (the Rule) that\ndefines the term to include those who are likely to participate,\neven  for  a  limited  period  of  time,  in  non-cash  federal\ngovernment assistance programs.  The programs designated\nby the Rule are not intended to provide for subsistence but\ninstead to supplement an individual’s ability to provide for\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a3g7e   1 P7a ogfe 4 177 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 17\nbasic  needs  such  as  food,  medical  care,  and  housing. \n8  C.F.R.  §  212.21(b).    Foreseeable  participation  for  an\naggregate of twelve months in any of the federal programs\nwithin a three-year span renders an immigrant inadmissible\nas a public charge and ineligible for permanent resident\nstatus.  § 212.21(a).  In other words, a single mother with\nyoung children who DHS foresees as likely to participate in\nthree of those programs for four months could not get a green\ncard.\nLitigation followed in multiple district courts against\nDHS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\nas states and municipalities recognized that the immediate\neffect of the Rule would be to discourage immigrants from\nparticipating  in  such  assistance  programs,  even  though\nCongress has made them available to immigrants who have\nbeen in the country for five years.  According to the plaintiffs\nin  those  cases,  the  Rule’s  effect  would  be  to  increase\nassistance demands on state and local governments, as their\nresident immigrants’ overall health and welfare would be\nadversely affected by non-participation in federal assistance\nprograms.\nThe challenges to the Rule in the district courts resulted\nin a chorus of preliminary injunctions holding the Rule to be\ncontrary  to  law  and  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nThese included the two preliminary injunctions before us, one\nissued by the District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia (Northern District) covering the territory of the\nplaintiffs, and the other by the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Washington (Eastern District) purporting to apply\nnationwide.  Our court became the first federal appeals court\nto weigh in when we granted DHS’s motion for a stay of\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a3g8e   1 P8a ogfe 4 178 of 47\n18 CITY & CTY.

USCIS, 944 F.3d 773, 781 (9th Cir. 2019). \nPreliminary injunctions were also issued by courts in the\nNorthern District of Illinois and the Southern District of New\nYork, and they were stayed by the United States Supreme\nCourt before appeals could be considered by the circuit courts\nof appeals.\n When the Seventh Circuit and the Second Circuit did\nconsider those preliminary injunction appeals, both courts\naffirmed the injunctions.  Although their reasoning differed\nin some respects, both circuits concluded that the Rule’s\ndefinition  was  both  outside  any  historic  or  commonly\nunderstood meaning of “public charge,” and arbitrary and\ncapricious,  in  concluding  that  short-term  reliance  on\nsupplemental benefits made immigrants dependent on public\nassistance within the meaning of the statutory public charge\nimmigration bar.  Cook Cnty., Ill. v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 229,\n232–33 (7th Cir. 2020); New York v. DHS, 969 F.3d 42,\n80–81 (2nd Cir. 2020).  The Second Circuit opinion was\nunanimous, while a dissenting opinion in the Seventh Circuit\nagreed with DHS that those who receive such supplemental\nbenefits could be considered public charges because, by\nreceiving some assistance,  they are not completely  self-\nsufficient.  Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d at 250–51 (Barrett, J.,\ndissenting).\nThe district court in Maryland also enjoined enforcement\nof the Rule and was reversed by a divided decision of the\nFourth Circuit.  The majority looked in large measure to the\nfact that the Supreme Court had stayed the injunctions in the\nSeventh and Second Circuits.  CASA de Maryland, Inc. v.\nTrump, 971 F.3d 220, 230 (4th Cir. 2020).

Statutory and Administrative Background\nThis country has had a federal statutory provision barring\nthe admission of persons likely to become a “public charge”\nsince 1882.  The Immigration Act of 1882 barred entry to,\namong others, “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person\nunable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a\npublic charge.”  The Immigration and Nationality Act now\nprovides that “[a]ny alien who, . . . in the opinion of the\n[Secretary of Homeland Security] at the time of application\nfor admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to\nbecome  a  public  charge  is  inadmissible.”    8  U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  No statute has ever defined the term. For\nover  a  century,  agencies  have  routinely  applied  these\nprovisions in determining admissibility and removal as well\nas in issuing visas for entry.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g0e   2 P0a ogfe 4 270 of 47\n20 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nIn 1996, however, Congress amended the statute to add\nfive factors for agencies to consider in determining whether\nan individual is likely to be a public charge: the non-citizen’s\nage; health; family status; assets, resources and financial\nstatus;  and  education  and  skills.    §  1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \nCongress also included a provision requiring applicants to\nproduce an affidavit of support.  See § 1182(a)(4)(C)–(D)\n(requiring  most  family-sponsored  immigrants  to  submit\naffidavits  of  support);  §  1183a  (affidavit  of  support\nrequirements).\nAt nearly the same time, Congress enacted major reforms\nof public benefit programs that, as relevant here, made only\nnon-citizens with five or more years of residency in the\nUnited  States  eligible  for  public  benefits  such  as\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and\nMedicaid.  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\nReconciliation Act (PRWORA), Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110\nStat. 2105, 2265 (1996).  Previously, lawful immigrants had\ngenerally been eligible for such benefits.  Congress thus\nsimultaneously reduced the number of immigrants eligible for\nthis assistance and spelled out the factors to be considered in\na  public  charge  determination.    The  fact  that  Congress\ndelineated  the  factors  relevant  to  the  public  charge\ndetermination at the same time it adjusted certain immigrants’\neligibility to receive specific supplemental assistance strongly\nsuggests that Congress did not intend for such assistance to be\nconsidered as one of the public charge factors.\nJudicial  guidance  in  interpreting  the  phrase  was\napparently not in need or demand: There are relatively few\nsuch decisions.  A leading early Supreme Court case resolved\nthe important question of whether the adverse economic\nconditions in the location where the immigrant intends to live\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g1e   2 P1a ogfe 4 271 of 47\nCITY & CTY.

The Supreme Court’s\nanswer was no because the statute spoke to the permanent\ncharacteristics personal to the immigrant rather than to local\nlabor market conditions.  Id. at 10.  We followed Gegiow in\nEx parte Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913 (9th Cir. 1922), where we\nheld that a person temporarily in need of family assistance\nshould not have been excluded as likely to become a public\ncharge.  We so held because there was an absence of “any\nevidence whatever of mental or physical disability or any fact\ntending to show that the burden of supporting the appellant is\nlikely to be cast upon the public.”  Id. at 916.  Thus, our court\nin  Sakaguchi  understood  the  standard  for  determining\nwhether  someone  is  a  public  charge  to  be  whether  the\n“burden of support” falls on the public.\nAdministrative decisions followed the Supreme Court’s\nlead  by  looking  to  the  inherent  characteristics  of  the\nindividual rather than to external circumstances.  The Board\nof Immigration Appeals thus held that only an individual with\nthe inherent inability to be self-supporting is excludable as\n“likely to become a public charge” within the meaning of the\nstatute.  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I & N. Dec. 583, 589–90\n(BIA 1974); Matter of Vindman, 16 I. & N. Dec. 131, 132\n(B.I.A. 1977); see also New York, 969 F.3d at 69.  There has\nbeen corollary administrative recognition that even if an\nindividual has been on welfare, that fact does not in and of\nitself establish the requisite likelihood of becoming a public\ncharge.  An Attorney General decision collected authorities\nindicating that it is the totality of circumstances that must be\nconsidered in order to determine whether “the burden of\nsupporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public.”  Matter\nof Martinez-Lopez, 10 I & N.

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nof some public benefits does not automatically render an\nimmigrant a public charge because the public does not bear\nthe “burden of support.”\nThe  1996  amendments,  which  added  factors  to  be\nconsidered and created the current public charge statutory\nprovision, caused some confusion as to how big a change\nthey represented.  The INS, the agency then in charge of\nadministering immigration, decided a regulatory definition\nwould be helpful.  It adopted the 1999 Guidance, the first\nregulatory guidance to interpret the rather ancient notion of\n“public charge” in light of the myriad, modern forms of\npublic assistance.  64 Fed. Reg. 28,269.\nThe Guidance defined a “public charge” as a non-citizen\nwho depends on the government for survival, either by receipt\nof income or confinement in a public institution.  It described\npersons  “primarily  dependent  on  the  government  for\nsubsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public\ncash  assistance  for  income  maintenance  or\n(ii) institutionalization for long term care at government\nexpense.”  Id. at 28,689.  It thus embodied the traditional\nnotion of primary dependence on the government for either\nincome or institutional care.\nThe Guidance went on to identify the types of public\nassistance that would typically qualify as evidence of primary\ndependence:  (1)  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI);\n(2) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); (3)\nstate and local cash assistance programs; and (4) programs\nsupporting people institutionalized for long-term care.  Id. at\n28,692.  The Guidance expressly excluded non-cash benefits\nintended to supplement income and not to provide primary\nsupport.  The explanation lay with the changing times that\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g3e   2 P3a ogfe 4 273 of 47\nCITY & CTY.

(“[C]ertain federal, state, and\nlocal  benefits  are  increasingly  being  made  available  to\nfamilies with incomes far above the poverty level, reflecting\nbroad public policy decisions about improving general public\nhealth  and  nutrition,  promoting  education,  and  assisting\nworking-poor  families  in  the  process  of  becoming  self-\nsufficient.  Thus, participation in such non-cash programs is\nnot evidence of poverty or dependence.”).\nThe Guidance actually encouraged non-citizens to receive\nsupplemental benefits in order to improve their standard of\nliving and to promote the general health and welfare.  The\nGuidance drew a sharp distinction between the receipt of such\nsupplemental benefits and dependence on the government for\nsubsistence income that would render the individual a “public\ncharge.”  Id. at 28,692–93.\nThe 2019 Public Charge Rule we review in this case\neffectively  reversed  that  policy  by  making  receipt  of\nsupplemental benefits the very definition of a public charge. \nSee Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg.\n41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  The Rule defines the term “public\ncharge”  to  mean  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more\n[specified] public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the\naggregate  within  any  36-month  period  (such  that,  for\ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two\nmonths).”  Id. at 41,501.  The public benefits specified by the\nRule include most Medicaid benefits, SNAP benefits, Section\n8 housing vouchers and rental assistance, and other forms of\nfederal housing assistance.  Id.  Any receipt of such a benefit,\nno matter how small, will factor into the public charge\ndetermination.  The Rule also directs officials to consider\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g4e   2 P4a ogfe 4 274 of 47\n24 CITY & CTY.

Id. at 41,503–04.\nThe Rule was greeted with challenges in federal district\ncourts throughout the country.  We deal with those in this\ncircuit.\nB. The District Court Injunctions\nOn  appeal  are  two  district  court  decisions  granting\npreliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the Rule.  The\nNorthern District considered the challenges of California, the\nDistrict of Columbia, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Oregon,\nconsolidated with the challenges brought by the City and\nCounty of San Francisco, and the County of Santa Clara.  The\nEastern District heard the challenges brought by Washington,\nVirginia, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland,\nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey,\nNew Mexico, and Rhode Island.  Both district courts agreed\nthat the plaintiffs had standing because they had shown that\nthey would likely suffer economic harm and other costs and\nthat their concerns were within the zone of interests of the\nstatute.  Both held that the new definition of “public charge”\nwas likely not a permissible interpretation of the statute\nbecause  it  would  depart  from  the  longstanding,  settled\nunderstanding that a person does not become a public charge\nby receiving short-term aid, and must instead demonstrate an\ninherent incapacity to provide subsistence.  City and Cnty. of\nSan Francisco v. USCIS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1101 (N.D.\nCal. 2019), Washington v. DHS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1219\n(E.D. Wash. 2019).  Both found the Rule to be likely arbitrary\nand capricious because the agency failed to consider the\nburdens the Rule would impose on states and municipalities. \n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g5e   2 P5a ogfe 4 275 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 25\nThe Eastern District issued a nationwide injunction, and the\nNorthern District declined to do so.\nWithin a few weeks of the district court rulings, a divided\nmotions panel of this court, however, stayed both injunctions\npending this appeal.  City and Cnty. of SF, 944 F.3d 773.  The\npanel majority wrote that DHS was likely to prevail because\nthe  Rule  would  probably  be  viewed  as  a  reasonable\ninterpretation of a statute that had no consistent historical\napplication and gave the agency “considerable discretion.” \nId. at 796, 799.  Judge Owens dissented in part and would\nhave denied the stay.  Id. at 809–10 (Owens, J., dissenting).\nThe stay was based on a prediction of what this panel\nwould  hold  in  reviewing  the  merits  of  the  preliminary\ninjunctions.  The stay in this case was entered at a particularly\nearly point, less than two months after the district court\ninjunctions.  Almost none of the extensive documentation\nrelevant to this appeal was before the motions panel.  The\nbrief of the appellant DHS in the Northern District case had\nbeen filed only the day before the panel entered its stay, and\nthe opening brief in the Eastern District case was not filed\nuntil the day after.  Still to come were not only the answering\nand reply briefs in both appeals, but two dozen amicus briefs,\nmany of which we have found very helpful.\nAt least equally important, no other circuit court opinions\nhad yet considered the issues.  By now we have heard from\nthree.  One of those opinions even discussed and disagreed\nwith the reasoning of this court’s motions panel stay opinion,\npointing out that it “pinn[ed] the definition of ‘public charge’\non the form of public care provided” in concluding that there\nwas no consistent interpretation of the Rule.  New York,\n969 F.3d at 73 (emphasis in original).  The court there said\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g6e   2 P6a ogfe 4 276 of 47\n26 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nour motions panel thereby went “astray.”  Id.  This was\nbecause the issue was not whether a “public charge” had\nalways received similar assistance.  Id.  The issue should have\nbeen  whether  the  “inquiry”  under  the  statute  had  been\nconsistent.  Id.  The Second Circuit concluded the public\ncharge inquiry had always been whether the non-citizen “is\nlikely to depend on that [assistance] system.”  Id.\nWe therefore turn to the appeal before us.  We deal first\nwith DHS’s arguments that the plaintiffs may not maintain\nthe suit because they lack Article III standing or are outside\nthe zone of interests of the immigration statute in question.\nC. Plaintiffs’ Capacity to Maintain the Action\nPlaintiffs are states and municipalities that allege the Rule\nis causing them to suffer continuing financial harm, as lawful\nimmigrants  eligible  for  federal  cash,  food,  and  housing\nassistance withdraw from these programs to avoid the impact\nof the Rule.  Plaintiffs allege harm because such immigrants\nwill instead turn to assistance programs administered by the\nstate and local entities.\nDHS  argues  that  such  injuries  are  speculative  and\nrepresent only plausible future injury.  There is no question\nthat to have Article III standing to bring this action, the\nplaintiffs  must  allege  that  they  have  suffered,  or  will\nimminently suffer, a “concrete and particularized” injury in\nfact.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \nThere is also no question that an increased demand for aid\nsupplied by the state and local entities would be such an\ninjury.  The only question is whether such demand is, as of\nyet, apparent or imminent.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g7e   2 P7a ogfe 4 277 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 27\nThat is not a difficult question to answer.  The Rule itself\npredicts a 2.5 percent decrease in enrollment in public benefit\nprograms  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in  Medicaid\npayments of over one billion dollars per year.  Final Rule,\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,302, 41,463.  The Rule itself further\nacknowledges that disenrollment will cause other indirect\nfinancial harm to state and local entities by increasing the\ndemand for uncompensated indigent care.  Declarations in the\nrecord  show  that  such  entities  are  already  experiencing\ndisenrollment as a result of the Rule.  See City and Cnty. of\nSF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1122.\nDHS nevertheless asserts that the Rule will result in a\nlong-term cost savings after states compensate for the loss of\nfederal funds by reforming their operations.  But such long-\nterm reforms would not remedy the immediate financial\ninjury to the plaintiffs or the harms to the health and welfare\nof  those  individuals  affected.    As  the  Second  Circuit\nexplained, “this simplistic argument fails to account for the\nfact that the States allege injuries that extend well beyond\nreduced Medicaid revenue and federal funding to the States,\nincluding an overall increase in healthcare costs that will be\nborne by public hospitals and general economic harms.”  New\nYork, 969 F.3d at 60.  Thus, plaintiffs have established Article\nIII standing.\nThose suing under the APA, must also establish that the\ninterest they assert is at least “arguably within the zone of\ninterests  to  be  protected  or  regulated  by  the  statute”  in\nquestion.  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012) (quoting Ass’n\nof Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150,\n153 (1970)).  The Supreme Court has described the test as\n“not  meant  to  be  especially  demanding”  and  as  “not\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g8e   2 P8a ogfe 4 278 of 47\n28 CITY & CTY.

Ass’n,  479  U.S.  388,  399–40  (1987)).    A\nplaintiff’s interest need only be “sufficiently congruent with\nthose of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not\n‘more  likely  to  frustrate  than  to  further  the  statutory\nobjectives.’”  First Nat. Bank & Tr. Co. v. Nat’l Credit Union\nAdmin., 988 F.2d 1272, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting\nClarke, 479 U.S. at 397 n.12).\nThe statute in question is, of course, the immigration\nstatute  that  renders  inadmissible  an  individual  likely  to\nbecome a “public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  DHS\nappears to contend that the only entities within the zone of\ninterests are the federal government itself and individuals\nseeking  to  immigrate,  because  the  provision  deals  with\nimmigration  and  only  the  federal  government  controls\nimmigration.  If that were to define the zone of interests\nregulated by the statute, the scope of permissible immigration\nlitigation against the government would be so narrow as to\npractically insulate it from many challenges to immigration\npolicy and procedures, even those violating the Constitution\nor federal laws.\nDHS suggests that the purpose of the public charge\nexclusion is to reduce immigrants’ use of public benefits, and\nthat the plaintiffs’ suit therefore contradicts this purpose by\nseeking to make more federal benefits available.  But this\nassumes that Congress’s statutory purpose was the same as\nDHS’s purpose here, which is the very dispute before us.  As\nthe Second Circuit pointed out, “DHS assumes the merits of\nits own argument when it identifies the purpose of the public\ncharge ground as ensuring that non-citizens do not use public\nbenefits . . . .

Providing access to\nbetter  health  care,  nutrition  and  supplemental  housing\nbenefits is consistent with precisely that purpose.  See Cook\nCnty., 962 F.3d at 220 (access to affordable basic health care\nmay  promote  self-sufficiency);  Hilary  Hoynes,  Diane\nWhitmore  Schanzenbach  &  Douglas  Almond,  Long-Run\nImpacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net, 106 Am.\nEcon.  Rev.  903,  921  (2016)  (access  to  food  stamps  in\nchildhood significantly increases economic self-sufficiency\namong women).  For these reasons, the interests of the\nplaintiffs in preserving immigrants’ access to supplemental\nbenefits is within the zone of interests protected by the\nstatute.\nWe therefore conclude that the district courts correctly\ndetermined that the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this\naction.  All of the circuits to consider the validity of this Rule\nhave reached a similar conclusion.  See Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d\nat 219–20, CASA de Maryland, 971 F.3d at 240–241, New\nYork, 969 F.3d at 62–63.  We now turn to the question\nwhether they were entitled to the preliminary injunctions\nentered by the district courts.\nD.  Contrary to Law\nBoth district courts concluded that the plaintiffs are likely\nto  prevail  in  their  contention  that  the  Rule  violates  the\nstatute’s public charge provision, and that such a conclusion\nsupports the entry of preliminary injunctions.

On\nappeal, DHS contends, as it has throughout the litigation, that\nthe Rule is a permissible interpretation of the statute.  The\nplaintiffs maintain that the Rule violates the statute because\nthe Rule is not a reasonable interpretation of the meaning of\n“public charge.”\nHistory is a strong pillar supporting the plaintiffs’ case. \nPlaintiffs point to repeated congressional reenactment of the\nprovision after it had been interpreted to mean long-term\ndependence on government support, and had never been\ninterpreted to encompass temporary resort to supplemental\nnon-cash  benefits.    Plaintiffs  contend  that  this  repeated\nreenactment amounts to congressional  ratification of the\nhistorically consistent interpretation.  DHS disagrees, arguing\nthat the repeated reenactments reflect congressional intent to\nhave a flexible standard subject to various executive branch\ninterpretations.\nOur review of the history of the provision in our law\nsuggests the plaintiffs have the better part of this dispute. \nFrom the Victorian Workhouse through the 1999 Guidance,\nthe  concept  of  becoming  a  “public  charge”  has  meant\ndependence on public assistance for survival.  Up until the\npromulgation  of  this  Rule,  the  concept  has  never\nencompassed persons likely to make short-term use of in-kind\nbenefits that are neither intended nor sufficient to provide\nbasic sustenance.  The Rule also, for the first time, introduces\na lack of English proficiency as figuring into the equation,\ndespite  the  common  American  experience  of  children\nlearning English in the public schools and teaching their\nelders  in  our  urban  immigrant  communities.    8  C.F.R.\n§ 212.22(b)(5)(ii)(D).

The  court\nrecognized and explained the line of settled judicial and\nadministrative interpretations of a public charge as one who\nis primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  Id.\nat 65–70.  The court traced that history in far more detail than\nwe have outlined and was “convinced” that there was a well-\nsettled meaning of “public charge” even before congressional\npassage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act (IIRIRA) in 1996, and that was a person\n“unable to support herself, either through work, savings, or\nfamily ties.”  Id. at 71.  Receipt of cash benefits may be\nconsidered in deciding whether a person is dependent on the\ngovernment but has never been determinative.  The Second\nCircuit persuasively summarized:\nThe Plaintiffs do not argue, and we do not\nhold,  that  the  receipt  of  various  kinds  of\npublic  benefits  is  irrelevant  to  the\ndetermination  of  whether  a  non-citizen  is\nlikely  to  become  a  public  charge.    But\ndefining public charge to mean the receipt,\neven for a limited period, of any of a wide\nrange of public benefits – particularly . . . ones\nthat  are  designed  to  supplement  an\nindividual's  or  family's  efforts  to  support\nthemselves,  rather  than  to  deal  with  their\nlikely  permanent  inability  to  do  so  –  is\ninconsistent with the traditional understanding\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g2e   3 P2a ogfe 4 372 of 47\n32 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nof what it means to be a “public charge,”\nwhich was well-established by 1996.\nId. at 78 (emphasis removed).\nA few months earlier, the Seventh Circuit had come to a\nsimilar  conclusion  that  the  Rule  violates  the  statutory\nmeaning of public charge.  Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d 208.  The\nSeventh Circuit differed somewhat in its analysis.  After a\nhistorical survey of court decisions and secondary sources, it\ndetermined that the phrase “public charge” was susceptible to\nvarious interpretations.  Id. at 226.  It concluded, however,\nthat DHS’s interpretation, quantifying the definition to mean\nreceipt of twelve months’ worth of benefits within three\nyears, represented an understanding of its authority to define\nthe phrase that “has no natural limitation.”  Id. at 228–29.  If\nDHS’s  interpretation  were  to  be  accepted,  then  there  is\nnothing in the statutory text that would prevent a zero-\ntolerance rule, where foreseeable receipt of a single benefit on\none occasion would bar entry or adjustment of status.  The\nmajority forcefully rejected such an interpretation, stating:\nWe  see  no  warrant  in  the  Act  for  this\nsweeping view.  Even assuming that the term\n“public charge” is ambiguous and thus might\nencompass more than institutionalization or\nprimary,  long-term  dependence  on  cash\nbenefits,  it  does  violence  to  the  English\nlanguage and the statutory context to say that\nit  covers  a  person  who  receives  only  de\nminimis benefits for a de minimis period of\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g3e   3 P3a ogfe 4 373 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 33\ntime.  There is a floor inherent in the words\n“public charge,” backed up by the weight of\nhistory.\nId. at 229.\nAlthough the opinions of the Second Circuit in New York\nand  the  Seventh  Circuit  in  Cook  County  reflect  some\ndisagreement  over  whether  there  was  any  historically\nestablished meaning of the phrase “public charge,” they\nagreed that the Rule’s interpretation of the statute was outside\nany historically accepted or sensible understanding of the\nterm.  In commenting on the difference between its historical\nreview in New York and that of the Seventh Circuit in Cook\nCounty, the Second Circuit noted that the Seventh Circuit had\nnot  included  the  significant    administrative  rulings  that\npreceded the 1996 statute.  New York, 969 F.3d at 74.\nThe New York opinion was unanimous, but the Cook\nCounty opinion was not.  The lengthy dissenting opinion in\nCook County focused on other statutory provisions aimed at\npreventing entry of persons who could become dependent on\nthe government.  The most significant of these provisions is\nthe  requirement  that  family-sponsored  immigrants,  and\nemployment-sponsored immigrants whose employment is\ntied to a family member, must furnish an affidavit from the\nsponsor.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(C)–(D).  In the affidavit, the\nsponsor  must  agree  to  support  the  immigrant  at  annual\nincome of at least 125 percent of the poverty level and pay\nback  the  relevant  governmental  entity  in  the  event  the\nimmigrant  receives  “any  means-tested  public  benefit.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(b).\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g4e   3 P4a ogfe 4 374 of 47\n34 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nThe dissent focused on the fact that the affidavit provision\nforces sponsors to bear responsibility for “any means-tested\npublic benefit” that an immigrant may receive.  It concluded\nthat the affidavit provision reflects Congress’s view that\n“public charge” may encompass receipt of supplemental\nbenefits as well as primary dependence.  See Cook Cnty.,\n962 F.3d at 246 (Barrett, J., dissenting).\nIn its focus on the provisions in a related but different\nsection  of  the  statute,  the  dissent  did  not  address  the\nsignificance of the history of the public charge provision\nitself, nor did it address  the majority’s objection  to the\nduration of the receipt of benefits as a standard having no\nlimiting principle.  The dissent concluded only that the choice\nof an aggregate of twelve months is “not unreasonable.”  Id.\nat 253.  Moreover, the dissent’s interpretation of the affidavit\nrequirement’s application here seems to suggest that it would\napprove a public charge rule excluding  individuals  who\nreceived “any means-tested benefit,” no matter how small, as\nin line with congressional intent.\nIn this appeal, DHS also relies upon the affidavit of\nsupport provisions to contend that the Rule is consistent with\nthe statutory public charge bar.  The public charge bar and\naffidavit of support provisions were parts of two separate\nacts.  The two have no historic or functional relationship to\neach other.  The public charge bar dates back to the 19th\ncentury, embodying an age-old concept of excluding those\nwho may become primarily dependent on the government. \nCongress enacted the affidavit of support provision, however,\nin 1996 as part of more recent specific immigration reforms\nincluding  the  financial  responsibilities  of  families  and\nemployers sponsoring individual immigrants. See PRWORA,\nPub. L. No. 423, 110 Stat. 2271 (1996); IIRIRA, Pub. L.

USCIS 35\n104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996).  The section of the affidavit\nprovision that refers to public benefits serves as a post-\nadmission remedy to help local and federal governments\nrecoup funds.  § 1183a(b).  The changes to the affidavit\nprovisions were aimed at problems with the unenforceability\nof such affidavits prior to 1996.  Michael J. Sheridan, The\nNew Affidavit of Support and Other 1996 Amendments to\nImmigration and Welfare Provisions Designed to Prevent\nAliens from Becoming Public Charges, 31 Creighton L. Rev.\n741, 743-44, 752-53 (1998) (article by INS Associate General\nCounsel).\nDHS also points to the provision that permits entry of\nbattered women without regard to receipt of “any benefits.” \nSee 8  U.S.C. §  1182(s).    DHS argues  that  this reflects\nCongress’s belief that the receipt of any public benefits would\nbe a consideration in admission for most other public charge\ndeterminations.  Had Congress intended to make non-cash\nbenefits a factor for admission or permanent residence, it\nwould have done so directly and not through this ancillary\nprovision.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S.\n457,  468  (2001)  (Congress  does  not  “hide  elephants  in\nmouseholes”).  It is more likely that Congress created this\nprovision  in  order  to  provide  sweeping  protections  for\nbattered migrant women, as it did throughout Section 1182. \nSee § 1182(a)(6)(ii), (a)(9)(B)(iii)(IV).\nFor  these  reasons  we  conclude  the  plaintiffs  have\ndemonstrated a high likelihood of success in showing that the\nRule is inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the\nstatutory public charge bar and therefore is contrary to law.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g6e   3 P6a ogfe 4 376 of 47\n36 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nE. Arbitrary and Capricious\nBoth district courts also ruled that the plaintiffs were\nlikely to succeed in their contention that the Rule is arbitrary\nand capricious.  The APA standard in this regard is inherently\ndeferential.  The task of the courts is to ensure that the\nagency’s  action  relied  on  appropriate  considerations,\nconsidered all important aspects of the issue, and provided an\nadequate explanation for its decision.  The Supreme Court\nsummed it up in its leading decision, Motor Vehicle Mfrs.\nAss'n, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (“State Farm”),\n463 U.S. 29 (1983).  The Court explained the general rule:\nNormally, an agency rule would be arbitrary\nand capricious if the agency has relied on\nfactors which Congress has not intended it to\nconsider,  entirely  failed  to  consider  an\nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an\nexplanation for its decision that runs counter\nto the evidence before the agency, or is so\nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a\ndifference in view or the product of agency\nexpertise.\nId. at 43.\nThe plaintiffs argue that DHS failed the test in three\nprincipal respects: It failed to take into account the costs the\nRule would impose on state and local governments; it did not\nconsider the adverse effects on health, including both the\nhealth of immigrants who might withdraw from programs and\nthe overall health of the community; and it did not adequately\nexplain why it was changing the policy that was thoroughly\nexplained in the 1999 Guidance.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g7e   3 P7a ogfe 4 377 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 37\n1. Disenrollment and Financial Costs\nWe first turn to DHS’s consideration of the financial\nimpact of the proposed Rule.  During the comment period,\nthere was repeated emphasis on the financial burdens that\nwould befall state and local governments because immigrants\nfearing application of the Rule would disenroll from the\nsupplemental programs, even if the Rule did not apply to\nthem.  DHS’s response was a generality coupled with an\nexpression of uncertainty.  It said that, despite these effects,\nthe  Rule’s  “overriding  consideration”  of  self-sufficiency\nformed “a sufficient basis to move forward.”  84 Fed. Reg. at\n41,312.  DHS added that there was no way of knowing with\nany  degree  of  exactitude  how  many  individuals  would\ndisenroll or how much of a burden it would place on the state\nand local governments.  Id. at 41,312–13.\nDHS provided no analysis of the effect of the Rule on\ngovernmental entities like the plaintiffs in these cases.  As the\nNorthern  District  found,  DHS  had  not  “grapple[d]  with\nestimates and credible data explained in the comments.”  City\nand Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1106.\nOur  law  requires  more  from  an  agency.    A  bald\ndeclaration  of  an  agency’s  policy  preferences  does  not\ndischarge its duty to engage in “reasoned decisionmaking”\nand “explain the evidence which is available.”  State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 52.  The record before DHS was replete with\ndetailed information about, and projections of, disenrollment\nand associated financial costs to state and local governments. \nSee, e.g., Ninez Ponce, Laurel Lucia, & Tia Shimada, How\nProposed Changes to the ‘Public Charge’ Rule Will Affect\nHealth, Hunger and the Economy in California, 32 (Nov.\n2018),  https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/newsroom/Documents/\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g8e   3 P8a ogfe 4 378 of 47\n38 CITY & CTY.

DHS was required to “reasonably reflect upon” and\n“grapple with” such evidence.  Fred Meyers Stores, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 865 F.3d 630, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  But DHS made\nno attempt to quantify the financial costs of the Rule or\ncritique the projections offered.\nSimilarly, DHS’s repeated statements that the Rule’s\ndisenrollment impacts are “difficult to predict” do not satisfy\nits duty to “examine the relevant data” before it.  State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 43.  The Supreme Court held in State Farm that\nan agency may not, without analysis, cite even “‘substantial\nuncertainty’ . . . as a justification for its actions.”  Id. at 52;\nsee also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA, 538 F.3d\n1172,  1200  (9th  Cir.  2008)  (rejecting  as  arbitrary  and\ncapricious  agency’s  characterization  of  greenhouse  gas\nreductions as “too uncertain to support their explicit valuation\nand inclusion” in analysis).  DHS’s analysis thus fell short of\nthe  standard  established  by  the  Supreme  Court  and\nrecognized by our circuit.  DHS did not adequately deal with\nthe financial effects of the Rule.\n2. Health Consequences\nAlthough DHS wrote the Rule was intended to make\nimmigrants healthier and stronger, commenters stressed the\nRule’s likely adverse health consequences for immigrants and\nthe public as a whole, including infectious disease outbreaks\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g9e   3 P9a ogfe 4 379 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 39\nand hospital closures.  While acknowledging these comments,\nDHS  concluded,  without  support,  that  the  Rule  “will\nultimately strengthen public safety, health, and nutrition.” \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314.  The Northern District aptly found\nthat DHS impermissibly “simply declined to engage with\ncertain, identified public-health consequences of the Rule.” \nCity and Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1111–12.\nCommenters provided substantial evidence that the Rule\nwould in fact harm public safety, health, and nutrition.  DHS\nitself repeatedly  acknowledged that hospitals  might face\nfinancial harms as a result of the Rule, but DHS repeatedly\ndeclined  to  quantify,  assess,  or  otherwise  deal  with  the\nproblem in any meaningful way.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at\n41,313–14, 41,384, 41,475, 41,476.  This is inadequate and\nsuggests that DHS’s position was intractable.  As the D.C.\nCircuit has observed, making some mention of evidence but\nthen coming to a contrary, “unsupported and conclusory”\ndecision “add[s] nothing to the agency’s defense of its thesis\nexcept perhaps the implication that it was committed to its\nposition regardless of any facts to the contrary.”  Chem. Mfrs.\nAss’n. v. EPA, 28 F.3d 1259, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  DHS\nresponded by excluding certain programs for children and\npregnant women from the ambit of the Rule, but never\naddressed the larger concerns about the Rule’s effect on\nhealth as well as on hospital resources.\nThere were other serious health concerns.  For example,\ncomments demonstrated that the Rule would endanger public\nhealth  by  decreasing  vaccination  rates  in  the  general\npopulation.    DHS  insisted  that  vaccines  would  “still  be\navailable” to Medicaid-disenrolled individuals because “local\nhealth centers and state health departments” would pick up\nthe slack, id. at 41,385, despite objections voiced by such\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g0e   4 P0a ogfe 4 470 of 47\n40 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nlocal health centers and state health departments themselves\nshowing  that  the  Rule  will  put  the  populations  they\nserve—citizens and non-citizens alike—in danger.  See, e.g.,\nMass. Dep’t of Pub. Health, Comments on Inadmissibility on\nPublic Charge Grounds (Dec. 2018), https://www.regulations.\ngov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-45697; Hilltown Cmty.\nHealth Ctr., Comments on Inadmissibility on Public Charge\nGrounds (Dec. 2018), https://www.regulations.gov/docume\nnt?D=USCIS-2010-0012-45675.    A  decision  that  “runs\ncounter to the evidence” or “is so implausible that it could not\nbe ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency\nexpertise” is arbitrary and capricious.  State Farm, 463 U.S.\nat 43.  The promulgation of this Rule is such a decision.  DHS\nclaims no expertise in public health, unlike the scores of\nexpert commenters who weighed in against the Rule.\n3. Reversal of Position\nAbove all, DHS failed to explain its abrupt change in\npolicy from the 1999 Guidance.  An agency reversing a prior\npolicy “must show that there are good reasons for the new\npolicy”  and  provide  “a  reasoned  explanation  .  .  .  for\ndisregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were\nengendered by the prior policy.”  FCC v. Fox Television\nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009).  The district\ncourts  below  found  that  DHS  had  failed  to  satisfy  this\nstandard.  City and Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1111–12;\nWashington v. DHS, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1220.\nThe  1999  Guidance  had  been  issued  after  the  1996\nstatutory amendments setting out the general factors to be\ntaken into account in making a public charge determination. \nThe Guidance considered all of the different types of public\nassistance  governments  offered,  including  programs\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g1e   4 P1a ogfe 4 471 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 41\nproviding  subsistence  income  and  those  providing\nsupplemental benefits.  The Guidance expressly provided that\nreceipt of supplemental assistance for food, healthcare and\nhousing  were  not  to  be  considered  in  assessing  an\nimmigrant’s likelihood of becoming a public charge.  As\ndiscussed above, this provision was consistent with over a\ncentury of judicial and administrative decisions interpreting\nthe public charge bar.  The Rule, however, provides that the\nprospect of receiving those same supplemental benefits, for\neven a few months, renders an individual inadmissible.  This\nis directly contrary to the 1999 Guidance.\nYet DHS promulgated the Rule without any explanation\nof why the facts found, and the analysis provided, in the prior\nGuidance were now unsatisfactory.  This is a practice the\nSupreme Court has rejected: an agency about-face with no\n“reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding” the findings\nunderlying the prior policy.  Fox, 556 U.S. at 516.  Here is an\nillustration of the about-face.  The 1999 Guidance had found\nthat deterring acceptance of “important health and nutrition\nbenefits” had yielded “an adverse impact . . . on public health\nand the general welfare.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. In contrast,\nDHS now says that the new Rule “will ultimately strengthen\npublic safety, health, and nutrition.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314. \nDHS provides no basis for this conclusion or for its departure\nfrom the empirical assessments underlying the prior policy.\nIn light of this policy change, coupled with the “serious\nreliance  interests”  engendered  by  over  two  decades  of\nreliance on the Guidance, DHS was required to provide a\n“more detailed justification” for the Rule.  Fox, 556 U.S.\nat 515.  DHS provides no justification, other than the repeated\nconclusory mantra that the new policy will encourage self-\nsufficiency.    DHS  in  effect  says  that  by  creating  a\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g2e   4 P2a ogfe 4 472 of 47\n42 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\ndisincentive for immigrants to use available assistance, the\nRule  will  “ensur[e]  that  [admitted  immigrants]  be  self-\nsufficient and not reliant on public resources.”  84 Fed. Reg.\nat 41,319.  DHS does not substantiate, and the record does not\nsupport, this empirical prediction.  See, e.g., Hilary Hoynes,\nDiane Whitmore Schanzenbach & Douglas Almond, Long-\nRun Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net, 106 Am.\nEcon. Rev. 903, 930 (finding that having access to food\nstamps during childhood leads to “significant improvement\nin adult health” and “increases in economic self-sufficiency,”\nincluding decreased welfare participation).  Plaintiffs urge\nthat their experience is contrary to DHS’s conclusion.  Also\nto the contrary is the experience related in multiple amicus\nbriefs.  See, e.g., Brief for the Institute for Policy Integrity as\nAmicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners at 9 (citing evidence\nthat reductions in SNAP participation increase homelessness);\nBrief for National Housing Law Project et al. as Amici Curiae\nSupporting Petitioners at 13 (citing evidence that Medicaid\nmade it easier for recipients to work and find work).\n4. Arbitrary and Capricious\nIn  sum,  DHS  adopted  the  Rule,  reversing  prior,\nlongstanding public policy, without adequately taking into\naccount its potential adverse effects on the public fisc and the\npublic  welfare.    We  must  conclude  that  the  Rule’s\npromulgation was arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary\nto law within the meaning of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g3e   4 P3a ogfe 4 473 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 43\nF. Remaining Injunction Factors\n1. Irreparable Harm\nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their claim that the Rule violates the standards of\nthe APA in that it is both contrary to law and arbitrary and\ncapricious.  To support entry of an injunction, Plaintiffs must\nalso show a likely threat of irreparable injury in the absence\nof an injunction.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  Plaintiffs have\nestablished that they likely are bearing and will continue to\nbear  heavy  financial  costs  because  of  withdrawal  of\nimmigrants from federal assistance programs and consequent\ndependence on state and local programs.\nThere is no dispute that such economic harm is sufficient\nto constitute irreparable harm because of the unavailability of\nmonetary damages.  See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558,\n581 (9th Cir. 2018); 5 U.S.C. § 702 (providing for relief\n“other than monetary damages”).  DHS counters that such\nharm in this case is speculative, amounting to no more than\nthe possibility of future injury.  See Park Vill. Apartment\nTenants Ass’n v. Mortimer Howard Tr., 636 F.3d 1150, 1160\n(9th Cir. 2011).\nWe have, however, already seen that in this case such\nharm is more than speculative.  Plaintiffs have presented\nevidence that they are already experiencing harm and DHS\nitself has projected significant disenrollment from federal\nprograms, likely leading to enrollments in state and local\nones.  The district courts both made factual findings as to\nharm that DHS does not refute with citations to the record.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g4e   4 P4a ogfe 4 474 of 47\n44 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\n2. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\nThere was no error in finding that the balance of equities\nand public interest support an injunction.  The Northern\nDistrict pointed to the need for “continuing the provision of\nmedical  services  through  Medicaid  to  those  who  would\npredictably disenroll absent an injunction” in light of the\nexplanations given by “parties and numerous amici . . . [of\nthe] adverse health consequences not only to those who\ndisenroll, but to the entire populations of the plaintiff states,\nfor example, in the form of decreased vaccination rates.”  City\nand Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1127.  The public interest\nin preventing contagion is particularly salient during the\ncurrent global pandemic.\nAlthough DHS nevertheless argues that it is harmed by\nnot being able to implement its new definition of public\ncharge, if it is ultimately successful in defending the merits of\nthe Rule, the harm will amount to no more than a temporary\nextension of the law previously in effect for decades.  Given\nthe  financial  burdens  that  plaintiffs  have  persuasively\ndemonstrated will befall them as a result of disenrollment\nfrom federal programs, coupled with adverse effects on the\nhealth  and  welfare  of  the  immigrant  as  well  as  general\npopulation, we cannot say the district courts abused their\ndiscretion in finding that the balance of equities and public\ninterest weigh in favor the injunction.\nG. Propriety of a Nationwide Injunction\nThe Northern District issued a preliminary injunction\nlimited to the territory of the plaintiff state and local entities\nbefore it.  The Eastern District issued a nationwide injunction,\nexplaining that a more limited injunction would not prevent\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g5e   4 P5a ogfe 4 475 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 45\nall  the  harms  alleged.    The  court  was  concerned  about\nprotecting immigrants from harm if they moved outside of the\nplaintiff jurisdictions, about the economic impact on plaintiff\nstates  if  immigrants  moved  to  them  to  evade  the\nconsequences of the Rule, and about lawful immigrants being\nsubject to the Rule at points of entry after travel abroad. \nWashington, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1223.\nThe appropriateness of nationwide injunctions in any case\nhas come under serious question.  See, e.g., DHS v. New York,\n140 S Ct. 599, 599–601 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring);\nTrump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424–29 (2018) (Thomas,\nJ.,  concurring).    In  explaining  the  limited  scope  of  its\ninjunction, the Second Circuit questioned the propriety of one\ncourt imposing its will on all:\nIt is not clear to us that, where contrary views\ncould be or have been taken by courts of\nparallel  or  superior  authority  entitled  to\ndetermine  the  law  within  their  own\ngeographical  jurisdictions,  the  court  that\nimposes the most sweeping injunction should\ncontrol the nationwide legal landscape.\nNew York, 969 F.3d at 88.\nWhatever the merits of nationwide injunctions in other\ncontexts,  we  conclude  a  nationwide  injunction  is  not\nappropriate in this case.  This is because the impact of the\nRule would fall upon all districts at the same time, and the\nsame issues regarding its validity have been and are being\nlitigated in multiple federal district and circuit courts.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g6e   4 P6a ogfe 4 476 of 47\n46 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nAccordingly,  we  vacate  that  portion  of  the  Eastern\nDistrict’s injunction making it applicable nationwide, but\notherwise affirm it.\nH. Rehabilitation Act\nThe plaintiffs also contend that the Rule violates the\nRehabilitation Act, which bans discrimination on the basis of\ndisabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The Seventh Circuit looked\nfavorably  on  this  contention,  and  the  Second  Circuit\nexpressly did not address it. Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d at 228,\nNew York, 969 F.3d at 64 n.20.  Because we have held that\nthe Rule violates the APA as contrary to law and arbitrary\nand capricious, we similarly do not address the Rehabilitation\nAct.\nI. Conclusion\nThe order of the District Court for the Northern District\nof California is AFFIRMED.  The order of the District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Washington is AFFIRMED in\npart and VACATED in part.  Costs are awarded to the\nplaintiffs.\nVANDYKE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nFor  the  reasons  ably  articulated  by  our  court  in  a\nDecember 2019 published opinion,1 by the Fourth Circuit in\n1 City & County of San Francisco v.

It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g5e   5 P oafg 4e7 5 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 5\nUnder 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A), any alien who, in the\nopinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, at the time of\napplication for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at\nany time to become a “public charge,” is inadmissible.  No\nstatute has ever defined the term.  In 1999, the Immigration\nand  Naturalization  Service  issued  guidance  (Guidance)\ndefining the term as one who “is or is likely to become\nprimarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”  The\nGuidance expressly excluded non-cash benefits intended to\nsupplement income.\nIn August 2019, the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) issued a rule (the Rule) that defines “public charge” to\ninclude those who are likely to participate, even for a limited\nperiod of time, in non-cash federal government assistance\nprograms.  The Rule defines the term “public charge” to\nmean “an alien who receives one or more [specified] public\nbenefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within\nany 36-month period.”   Inadmissibility on Public Charge\nGrounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  The Rule\nalso  directs  officials  to  consider  English  proficiency  in\nmaking the public charge determination.\nStates and municipalities brought suits in California and\nWashington,  asserting  claims  under  the  Administrative\nProcedure Act.  The District Court for the Northern District\nof California issued a preliminary injunction covering the\nterritory  of the plaintiffs, and the District Court for the\nEastern  District  of  Washington  issued  a  nationwide\ninjunction.  A divided motions panel of this court granted\nDHS’s motion for a stay of those injunctions pending appeal.\nThe  panel  first  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs  had\nestablished Article III standing.  The plaintiffs are states and\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g6e   6 P oafg 4e7 6 of 47\n6 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nmunicipalities that alleged that the Rule is causing them\ncontinuing financial harm, as lawful immigrants eligible for\nfederal cash, food, and housing assistance withdraw from\nthese programs and instead turn to state and local programs. \nThe panel concluded that this constituted sufficient injury. \nAddressing whether the injury is apparent or imminent, the\npanel explained that: 1) the Rule itself predicts a 2.5 percent\ndecrease  in  enrollment  in  federal  programs  and  a\ncorresponding reduction in Medicaid payments of over one\nbillion  dollars  per  year;  2)  the  Rule  acknowledges  that\ndisenrollment will cause other indirect financial harm to state\nand local entities; and 3) declarations in the record show that\nsuch entities are already experiencing disenrollment.\nNext, the panel concluded that the interest of the plaintiffs\nin preserving immigrants’ access to supplemental benefits is\nwithin the zone of interests protected by the “public charge”\nstatute.  The panel rejected DHS’s suggestion that only the\nfederal government and individuals seeking to immigrate are\nwithin the zone of interest.  The panel also rejected DHS’s\nsuggestion that the purpose of the public charge statute is to\nreduce  immigrants’  use  of  public  benefits.    Addressing\nDHS’s contention that the statute’s overall purpose is to\npromote self-sufficiency, the panel concluded that providing\naccess  to  better  health  care,  nutrition,  and  supplemental\nhousing benefits is consistent with precisely that purpose.  \nThe  panel  next  concluded  that  the  plaintiffs  had\ndemonstrated a high likelihood of success in showing that the\nRule is inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the\npublic charge statute and therefore contrary to law.  The\nplaintiffs pointed to repeated congressional reenactment of\nthe provision after it had been interpreted to mean long-term\ndependence on government support, noting that the statute\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g7e   7 P oafg 4e7 7 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 7\nhad never been interpreted to encompass temporary resort to\nsupplemental non-cash benefits.  The plaintiffs contended that\nthis  repeated  reenactment  amounted  to  congressional\nratification of the historically consistent interpretation.\nThe panel concluded that the history of the provision\nsupported the plaintiffs’ position, noting that: 1) from the\nVictorian Workhouse through the 1999 Guidance, the concept\nof becoming a “public charge” has meant dependence on\npublic  assistance  for  survival;  2)  the  term  had  never\nencompassed persons likely to make short-term use of in-kind\nbenefits that are neither intended nor sufficient to provide\nbasic sustenance; and 3) the Rule introduces a lack of English\nproficiency.  The panel also noted that the opinions of the\nSecond  Circuit  and  the  Seventh  Circuit,  in  affirming\npreliminary injunctions of the Rule, agreed that the Rule’s\ninterpretation  was  outside  any  historically  accepted  or\nsensible understanding of the term.  \nThe panel next concluded that the Rule’s promulgation\nwas arbitrary and capricious, explaining that DHS: 1) failed\nto adequately consider the financial effects of the Rule;\n2) failed to address concerns about the Rule’s effect on public\nsafety, health, and nutrition, as well its effect on hospital\nresources and vaccination rates in the general population; and\n3) failed to explain its abrupt change in policy from the 1999\nGuidance. \nThe panel also concluded that the remaining preliminary\ninjunction factors favored the plaintiffs. The panel explained\nthat the plaintiffs had established that they likely are bearing\nand will continue to bear heavy financial costs because of\nwithdrawal of immigrants from federal assistance programs\nand consequent dependence on state and local programs.  The\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a2g8e   8 P oafg 4e7 8 of 47\n8 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\npanel also observed that the public interest in preventing\ncontagion is particularly salient during the current global\npandemic, and noted the financial burdens on the plaintiffs\nand the adverse effects on the health and welfare of the\nimmigrant as well as general population.\nFinally, the panel concluded that a nationwide injunction\nwas not appropriate in this case because the impact of the\nRule would fall upon all districts at the same time, and the\nsame issues regarding its validity have been and are being\nlitigated  in  multiple  federal  district  and  circuit  courts. \nAccordingly, the panel vacated that portion of the District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Washington’s injunction\nmaking it applicable nationwide.\nDissenting, Judge VanDyke, wrote that for the reasons\nably articulated by this court in a December 2019 published\nopinion in this case, by the Fourth Circuit in CASA de\nMaryland, Inc. v.

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nOPINION\nSCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:\nThe  phrase  “public  charge”  enjoys  a  rich  history  in\nAnglo-American lore and literature, one more colorful than\nour American law on the subject.  There have been relatively\nfew published court decisions construing the phrase, even\nthough our immigration statutes have barred admission to\nimmigrants who are likely to become a “public charge” for\nmore  than  a  century.    Until  recently,  the  judicial  and\nadministrative  guidance  has  reflected  the  traditional\nconcept—rooted in the English Poor Laws and immortalized\nby Dickens in the workhouse of Oliver Twist—of incapacity\nand reliance on public support for subsistence.  The first\ncomprehensive federal immigration law barred entry to “any\nconvict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of\nhimself  or  herself  without  becoming  a  public  charge.” \nImmigration Act of 1882, 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2 (1882). \nThe 1999 Guidance (the Guidance) issued by the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service (INS), the predecessor of the\ncurrent agency, defined a “public charge” as one who “is or\nis likely to become primarily dependent on the government\nfor subsistence.”  See Field Guidance on Deportability and\nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg.\n28,689 (May 26, 1999).\nIn 2019, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\nchanged direction, however, and issued a rule (the Rule) that\ndefines the term to include those who are likely to participate,\neven  for  a  limited  period  of  time,  in  non-cash  federal\ngovernment assistance programs.  The programs designated\nby the Rule are not intended to provide for subsistence but\ninstead to supplement an individual’s ability to provide for\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a3g7e   1 P7a ogfe 4 177 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 17\nbasic  needs  such  as  food,  medical  care,  and  housing. \n8  C.F.R.  §  212.21(b).    Foreseeable  participation  for  an\naggregate of twelve months in any of the federal programs\nwithin a three-year span renders an immigrant inadmissible\nas a public charge and ineligible for permanent resident\nstatus.  § 212.21(a).  In other words, a single mother with\nyoung children who DHS foresees as likely to participate in\nthree of those programs for four months could not get a green\ncard.\nLitigation followed in multiple district courts against\nDHS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)\nas states and municipalities recognized that the immediate\neffect of the Rule would be to discourage immigrants from\nparticipating  in  such  assistance  programs,  even  though\nCongress has made them available to immigrants who have\nbeen in the country for five years.  According to the plaintiffs\nin  those  cases,  the  Rule’s  effect  would  be  to  increase\nassistance demands on state and local governments, as their\nresident immigrants’ overall health and welfare would be\nadversely affected by non-participation in federal assistance\nprograms.\nThe challenges to the Rule in the district courts resulted\nin a chorus of preliminary injunctions holding the Rule to be\ncontrary  to  law  and  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nThese included the two preliminary injunctions before us, one\nissued by the District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia (Northern District) covering the territory of the\nplaintiffs, and the other by the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Washington (Eastern District) purporting to apply\nnationwide.  Our court became the first federal appeals court\nto weigh in when we granted DHS’s motion for a stay of\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a3g8e   1 P8a ogfe 4 178 of 47\n18 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nthose injunctions pending appeal.  City and Cnty. of San\nFrancisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773, 781 (9th Cir. 2019). \nPreliminary injunctions were also issued by courts in the\nNorthern District of Illinois and the Southern District of New\nYork, and they were stayed by the United States Supreme\nCourt before appeals could be considered by the circuit courts\nof appeals.\n When the Seventh Circuit and the Second Circuit did\nconsider those preliminary injunction appeals, both courts\naffirmed the injunctions.  Although their reasoning differed\nin some respects, both circuits concluded that the Rule’s\ndefinition  was  both  outside  any  historic  or  commonly\nunderstood meaning of “public charge,” and arbitrary and\ncapricious,  in  concluding  that  short-term  reliance  on\nsupplemental benefits made immigrants dependent on public\nassistance within the meaning of the statutory public charge\nimmigration bar.  Cook Cnty., Ill. v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 208, 229,\n232–33 (7th Cir. 2020); New York v. DHS, 969 F.3d 42,\n80–81 (2nd Cir. 2020).  The Second Circuit opinion was\nunanimous, while a dissenting opinion in the Seventh Circuit\nagreed with DHS that those who receive such supplemental\nbenefits could be considered public charges because, by\nreceiving some assistance,  they are not completely  self-\nsufficient.  Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d at 250–51 (Barrett, J.,\ndissenting).\nThe district court in Maryland also enjoined enforcement\nof the Rule and was reversed by a divided decision of the\nFourth Circuit.  The majority looked in large measure to the\nfact that the Supreme Court had stayed the injunctions in the\nSeventh and Second Circuits.  CASA de Maryland, Inc. v.\nTrump, 971 F.3d 220, 230 (4th Cir. 2020).  In dissent, Judge\nKing viewed the Rule as outside the longstanding meaning of\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a3g9e   1 P9a ogfe 4 179 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 19\n“public charge” and would have affirmed the injunction.  He\nalso disagreed with the majority about the significance of the\nSupreme  Court’s  stay,  explaining  that  “[i]f  the  Court's\ndecision to grant a stay could be understood to effectively\nhand victory to the government regarding the propriety of a\npreliminary injunction, there would be little need for an\nintermediate appellate court to even consider the merits of an\nappeal in which the Court has granted a stay.”  Id. at 281 n.16\n(King, J., dissenting) (citing Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d at 234).\nTo  understand  the  reason  for  this  recent  cascade  of\nlitigation after a relatively quiescent statutory and regulatory\nhistory, we review the historical background of the Rule. \nSuch a review reveals the extent to which the Rule departs\nfrom past congressional and administrative policies.\nA. Statutory and Administrative Background\nThis country has had a federal statutory provision barring\nthe admission of persons likely to become a “public charge”\nsince 1882.  The Immigration Act of 1882 barred entry to,\namong others, “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person\nunable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a\npublic charge.”  The Immigration and Nationality Act now\nprovides that “[a]ny alien who, . . . in the opinion of the\n[Secretary of Homeland Security] at the time of application\nfor admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to\nbecome  a  public  charge  is  inadmissible.”    8  U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  No statute has ever defined the term. For\nover  a  century,  agencies  have  routinely  applied  these\nprovisions in determining admissibility and removal as well\nas in issuing visas for entry.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g0e   2 P0a ogfe 4 270 of 47\n20 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nIn 1996, however, Congress amended the statute to add\nfive factors for agencies to consider in determining whether\nan individual is likely to be a public charge: the non-citizen’s\nage; health; family status; assets, resources and financial\nstatus;  and  education  and  skills.    §  1182(a)(4)(B)(i). \nCongress also included a provision requiring applicants to\nproduce an affidavit of support.  See § 1182(a)(4)(C)–(D)\n(requiring  most  family-sponsored  immigrants  to  submit\naffidavits  of  support);  §  1183a  (affidavit  of  support\nrequirements).\nAt nearly the same time, Congress enacted major reforms\nof public benefit programs that, as relevant here, made only\nnon-citizens with five or more years of residency in the\nUnited  States  eligible  for  public  benefits  such  as\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and\nMedicaid.  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\nReconciliation Act (PRWORA), Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110\nStat. 2105, 2265 (1996).  Previously, lawful immigrants had\ngenerally been eligible for such benefits.  Congress thus\nsimultaneously reduced the number of immigrants eligible for\nthis assistance and spelled out the factors to be considered in\na  public  charge  determination.    The  fact  that  Congress\ndelineated  the  factors  relevant  to  the  public  charge\ndetermination at the same time it adjusted certain immigrants’\neligibility to receive specific supplemental assistance strongly\nsuggests that Congress did not intend for such assistance to be\nconsidered as one of the public charge factors.\nJudicial  guidance  in  interpreting  the  phrase  was\napparently not in need or demand: There are relatively few\nsuch decisions.  A leading early Supreme Court case resolved\nthe important question of whether the adverse economic\nconditions in the location where the immigrant intends to live\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g1e   2 P1a ogfe 4 271 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 21\ncan render an immigrant likely to become a “public charge.” \nGegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 (1915).  The Supreme Court’s\nanswer was no because the statute spoke to the permanent\ncharacteristics personal to the immigrant rather than to local\nlabor market conditions.  Id. at 10.  We followed Gegiow in\nEx parte Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913 (9th Cir. 1922), where we\nheld that a person temporarily in need of family assistance\nshould not have been excluded as likely to become a public\ncharge.  We so held because there was an absence of “any\nevidence whatever of mental or physical disability or any fact\ntending to show that the burden of supporting the appellant is\nlikely to be cast upon the public.”  Id. at 916.  Thus, our court\nin  Sakaguchi  understood  the  standard  for  determining\nwhether  someone  is  a  public  charge  to  be  whether  the\n“burden of support” falls on the public.\nAdministrative decisions followed the Supreme Court’s\nlead  by  looking  to  the  inherent  characteristics  of  the\nindividual rather than to external circumstances.  The Board\nof Immigration Appeals thus held that only an individual with\nthe inherent inability to be self-supporting is excludable as\n“likely to become a public charge” within the meaning of the\nstatute.  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I & N. Dec. 583, 589–90\n(BIA 1974); Matter of Vindman, 16 I. & N. Dec. 131, 132\n(B.I.A. 1977); see also New York, 969 F.3d at 69.  There has\nbeen corollary administrative recognition that even if an\nindividual has been on welfare, that fact does not in and of\nitself establish the requisite likelihood of becoming a public\ncharge.  An Attorney General decision collected authorities\nindicating that it is the totality of circumstances that must be\nconsidered in order to determine whether “the burden of\nsupporting the alien is likely to be cast on the public.”  Matter\nof Martinez-Lopez, 10 I & N. Dec. 409, 421–22 (BIA 1962;\nA.G. 1964) (citing Sakaguchi, 277 F. at 916).

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nof some public benefits does not automatically render an\nimmigrant a public charge because the public does not bear\nthe “burden of support.”\nThe  1996  amendments,  which  added  factors  to  be\nconsidered and created the current public charge statutory\nprovision, caused some confusion as to how big a change\nthey represented.  The INS, the agency then in charge of\nadministering immigration, decided a regulatory definition\nwould be helpful.  It adopted the 1999 Guidance, the first\nregulatory guidance to interpret the rather ancient notion of\n“public charge” in light of the myriad, modern forms of\npublic assistance.  64 Fed. Reg. 28,269.\nThe Guidance defined a “public charge” as a non-citizen\nwho depends on the government for survival, either by receipt\nof income or confinement in a public institution.  It described\npersons  “primarily  dependent  on  the  government  for\nsubsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public\ncash  assistance  for  income  maintenance  or\n(ii) institutionalization for long term care at government\nexpense.”  Id. at 28,689.  It thus embodied the traditional\nnotion of primary dependence on the government for either\nincome or institutional care.\nThe Guidance went on to identify the types of public\nassistance that would typically qualify as evidence of primary\ndependence:  (1)  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI);\n(2) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); (3)\nstate and local cash assistance programs; and (4) programs\nsupporting people institutionalized for long-term care.  Id. at\n28,692.  The Guidance expressly excluded non-cash benefits\nintended to supplement income and not to provide primary\nsupport.  The explanation lay with the changing times that\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g3e   2 P3a ogfe 4 273 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 23\nwere bringing benefits to more and more families to improve\ntheir health and welfare.  See id. (“[C]ertain federal, state, and\nlocal  benefits  are  increasingly  being  made  available  to\nfamilies with incomes far above the poverty level, reflecting\nbroad public policy decisions about improving general public\nhealth  and  nutrition,  promoting  education,  and  assisting\nworking-poor  families  in  the  process  of  becoming  self-\nsufficient.  Thus, participation in such non-cash programs is\nnot evidence of poverty or dependence.”).\nThe Guidance actually encouraged non-citizens to receive\nsupplemental benefits in order to improve their standard of\nliving and to promote the general health and welfare.  The\nGuidance drew a sharp distinction between the receipt of such\nsupplemental benefits and dependence on the government for\nsubsistence income that would render the individual a “public\ncharge.”  Id. at 28,692–93.\nThe 2019 Public Charge Rule we review in this case\neffectively  reversed  that  policy  by  making  receipt  of\nsupplemental benefits the very definition of a public charge. \nSee Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg.\n41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  The Rule defines the term “public\ncharge”  to  mean  “an  alien  who  receives  one  or  more\n[specified] public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the\naggregate  within  any  36-month  period  (such  that,  for\ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two\nmonths).”  Id. at 41,501.

The District Court Injunctions\nOn  appeal  are  two  district  court  decisions  granting\npreliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the Rule.  The\nNorthern District considered the challenges of California, the\nDistrict of Columbia, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Oregon,\nconsolidated with the challenges brought by the City and\nCounty of San Francisco, and the County of Santa Clara.  The\nEastern District heard the challenges brought by Washington,\nVirginia, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland,\nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey,\nNew Mexico, and Rhode Island.  Both district courts agreed\nthat the plaintiffs had standing because they had shown that\nthey would likely suffer economic harm and other costs and\nthat their concerns were within the zone of interests of the\nstatute.  Both held that the new definition of “public charge”\nwas likely not a permissible interpretation of the statute\nbecause  it  would  depart  from  the  longstanding,  settled\nunderstanding that a person does not become a public charge\nby receiving short-term aid, and must instead demonstrate an\ninherent incapacity to provide subsistence.  City and Cnty. of\nSan Francisco v. USCIS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1101 (N.D.\nCal. 2019), Washington v. DHS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1219\n(E.D. Wash. 2019).  Both found the Rule to be likely arbitrary\nand capricious because the agency failed to consider the\nburdens the Rule would impose on states and municipalities. \n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g5e   2 P5a ogfe 4 275 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 25\nThe Eastern District issued a nationwide injunction, and the\nNorthern District declined to do so.\nWithin a few weeks of the district court rulings, a divided\nmotions panel of this court, however, stayed both injunctions\npending this appeal.  City and Cnty. of SF, 944 F.3d 773.  The\npanel majority wrote that DHS was likely to prevail because\nthe  Rule  would  probably  be  viewed  as  a  reasonable\ninterpretation of a statute that had no consistent historical\napplication and gave the agency “considerable discretion.” \nId. at 796, 799.  Judge Owens dissented in part and would\nhave denied the stay.  Id. at 809–10 (Owens, J., dissenting).\nThe stay was based on a prediction of what this panel\nwould  hold  in  reviewing  the  merits  of  the  preliminary\ninjunctions.  The stay in this case was entered at a particularly\nearly point, less than two months after the district court\ninjunctions.  Almost none of the extensive documentation\nrelevant to this appeal was before the motions panel.  The\nbrief of the appellant DHS in the Northern District case had\nbeen filed only the day before the panel entered its stay, and\nthe opening brief in the Eastern District case was not filed\nuntil the day after.  Still to come were not only the answering\nand reply briefs in both appeals, but two dozen amicus briefs,\nmany of which we have found very helpful.\nAt least equally important, no other circuit court opinions\nhad yet considered the issues.  By now we have heard from\nthree.  One of those opinions even discussed and disagreed\nwith the reasoning of this court’s motions panel stay opinion,\npointing out that it “pinn[ed] the definition of ‘public charge’\non the form of public care provided” in concluding that there\nwas no consistent interpretation of the Rule.  New York,\n969 F.3d at 73 (emphasis in original).  The court there said\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g6e   2 P6a ogfe 4 276 of 47\n26 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nour motions panel thereby went “astray.”  Id.  This was\nbecause the issue was not whether a “public charge” had\nalways received similar assistance.  Id.  The issue should have\nbeen  whether  the  “inquiry”  under  the  statute  had  been\nconsistent.  Id.  The Second Circuit concluded the public\ncharge inquiry had always been whether the non-citizen “is\nlikely to depend on that [assistance] system.”  Id.\nWe therefore turn to the appeal before us.  We deal first\nwith DHS’s arguments that the plaintiffs may not maintain\nthe suit because they lack Article III standing or are outside\nthe zone of interests of the immigration statute in question.\nC. Plaintiffs’ Capacity to Maintain the Action\nPlaintiffs are states and municipalities that allege the Rule\nis causing them to suffer continuing financial harm, as lawful\nimmigrants  eligible  for  federal  cash,  food,  and  housing\nassistance withdraw from these programs to avoid the impact\nof the Rule.  Plaintiffs allege harm because such immigrants\nwill instead turn to assistance programs administered by the\nstate and local entities.\nDHS  argues  that  such  injuries  are  speculative  and\nrepresent only plausible future injury.  There is no question\nthat to have Article III standing to bring this action, the\nplaintiffs  must  allege  that  they  have  suffered,  or  will\nimminently suffer, a “concrete and particularized” injury in\nfact.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). \nThere is also no question that an increased demand for aid\nsupplied by the state and local entities would be such an\ninjury.  The only question is whether such demand is, as of\nyet, apparent or imminent.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g7e   2 P7a ogfe 4 277 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 27\nThat is not a difficult question to answer.  The Rule itself\npredicts a 2.5 percent decrease in enrollment in public benefit\nprograms  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in  Medicaid\npayments of over one billion dollars per year.  Final Rule,\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,302, 41,463.  The Rule itself further\nacknowledges that disenrollment will cause other indirect\nfinancial harm to state and local entities by increasing the\ndemand for uncompensated indigent care.  Declarations in the\nrecord  show  that  such  entities  are  already  experiencing\ndisenrollment as a result of the Rule.  See City and Cnty. of\nSF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1122.\nDHS nevertheless asserts that the Rule will result in a\nlong-term cost savings after states compensate for the loss of\nfederal funds by reforming their operations.  But such long-\nterm reforms would not remedy the immediate financial\ninjury to the plaintiffs or the harms to the health and welfare\nof  those  individuals  affected.    As  the  Second  Circuit\nexplained, “this simplistic argument fails to account for the\nfact that the States allege injuries that extend well beyond\nreduced Medicaid revenue and federal funding to the States,\nincluding an overall increase in healthcare costs that will be\nborne by public hospitals and general economic harms.”  New\nYork, 969 F.3d at 60.  Thus, plaintiffs have established Article\nIII standing.\nThose suing under the APA, must also establish that the\ninterest they assert is at least “arguably within the zone of\ninterests  to  be  protected  or  regulated  by  the  statute”  in\nquestion.  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi\nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012) (quoting Ass’n\nof Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150,\n153 (1970)).  The Supreme Court has described the test as\n“not  meant  to  be  especially  demanding”  and  as  “not\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g8e   2 P8a ogfe 4 278 of 47\n28 CITY & CTY.

Ass’n,  479  U.S.  388,  399–40  (1987)).    A\nplaintiff’s interest need only be “sufficiently congruent with\nthose of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not\n‘more  likely  to  frustrate  than  to  further  the  statutory\nobjectives.’”  First Nat. Bank & Tr. Co. v. Nat’l Credit Union\nAdmin., 988 F.2d 1272, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (quoting\nClarke, 479 U.S. at 397 n.12).\nThe statute in question is, of course, the immigration\nstatute  that  renders  inadmissible  an  individual  likely  to\nbecome a “public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  DHS\nappears to contend that the only entities within the zone of\ninterests are the federal government itself and individuals\nseeking  to  immigrate,  because  the  provision  deals  with\nimmigration  and  only  the  federal  government  controls\nimmigration.  If that were to define the zone of interests\nregulated by the statute, the scope of permissible immigration\nlitigation against the government would be so narrow as to\npractically insulate it from many challenges to immigration\npolicy and procedures, even those violating the Constitution\nor federal laws.\nDHS suggests that the purpose of the public charge\nexclusion is to reduce immigrants’ use of public benefits, and\nthat the plaintiffs’ suit therefore contradicts this purpose by\nseeking to make more federal benefits available.  But this\nassumes that Congress’s statutory purpose was the same as\nDHS’s purpose here, which is the very dispute before us.  As\nthe Second Circuit pointed out, “DHS assumes the merits of\nits own argument when it identifies the purpose of the public\ncharge ground as ensuring that non-citizens do not use public\nbenefits . . . . Understood in context, [the public charge bar’s]\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a4g9e   2 P9a ogfe 4 279 of 47\nCITY & CTY.

USCIS 29\npurpose is to exclude where appropriate and to not exclude\nwhere  exclusion  would  be  inappropriate.”)    New  York,\n969 F.3d at 62–63.\nMoreover,  DHS  maintains  that  the  statute’s  overall\npurpose is to promote self-sufficiency.  Providing access to\nbetter  health  care,  nutrition  and  supplemental  housing\nbenefits is consistent with precisely that purpose.  See Cook\nCnty., 962 F.3d at 220 (access to affordable basic health care\nmay  promote  self-sufficiency);  Hilary  Hoynes,  Diane\nWhitmore  Schanzenbach  &  Douglas  Almond,  Long-Run\nImpacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net, 106 Am.\nEcon.  Rev.  903,  921  (2016)  (access  to  food  stamps  in\nchildhood significantly increases economic self-sufficiency\namong women).  For these reasons, the interests of the\nplaintiffs in preserving immigrants’ access to supplemental\nbenefits is within the zone of interests protected by the\nstatute.\nWe therefore conclude that the district courts correctly\ndetermined that the plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this\naction.  All of the circuits to consider the validity of this Rule\nhave reached a similar conclusion.  See Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d\nat 219–20, CASA de Maryland, 971 F.3d at 240–241, New\nYork, 969 F.3d at 62–63.  We now turn to the question\nwhether they were entitled to the preliminary injunctions\nentered by the district courts.\nD.  Contrary to Law\nBoth district courts concluded that the plaintiffs are likely\nto  prevail  in  their  contention  that  the  Rule  violates  the\nstatute’s public charge provision, and that such a conclusion\nsupports the entry of preliminary injunctions.  See Winter v.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g0e   3 P0a ogfe 4 370 of 47\n30 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  On\nappeal, DHS contends, as it has throughout the litigation, that\nthe Rule is a permissible interpretation of the statute.  The\nplaintiffs maintain that the Rule violates the statute because\nthe Rule is not a reasonable interpretation of the meaning of\n“public charge.”\nHistory is a strong pillar supporting the plaintiffs’ case. \nPlaintiffs point to repeated congressional reenactment of the\nprovision after it had been interpreted to mean long-term\ndependence on government support, and had never been\ninterpreted to encompass temporary resort to supplemental\nnon-cash  benefits.    Plaintiffs  contend  that  this  repeated\nreenactment amounts to congressional  ratification of the\nhistorically consistent interpretation.  DHS disagrees, arguing\nthat the repeated reenactments reflect congressional intent to\nhave a flexible standard subject to various executive branch\ninterpretations.\nOur review of the history of the provision in our law\nsuggests the plaintiffs have the better part of this dispute. \nFrom the Victorian Workhouse through the 1999 Guidance,\nthe  concept  of  becoming  a  “public  charge”  has  meant\ndependence on public assistance for survival.  Up until the\npromulgation  of  this  Rule,  the  concept  has  never\nencompassed persons likely to make short-term use of in-kind\nbenefits that are neither intended nor sufficient to provide\nbasic sustenance.  The Rule also, for the first time, introduces\na lack of English proficiency as figuring into the equation,\ndespite  the  common  American  experience  of  children\nlearning English in the public schools and teaching their\nelders  in  our  urban  immigrant  communities.    8  C.F.R.\n§ 212.22(b)(5)(ii)(D).  Indeed, in Gegiow, 239 U.S. 3, the\nSupreme Court found that the individuals in that case were\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g1e   3 P1a ogfe 4 371 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 31\nnot likely to become public charges even though they spoke\nonly Russian.\nIn New York, 969 F.3d 42, the Second Circuit essentially\nagreed  with  plaintiffs’  historical  analysis.    The  court\nrecognized and explained the line of settled judicial and\nadministrative interpretations of a public charge as one who\nis primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  Id.\nat 65–70.  The court traced that history in far more detail than\nwe have outlined and was “convinced” that there was a well-\nsettled meaning of “public charge” even before congressional\npassage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act (IIRIRA) in 1996, and that was a person\n“unable to support herself, either through work, savings, or\nfamily ties.”  Id. at 71.  Receipt of cash benefits may be\nconsidered in deciding whether a person is dependent on the\ngovernment but has never been determinative.  The Second\nCircuit persuasively summarized:\nThe Plaintiffs do not argue, and we do not\nhold,  that  the  receipt  of  various  kinds  of\npublic  benefits  is  irrelevant  to  the\ndetermination  of  whether  a  non-citizen  is\nlikely  to  become  a  public  charge.    But\ndefining public charge to mean the receipt,\neven for a limited period, of any of a wide\nrange of public benefits – particularly . . . ones\nthat  are  designed  to  supplement  an\nindividual's  or  family's  efforts  to  support\nthemselves,  rather  than  to  deal  with  their\nlikely  permanent  inability  to  do  so  –  is\ninconsistent with the traditional understanding\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g2e   3 P2a ogfe 4 372 of 47\n32 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nof what it means to be a “public charge,”\nwhich was well-established by 1996.\nId. at 78 (emphasis removed).\nA few months earlier, the Seventh Circuit had come to a\nsimilar  conclusion  that  the  Rule  violates  the  statutory\nmeaning of public charge.  Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d 208.  The\nSeventh Circuit differed somewhat in its analysis.  After a\nhistorical survey of court decisions and secondary sources, it\ndetermined that the phrase “public charge” was susceptible to\nvarious interpretations.  Id. at 226.  It concluded, however,\nthat DHS’s interpretation, quantifying the definition to mean\nreceipt of twelve months’ worth of benefits within three\nyears, represented an understanding of its authority to define\nthe phrase that “has no natural limitation.”  Id. at 228–29.  If\nDHS’s  interpretation  were  to  be  accepted,  then  there  is\nnothing in the statutory text that would prevent a zero-\ntolerance rule, where foreseeable receipt of a single benefit on\none occasion would bar entry or adjustment of status.  The\nmajority forcefully rejected such an interpretation, stating:\nWe  see  no  warrant  in  the  Act  for  this\nsweeping view.  Even assuming that the term\n“public charge” is ambiguous and thus might\nencompass more than institutionalization or\nprimary,  long-term  dependence  on  cash\nbenefits,  it  does  violence  to  the  English\nlanguage and the statutory context to say that\nit  covers  a  person  who  receives  only  de\nminimis benefits for a de minimis period of\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g3e   3 P3a ogfe 4 373 of 47\nCITY & CTY.

There is a floor inherent in the words\n“public charge,” backed up by the weight of\nhistory.\nId. at 229.\nAlthough the opinions of the Second Circuit in New York\nand  the  Seventh  Circuit  in  Cook  County  reflect  some\ndisagreement  over  whether  there  was  any  historically\nestablished meaning of the phrase “public charge,” they\nagreed that the Rule’s interpretation of the statute was outside\nany historically accepted or sensible understanding of the\nterm.  In commenting on the difference between its historical\nreview in New York and that of the Seventh Circuit in Cook\nCounty, the Second Circuit noted that the Seventh Circuit had\nnot  included  the  significant    administrative  rulings  that\npreceded the 1996 statute.  New York, 969 F.3d at 74.\nThe New York opinion was unanimous, but the Cook\nCounty opinion was not.  The lengthy dissenting opinion in\nCook County focused on other statutory provisions aimed at\npreventing entry of persons who could become dependent on\nthe government.  The most significant of these provisions is\nthe  requirement  that  family-sponsored  immigrants,  and\nemployment-sponsored immigrants whose employment is\ntied to a family member, must furnish an affidavit from the\nsponsor.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(C)–(D).  In the affidavit, the\nsponsor  must  agree  to  support  the  immigrant  at  annual\nincome of at least 125 percent of the poverty level and pay\nback  the  relevant  governmental  entity  in  the  event  the\nimmigrant  receives  “any  means-tested  public  benefit.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(b).\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g4e   3 P4a ogfe 4 374 of 47\n34 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nThe dissent focused on the fact that the affidavit provision\nforces sponsors to bear responsibility for “any means-tested\npublic benefit” that an immigrant may receive.  It concluded\nthat the affidavit provision reflects Congress’s view that\n“public charge” may encompass receipt of supplemental\nbenefits as well as primary dependence.  See Cook Cnty.,\n962 F.3d at 246 (Barrett, J., dissenting).\nIn its focus on the provisions in a related but different\nsection  of  the  statute,  the  dissent  did  not  address  the\nsignificance of the history of the public charge provision\nitself, nor did it address  the majority’s objection  to the\nduration of the receipt of benefits as a standard having no\nlimiting principle.  The dissent concluded only that the choice\nof an aggregate of twelve months is “not unreasonable.”  Id.\nat 253.  Moreover, the dissent’s interpretation of the affidavit\nrequirement’s application here seems to suggest that it would\napprove a public charge rule excluding  individuals  who\nreceived “any means-tested benefit,” no matter how small, as\nin line with congressional intent.\nIn this appeal, DHS also relies upon the affidavit of\nsupport provisions to contend that the Rule is consistent with\nthe statutory public charge bar.  The public charge bar and\naffidavit of support provisions were parts of two separate\nacts.  The two have no historic or functional relationship to\neach other.  The public charge bar dates back to the 19th\ncentury, embodying an age-old concept of excluding those\nwho may become primarily dependent on the government. \nCongress enacted the affidavit of support provision, however,\nin 1996 as part of more recent specific immigration reforms\nincluding  the  financial  responsibilities  of  families  and\nemployers sponsoring individual immigrants.

USCIS 35\n104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996).  The section of the affidavit\nprovision that refers to public benefits serves as a post-\nadmission remedy to help local and federal governments\nrecoup funds.  § 1183a(b).  The changes to the affidavit\nprovisions were aimed at problems with the unenforceability\nof such affidavits prior to 1996.  Michael J. Sheridan, The\nNew Affidavit of Support and Other 1996 Amendments to\nImmigration and Welfare Provisions Designed to Prevent\nAliens from Becoming Public Charges, 31 Creighton L. Rev.\n741, 743-44, 752-53 (1998) (article by INS Associate General\nCounsel).\nDHS also points to the provision that permits entry of\nbattered women without regard to receipt of “any benefits.” \nSee 8  U.S.C. §  1182(s).    DHS argues  that  this reflects\nCongress’s belief that the receipt of any public benefits would\nbe a consideration in admission for most other public charge\ndeterminations.  Had Congress intended to make non-cash\nbenefits a factor for admission or permanent residence, it\nwould have done so directly and not through this ancillary\nprovision.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S.\n457,  468  (2001)  (Congress  does  not  “hide  elephants  in\nmouseholes”).  It is more likely that Congress created this\nprovision  in  order  to  provide  sweeping  protections  for\nbattered migrant women, as it did throughout Section 1182. \nSee § 1182(a)(6)(ii), (a)(9)(B)(iii)(IV).\nFor  these  reasons  we  conclude  the  plaintiffs  have\ndemonstrated a high likelihood of success in showing that the\nRule is inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the\nstatutory public charge bar and therefore is contrary to law.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g6e   3 P6a ogfe 4 376 of 47\n36 CITY & CTY.

The APA standard in this regard is inherently\ndeferential.  The task of the courts is to ensure that the\nagency’s  action  relied  on  appropriate  considerations,\nconsidered all important aspects of the issue, and provided an\nadequate explanation for its decision.

The Court explained the general rule:\nNormally, an agency rule would be arbitrary\nand capricious if the agency has relied on\nfactors which Congress has not intended it to\nconsider,  entirely  failed  to  consider  an\nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an\nexplanation for its decision that runs counter\nto the evidence before the agency, or is so\nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a\ndifference in view or the product of agency\nexpertise.\nId. at 43.\nThe plaintiffs argue that DHS failed the test in three\nprincipal respects: It failed to take into account the costs the\nRule would impose on state and local governments; it did not\nconsider the adverse effects on health, including both the\nhealth of immigrants who might withdraw from programs and\nthe overall health of the community; and it did not adequately\nexplain why it was changing the policy that was thoroughly\nexplained in the 1999 Guidance.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g7e   3 P7a ogfe 4 377 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 37\n1. Disenrollment and Financial Costs\nWe first turn to DHS’s consideration of the financial\nimpact of the proposed Rule.  During the comment period,\nthere was repeated emphasis on the financial burdens that\nwould befall state and local governments because immigrants\nfearing application of the Rule would disenroll from the\nsupplemental programs, even if the Rule did not apply to\nthem.  DHS’s response was a generality coupled with an\nexpression of uncertainty.  It said that, despite these effects,\nthe  Rule’s  “overriding  consideration”  of  self-sufficiency\nformed “a sufficient basis to move forward.”  84 Fed. Reg. at\n41,312.  DHS added that there was no way of knowing with\nany  degree  of  exactitude  how  many  individuals  would\ndisenroll or how much of a burden it would place on the state\nand local governments.  Id. at 41,312–13.\nDHS provided no analysis of the effect of the Rule on\ngovernmental entities like the plaintiffs in these cases.  As the\nNorthern  District  found,  DHS  had  not  “grapple[d]  with\nestimates and credible data explained in the comments.”  City\nand Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1106.\nOur  law  requires  more  from  an  agency.    A  bald\ndeclaration  of  an  agency’s  policy  preferences  does  not\ndischarge its duty to engage in “reasoned decisionmaking”\nand “explain the evidence which is available.”  State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 52.  The record before DHS was replete with\ndetailed information about, and projections of, disenrollment\nand associated financial costs to state and local governments. \nSee, e.g., Ninez Ponce, Laurel Lucia, & Tia Shimada, How\nProposed Changes to the ‘Public Charge’ Rule Will Affect\nHealth, Hunger and the Economy in California, 32 (Nov.\n2018),  https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/newsroom/Documents/\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g8e   3 P8a ogfe 4 378 of 47\n38 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\n2018/public-charge-seminar-slides-nov2018.pdf (estimating\nover 300,000 disenrollments from Medicaid in California\nalone); Fiscal Policy Institute, Only Wealthy Immigrants\nNeed  Apply:  The  Chilling  Effects  of  “Public  Charge,”\n5 (Nov. 2019), http://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2\n019/11/FINAL-FPI-Public-Charge-2019-MasterCopy.pdf\n(estimating over $500 million combined in lost state tax\nrevenue).  DHS was required to “reasonably reflect upon” and\n“grapple with” such evidence.  Fred Meyers Stores, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 865 F.3d 630, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  But DHS made\nno attempt to quantify the financial costs of the Rule or\ncritique the projections offered.\nSimilarly, DHS’s repeated statements that the Rule’s\ndisenrollment impacts are “difficult to predict” do not satisfy\nits duty to “examine the relevant data” before it.  State Farm,\n463 U.S. at 43.  The Supreme Court held in State Farm that\nan agency may not, without analysis, cite even “‘substantial\nuncertainty’ . . . as a justification for its actions.”  Id. at 52;\nsee also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA, 538 F.3d\n1172,  1200  (9th  Cir.  2008)  (rejecting  as  arbitrary  and\ncapricious  agency’s  characterization  of  greenhouse  gas\nreductions as “too uncertain to support their explicit valuation\nand inclusion” in analysis).  DHS’s analysis thus fell short of\nthe  standard  established  by  the  Supreme  Court  and\nrecognized by our circuit.  DHS did not adequately deal with\nthe financial effects of the Rule.\n2. Health Consequences\nAlthough DHS wrote the Rule was intended to make\nimmigrants healthier and stronger, commenters stressed the\nRule’s likely adverse health consequences for immigrants and\nthe public as a whole, including infectious disease outbreaks\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a5g9e   3 P9a ogfe 4 379 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 39\nand hospital closures.  While acknowledging these comments,\nDHS  concluded,  without  support,  that  the  Rule  “will\nultimately strengthen public safety, health, and nutrition.” \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314.  The Northern District aptly found\nthat DHS impermissibly “simply declined to engage with\ncertain, identified public-health consequences of the Rule.” \nCity and Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1111–12.\nCommenters provided substantial evidence that the Rule\nwould in fact harm public safety, health, and nutrition.  DHS\nitself repeatedly  acknowledged that hospitals  might face\nfinancial harms as a result of the Rule, but DHS repeatedly\ndeclined  to  quantify,  assess,  or  otherwise  deal  with  the\nproblem in any meaningful way.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at\n41,313–14, 41,384, 41,475, 41,476.  This is inadequate and\nsuggests that DHS’s position was intractable.  As the D.C.\nCircuit has observed, making some mention of evidence but\nthen coming to a contrary, “unsupported and conclusory”\ndecision “add[s] nothing to the agency’s defense of its thesis\nexcept perhaps the implication that it was committed to its\nposition regardless of any facts to the contrary.”  Chem. Mfrs.\nAss’n. v. EPA, 28 F.3d 1259, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  DHS\nresponded by excluding certain programs for children and\npregnant women from the ambit of the Rule, but never\naddressed the larger concerns about the Rule’s effect on\nhealth as well as on hospital resources.\nThere were other serious health concerns.  For example,\ncomments demonstrated that the Rule would endanger public\nhealth  by  decreasing  vaccination  rates  in  the  general\npopulation.    DHS  insisted  that  vaccines  would  “still  be\navailable” to Medicaid-disenrolled individuals because “local\nhealth centers and state health departments” would pick up\nthe slack, id. at 41,385, despite objections voiced by such\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g0e   4 P0a ogfe 4 470 of 47\n40 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nlocal health centers and state health departments themselves\nshowing  that  the  Rule  will  put  the  populations  they\nserve—citizens and non-citizens alike—in danger.  See, e.g.,\nMass. Dep’t of Pub. Health, Comments on Inadmissibility on\nPublic Charge Grounds (Dec. 2018), https://www.regulations.\ngov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-45697; Hilltown Cmty.\nHealth Ctr., Comments on Inadmissibility on Public Charge\nGrounds (Dec. 2018), https://www.regulations.gov/docume\nnt?D=USCIS-2010-0012-45675.    A  decision  that  “runs\ncounter to the evidence” or “is so implausible that it could not\nbe ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency\nexpertise” is arbitrary and capricious.  State Farm, 463 U.S.\nat 43.  The promulgation of this Rule is such a decision.  DHS\nclaims no expertise in public health, unlike the scores of\nexpert commenters who weighed in against the Rule.\n3. Reversal of Position\nAbove all, DHS failed to explain its abrupt change in\npolicy from the 1999 Guidance.  An agency reversing a prior\npolicy “must show that there are good reasons for the new\npolicy”  and  provide  “a  reasoned  explanation  .  .  .  for\ndisregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were\nengendered by the prior policy.”  FCC v. Fox Television\nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515–16 (2009).  The district\ncourts  below  found  that  DHS  had  failed  to  satisfy  this\nstandard.  City and Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1111–12;\nWashington v. DHS, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1220.\nThe  1999  Guidance  had  been  issued  after  the  1996\nstatutory amendments setting out the general factors to be\ntaken into account in making a public charge determination. \nThe Guidance considered all of the different types of public\nassistance  governments  offered,  including  programs\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g1e   4 P1a ogfe 4 471 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 41\nproviding  subsistence  income  and  those  providing\nsupplemental benefits.  The Guidance expressly provided that\nreceipt of supplemental assistance for food, healthcare and\nhousing  were  not  to  be  considered  in  assessing  an\nimmigrant’s likelihood of becoming a public charge.  As\ndiscussed above, this provision was consistent with over a\ncentury of judicial and administrative decisions interpreting\nthe public charge bar.  The Rule, however, provides that the\nprospect of receiving those same supplemental benefits, for\neven a few months, renders an individual inadmissible.  This\nis directly contrary to the 1999 Guidance.\nYet DHS promulgated the Rule without any explanation\nof why the facts found, and the analysis provided, in the prior\nGuidance were now unsatisfactory.  This is a practice the\nSupreme Court has rejected: an agency about-face with no\n“reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding” the findings\nunderlying the prior policy.  Fox, 556 U.S. at 516.  Here is an\nillustration of the about-face.  The 1999 Guidance had found\nthat deterring acceptance of “important health and nutrition\nbenefits” had yielded “an adverse impact . . . on public health\nand the general welfare.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. In contrast,\nDHS now says that the new Rule “will ultimately strengthen\npublic safety, health, and nutrition.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314. \nDHS provides no basis for this conclusion or for its departure\nfrom the empirical assessments underlying the prior policy.\nIn light of this policy change, coupled with the “serious\nreliance  interests”  engendered  by  over  two  decades  of\nreliance on the Guidance, DHS was required to provide a\n“more detailed justification” for the Rule.  Fox, 556 U.S.\nat 515.  DHS provides no justification, other than the repeated\nconclusory mantra that the new policy will encourage self-\nsufficiency.    DHS  in  effect  says  that  by  creating  a\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g2e   4 P2a ogfe 4 472 of 47\n42 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\ndisincentive for immigrants to use available assistance, the\nRule  will  “ensur[e]  that  [admitted  immigrants]  be  self-\nsufficient and not reliant on public resources.”  84 Fed. Reg.\nat 41,319.  DHS does not substantiate, and the record does not\nsupport, this empirical prediction.  See, e.g., Hilary Hoynes,\nDiane Whitmore Schanzenbach & Douglas Almond, Long-\nRun Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net, 106 Am.\nEcon. Rev. 903, 930 (finding that having access to food\nstamps during childhood leads to “significant improvement\nin adult health” and “increases in economic self-sufficiency,”\nincluding decreased welfare participation).  Plaintiffs urge\nthat their experience is contrary to DHS’s conclusion.  Also\nto the contrary is the experience related in multiple amicus\nbriefs.  See, e.g., Brief for the Institute for Policy Integrity as\nAmicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners at 9 (citing evidence\nthat reductions in SNAP participation increase homelessness);\nBrief for National Housing Law Project et al. as Amici Curiae\nSupporting Petitioners at 13 (citing evidence that Medicaid\nmade it easier for recipients to work and find work).\n4. Arbitrary and Capricious\nIn  sum,  DHS  adopted  the  Rule,  reversing  prior,\nlongstanding public policy, without adequately taking into\naccount its potential adverse effects on the public fisc and the\npublic  welfare.    We  must  conclude  that  the  Rule’s\npromulgation was arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary\nto law within the meaning of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g3e   4 P3a ogfe 4 473 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 43\nF. Remaining Injunction Factors\n1. Irreparable Harm\nPlaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their claim that the Rule violates the standards of\nthe APA in that it is both contrary to law and arbitrary and\ncapricious.  To support entry of an injunction, Plaintiffs must\nalso show a likely threat of irreparable injury in the absence\nof an injunction.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  Plaintiffs have\nestablished that they likely are bearing and will continue to\nbear  heavy  financial  costs  because  of  withdrawal  of\nimmigrants from federal assistance programs and consequent\ndependence on state and local programs.\nThere is no dispute that such economic harm is sufficient\nto constitute irreparable harm because of the unavailability of\nmonetary damages.  See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558,\n581 (9th Cir. 2018); 5 U.S.C. § 702 (providing for relief\n“other than monetary damages”).  DHS counters that such\nharm in this case is speculative, amounting to no more than\nthe possibility of future injury.  See Park Vill. Apartment\nTenants Ass’n v. Mortimer Howard Tr., 636 F.3d 1150, 1160\n(9th Cir. 2011).\nWe have, however, already seen that in this case such\nharm is more than speculative.  Plaintiffs have presented\nevidence that they are already experiencing harm and DHS\nitself has projected significant disenrollment from federal\nprograms, likely leading to enrollments in state and local\nones.  The district courts both made factual findings as to\nharm that DHS does not refute with citations to the record.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g4e   4 P4a ogfe 4 474 of 47\n44 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\n2. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\nThere was no error in finding that the balance of equities\nand public interest support an injunction.  The Northern\nDistrict pointed to the need for “continuing the provision of\nmedical  services  through  Medicaid  to  those  who  would\npredictably disenroll absent an injunction” in light of the\nexplanations given by “parties and numerous amici . . . [of\nthe] adverse health consequences not only to those who\ndisenroll, but to the entire populations of the plaintiff states,\nfor example, in the form of decreased vaccination rates.”  City\nand Cnty. of SF, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1127.  The public interest\nin preventing contagion is particularly salient during the\ncurrent global pandemic.\nAlthough DHS nevertheless argues that it is harmed by\nnot being able to implement its new definition of public\ncharge, if it is ultimately successful in defending the merits of\nthe Rule, the harm will amount to no more than a temporary\nextension of the law previously in effect for decades.  Given\nthe  financial  burdens  that  plaintiffs  have  persuasively\ndemonstrated will befall them as a result of disenrollment\nfrom federal programs, coupled with adverse effects on the\nhealth  and  welfare  of  the  immigrant  as  well  as  general\npopulation, we cannot say the district courts abused their\ndiscretion in finding that the balance of equities and public\ninterest weigh in favor the injunction.\nG. Propriety of a Nationwide Injunction\nThe Northern District issued a preliminary injunction\nlimited to the territory of the plaintiff state and local entities\nbefore it.  The Eastern District issued a nationwide injunction,\nexplaining that a more limited injunction would not prevent\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g5e   4 P5a ogfe 4 475 of 47\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 45\nall  the  harms  alleged.    The  court  was  concerned  about\nprotecting immigrants from harm if they moved outside of the\nplaintiff jurisdictions, about the economic impact on plaintiff\nstates  if  immigrants  moved  to  them  to  evade  the\nconsequences of the Rule, and about lawful immigrants being\nsubject to the Rule at points of entry after travel abroad. \nWashington, 408 F. Supp. 3d at 1223.\nThe appropriateness of nationwide injunctions in any case\nhas come under serious question.  See, e.g., DHS v. New York,\n140 S Ct. 599, 599–601 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring);\nTrump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424–29 (2018) (Thomas,\nJ.,  concurring).    In  explaining  the  limited  scope  of  its\ninjunction, the Second Circuit questioned the propriety of one\ncourt imposing its will on all:\nIt is not clear to us that, where contrary views\ncould be or have been taken by courts of\nparallel  or  superior  authority  entitled  to\ndetermine  the  law  within  their  own\ngeographical  jurisdictions,  the  court  that\nimposes the most sweeping injunction should\ncontrol the nationwide legal landscape.\nNew York, 969 F.3d at 88.\nWhatever the merits of nationwide injunctions in other\ncontexts,  we  conclude  a  nationwide  injunction  is  not\nappropriate in this case.  This is because the impact of the\nRule would fall upon all districts at the same time, and the\nsame issues regarding its validity have been and are being\nlitigated in multiple federal district and circuit courts.\n\nCase 4C:1a9s-ec:v -1095-211702-1R3M, 1P2 / 0  2E/C20F2 N0o, .I D2:7 101  9  1fi1le9d7 172, /D0k2t/E2n0t r  y :P 1a3g7e-I1D,. 6P3a6g6e   4 P6a ogfe 4 476 of 47\n46 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nAccordingly,  we  vacate  that  portion  of  the  Eastern\nDistrict’s injunction making it applicable nationwide, but\notherwise affirm it.\nH. Rehabilitation Act\nThe plaintiffs also contend that the Rule violates the\nRehabilitation Act, which bans discrimination on the basis of\ndisabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The Seventh Circuit looked\nfavorably  on  this  contention,  and  the  Second  Circuit\nexpressly did not address it. Cook Cnty., 962 F.3d at 228,\nNew York, 969 F.3d at 64 n.20.  Because we have held that\nthe Rule violates the APA as contrary to law and arbitrary\nand capricious, we similarly do not address the Rehabilitation\nAct.\nI. Conclusion\nThe order of the District Court for the Northern District\nof California is AFFIRMED.  The order of the District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Washington is AFFIRMED in\npart and VACATED in part.  Costs are awarded to the\nplaintiffs.\nVANDYKE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nFor  the  reasons  ably  articulated  by  our  court  in  a\nDecember 2019 published opinion,1 by the Fourth Circuit in\n1 City & County of San Francisco v.
