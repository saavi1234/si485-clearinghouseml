    "summary": "<p>This case challenged President Trump's use of presidential emergency powers to allocate funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. </p><p>On February 20, 2019, El Paso County of Texas and Border Network for Human Rights, Inc. filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued President Trump and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Interior, and Treasury for unlawfully funding barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The plaintiffs, represented by The Protect Democracy Project, Niskanen Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, and others, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the defendants from taking any action under the President’s Proclamation of February 15, 2019, which declared a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border. </p><p>Specifically, the complaint alleged that President Trump exerted power beyond constitutional and statutory limits by seeking to allocate funds for a border wall that Congress did not appropriate. On February 2019, Congress passed the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which allocated $1.375 billion in funding for fencing in specific locations along the southern border. President Trump then issued the Proclamation in order to access additional funds for the construction of a border wall under the National Emergencies Act (“NEA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., citing 10 U.S.C. § 2808, the military construction statute, as a funding source. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated the Constitution by usurping Congress' exclusive power to appropriate funds, the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 <i>et seq.</i>) by implementing the Proclamation in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and the NEA itself because no national emergency existed.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 25, 2019, which emphasized the plaintiffs' allegations that the Proclamation would harm El Paso County's tourism and economic development. On the same day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction. The defendants also filed a motion for summary judgment on June 10, 2019, claiming, among other things, that the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to satisfy APA requirements for review of agency action. </p><p>The court (Judge David Briones) granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction and denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on October 11, 2019. The court determined that the plaintiffs had standing and the Proclamation was invalid as a matter of law; it also asked the plaintiffs to submit a proposal for injunctive relief. 408 F. Supp 3d 840. </p><p>On December 10, 2019, Judge Briones granted a permanent injunction against the use of funds appropriated for “military construction” under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 for border wall construction. The Court also declared the Proclamation unlawful. 407 F. Supp. 3d 655. On the same day, the defendants filed a notice of appeal. The defendants filed a motion to stay the permanent injunction, pending appeal, on December 16, 2019. Judge Briones denied the motion the next day.</p><p>This case is ongoing. </p>",

The \nplan began with President Trump’s declaration of a “national emergency” at the southern border \nunder the National Emergencies Act (NEA).  And it continued with the invocation of two other \nstatutes that supposedly authorize wall funding.  Both elements of this plan are egregiously \nunlawful.\nBegin with the emergency declaration.  Courts construe statutory terms in accordance with \ntheir ordinary meaning, and the word “emergency” means an unforeseen circumstance calling for \nimmediate action.  The current situation at the southern border does not come close to fitting within \nthis definition:  the President’s emergency declaration itself acknowledges that the issue of \nunlawful immigration is “long-standing,” and Congress has rejected the notion that it requires \nimmediate action in the form of a border wall.  In truth, President Trump has declared a faux \nemergency because he could not achieve the result he wanted through the legislative process.  The \ngovernment’s principal argument in response to this point has been the following:  because the \nNEA  does  not  define  “emergency,”  it  must  grant  the  President  unreviewable  discretion  to \ndetermine when an emergency exists.  If adopted, that reading of the statute would render it \nunconstitutional, in violation of the non-delegation doctrine.  That reading should accordingly be \navoided.\nNext take the second part of Defendants’ border-wall plan.  Setting aside the NEA, \nDefendants invoke two obscure statutes that they say enable them to spend congressionally \nappropriated funds on a border wall.  But by their terms, neither of the statutes they invoke comes \nclose  to  authorizing  such  expenditures.    That  should  be  no  surprise,  since  government \ninterpretations are usually flawed where, as here, an agency suddenly finds an expansive power in \n1\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 13 of 64\na long-dormant statutory provision. \nIn the end, Defendants’ actions amount to a brazen attempt to defy statutory text and \narrogate legislative power to themselves.  The separation of powers, however, “establish[es] high \nwalls and clear distinctions.”  Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 239 (1995).  After all, \nthe “[c]oncentration of power in the hands of a single branch” is “the very definition of tyranny.”  \nClinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 450 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting The \nFederalist No. 47 (James Madison)).  To vindicate these principles, the Judiciary must deploy its \npower to “say what the law is” and rebuke Defendants’ Executive power grab.  Marbury v. \nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). \n2\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 14 of 64\nSTATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS \nA. For Decades, Congress Addresses Border Security \nThe issue of unlawful immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border is not new, and it has \nnot been lost on Congress.  In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-554-55, appropriating $12 \nmillion for construction of border fencing near San Diego, California.  A decade later, it added \nnew fencing in discrete border areas of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  SeePub. L. \nNo. 104-208; 8 U.S.C. § 1103.  From 2007-2008, Congress appropriated over $3 billion for border \nsecurity  infrastructure  and  technology.    See H.R.  5441,  109th  Cong.  (2007);  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 110-161, 121 Stat. 1844, 2094 (2008).  And in 2018, Congress \nappropriated $1.5 billion for “[p]rocurement, construction, and improvements” in particular areas \nalong the southern border.  H.R. 1625, 115th Cong. (2018). \nB. President Trump Makes a Border Wall His Signature Issue \nOn the first day of his presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump promised that he \n“would build a great wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border that Mexico would pay for.  Ex. 1, at 2.1\nAccording to then-candidate Trump, a wall was necessary because “the worst elements in Mexico” \nwere “being pushed into the United States,” bringing “infectious disease,” “drugs[,] and death.”  \nEx. 2, at 3.  At campaign rallies, supporters would erupt in chants of “Build the wall!”  Ex. 3, at \n12.\nSoon after his election, President Trump again promised “[w]e’re going to build a wall.”  \nEx. 4, at 19.  “I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico,” \nhe explained, “but . . . I don’t feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half.”  Id. Five days after \n1 All references to “Ex. __” refer to exhibits to the declaration of Kristy Parker, attached \nhereto.

Reg. 8793, 8794 (Jan. 25, 2017) (Ex. \n5, at 2). \nIn 2017, President Trump requested $999 million in congressional appropriations for “the \nfirst installment of the border wall.”  Ex. 6, at 5.  A Republican-controlled Congress instead \nprovided  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  with  $341.2  million  “to  replace \napproximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian and vehicle border fencing along the \nsouthwest border.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-31, 131 Stat. 135, 434 \n(2017).  In 2018, President Trump requested $1.6 billion in congressional appropriations for 74 \nmiles of new or replacement border wall.  Ex. 7, at 3.  In response, Congress appropriated $1.571 \nbillion for new border security technology and new and replacement fencing in specified areas on \nthe southern border.  Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141 (2018) (to be printed \nat 132 Stat. 348, 616). \nC. President Trump Shuts Down the Government for a Border Wall \nIn February 2018, President Trump issued his fiscal year 2019 budget request, seeking \n“$1.6 billion to construct approximately 65 miles of border wall.”  Ex. 8, at 58.  Near the end of \n2018, Congress began working on a fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill, to be enacted before the \nDecember  22,  2018  deadline  when  federal  funding  would  expire  for  nine  governmental \ndepartments.  The initial Senate appropriations bill included the exact amount that the President \nhad requested in February 2018:  $1.6 billion for 65 miles of border fencing.  S. 3109, 115th Cong. \n(2018).\nOn December 11, 2016, President Trump met with then-House Minority Leader Nancy \nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss the impending funding deadline.  At \n4\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 16 of 64\nthat meeting, President Trump stated that he wanted $5 billion for a border wall and would be \n“proud to shut down the government for border security.”  Ex. 9, at 11.  On December 19, 2018, \ntwo days before the funding deadline, the Senate passed a continuing resolution funding the \ngovernment through February 8, 2019.  Department of Defense Appropriations Act, H.R. 695, \n115th Cong. (2018).  Because that continuing resolution contained no border wall funding, \nhowever, the President refused to support it.  On December 22, 2018, federal funding for a \nsubstantial portion of the government expired, precipitating the longest government shutdown in \nAmerican history. \nD. President Trump Raises the Possibility of Declaring a National Emergency \nOn January 4, 2019, in the midst of the government shut down, President Trump raised a \nnew idea:  If the “negotiated process” with Congress did not lead to border wall funding, he \nexplained, he could “call a national emergency and build [the wall] very quickly.”  Ex. 10, at 25.  \nFive days later, President Trump stated that he has “an absolute right to do [a] national emergency \nif [he] want[s],” and that the “threshold” for declaring an emergency would be if “I can’t make a \ndeal with people that are unreasonable.”  Ex. 11, at 1; Ex. 12, at 4.  Three days after that, the \nPresident noted that “the easy solution is for me to call a national emergency,” and that if Congress \n“can’t do it, I will declare a national emergency.”  Ex. 13, at 2, 15. \nAfter the government shut down had lasted for over a month, the President finally agreed \nto end it on January 25, 2019.  He signed a continuing resolution funding the government through \nFebruary 15, 2019.  See Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 116-5 \n(2019) (to be printed at 133 Stat. 10).  That continuing resolution provided no additional border \nwall funding. Id.\nE. Congress Passes the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act \nOn February 14, 2019, Congress passed the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA), \n5\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 17 of 64\nPub. L. No. 116-6 (2019) (to be printed at 133 Stat. 13).  The CAA provides $1.375 billion for \n“the construction of primary pedestrian fencing” in “the Rio Grande Valley Sector.”  CAA, § \n230(a)(1).  And it states that none of the funds appropriated by the Act can be used “for the \nconstruction of pedestrian fencing” in any of five areas of the border. Id.§ 231.  On February 15, \n2019, President Trump signed the CAA into law. \nF. President Trump Declares a National Emergency and Announces a Plan to \nFund a Border Wall \nOn the same day that President Trump signed the CAA, he issued a Proclamation declaring \n“the current situation at the southern border” to be a “national emergency.”  Ex. 14, at 1.  According \nto the Proclamation, “[t]he problem of large-scale unlawful migration across the southern border \nis long-standing,” requiring deployment of the military to the border and construction of a wall \nthere. Id.  When announcing his Proclamation, President Trump noted that he “could do the wall \nover a longer period of time” and “didn’t need to do this.”  Ex. 15, at 6.  But, he said, “I’d rather \ndo it much faster.”  Id.\nIn addition to declaring a national emergency, the President announced a plan, to be carried \nout by Defendant Acting Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, to use funds Congress \nappropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.  As relevant, the White House directed those \nActing Secretaries to use:  (1) $2.5 billion of Department of Defense (DOD) funds for Support for \nCounterdrug Activities under 10 U.S.C. § 284; and (2) $3.6 billion of DOD funds for “military \nconstruction projects” under 10 U.S.C. § 2808.2\nLess  than  two  weeks  after  the  President’s  Proclamation,  Congress  repudiated  his \nemergency declaration.  Both the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a resolution \n2President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory,White House Fact Sheet (Feb. 15, \n2019)  (“Fact  Sheet”),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-\ntrumps-border-security-victory/. \n6\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 18 of 64\nterminating that declaration.  Exs. 16-17.  The President then vetoed the disapproval resolution.  \nEx. 18. \nG. Defendants Begin the Wall Construction Process \nSince President Trump’s Proclamation, Defendants have begun the process of building a \nwall along the southern border.  On February 25, 2019, DHS officially requested that DOD supply \nit with funds under § 284 to build approximately 200 miles of barriers along the border.  Ex. 19.  \nDOD then informed Congress that it was preparing to reprogram funds from its Military Personnel \nAccount into its Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities Account (“Drug Interdiction \nAccount”), so that it would have sufficient funds to transfer to DHS for the border wall.  Ex. 20, \nat 1.  The reprogramming was necessary because DOD had already spent over 90% of the $881.5 \nmillion appropriated to the Drug Interdiction Account in 2019.  Id.\nOn March 18, 2019, DOD sent Congress a “Fact Sheet” identifying “military construction” \nfunds available under § 2808 to build a border wall.  Ex. 21.  Among the funds DOD identified \nwas $52.3 million for three projects at the Fort Bliss Army Base in El Paso County, Texas.  Id. at\n4, 13.  On March 25, 2019, DOD confirmed the reprogramming of $1 billion from its Military \nPersonnel Account to its Drug Interdiction Account, for eventual transfer to DHS.  Ex. 22, at 1.  \nThat same day, DOD also confirmed in a letter that DOD and DHS “ha[d] decided to undertake \nYuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 and El Paso Sector Project 1 by constructing 57 miles of 18-foot-\nhigh pedestrian fencing.”  Ex. 23.  El Paso Sector Project 1 involves the construction of 46 miles \nof new or replacement border walls in southern New Mexico, in the nearby vicinity of El Paso \nCounty, Texas.  Ex. 19, at 9. \nOn April 9, 2019, DOD announced the award of a $789 million contract to a private \ncompany “for border replacement wall construction.”  Ex. 24, at 1.  It further announced that \n“[w]ork will be performed in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, with an estimated completion date of \n7\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 19 of 64\nOctober 1, 2020.”  Id. The Santa Teresa port of entry is only twenty minutes from downtown El \nPaso, Texas.  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 17.   \nH. Proceedings \nPlaintiffs El Paso County, Texas (“the County”) and the Border Network for Human Rights \n(“BNHR”) filed a complaint in this Court on February 20, 2019.  SeeNo. 3:19-cv-66, Doc. 1.  On \nApril 25, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.  Plaintiffs now hereby move for summary \njudgment or, alternatively, a preliminary injunction, on all seven claims in the amended complaint.\nARGUMENT \nAs shown below, this Court should grant Plaintiffs summary judgment and permanent \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief on the seven claims in their amended complaint.  “Summary \njudgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the parties are entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  SEC v. Sethi, 910 F.3d 198, 202 (5th Cir. 2018).  Because this \ncase involves solely legal questions, no discovery is necessary to resolve it.  And with no genuine \nissues of material fact present, summary judgment is warranted.  See, e.g., Bauer v. Albemarle \nCorp., 169 F.3d 962, 968 (5th Cir. 1999) (“[A] summary judgment motion can be decided without \nany discovery.”); United States v. Bloom, 112 F.3d 200, 205 n.17 (5th Cir. 1997) (“The summary \njudgment rule does not require that any discovery take place before summary judgment can be \ngranted.”).\nEven if a permanent injunction were not yet warranted, however, this Court should grant \nPlaintiffs a preliminary injunction against Defendants’ unlawful actions.  As explained infra,\nPlaintiffs have “a substantial likelihood of success on the merits”; they will suffer “irreparable \ninjury if the injunction is not issued”; “the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs \nany harm that will result if the injunction is granted”; and “the grant of an injunction will not \ndisserve the public interest.”  Jones v. Tex. Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 880 F.3d 756, 759 (5th Cir. \n8\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 20 of 64\n2018) (quotations omitted). \nI. PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING \n“To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient \ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood that the \ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. \n149, 157-58 (2014) (quotations omitted).  “[T]he injury in fact requirement under Article III is \nqualitative, not quantitative, in nature.”  Ass’n of Cmty Orgs. for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d \n350, 357-58 (5th Cir. 1999).  So while an “injury must be (a) concrete and particularized and (b) \nactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical, to pass constitutional muster,” it “need not \nmeasure more than an identifiable trifle.”  Id.at 358 (citations and quotations omitted); see United \nStates v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669, 690 n.14 (1973) \n(noting that the Court has upheld standing where plaintiffs have “no more at stake in the outcome \nof an action than a fraction of a vote, a $5 fine and costs, and a $1.50 poll tax”). \nWhen a plaintiff “challeng[es] the legality of government action,” the “nature and extent \nof facts that must be averred” to establish standing “depends considerably upon whether the \nplaintiff is [itself] an object of the action” at issue.  Lujan v. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-\n62 (1992).  If it is, “there is ordinarily little question that the action . . . has caused [it] injury, and \nthat a judgment preventing . . . the action will redress [that injury].” Id.\nAt the summary-judgment stage, plaintiffs “must ‘set forth’ by affidavit or other evidence \n‘specific facts’” to establish their standing. Id. at 561 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  When \nevaluating plaintiffs’ standing, courts must “take as true” the factual evidence plaintiffs submit.  \nMcCardell v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 794 F.3d 510, 520 (5th Cir. 2015); see Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561. \n9\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 21 of 64\nA. El Paso County Has Standing \nEl Paso County is located in west Texas, squarely on the U.S.-Mexico border.  A vibrant, \nmulticultural community, the County is “defined by [its] relationship with Mexico and the \npresence of [its] many immigrant residents.”  Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 5.  It ranks as one of the \nnation’s safest communities.  Id.; see also Press Release, City of El Paso, City of El Paso Named \nSecond Safest City in America (Aug. 2017), available at https://bit.ly/2TZkGsX. \nThe County’s economy relies heavily on tourism and commercial development.  Ex. 25, \nKeller Decl. ¶ 4.  It recently entered a three-year, multi-million-dollar tourism campaign with the \nCity of El Paso aimed at increasing the City’s and County’s shares of the Texas tourism market.  \nEx. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 10.  And it has secured the opening of new \ndowntown hotels and refurbished historical sites “as part of a strategic plan to bring tourism and \nits attendant revenue to the county.”  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 9.  As a primary selling point to \ntourists  and  investors,  the  County  seeks  to  market  itself  as  a  safe,  aesthetically  beautiful, \nmulticultural border community.  Id. ¶ 4.  To that end, the County has contracted with a private \ncompany to run “an advertising campaign that would promote a positive image of El Paso and the \nborder community.”  Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 10.  The County’s efforts have begun to pay off:  its \ncurrent annual budget projects that it will earn $4 million in tax revenue from tourism.  Ex. 26, \nSamaniego Decl. ¶ 5. \nIn this case, the County “challeng[es] the legality of government action,” Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 561—namely, the President’s Proclamation and Defendants’ attendant actions to build a wall \nalong the southern border.  Those actions make the County, and all such border communities, their \ndirect “object.”  Id.; see Ex. 14, at 1 (Proclamation defines the national emergency as the “current \nsituation at the southern border”).  As a result, there is “little question” that the County has standing \nto challenge those actions.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see Duarte ex rel. Duarte v. City of Lewisville,\n10\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 22 of 64\n759 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (“It follows from Lujan that if a plaintiff is an object of a \ngovernment regulation, then that plaintiff ordinarily has standing to challenge that regulation.”). \nAnd indeed, the County has demonstrated two interconnected, concrete injuries stemming \nfrom Defendants’ actions.  First, the County has shown an injury to its reputation.  “[I]njury to \nreputation can constitute a cognizable injury sufficient for Article III standing.”  Foretich v. United \nStates, 351 F.3d 1198, 1211 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see Walker v. City of Mesquite, 129 F.3d 831, 832-\n33  (5th  Cir.  1997).    “[W]here  reputational  injury  derives  directly  from  an  unexpired  and \nunretracted government action, that injury satisfies the requirements of Article III standing to \nchallenge that action.”  Foretich, 351 F.3d at 1213.  Even “the need to take . . . affirmative steps \nto avoid the risk of harm to [one’s] reputation constitutes a cognizable injury.”  Meese v. Keene,\n481 U.S. 465, 475 (1987). \nIn Meese, for instance, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff had standing, based on \nreputational injury, to challenge a federal law classifying films he wished to show as “political \npropaganda.”  Id. at 472-77.  By forcing the plaintiff to “choose between exhibiting the films and \nincurring the risk that public perception of this [legal] scheme will harm [his] reputation,” the law \ninflicted concrete injury.  Id. at 477.  And in NCAA v. Governor of New Jersey, 730 F.3d 208 (3d \nCir. 2013), rev’d on other grounds sub nom., 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018), whose standing analysis the \nFifth Circuit has favorably cited, seeTexas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 156 (5th Cir. 2015), the \ncourt held that sports leagues had standing, based on reputational injury, to challenge a state law \nlegalizing sports gambling, NCAA, 730 F.3d at 220.  The court held that the leagues had shown \ncognizable reputational injury on the ground that “they are harmed by their unwanted association \nwith an activity they (and large portions of the public) disapprove of—gambling.”  Id.\nHere, the President’s Proclamation and Defendants’ actions carrying it out have caused the \n11\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 23 of 64\nCounty cognizable reputational injury.  According to County officials, El Paso County takes pride \nin its “reputation as a safe place to live, work, and visit,” and as a vibrant “bilingual, bi-national, \nmulticultural” community.  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.  But Defendants’ actions have “falsely \ntold the world the exact opposite”:  “that El Paso County and the Southern border are crime-ridden \nand dangerous, that [its] immigrant community comprises criminals and drug traffickers . . ., that \n[its] proximity to Mexico is an existential threat, and that [it] can be rescued only through the blight \nof massive wall construction and militarization.”  Id.¶ 8; id.¶ 10(“I have already heard personally \nfrom people who have a false impression that El Paso County is a dangerous place and who do not \nwant to come here [because of the President’s Proclamation].”).  Indeed, Defendants’ actions \namount to a message “transmitted all over the world” that “all of [the County’s] strengths are \nactually weaknesses” and that the County is “so endangered by immigrants and [its] closeness to \nMexico that [it] need[s] a wall to protect [it].”  Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 6.  Because of Defendants’ \nactions, County officials now must “not only promot[e] El Paso’s image, but actively defend[] it.”  \nId.  As those officials have explained, “every meeting anyone promoting El Paso has now must \ninclude extra efforts to persuade people that El Paso County is a good place to invest in and visit.”  \nEx. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 11; see Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 154 \n(2010) (finding standing based on plaintiffs’ need “to take certain measures to minimize the \nlikelihood” of harm). \nThe County’s reputational injuries track those found sufficient for standing in NCAA and\nMeese.  Just as the sports leagues in NCAA were “harmed by their unwanted association” with \ngambling, the County is “harmed by [its] unwanted association” with crime, danger, construction, \nand militarization.  730 F.3d at 220.  And just as the plaintiff in Meese had to take “affirmative \nsteps to avoid the risk of harm to his reputation” posed by the challenged law, 481 U.S. at 475, the \n12\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 24 of 64\nCounty must now take steps to “actively defend[]” its reputation against the depiction of the border \nconveyed by the Proclamation and Defendants’ subsequent actions, Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 6; see \nEx. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 12 (“I have spent approximately 30% of my time [as County Judge] . . \n. defending El Paso’s reputation”). \nSecond,  the  County’s  reputational  injury—though  alone  sufficient  for  standing—is \nintimately tied to “a direct pecuniary injury that generally is sufficient to establish injury-in-fact.”  \nK.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 122 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations omitted).  By treating the border as \na danger zone requiring military occupation and a wall, Defendants’ actions have already begun \nto discourage tourism and commercial development in the County.  As the County’s Chief \nAdministrator explained, “[t]here is nothing more detrimental to a drive to bring in tourists than \nthe perception that a community is chaotic and dangerous and that the tourists[’] access to \nhistorical and scenic destinations will be impeded by construction.”  Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 8; see \nid. at ¶¶ 12-13 (describing economic effects of impending construction in the County’s nearby \nvicinity); Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 6 (“[T]he President’s Proclamation declaring an emergency \nat the Southern border is a serious threat to both tourism and economic development because of \nthe false and negative impression of El Paso that it creates.”).  And as the El Paso County Judge \nlikewise  emphasized,  recent  meetings  with  “local  business  leaders”  have  indicated  that \nDefendants’ actions are “generating fears of potential investors that the community will be mired \nin a long-term state of chaos that includes . . . violent crime, the blight of construction, and \nimpediments to crossing back and forth across the border.” Id. ¶ 11.3\nWhile the County has already suffered economic harm flowing from Defendants’ actions, \n3 In addition, the reputational harm inflicted by the Proclamation and attendant border \nmilitarization have hindered the County’s efforts to attract qualified applicants for important \ngovernment posts.  Ex. 25, Keller Decl. ¶ 11. \n13\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 25 of 64\nmuch more is “certainly impending.”  Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 158 (quotations omitted); see LeBlanc,\n627 F.3d at 122 (finding injury in fact where economic harm “ha[d] not yet materialized”);\nMcCardell, 794 F.3d at 520 (finding injury in fact where the “asserted injury would be concretely \nfelt in the logical course of probable events flowing from an unfavorable decision by this court”).\nThe longer the President’s Proclamation remains in effect, the more the County’s reputation will \nbe tarnished in the eyes of tourists and developers, and the more hours County officials will have \nto devote to combating negative messaging, as opposed to “meeting directly with business leaders \nto bring business to El Paso.”  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 12.  Any drop in the $4 million tax \nrevenue the County earns from tourism “would significantly damage the county’s financial \nhealth.”  Id. ¶ 5; see Gladstone Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 110-11 (1979) \n(municipality’s “diminish[ed] . . . tax base” constitutes injury in fact). \nMoreover, if the planned wall construction in the County’s nearby vicinity is allowed to \nprogress, noise and traffic will surely disrupt the County’s “regional economy.”  Ex. 25, Keller \nDecl. ¶ 13 (describing impact of planned wall construction “only 15 miles from downtown El \nPaso”).  That disruption will, in turn, thwart the County’s “ability to compete for business \ninvestment and tourism.”  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 18. \nFinally, Defendants have identified $52.3 million appropriated for “military construction \nprojects” at Fort Bliss, an El Paso army base, for diversion toward the border wall.  Ex. 21.  “Fort \nBliss is the lifeblood of the El Paso economy,” contributing billions of dollars and creating \nthousands of jobs.  Ex. 26, Samaniego Decl. ¶ 15.  Losing funds that had been appropriated for use \nat Fort Bliss “creates the imminent prospect of economic harm to El Paso County.”  Id.¶ 16.  That \nloss of funds also represents a missed opportunity to “obtain a benefit,” which can suffice to show \ninjury in fact.  N.E. Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). \n14\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 26 of 64\nWith the County’s injury in fact established, standing doctrine’s final two requirements—\ncausation and redressability—easily follow.  To begin, the causation element is satisfied because \nthe County’s reputational and economic injuries are “fairly traceable” to Defendants’ actions.  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997).  The President’s Proclamation expressly declares a \n“national emergency” on the “southern border”—including El Paso County—based on its status \nas a “major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.”  Ex. 14, at 1.  And \nDefendants’ recent deployment of the military to build a border wall reinforces the County’s image \nas dangerous and uninviting, while threatening to increase noise and congestion in the area. \nAs County officials explained, these precise actions bear a “causal connection” to the \nCounty’s reputational and economic injuries described above.  Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 158; seeEx. \n25, Keller Decl. ¶ 6 (“The President’s Proclamation . . . is an official government statement that \ndamages El Paso County’s ability to compete for business investment and tourism.”); id. ¶ 10 \n(“Because of the President’s Proclamation, we are now in the process of strategizing how to \ncombat a falsely negative image.”); id. ¶¶ 12-13 (impending wall construction will create a \n“massive construction zone,” deterring “tourism and business development”); Ex. 26, Samaniego \nDec. ¶ 10 (“The President’s Proclamation has falsely told the world the exact opposite of who we \nare and what we promote”); id. ¶ 16 (diversion of funds from Fort Bliss “creates the imminent \nprospect of economic harm”). \nFinally,  where,  as  here,  a  plaintiff  challenges  government  action,  “[c]ausation  and \nredressability typically overlap as two sides of a causation coin.”  Carpenters Indus. Council v. \nZinke, 854 F.3d 1, 6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  “After all, if a government action causes an injury, \nenjoining the action usually will redress that injury.”  Id.  That is true here.  As to the County’s \nreputational injuries, enjoining Defendants’ actions will countermand the negative image of the \n15\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 27 of 64\nCounty that those actions have perpetuated and allow County officials to refocus their resources \non improving tourism and commerce, not defending the County against Defendants’ attacks.  See\nForetich, 351 F.3d at 1214 (invalidating government action from which “reputational injury . . . \nderives” “provide[s] meaningful relief”).  And as to the County’s pecuniary injuries, enjoining \nDefendants’ actions will help restore the County’s image in the eyes of tourists and investors and \nforestall disruptive border wall construction.  Accordingly, the County has standing to bring its \nclaims. \nB. BNHR Has Standing \nFounded in 1998, BNHR is a community organization headquartered in El Paso, Texas.  \nEx. 27, Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.  It consists of about 5,000 members who live and work in west Texas, \nmetropolitan El Paso, and southern New Mexico.  Id.¶ 4.  BNHR’s mission is to “organize border \ncommunities through human rights education” and “mobilize [its] members to advocate for \npositive change in policies” affecting “the immigrant community.”  Id.¶ 3.  To fulfill that mission, \nBNHR “educate[s] [its] own members about their rights” and “train[s] them to educate and \norganize other members of the immigrant community.”  Id. It also works to forge bonds between \nits members and the area’s law-enforcement officials.  Id. ¶ 10. \n“An organization has standing to sue on its own behalf if it meets the same standing test \nthat applies to individuals.”  Fowler, 178 F.3d at 356.  In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 \nU.S. 363 (1982), the Supreme Court held that an organization devoted to counseling low-income \nhome buyers met that test, enabling it to challenge defendants’ “racial steering practices.”  Id. at\n379.  The Court found sufficient the organization’s allegation that it “had to devote significant \nresources to identify and counteract” defendants’ unlawful practices. Id. If defendants’ “steering \npractices have perceptibly impaired [the organization’s] ability to provide” its services, the Court \nexplained, “there can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in fact.”  Id. “Such \n16\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 28 of 64\nconcrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain on \nthe organization’s resources—constitutes far more than simply a setback to the organization’s \nabstract social interests.”  Id.\nApplying Havens  Realty,  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  announced  the  following  rule:    “an \norganization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it devotes resources to counteract a \ndefendant’s allegedly unlawful practices.”  Fowler, 178 F.3d at 360; see Scott v. Schedler, 771 \nF.3d 831, 837 (5th Cir. 2014).  In OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604 (5th Cir. 2017), \nfor instance, the Fifth Circuit held that an advocacy organization had standing to challenge a Texas \nlaw restricting the “interpretation assistance that English-limited voters may receive.”  Id. at 606, \n612.  Because the organization “went out of its way to counteract the effect of Texas’s allegedly \nunlawful”  restriction—for  instance,  by  “educat[ing]  voters”  about  it—the  organization  had \nsuffered cognizable injury, even if that “injury was not large.” Id. at 612.  Similarly, in Scott, the \nFifth Circuit held that the Louisiana NAACP had standing to challenge Louisiana’s alleged failure \nto comply with the National Voter Registration Act.  771 F.3d at 837.  Because one NAACP \nmember “devoted resources to counter[acting] [the State’s] allegedly unlawful practices” by \nconducting “voter- registration drives,” the NAACP “suffered injury in fact.”  Id. \nBNHR has standing under the foregoing precedents.  In normal circumstances, BNHR \ndedicates  its  resources  to  “its  core  mission”  of  human  rights  education  and  “promoting \nimmigration reform.”  Ex. 27, Garcia Decl. ¶ 13.  Because of Defendants’ emergency declaration \nand attendant border militarization, however, BNHR has had to “divert resources” away from that \ncore mission, and toward “counsel[ing] community members who are fearful,” “organizing [its] \ncommunity in opposition to the President’s declaration,” and “opposing the illegal [border wall] \nconstruction.” Id.¶¶ 13, 37. BNHR has held and scheduled Proclamation-related weekend events \n17\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 29 of 64\nthat it would not otherwise hold, and has increased the frequency of its “Know Your Rights” \npresentations approximately five-fold.  Id. ¶¶ 14-15.  It has also hired an additional policy \nconsultant  (costing  $14,400)  to  deal  with  its  increased  advocacy  workload  in  light  of  the \nProclamation, and has sent delegations to discuss the Proclamation’s effects with congressional \nmembers in Washington, D.C.  Id. ¶¶ 16, 19.  In short, as the organization’s Executive Director \nstated in his declaration, the Proclamation and Defendants’ subsequent actions have “required \nBNHR to expend significant resources that could have, and would have, gone elsewhere,” leading \nto a total of $23,956 in additional organizational expenses. Id.at ¶¶ 16, 21.4\nIn addition to draining BNHR’s resources, the Proclamation has forced BNHR to end one \nof its “major initiatives” to build trust between the immigrant community and law enforcement, \ncalled the “Hugs Not Walls” campaign.  Id. ¶ 32.  That campaign’s signature event has now been \ncancelled. Id.\nLike the organizational plaintiffs in Havens Realty, OCA-Greater Houston, and Scott,\nBNHR has standing to challenge Defendants’ actions.  As shown, BNHR has gone “out of its way \nto counteract” those actions, OCA-Greater Houston, 867 F.3d at 612, by diverting resources from \nits traditional activities toward “counsel[ing]” and “organizing” community members in relation \nto the national emergency and border wall, Ex. 27, Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 13, 37.  And Defendants’ \nactions have inflicted “demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities,” because those actions \nhave forced BNHR to cancel initiatives it would otherwise spearhead.  Havens Realty, 455 U.S. at \n379.  All of BNHR’s organizational injuries, moreover, have a “causal nexus” to Defendants’ \nactions, and would be redressed if this Court were to enjoin those actions.  See Scott, 771 F.3d at \n4 Beyond these monetary costs, BNHR staff members have faced longer hours and a more \nburdensome workload as a result of Defendants’ actions.  See id. ¶ 22. \n18\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 30 of 64\n838-39.  BNHR has standing. \nII. THE PRESIDENT’S PROCLAMATION IS UNLAWFUL \nInvoking the National Emergencies Act (NEA), Pub. L. No. 94-412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976), \nPresident Trump’s Proclamation declares a “national emergency” at “the southern border.”  Based \non that declaration, Defendants plan to use $3.6 billion in funds appropriated for “military \nconstruction projects” to build a border wall.  10 U.S.C. § 2808.  But to properly rely on the NEA, \na  president  must  identify  an  actual  “emergency”—i.e.,  an  unforeseen  combination  of \ncircumstances requiring immediate action.  Because the “current situation at the southern border” \ndoes not qualify as an “emergency” under that definition, the Proclamation exceeds the President’s \nauthority under the NEA.  As a result, the Proclamation should be declared unlawful, and \nDefendants should be enjoined from using § 2808 “military construction” funding for a border \nwall. \nTo avoid this straightforward conclusion, Defendants have argued in other courts that the \nNEA grants the President complete discretion in determining whether an “emergency” exists.  See\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 21, Alvarez v. Trump, No. 19-00404 (D.D.C. Apr. 2, 2019) \n(“Defs.’ MTD”).  If this Court were to adopt that reading, the NEA would violate the nondelegation \ndoctrine, which prohibits Congress from transferring its legislative power to the Executive Branch.  \nIn that scenario, the NEA and Proclamation should be declared unconstitutional, and Defendants \nshould similarly be enjoined from using “military construction” funding for a border wall. \nA. The Proclamation Exceeds the President’s Authority Under the NEA \nFrom the 1930s through the 1960s, Presidents exercised unfettered discretion in declaring \nnational emergencies, pursuant to over 400 separate “emergency statutes.”  S. Rep. No. 93-1170, \nat 2 (1974).  By 1974, hundreds of such emergencies were in effect, four of which had existed \ncontinuously for close to forty years.  Id.at 1.  Each of these emergencies authorized the President \n19\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 31 of 64\nto wield “extraordinary powers” and “manage every aspect of the lives of all American citizens.”  \nId. at 2. \nTo narrow the concept of “emergency” and prevent presidential abuse, Congress passed \nthe NEA.  The NEA “would end the states of emergency under which the United States has been \noperating for more than 40 years.”  S. Rep. No. 94-1168, at 2 (1976).  And it would “insure that \nthe extraordinary powers which now reside in the hands of the Chief Executive . . . could be utilized \nonly when emergencies actually exist, and then, only under safeguards of congressional review.”  \nId.  Testifying on behalf of the Justice Department in support of the NEA, then-Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Antonin Scalia stated that “[t]hose powers which society really no longer views as \nemergency powers should not be called that.”  Antonin Scalia, Testimony to the House of \nRepresentatives,  Subcommittee  on  Administrative  Law  and  Government  Relations  of  the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, at 95 (Apr. 9, 1975) (“Scalia Testimony”).  “[W]e have to be careful \nnot to slap that label on something that doesn’t merit it,” Scalia warned.  Id.\nThe NEA’s core provision states that, “[w]ith respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the \nexercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the \nPresident is authorized to declare such emergency.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621.  Once a President declares \na national emergency pursuant to § 1621, he gains “special or extraordinary power[s]” under a \nbroad swath of separate statutes, including 10 U.S.C. § 2808, which the President has invoked \nhere.\nThe NEA does not define the term “emergency,” so it must be construed “in accordance \nwith [its] ordinary meaning.”  Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369, 376 (2013).  The ordinary meaning \nof “emergency” is an “unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for \nimmediate action.”  Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary 372 (8th ed. 1976); see also American \n20\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 32 of 64\nHeritage Dictionary 427 (1st ed. 1976) (defining “emergency” as “[a] situation or occurrence of a \nserious  nature,  developing  suddenly  and  unexpectedly,  and  demanding  immediate  action”).  \nInterpreting the term “emergency” in other contexts, courts (including the Fifth Circuit) have long \nadhered to this ordinary meaning.  See, e.g., Van de Walle v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 477 F.2d 20, 23 \n(5th Cir. 1973) (because employee’s shift “was neither unfamiliar nor unexpected,” it could \n“hardly be characterized as an ‘emergency’ as that term is commonly used”); Taylor v. Bair, 414 \nF.2d 815, 821 (5th Cir. 1969) (an “emergency” is “a condition arising suddenly and unexpectedly \n. . . and which calls for immediate action . . . without time for deliberation”).  Indeed, the Third \nCircuit applied this very definition when invalidating an emergency declaration issued by the \nGovernment of the Virgin Islands, holding that a wastewater problem was not an “emergency” \nbecause it was longstanding and “could not be construed as surprising or unexpected.”  United\nStates v. Gov’t of V.I., 363 F.3d 276, 289 n.10 (3d Cir. 2004). \nInvoking NEA § 1621, President Trump’s Proclamation declares “[t]he current situation at \nthe southern border . . . a national emergency.”  Ex. 14, at 1.  Specifically, it claims that “[t]he \nsouthern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.”  Id. And, \nit adds, “recent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking \nentry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while \ntheir removal proceedings are pending.”  Id. Based on this “emergency,” the Proclamation invokes \n10 U.S.C. § 2808 for purposes of building a border wall. Id. \nThe Proclamation exceeds the President’s authority under the NEA because the “current \nsituation at the southern border” does not qualify as an “emergency” under that word’s ordinary \nmeaning:  it is not “unforeseen,” and it does not “call for immediate action” in the form of a border \nwall. \n21\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 33 of 64\nFirst, the Proclamation itself acknowledges that the “current situation at the southern \nborder” is not unforeseen, emphasizing that “[t]he problem of large-scale unlawful migration \nthrough the southern border is long-standing.”  Id. (emphasis added); see Gov’t of V.I., 363 F.3d \nat 289 n.10 (longstanding issue cannot be “emergency”).  The political branches have grappled \nwith unlawful immigration for decades, and Congress has repeatedly acted to address the issue.5\nUnlawful immigration across the southern border thus presents a decades-old, political dilemma \nrequiring inter-branch solutions, not a sudden or unforeseen event necessitating a unilateral \nexecutive response. \nSecond, the “current situation” does not “call for immediate action” in the form of a wall \nstretching the length of the U.S.-Mexico border.  Congress considered and rejected such a \nproposal, instead determining that targeted fencing in the Rio Grande Valley area was the \nappropriate course.  SeeCAA, § 231.  That narrower approach reflects the facts on the ground, as \nevidenced by the government’s own data.  DHS recently estimated a “91 percent decline” in illegal \nborder crossings between 2000 and 2016.6  The amount of drugs Customs and Border Protection \n(CBP) seized between ports of entry has decreased from 2014 to 2018.7  And family migration \noccurs mostly at ports of entry, where families turn themselves in and seek asylum.8  The \n5 See, e.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 110-161, 121 Stat. 1844, 2090 \n(2008); Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, 120 Stat. 2368 (2006); Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). \n6Efforts by DHS to Estimate Southwest Border Security Between Ports of Entry, U.S. Dep’t \nof Homeland Security Off. of Immigr. Stat., 17 (Sept. 2017), http://tinyurl.com/DHSOISReport. \n7 CBP  Enforcement  Statistics  FY  2019,  U.S.  Customs  &  Border  Protection, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/CBPFY19Stats (showing the amount of drugs seized annually at and between \nports of entry from 2014 to 2018). \n8See To Secure the Border and Make America Safe Again, We Need to Deploy the National \nGuard,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (Apr.  4,  2018), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/04/04/secure-border-and-make-america-safe-again-we-need-\ndeploy-national-guard.\n22\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 34 of 64\nPresident’s  disagreement  with  how  Congress  has  dealt  with  a  problem  does  not  create  an \n“emergency.” \nPresident Trump’s own words also belie the notion that the “current situation at the \nsouthern border” calls for immediate action.  See, e.g., Old Dominion Branch No. 496 v. Austin,\n418 U.S. 264, 274-75 (1975) (considering presidential announcement accompanying signing of \nexecutive order); City & Cty. of S.F. v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1242-43 (9th Cir. 2018) (considering \npresidential statements when construing executive order).  Before issuing the Proclamation, \nPresident Trump characterized an emergency declaration as “another way” of building a wall that \nhe would use “if I can’t make a deal with people [in Congress] that are unreasonable.”  Ex. 11, at \n1; Ex. 12, at 4.  And during his Rose Garden announcement of the emergency declaration, President \nTrump stated that he “could do the wall over a longer period of time” and “didn’t need to do this,” \nbut would “rather do it much faster.”  Ex. 15, at 4.  By definition, an “emergency” is not something \none can opt to address “over a longer period of time” or “didn’t need to” address at all. \nTo be sure, since its enactment, Presidents have invoked the NEA numerous times in \nvarious contexts, but that history does not validate President Trump’s unique power grab.  As an \ninitial matter, most presidential emergency declarations have gone unchallenged, so the mere fact \nthat many other emergencies have been declared does not suggest that those declarations were \nuniformly lawful.  In any event, the government has not identified another instance in which the \nPresident has wielded his emergency power to claim funding that Congress has expressly denied.  \nAnd lest there be any doubt that is what occurred here, recall that President Trump stated that the \nemergency declaration was “another way” of building a wall if “a negotiated process” failed to \nbear fruit.  Ex. 10, at 25. Treating an emergency declaration as a political tool to effectuate an \nagenda  repudiated  by  Congress  mocks  the  NEA,  which  was  designed  for  instances  “when \n23\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 35 of 64\nemergencies actually exist.”  S. Rep. No. 94-1168, at 2 (1976).  In the words of Antonin Scalia, \nPresident Trump’s emergency declaration “debases the currency” and “distorts our whole process” \nby “slap[ping] [the] label [of emergency] on something that doesn’t merit it.”  Scalia Testimony, \nat 95. \nEven if the NEA’s text could be read to permit this emergency declaration (it cannot), that \nreading  should  be  avoided  because  it  would  raise  “a  serious  doubt”  about  the  NEA’s \nconstitutionality. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 \nU.S.  22,  62  (1932)).    The  nondelegation  doctrine  prohibits  Congress  from  transferring  its \nlegislative power to the Executive Branch.  See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, \n472 (2001).  As explained infra, Defendants’ proposed reading of the NEA—as an “intentional \ndecision [by Congress] to leave to the President the determination about when and under what \ncircumstances  to  declare  a  national  emergency,”  Defs.’  MTD  at  21—would  violate  the \nnondelegation doctrine.  But at a minimum, that reading “would raise serious constitutional \nproblems,” requiring the Court to adopt Plaintiffs’ “alternative interpretation of the statute” as long \nas it is “fairly possible.”  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 300 (2001) (quotations omitted).  Here, \nPlaintiffs’  proposed  reading,  viz.,  that  an  “emergency”  under  the  NEA  is  an  unforeseen \ncircumstance requiring immediate action, is “fairly possible,” id., given that it comports with the \nterm’s ordinary meaning and past judicial interpretations. \nThe Supreme Court employed this canon to avoid nondelegation concerns in Industrial \nUnion Department., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607 (1980).  There, the \ngovernment took the “extreme position” that a statutory command to “set a standard ‘which most \nadequately assures . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health’” required it to \n“impose standards that either guarantee workplaces that are free from any risk of material health \n24\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 36 of 64\nimpairment, however small, or that come as close as possible to doing so without ruining entire \nindustries.” Id.at 641 (plurality op.).  A plurality held that “[i]n the absence of a clear mandate in \nthe  Act,  it  is  unreasonable  to  assume  that  Congress  intended  to  give  the  [executive]  the \nunprecedented power” it claimed, because “the statute would make such a sweeping delegation of \nlegislative power that it might be unconstitutional.”  Id. at 645-46 (citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  According to the plurality, “[a] construction of the statute that avoids this kind of open-\nended grant should certainly be favored.” Id. at 646.9\nHere, as in Industrial Union, Defendants have pressed an “extreme position,” id. at 641:  \nthat there are no “standards by which to evaluate the President’s exercise of [his NEA] authority” \nand that the emergency determination has been “le[ft] to the President,” Defs.’ MTD at 21.  That \nposition would result in a “sweeping delegation of legislative power,” Indus. Union, 448 U.S. at \n646, empowering the President to declare an emergency on a whim—or more likely, whenever he \nloses a political battle—and thereby unlock breathtaking executive authority under a wide array of \nseparate statutes.  See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. § 606(c) (in event of emergency, President may direct “the \nclos[ure] of any station for radio communication”); 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3 (in event of emergency, \nSecretary of Health and Human Services may authorize use of unapproved “drug, device, or \nbiological product”).  “[I]t is unreasonable to assume that Congress intended to give the [President] \nth[is] unprecedented power.”  Indus. Union, 448 U.S. at 645.  Because another “construction of \nthe statute [would] avoid[] this kind of open-ended grant”—and in fact would best cohere with the \n9 Although only a plurality of the Court reached this conclusion, that was because then-\nJustice Rehnquist would have gone even further and held the statute unconstitutional under the \nnondelegation doctrine.  Id.at 686 (“We ought not to shy away from our judicial duty to invalidate \nunconstitutional delegations of legislative authority . . . .”) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in the \njudgment).  \n25\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 37 of 64\nplain meaning of “emergency”—that construction “should certainly be favored.” Id.at 646.10\nB. If Read to Authorize the Proclamation, the NEA Is Unconstitutional \nArticle I, § 1 of the Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a \nCongress of the United States.”  “This text permits no delegation of those powers.”  Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 472.  In a nondelegation challenge, then, “the constitutional question is whether the statute \n[at issue] has delegated legislative power” to the Executive Branch.  Id. \nThe Supreme Court has developed the “intelligible principle” test to determine whether \nCongress has violated the nondelegation doctrine.  Under that test, if “Congress shall lay down by \nlegislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body [to whom power is delegated] \nis directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.”  \nJ.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928); see United States v. Whaley,\n577 F.3d 254, 263 (5th Cir. 2009).  An intelligible principle must not only be clear enough to guide \nthe Executive, but it must also enable the Judiciary to evaluate whether the Executive has acted \nwithin the bounds of its authority.  See, e.g.,Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 423, 425 (1944) \n(requiring that courts be able to see “in an appropriate proceeding” that there is a “substantial \nbasis” for the executive action and that the “will of Congress has been obeyed”). \nUnder the intelligible principle test, “the degree of [executive] discretion that is acceptable \nvaries according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.”  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475.  \nWhereas Congress itself must regulate “important subjects,” it has more leeway to delegate in \n10 By flagrantly disregarding the NEA through his declaration of a fabricated emergency, \nthe President has also violated his “most important constitutional duty, to ‘take Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed.’”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 577 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, § 3); seeAm. Compl. \nCount VII.  The Take Care Clause would be rendered a dead letter if construed to authorize bad- \nfaith presidential actions designed to subvert the will of another governmental branch.  As the \nSupreme Court explained in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), “the \nPresident’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be the \nlawmaker.”  Id. at 587.\n26\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 38 of 64\nareas of “less interest.”  Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 43 (1825).  So, for example, \nwhile Congress “must provide substantial guidance on setting air standards that affect the entire \nnational economy,” it need not flesh out relatively minor matters, like the definition of “country \nelevators.” Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475. \nIn Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), the Supreme Court applied the \nnondelegation  doctrine  to  invalidate  a  statute  “authoriz[ing]  [the  President]  to  prohibit  the \ntransportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum” products in excess of state \nproduction quotas. Id. at 406.  Because regulation of oil transportation was a question “of \nlegislative policy,” the Court asked whether Congress had “set up a standard for the President’s \naction,” or “required any finding by the President in the exercise of the authority to enact the \nprohibition.” Id.at 415. The Court held that the statute did not do so:  it “establishe[d] no criterion \nto  govern  the  President’s”  decision  of  “whether  or  in  what  circumstances  or  under  what \nconditions” to prohibit oil transportation.  Id. Nor did it “require any finding by the President as a \ncondition of his action.”  Id.  Instead, the statute gave the President “unlimited authority to \ndetermine the policy and to lay down the prohibition, or not to lay it down, as he may see fit,” \nunguided by any “standard or rule.”  Id. at 415, 418; see id. at 418 (“The Congress left the matter \nto the President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.”).  Accordingly, the Court \nconcluded, Congress had unconstitutionally “transfer[red] . . . its lawmaking function . . . to the \nPresident.”  Id. at 430. \nThe NEA, as Defendants have construed it, suffers from the same constitutional infirmity.  \nAs earlier explained, the Act permits the President to claim “special or extraordinary power[s]” \nunder numerous separate statutes whenever he declares an “emergency.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621.  By \nits terms, the Act does not define “emergency” or provide any intelligible principle to guide the \n27\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 39 of 64\nPresident’s emergency determination.  As a result, the natural approach is to construe “emergency” \nin  accordance  with  its  ordinary  meaning—an  unforeseen  circumstance  requiring  immediate \naction—which would thereby give the President the requisite intelligible principle from which to \noperate. See supra at 20-25. \nDefendants, however, have rejected this approach.  In their view, because the NEA “does \nnot define the term national emergency or provide courts with any standards by which to evaluate \nthe President’s exercise of this authority,” Congress has “le[ft] to the President the determination \nabout when and under what circumstances to declare a national emergency.”  Defs.’ MTD at 21.  \nMoreover, Defendants have asserted, “[t]he NEA sets forth no criteria from which the Court could \njudge the President’s action or make a determination about whether a particular issue constitutes \na national emergency.”  Id. at 26. \nUnder  this  (flawed)  reading,  the  NEA  amounts  to  an  unconstitutional  delegation  of \nlegislative  power.    The  NEA,  Defendants  have  argued,  provides  no  “standards”  to  guide \npresidential action.  Id. at 21.  That is another way of saying that the statute lacks an intelligible \nprinciple.  See Panama Refining, 293 U.S. at 418 (invalidating statute because it established no \n“standard or rule” to govern the President’s determination).  And the NEA, Defendants have \ncontended, “sets forth no criteria from which” a court can evaluate the President’s emergency \ndetermination.  Defs.’ MTD at 26.  That is yet another way of saying that the statute flunks the \nintelligible principle test.  See Yakus, 321 U.S. at 423 (courts need “substantial basis” for \nevaluating executive action). \nIn  fact,  under  Defendants’  reading,  the  delegation  here  is  even  more  flagrantly \nunconstitutional than the one in Panama Refining.  In both cases, the relevant statute left “the \nmatter to the President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.”  Panama Refining,\n28\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 40 of 64\n293 U.S. at 418.  But there, at least the delegation took place within a relatively confined area of \neconomic policy.  See Whitman, 531 U.S. at 475 (“[T]he degree of [executive] discretion that is \nacceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.”); Whaley, 577 \nF.3d at 264 (upholding delegation because “the authority delegated is relatively small”).  Here, by \ncontrast, the delegation would authorize the President to “affect the entire nation[],” Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 475—giving him access to scores of new funds and policymaking powers—simply by \nmaking the unreviewable determination that an emergency exists.  Were the Judiciary to bless such \na delegation, the only future limit on presidential power would be the President’s own imagination.  \nSee Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 650 (Jackson, J., concurring) (emergencies “afford a ready pretext \nfor usurpation”); id. at 652 (“[E]mergency powers are consistent with free government only when \ntheir control is lodged elsewhere than in the Executive who exercises them.”). \nIf all this were not enough, two other aspects of the delegation in this case exacerbate its \nunconstitutionality.  First, the NEA delegates power directly to the President, as opposed to an \nadministrative  agency.    Unlike  an  administrative  agency,  which  is  subject  to  procedural \nrequirements and robust judicial review, see5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 553, 706, the President can act with \nspeed and insulation—often enacting and implementing policies long before courts can review \nthem. The President’s deployment of legislative authority therefore threatens the separation of \npowers and, in turn, individual liberty, to a greater extent than an administrative agency’s.  See\nBond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011) (“The structural principles secured by the \nseparation of powers protect the individual”).  For this reason, it is no surprise that the two cases \nin  which  the  Supreme  Court  has  found  nondelegation-doctrine  violations  involved  direct \ndelegations to the President.  See Panama Refining, 293 U.S. 388; A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. \nv. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). \n29\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 41 of 64\nSecond, the delegation opens the door to the President spending appropriated funds in \nviolation of their assigned purpose.  Appropriating funds is a uniquely legislative function:  The \nAppropriations Clause vests Congress with the “exclusive power over the federal purse” and forms \nthe “bulwark of the Constitution’s separation of powers.”  U.S. Dep’t of Navy v. FLRA, 665 F.3d \n1339, 1346-47 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Part III infra.  When “the decision to spend \n[is] determined by the Executive alone, without adequate control by the citizen’s Representatives \nin Congress, liberty is threatened.”  Clinton, 524 U.S. at 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Under \nDefendants’ reading of the NEA, Congress has given the President unconstrained authority to \ndeclare an emergency and thereby use funds appropriated for other purposes to address that \nemergency.  See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. § 2808 (in event of emergency declaration, allowing expenditures \non “military construction projects”).  On this view, in other words, Congress has licensed the \nPresident to usurp one of its quintessential functions.  Not only does this consequence render \nDefendants’ statutory interpretation unreasonable, but it also renders the constitutional violation \nthat would result from that interpretation all the more egregious. \nIII. DEFENDANTS’ USE OF FUNDS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL VIOLATES \nTHE APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE \nEven if the Proclamation were lawful, Defendants’ plan to build a border wall could not \nproceed.  That is because the plan entails spending funds for purposes that Congress never \nauthorized,  in  direct  contravention  of  the  Appropriations  Clause.    Because  of  Defendants’ \nAppropriations Clause violations, their plan to build a border wall—and all actions carried out in \naccordance with that plan—must be declared unlawful and enjoined. \n“The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not \nthe President.”  City & Cty. of S.F., 897 F.3d at 1231; Dep’t of Navy, 665 F.3d at 1348 (“Congress’s \ncontrol over federal expenditures is absolute.” (quotation omitted)).  In The Federalist Papers,\n30\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 42 of 64\nJames Madison described that power as “the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \nconstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people.”  The Federalist No. 58.  And in \nhis own constitutional commentary, Joseph Story deemed it “highly proper” that “[C]ongress \nshould possess the power to decide how and when any money should be applied,” because “[i]f it \nwere otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the \nnation  .  .  .  and  might  apply  all  its  moneyed  resources  at  his  pleasure.”    2  Joseph  Story, \nCommentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1348 (3d ed. 1851). \nThe key source of Congress’s power of the purse is the Appropriations Clause, which \ndeclares that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  By its terms, the Clause “provides an explicit rule of \ndecision”:  “the payment of money from the Treasury must be authorized by a statute.”  OPM v. \nRichmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990); see Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 \n(1937) (“[N]o money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of \nCongress.”).  That means “that the expenditure of public funds is proper only whenauthorized by \nCongress, not that public funds may be expended unless prohibited by Congress.” United States \nv. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 321 (1976) (emphasis added); see Dep’t of Navy, 665 F.3d at 1348 \n(“[A]ll uses of appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress; the mere absence \nof a prohibition is not sufficient.”).  Thus, “[w]here Congress has addressed [a] subject” and \n“authorized expenditures where a condition is met, the clear implication is that where the condition \nis not met, the expenditure is not authorized.”  MacCollom, 426 U.S. at 321. \nCongress has “reinforce[d] [its] control over appropriated funds” pursuant to “numerous” \nfederal statutory provisions.  Dep’t of Navy, 665 F.3d at 1347 (citing 31 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq.);\nsee also Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190, 194-95 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“Congress has plenary power \n31\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 43 of 64\nto give meaning to” the Appropriations Clause).  These provisions include 31 U.S.C. § 1301, \nknown as the “Purpose Statute,” which states that “[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the \nobjects for which the appropriations were made.”  Similarly, 31 U.S.C. § 1532, known as the \n“Transfer Statute,” provides that funds may not “be withdrawn from one appropriation account \nand credited to another” unless “authorized by law.”  And 31 U.S.C. § 1341, known as the \n“Antideficiency  Act,”  makes  it  unlawful  for  any  federal  officer  to  “make  or  authorize  an \nexpenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation,” or to involve the \n“government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is \nmade.” \nHere,  Defendants  have  announced,  and  begun  to  implement,  a  plan  to  use  certain \nappropriated funds to build a border wall.  Specifically, Defendants will draw:  (1) $3.6 billion \nfrom DOD funds for military construction projects, see10 U.S.C. § 2808; and (2) $2.5 billion from \nDOD funds designed to support DHS counterdrug activities, see 10 U.S.C. § 284.  All told, these \nfunding sources would provide an additional $6.1 billion toward building a border wall. \nBut in the CAA, Congress itself considered whether to appropriate funds for a border wall.  \nIn fact, border-wall funding was the chief issue that Congress debated, and a standoff over such \nfunding precipitated the longest government shutdown in American history.  See supra at 4-5.  And \nin the CAA, Congress provided only $1.375 billion—not $6.1 billion (or a combined $7.5 \nbillion)—for border-wall funding.  See CAA, § 230(a).  It also made clear that the appropriated \n$1.375 billion is for “construction of primary pedestrian fencing . . . in the Rio Grande Valley \nSector” alone, not along other sections of the southern border.  Id.; see also id. § 231 (“None of \nthe funds made available by this Act or prior Acts are available for the construction of pedestrian \nfencing” in five specified border areas). Finally, Congress barred the use of appropriations to \n32\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 44 of 64\nincrease funding for “a program, project, or activity” beyond the allotted amount, unless authorized \nby a “reprogramming or transfer provision” of an appropriations statute. Id. § 739.  As explained \nin Part III.A infra, Defendants’ funding plan violates the CAA and, in turn, the Appropriations \nClause.\nSeparately, Defendants’ funding plan violates the Appropriations Clause because it is not \nauthorized by the statutory provisions it invokes. See MacCollom, 426 U.S. at 321 (Appropriations \nClause violated if the expenditure is not “authorized by Congress”).  First, § 2808 does not \nauthorize the planned border-wall expenditures because the President’s declared emergency does \nnot “require[] use of the armed forces”; a border wall is not a “military construction project[]”; \nand a border wall is not “necessary to support [a] use of the armed forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808; see \nPart III.B infra.  Second, § 284 does not authorize the planned expenditures because $2.5 billion \ntoward a wall is not “support” for counterdrug activities, and the entire southern border is not a \n“drug smuggling corridor[].”  10 U.S.C. § 284(a), (b)(7); see Part III.C infra.\nA. Defendants’ Wall-Funding Plan Violates the CAA \n“[A]n appropriation for a specific purpose is exclusive of other appropriations in general \nterms which might be applicable in the absence of the specific appropriation.”  Nevada v. Dep’t of \nEnergy,  400  F.3d  9,  16  (D.C.  Cir.  2005)  (quotations  omitted).    “[E]stablished  from  time \nimmemorial,”  this  rule  applies  “to  appropriations  bills  the  general  principle  of  statutory \nconstruction” that “a more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one.”  Id.\n(quoting Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980)).  Applying this rule, the D.C. Circuit \nhas  held,  for  instance,  that  Congress’s  specific  appropriation  of  $1  million  to  Nevada  for \nconducting  “scientific  oversight  responsibilities”  precluded  a  more  general  $190  million \nappropriation for “nuclear waste disposal activities” from being directed to Nevada.  Id.\nThe CAA appropriates $1.375 billion for border-wall expenditures and requires those \n33\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 45 of 64\nexpenditures to be made on “construction . . . in the Rio Grande Valley Sector” alone.  CAA, § \n230; id. §  231.    Defendants’  funding  plan,  by  contrast,  will  transfer  $6.1  billion  of  funds \nappropriated for other more general purposes—military construction, 10 U.S.C. § 2808, and \ncounterdrug support, 10 U.S.C. § 284—to construction of a wall along the entire southern border.\nTheir plan therefore flouts the cardinal principle that a specific statute controls a general one and \nis precluded by the CAA.  See Nevada, 400 F.3d at 16; MacCollom, 426 U.S. at 321.  And by using \nappropriated funds for different purposes than Congress chose, the plan also violates the “Purpose \nStatute” discussed above.  31 U.S.C. § 1301. \nOn top of that, CAA § 739 expressly forbids Defendants’ funding plan.  Section 739 states: \nNone of the funds made available in this or any other appropriations Act may be \nused to increase . . . funding for a program, project, or activity as proposed in the \nPresident’s  budget  request  for  a  fiscal  year  until  such  proposed  change  is \nsubsequently enacted in an appropriation Act, or unless such change is made \npursuant  to  the  reprogramming  or  transfer  provisions  of  this  or  any  other \nappropriations Act. \nSection 739 creates a general rule and an exception.  The general rule is that “[n]one of the funds \nmade available” in an “appropriations Act” (including the CAA) “may be used to increase funding \nfor a program, project, or activity” that was “proposed in the President’s budget request for a fiscal \nyear.”  The exception is that appropriations may be used to increase such funding if that use is \nauthorized by “the reprogramming or transfer provisions” of an “appropriations Act.”  Section 739 \nprohibits Defendants’ plan to fund the border wall, because the plan is barred by that provision’s \ngeneral rule and does not fall within its exception. \n1.  Defendants’ plan is barred by Section 739’s general rule, because it (1) seeks to use \nfunds “made available” in an “appropriations Act”; (2) “to increase funding for a program, project, \nor activity”; (3) that was “proposed in the President’s budget request for a fiscal year.” \nFirst, Defendants’ plan seeks to use funds “made available” in an “appropriations Act.”  In \n34\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 46 of 64\nparticular, it taps appropriated military construction funds under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 and counterdrug \nsupport funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284.  As the White House has acknowledged, all of those funds \nhave been “appropriated by Congress.”  Fact Sheet, note 2 supra.  The military construction funds \nhave been “made available” by Military Construction Appropriation Acts dating back to 1982.  \nSee, e.g., Pub. L. No. 97-106, 95 Stat. 1503; see also 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) (military construction \nprojects “may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds that have been appropriated for \nmilitary construction”).  And the counterdrug support funds have been “made available” by the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act.  SeePub. L. No. 115-245 (2019). \nSecond, Defendants’ plan also seeks to use these appropriations to “increase funding for a \nprogram, project, or activity.”  Construction of a wall along the southern border is a singular \n“project” under that word’s ordinary meaning.  See Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary 932 (10th ed. \n1998) (defining “project” as “a specific plan or design”).  Indeed, the Executive Branch has \nconsistently referred to the wall in this manner.  In the first days of his administration, the President \nsigned an executive order stating that it is “the policy of the executive branch” to construct “a \nphysical wall on the southern border,” defined as “a contiguous, physical wall, or other similarly \nsecure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.”  82 Fed. Reg. at 8793-94 (Ex. 5).  Likewise, \non the day of the President’s Proclamation, a White House fact sheet announced that the Executive \nBranch would use over $6 billion in additional funds to “build the border wall.”  Fact Sheet, supra\nnote 2. \nThird, funding for the border wall was “proposed in the President’s budget request for a \nfiscal year.”  On January 6, 2019, President Trump formally requested $5.7 billion for fiscal year \n2019 “for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border.”  Ex. 28, at 1. \n2.  Defendants’ funding plan is not saved by Section 739’s exception:  the funding increases \n35\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 47 of 64\nit proposes are not “change[s] . . . made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of \nthis or any other appropriations Act.”  Under federal law, an “appropriations Act” is an Act whose \ntitle begins:  “An Act making appropriations.”  2 U.S.C. § 622(5); 1 U.S.C. § 105.  Neither 10 \nU.S.C. § 2808 nor 10 U.S.C. § 284 is found in an “appropriations Act.”  Section 2808 is a provision \nof the Military Construction Codification Act, Pub. L. No. 97-124, 96 Stat. 153 (1982), which says \nnothing about appropriations in its title, nor makes any appropriations in its body.  And § 284 is a \nprovision of the National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 114-328, 130 Stat. 2000, 2381, \n2497 (2016), which by title and substance is not an “appropriations Act.”  Cf.Pub. L. No. 115-31, \n131 Stat. 135, 229 (2017) (separate statute appropriating Department of Defense funds). \nBecause Defendants’ funding plan runs afoul of the CAA, it must be enjoined in its entirety.  \nBut even apart from the CAA, the funding plan cannot be sustained by either of the individual \nstatutes on which Defendants rely, as explained directly below. \nB. Section 2808 Does Not Authorize Defendants’ Border-Wall Expenditures \nDefendants have invoked 10 U.S.C. § 2808 as authority for the Secretary of Defense to \nspend $3.6 billion on constructing a border wall.  Section 2808 does not authorize that expenditure. \nIn relevant part, § 2808 states: \nIn the event . . . of the declaration by the President of a national emergency in \naccordance with the National Emergencies Act . . . that requires use of the armed \nforces, the Secretary of Defense . . . may undertake military construction projects . \n. . that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces. \nBroken down, the provision sets forth three requirements, each of which must be satisfied for \nborder-wall construction to be permitted:  (1) the relevant “national emergency” must “require[] \nuse of the armed forces”; (2) the relevant project must be a “military construction project”; and (3) \nthe relevant project must be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  Id.  None of \nthese requirements is satisfied here. \n36\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 48 of 64\n1.  The Proclamation declares that the relevant “national emergency” is the “current \nsituation at the southern border.”  Ex. 14, at 1.  According to the Proclamation, the essence of that \n“situation” is “the problem of large-scale unlawful migration” and an “inability to provide \ndetention space for many . . . aliens while their removal proceedings are pending.”  Id.  This \n“situation” is therefore inextricably linked to the enforcement of immigration laws. \nBut the enforcement of immigration laws does not “require[] use of the armed forces.”  10 \nU.S.C. § 2808.  Such enforcement requires no military experience or training; instead, it requires \nonly traditional law enforcement experience and training possessed by civilian officers around the \ncountry. See, e.g., City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 42 (2000) (“Securing the border \n. . . [is], of course, law enforcement activit[y].”).  For that reason, Congress has long tasked civilian \nagencies such as DHS and CBP with immigration enforcement responsibilities.11  In fact, even \nwhen addressing “an actual or imminent mass influx of aliens . . . near a land border[] present[ing] \nurgent circumstances”—i.e., the same circumstances alleged in the Proclamation—Congress only \nempowered the Attorney General to authorize civilian “law enforcement officer[s]” to perform \nimmigration functions.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(10). \nNot only has Congress assigned immigration enforcement solely to civilian agencies, but \nit has also expressly disapproved of military officers performing law enforcement duties.  The \nPosse Comitatus Act generally bars military members from “execut[ing] the laws.”  18 U.S.C. § \n1385.  And other federal statutory provisions contain similar prohibitions—e.g., barring military \nparticipation in “search[es], seizure[s], arrest[s], or other similar activit[ies].”  10 U.S.C. § 275.  \n11 See 6 U.S.C. § 202 (assigning DHS responsibility for “[s]ecuring the borders” and \n“immigration enforcement functions”); id. § 251 (assigning DHS responsibility for “Border \nPatrol,” “detention and removal,” and “inspections”); 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(5) (Secretary of DHS \nhas “duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal \nentry of aliens”). \n37\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 49 of 64\nThese laws embody the longstanding norm that the President must avoid using the military to \nexecute domestic laws.  That norm is grounded in the recognition that nothing could be “more \nsinister and alarming” than allowing a President to “vastly enlarge his mastery over the internal \naffairs of the country” through “commitment of the Nation’s armed forces.”  Youngstown, 343 \nU.S. at 642 (Jackson, J., concurring). \nLastly, setting aside immigration enforcement, the act of constructing a border wall itself \ndoes not “require[] use of the armed forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808.  Since 1996, Congress has provided \nfor  construction  of  hundreds  of  miles  of  southern-border  barriers.12    The  military  has  not \nparticipated in any of that construction.  That is unsurprising, since no military training or \nexperience is necessary to build walls. \n2.  Even when there is a national emergency requiring use of the armed forces, § 2808 \nauthorizes  only  “military  construction  projects.”    Section  2801(a)  in  turn  defines  “military \nconstruction” as “any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out \nwith respect to a military installation.”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).  And “military installation” means “a \nbase, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a \nmilitary department.”  Id. § 2801(c)(4). \nGiven these statutory definitions, § 2808 does not authorize a border wall.  The southern \nborder, where the wall construction will be “carried out,” is not a “military installation.”  Id. §\n2801(a).  It is not a “base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity.”  Id. § 2801(c)(4).  \n12SeePub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546, 554-55 (1996) (authorizing Attorney \nGeneral to install barriers “in areas of high illegal entry” and directing construction of 14 miles of \nbarriers  in  San  Diego);  Pub.  L.  No.  109-367,  120  Stat.  2368,  2638-39  (2006)  (directing \nconstruction of barriers in specific areas and designating five “priority areas”); Pub. L. No. 110-\n161, 121 Stat. 1844, 2090 (2008) (allowing DHS to determine where fencing would be “most \npractical and effective”).   \n38\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 50 of 64\nRather, the southern border is an international boundary line.  Nor is the border “under the \njurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  Id. But to the extent the border is under \nany agency’s “jurisdiction,” it would be DHS, which is responsible for “[s]ecuring the borders,” 6 \nU.S.C. § 202(2)—not DOD. \nPast practice highlights Defendants’ misapplication of the phrase “military construction \nprojects” under § 2808.  Presidents have twice invoked § 2808 and the NEA to authorize “military \nconstruction projects.”  First, President George H.W. Bush did so during Operation Desert \nShield.13  Based on that invocation, Army officials opted to use $20.5 million to construct new \nfacilities at an Army base in Kuwait.14  Second, President George W. Bush invoked § 2808 in the \naftermath of September 11th,15 leading to eighteen different military construction projects.16\nSeventeen of those projects occurred at overseas military sites, such as the construction of barracks \nat camps in Afghanistan.  Id.  The one project on American soil involved construction necessary \nto secure weapons of mass destruction.  Id. at 2. \nEvery  past  use  of  §  2808  has  thus  involved  mine  run  military  construction—i.e.,\nconstruction taking place on military sites under the control of military departments.  Never has \nthe Executive Branch sought to stretch § 2808’s words like Defendants have here, to authorize \nconstruction of a law-enforcement project away from a military site.

See Chamber of Commerce v. Dep’t of Labor,\n885 F.3d 360, 380 (5th Cir. 2018) (“[T]hat it took [an agency] forty years to discover its novel \ninterpretation  further  highlights  [that  interpretation’s]  unreasonableness.”  (quotation  marks \nomitted)). \n3.  Even if a border wall were a “military construction project[],” it would need to be \n“necessary to support such use of the armed forces” for § 2808 to allow it.  For instance, the \nSecretary of Defense has previously invoked § 2808 to build military hangars, runways, logistics \nhubs, and ammunition-storage facilities.  See Vassalotti & McGarry, note 16 supra, at 2-3.  Those \nprojects “support” uses of the armed forces by enabling them to more effectively carry out military \nfunctions.\nThe relevant “use of the armed forces” here would be immigration enforcement at the \nborder, because that is what the alleged “national emergency” purportedly requires.  See supra at \n37.  But immigration enforcement is not a valid “use of the armed forces” at all, as discussed \nabove.  And even assuming it were, a border wall is not “necessary to support” the armed forces \nin its enforcement of immigration laws at the border.  Instead, a wall would obviate the need for \nthe military to enforce immigration laws, rather than “support[ing]” its effort to do so.  As President \nTrump explained:  “If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall.”  Ex. \n15, at 6.  That explanation shows that a border wall cannot be “necessary to support” the relevant \nuse of the armed forces. \nC. Section 284 Does Not Authorize Defendants’ Border-Wall Expenditures \nDefendants have also invoked 10 U.S.C. § 284 as authority to spend $2.5 billion on a border \nwall.    Section  284(a)  states  that  “[t]he  Secretary  of  Defense  may  provide  support  for  the \ncounterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency . . . for any of the purposes set forth \nin subsection (b).”  10 U.S.C. § 284(a).  Section 284(b)(7) lists as one such purpose:  “Construction \n40\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 52 of 64\nof  roads  and  fences  and  installation  of  lighting  to  block  drug  smuggling  corridors  across \ninternational  boundaries  of  the  United  States.”    10  U.S.C.  §  284(b)(7).    Relying  on  these \nprovisions, Defendants have announced, and begun to carry out, a plan in which the Acting \nSecretary of Defense will “support” DHS by providing it $2.5 billion for construction of a wall \nalong the entire southern border.  To validate that plan, this Court would have to conclude that:  \n(1) $2.5 billion toward a border wall qualifies as “support” for DHS’s “counterdrug activities”; \nand (2) the entire southern border qualifies as a “drug smuggling corridor[].”  Neither of these \nconditions is met. \n1.  To determine the meaning of “support” in § 284, one must view that term in the context \nof the provision as a whole.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Sea-Land Servs., Inc., 566 U.S. 93, 101 (2012) \n(“[s]tatutory language” is not “construed in a vacuum” and “must be read in . . . context and with \na view to [its] place in the overall statutory scheme”).  Section 284(b) lists ten forms of support \nthat DOD may provide to other agencies.  10 U.S.C. § 284(b).  These forms of support include \nmaintaining  and  repairing  equipment,  transporting  personnel,  establishing  training  facilities, \ndetecting air and sea traffic, constructing roads and fences, establishing computer networks, \nproviding intelligence analysis, and performing aerial and ground reconnaissance.  See 10 U.S.C. \n§ 284(b)(1)-(10).  After listing the types of support that DOD may give, § 284 specifies instances \nin which the Secretary must notify Congress about “support” DOD has provided.  10 U.S.C. § \n284(h).  And there, it states that “[i]n the case of support for a purpose described in subsection \n(b)”—including subsection (b)(7)—the Secretary must offer “a description of any small scale \nconstruction  project  for  which  support  is  provided.”    Id.  §  284(h)(1)(B).    “[S]mall  scale \nconstruction,” in turn, is defined as “construction at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for any project.”  \nId. § 284(i)(3). \n41\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 53 of 64\nTaken together, § 284’s interlocking provisions show that “support” cannot include $2.5 \nbillion toward a border wall.  For starters, an expenditure in that amount for a project of that \nmagnitude is totally disproportionate to the other forms of “support” that § 284(b) authorizes.  In \naccordance with the ordinary meaning of “support”—“assistance or backing,” Oxford English \nDictionary Online (last visited Apr. 23, 2019)—those other forms amount to subsidiary acts of aid.  \nA $2.5 billion outlay for a border wall, by contrast, would be the primary driver of a mammoth \nconstruction project. \nIndeed, § 284’s congressional notification provisions make clear that “support” in the \ncontext of § 284(b)(7) can include only assistance with “small scale construction project[s]” \ncosting no more than $750,000.  10 U.S.C. §§ 284(h)(1)(B), 284(i)(3).  Congress, after all, only \nrequired notification for construction projects of that scale.  Id.  Defendants’ contrary reading \nmakes no sense:  the Secretary would be required to notify Congress of construction projects \ncosting under $750,000, but would not need to notify Congress of a massive construction project \ncosting over 3,000 times that amount.  Congress, as the keeper of the public fisc, would obviously \nwant a description of the more expensive project over the less expensive one, just as any parent \nwould want their teenager to alert them before making a $5,000 purchase more so than a $5 one.  \nNo plausible reading could lead to such an “incongruous” result.  Salinas v. United States, 522 \nU.S. 52, 58 (1997). \nAnd there is still another reason to reject the government’s interpretation of “support.”  By \nreading that word to authorize a $2.5 billion payment for a border wall, the Acting Secretary of \nDefense is “claim[ing] to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power.”  UARG v. EPA,\n573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).  But as the Supreme Court has held, Congress does not grant agencies \nsuch powers through “vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide \n42\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 54 of 64\nelephants in mouseholes.”  Whitman, 531 U.S. at 468.  It is unsurprising, then, that DOD has never, \nbefore now, contended that § 284 authorizes anywhere near this level of spending.  Where, as here, \nan agency announces such a novel contention, courts “typically greet it[] . . . with a measure of \nskepticism.”  UARG, 573 U.S. at 324; accord Chamber of Commerce, 885 F.3d at 380. \n2.    Regardless  of  whether  $2.5  billion  for  a  border  wall  can  qualify  as  “support,” \nDefendants’ reliance on § 284 fails on a separate ground.  Recall that Defendants have invoked § \n284(b)(7), which authorizes support for construction of “fences . . . to block drug smuggling \ncorridors across international boundaries of the United States,” 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7), to build a \nwall that will ultimately span the entire “international boundar[y]” with Mexico.  But that \napplication of § 284(b)(7) cannot be reconciled with its text.  Section 284(b)(7) differentiates \nbetween “corridors” and “international boundaries,” by stating that “corridors” exist “across” such \nboundaries.    So  while  an  international  boundary  may  feature  numerous  “corridors,”  an \ninternational boundary cannot itself bea “corridor.”  Read Defendants’ way, the word “corridors” \nis superfluous, as § 284(b)(7) would allow “fences to block . . . international boundaries.” See, \ne.g., Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001) (rejecting interpretation that rendered word \n“insignificant, if not wholly superfluous”). \nNor  can  the  ordinary  meaning  of  “corridor”  be  stretched  to  encompass  an  entire \ninternational boundary.  “Corridor” means “passageway.”  American Heritage Dictionary 412 (4th \ned. 2006).  Recognizing as much, courts (including the Fifth Circuit) have used the phrase “drug \ncorridor” to refer to discrete passageways through which drugs are transported.  See, e.g., United \nStates v. Vasquez, 298 F.3d 354, 357 (5th Cir. 2002) (referring to “Highway 59” as a “known \ncorridor for . . . drug trafficking”); United States v. Powell, 137 F. App’x 701, 702, 706 (5th Cir. \n2005) (referring to “Interstate 45” as “known major drug corridor”); United States v. Foreman,\n43\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 55 of 64\n369 F.3d 776, 784-85 (4th Cir. 2004) (referring to “Route 13” as a “frequented corridor for illegal \nnarcotics”); United States v. Pino, 855 F.2d 357, 358 (6th Cir. 1988) (referring to “Interstate 24” \nas a “drug corridor”).  Such discrete passageways might cross the border at certain points.  See\nVasquez, 298 F.3d at 355 (noting that “South Texas highways often serve as corridors for illegal \nimmigration and drug-trafficking activity originating in Mexico”).  But the entirety of the southern \nborder is not itself a discrete passageway. \nIV. DEFENDANTS’ ACTIONS VIOLATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE \nACT\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) directs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside \nagency action, findings, and conclusions found to be,” inter alia:  “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity”; and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \nHere, Defendants Shanahan and McAleenan, as Acting Secretaries of Defense and Homeland \nSecurity, respectively, have violated the APA in two separate ways.  First, they have made a \ndetermination to spend funds on a border wall under 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808, even though \nneither of those provisions authorizes such expenditures.  Second, Defendant Shanahan has made \na determination to transfer funds from one DOD appropriations account to another and then to \nDHS, even though the Department of Defense Appropriations Act bars such transfers. \nAlthough  an  agency’s  “allocation  of  funds  from  a  lump-sum  appropriation”  is \nunreviewable under the APA, Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993), Plaintiffs here do not \nchallenge such an action.  Rather, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ use of funds violates express \n“restrictions in [their] operative statutes”—a claim to which APA review fully applies.  Id.at 193; \nsee  Louisiana  State  v.  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Eng’rs,  834  F.3d  574,  585-88  (5th  Cir.  2016) \n(conducting APA review of agency’s funding decisions where statutes constricted agency’s \n44\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 56 of 64\ndiscretion).  Courts have reviewed and invalidated agency fund-allocation decisions in precisely \nthese circumstances.  See Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd. v. Babbitt, 87 F.3d 1338, 1347, 1350 (D.C. Cir. \n1996) (agency’s allocation of funds was reviewable under APA and violated governing statute).  \nThis Court should do the same here.  \nA. Defendants’ Determination to Spend Funds on a Border Wall Violates the \nAPA\nAs  explained  above,  Defendants  Shanahan  and  McAleenan,  acting  pursuant  to  the \nPresident’s direction, have decided to spend appropriated funds on a border wall.  They have taken \nseveral actions in pursuit of that plan:  DHS has requested funds from DOD, citing 10 U.S.C. § \n284, see Ex. 19; DOD has provided Congress with a “Fact Sheet” identifying § 2808 “military \nconstruction” funding that could be used for building a border wall, including funding that \nCongress originally appropriated for use on projects at Fort Bliss in El Paso County, see Ex. 21; \nDOD has confirmed in a letter to DHS that the agencies have decided to undertake “El Paso Sector \nProject 1,” which entails the construction of 46 miles of border walls in the direct vicinity of El \nPaso County, see Ex. 19, at 9; and DOD has awarded a private contract for wall construction in \nthe direct vicinity of El Paso County, see Ex. 24, at 1. \nFor the same reasons that Defendants’ wall-funding plan violates the Appropriations \nClause, it also violates the APA.  Defendants claim that 10 U.S.C. §§ 284 and 2808 justify the \nactions they have taken toward building a border wall.  But in fact, neither of those provisions \nauthorizes such actions.  See supra at 36-44.  Accordingly, Defendants’ actions are “not in \naccordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional . . . power,” and “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  This Court must therefore hold them “unlawful” and “set [them] \naside.” Id.;see Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., 87 F.3d at 1350. \n45\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 57 of 64\nB. DOD’s Fund Transfers Violate the APA \nAs explained above, DOD plans to “support” DHS under § 284 by providing it $2.5 billion \nto construct a border wall.  But even aside from the fact that § 284 does not allow such an \nexpenditure, that plan is unlawful for multiple other reasons. \nDOD has stated that it will provide “support” to DHS under § 284 by transferring it funds \nfrom DOD’s Drug Interdiction appropriations account.  See Ex. 23.  In the 2019 Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-245, however, Congress expressly barred such a \ntransfer.  Section 8045(a) of that Act states:  “None of the funds available to the Department of \nDefense for any fiscal year for drug interdiction or counter-drug activities may be transferred to \nany other department or agency of the United States except as specifically provided in an \nappropriations law.”  Even if § 284 allowed DOD’s intended transfer on its own terms (it does \nnot), § 284 is not “an appropriations law.”  See supra at 36.  Thus, Section 8045 forbids DOD’s \n$2.5 billion transfer to DHS. \nDOD’s plan to provide § 284 “support” to DHS falters for another, independent reason.  \nCongress appropriated $881,525,000 to DOD’s Drug Interdiction account for fiscal year 2019—\nfar less than the $2.5 billion that DOD plans to give DHS.  SeePub. L. No. 115-245, Title VI.  To \nmake up the shortfall, DOD has reprogrammed $1 billion from its Military Personnel appropriation \naccount to its Drug Interdiction Account. See Exs. 22-23. \nDOD may engage in such reprogramming only if Congress has authorized it to do so.  As \ndiscussed in Part III supra, Congress, exercising its Appropriations Clause powers, has provided \nthat funds “may be withdrawn from one appropriation account and credited to another . . . only \nwhen authorized by law.”  31 U.S.C. § 1532 (emphasis added); see supra at 32.  Here, DOD points \nto Section 8005 of the DOD Appropriations Act as the requisite authorization.  That section reads \nas follows: \n46\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 58 of 64\n[The Secretary may transfer] funds made available in this Act to the Department of \nDefense for military functions (except military construction) . . . [p]rovided [t]hat \nsuch authority to transfer may not be used unless for higher priority items, based \non unforeseen military requirements, than those for which originally appropriated \nand in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the \nCongress.\nSection 8005 accordingly authorizes DOD’s reprogramming only if:  (1) it is “based on unforeseen \nmilitary requirements”; (2) “the item for which funds are requested” has not “been denied by the \nCongress”; and (3) the transfer is “for military functions (except military construction).”  None of \nthese prerequisites is satisfied here. \n1.  DOD has reprogrammed funds in order to provide money to DHS for a border wall.  \nThat reprogramming is not “based on unforeseen military requirements.”  For all the reasons given \nin Part II supra, the alleged need for a border wall to impede unlawful immigration is not \n“unforeseen.”  See supra at 22.  To the contrary, as the President’s Proclamation admits, dealing \nwith unlawful immigration is a “long-standing” political issue that Congress and the President \nhave debated over decades.  SeeEx. 14, at 1.  Nor would DOD’s reprogramming be for a “military \nrequirement.”  Enforcing immigration laws is, and has always been, a civilian responsibility. See \nsupraat 37.  And certainly, military members—who are trained to fight wars—are not “require[d]” \nto build a wall.  See supra at 38. \n2.  DOD has requested funds to be transferred so that a wall can be built along the southern \nborder.  But such a wall is an “item” that has “been denied by the Congress.”  Congress considered \nproviding funding for a border wall.  Ultimately, however, it elected to appropriate only $1.375 \nbillion for construction of barriers in specified areas.  See CAA, §§ 230-31.  In so doing, Congress \n“denied” the precise “item”—a $7.5 billion wall stretching the entire border—for which DOD now \nseeks to transfer funds.  Section 8005 therefore fails to authorize that transfer. \n3.  DOD’s transfer is also not “for military functions.”  It is for a wall designed to better \n47\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 59 of 64\nprevent unlawful immigration.  Preventing unlawful immigration and building walls are civilian, \nnot military, functions.  But to the extent building a border wall is a “military function,” it would \nof course be “military construction.”  Indeed, in invoking 10 U.S.C. § 2808, Defendants expressly \nassert that building a border wall qualifies as “military construction.”  See supra at 36.  That poses \na problem for Defendants, because Section 8005 states that no transfer of funds may be used for \n“military construction.”  So under any scenario, Defendants’ transfer is barred. \nWhat’s more, DOD’s assertion of contradictory positions on the meaning of “military \nconstruction” is a classic example of “arbitrary [and] capricious” agency action, in violation of the \nAPA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  An agency may not give a term opposite definitions in two related \nactions, based purely on convenience.  See, e.g.,NLRB v. CNN Am., Inc., 865 F.3d 740, 751 (D.C. \nCir. 2017) (rejecting agency interpretation that “chang[ed] . . . course” without “a reasoned analysis \nindicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored” \n(quotingGreater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970)).  To uphold \nsuch a gambit would be to abdicate this Court’s role of ensuring “rational” agency decisionmaking.  \nSee Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins., 463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). \nFor all these reasons, this Court must “hold unlawful and set aside” DOD’s plan to provide \n§ 284 “support” to DHS.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Not only is DOD’s transfer to DHS prohibited by \nSection 8045, but its reprogramming of funds between appropriations accounts is barred by \nSection 8005 and is arbitrary and capricious. \nV. EVEN IF A PERMANENT INJUNCTION WERE NOT YET WARRANTED, \nPLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs principally request that this Court grant summary judgment in their favor and \ndeclare unlawful and permanently enjoin Defendants’ actions.  In the alternative, however, \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to grant a preliminary injunction, thereby placing Defendants’ unlawful \n48\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 60 of 64\nactions on hold while this litigation runs its course. \nTo be entitled to a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  “(1) a substantial \nlikelihood that [they] will prevail on the merits, (2) a substantial threat that [they] will suffer \nirreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) [their] threatened injury outweighs the \nthreatened harm to the party whom [they] seek[] to enjoin, and (4) granting the preliminary \ninjunction will not disserve the public interest.”  Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee,\n862 F.3d 445, 457 (5th Cir. 2017).  Each of these factors weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. \nFirst, for all the reasons given above, Plaintiffs have established a “likelihood of success \non  the  merits,”  which  is  “arguably  the  most  important”  preliminary  injunction  factor.  \nTesfamichael v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 169, 176 (5th Cir. 2005). \nSecond, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a “substantial threat” of “irreparable injury.”  Gee,\n862 F.3d at 457.  As an official government policy treating the border as a place of crime and \nchaos, the Proclamation injures the County’s reputation every day that it remains on the books.  \nThat reputational injury, combined with the impending border-wall construction, is costing the \nCounty tourism and commercial dollars that it can never recoup.  Likewise, BNHR will be forced \nto divert more and more resources to combat Defendants’ actions as long as they remain in effect, \ndepleting the organization’s coffers. \nThird, Plaintiffs’ injuries outweigh any potential harm that an injunction would inflict on \nDefendants.  See id. As the President’s Proclamation notes, the issue of unlawful immigration is \n“long-standing,” Ex. 14, at 1, and delaying border-wall construction until its legality is determined \nwill simply leave intact the solution that Congress has chosen for dealing with that issue.  \nMoreover, building a wall along the southern border would undoubtedly take years.  A preliminary \ninjunction would cause only a short delay of that lengthy process. \n49\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 54   Filed 04/25/19   Page 61 of 64\nFinally, granting a preliminary injunction would not “disserve the public interest.”  Gee,\n862 F.3d at 457. To the contrary, because Defendants’ actions are unlawful, the public interest \nwould be servedby halting them.  And even if those actions were lawful, the public interest would \nnot be disserved by the minor delay of a years-long construction process. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment should be granted and \nDefendants’ actions should be declared unlawful and permanently enjoined.  In the alternative, \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted. \nDated:  April 25, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \nBy: /s/ Richard Mancino   \nRichard Mancino (Pro hac vice)\nWILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER LLP \n787 Seventh Avenue \nNew York, NY  10019 \nTelephone:  (212) 728-8000 \nFacsimile:  (212) 728-8111 \nrmancino@willkie.com \nKristy Parker (Pro hac vice)\nJustin Florence (Pro hac vice)\nErica Newland (Pro hac vice)\nTHE PROTECT DEMOCRACY PROJECT, INC. \n2020 Pennsylvania Avenue., NW, #163 \nWashington, DC  20006 \nTelephone:  (202) 579-4582 \nFacsimile:  (929) 777-8428 \nkristy.parker@protectdemocracy.org\njustin.florence@protectdemocracy.org \nerica.newland@protectdemocracy.org \nDeana K.

Plaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, and Border Network for Human Rights, Inc. \n(“BNHR”), bring this action seeking relief from Defendants’ unlawful conduct in declaring a \nnational emergency and violating laws of Congress limiting funding for barriers at the United \nStates-Mexico border (the “southern border”). Plaintiffs ask this Court to provide redress by \ndeclaring that the President’s actions are unauthorized by, and contrary to, the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States, and by enjoining the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Homeland \nSecurity, and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, from taking any \naction pursuant to or arising out of the President’s Proclamation of February 15, 2019, on \nDeclaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States (the \n“Proclamation”).1 \n2.  The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to decide how the \ngovernment spends money.  “No money can be paid out of the Treasury [except pursuant to] an \nact of Congress.”  OPM v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990). The Constitution’s \nAppropriations Clause provides that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \nConsequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  And the Spending \nClause grants Congress alone the “Power To lay and collect Taxes . . . to pay the Debts and \nprovide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. I, \n§ 8, cl. 1. As James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers, “[t]he power over the purse may \n[be] the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate \n                                                 \n1 Proclamation, Donald J. Trump, “Presidential Proclamation on Declaring a National \nEmergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States” (Feb. 15, 2019), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2UVgXfY. \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 3 of 50\n \nrepresentatives of the people.”  THE FEDERALIST NO. 58.  Indeed, when “the decision to spend \n[is] determined by the Executive alone, without adequate control by the citizens’ Representatives \nin Congress, liberty is threatened.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 451 (1998) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring). \n3.  The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to make laws.  The \nPresident may propose measures to Congress (U.S. Const. art. II, § 3), and he must sign bills in \norder for them to become law (U.S. Const. art. I, § 7), unless his veto is overridden. But \notherwise the President’s role in our system of checks and balances is to execute the laws \nCongress has enacted (U.S. Const. art. II, § 3), not to make the laws himself. \n4.  The Constitution further charges Congress to exercise oversight of the military. \nPursuant to this power, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385, which bars \nthe military from engaging in domestic law enforcement except where expressly authorized by \nthe Constitution or Congress. This statute enshrines the democratic norm, which took root at this \nnation’s founding, that the military shall not be used for domestic purposes. \n5.  Domestic deployment of the military without legislative authority was such an \naffront to the Founders that they discussed it in the Declaration of Independence, in their catalog \nof George III’s tyrannical conduct:  “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, \nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.”  The Supreme Court has warned of the dangers of a \nPresident deploying the armed forces to disrupt the checks and balances in our Constitution. In \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, Justice Robert Jackson observed that no doctrine could \nbe “more sinister and alarming” than to allow a President to “vastly enlarge his mastery over the \ninternal affairs of the country by his own commitment of the Nation’s armed forces to some \nforeign venture.” 343 U.S. 579, 642 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 4 of 50\n \n6.  The architects of our Constitution understood that concentrating power in a single \nbranch of government would lead to tyranny, and they saw the separation of powers as among \nthe Constitution’s primary safeguards against it. Madison cautioned that “[t]he accumulation of \nall powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or \nmany, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very \ndefinition of tyranny.” THE FEDERALIST NO. 47.   \n7.  Pursuant to this constitutional framework, the President asked Congress to \nauthorize and appropriate certain funding for barriers at the southern border.  After careful \nconsideration and extensive political debate within each House and with the President, Congress \nenacted the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  It includes $1.375 billion in funding for \nfencing in specific locations along the southern border, limiting the fencing to a previously \ndeployed design.  President Trump signed this measure into law on February 15, 2019. \n8.  The same day the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, he also \nissued his Proclamation declaring a national emergency in order to access additional \nunappropriated funds for the unauthorized construction of a border wall.2 \n9.  The President’s Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement3 laid \nclaim to $6.7 billion that Congress did not appropriate, for the purpose of building a border wall \nthat Congress did not authorize. In an attempt to override the limits that Congress had enacted \nand he had signed, the President purported to issue his Proclamation under the National \nEmergencies Act (“NEA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., citing 10 U.S.C. § 2808, the military \n                                                 \n2 References to “border wall” in this Complaint refer to any barrier or border-related infrastructure \nand/or project relating to the construction of a barrier or border-related infrastructure along the \nsouthern border that President Trump has called for and has not been approved by Congress.  \n3 Statement, White House, “President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory” (Feb. 15, \n2019), available at https://bit.ly/2GLqvGD. \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 5 of 50\n \nconstruction statute, as a funding source. He also issued a White House Statement announcing \nthat he would use—for the purpose of building a border wall—money that Congress had \ndesignated for use under different laws.  In particular, the Proclamation and White House \nStatement direct the use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284, which permits the Department of \nDefense to support drug interdiction activities.  As explained below, this law does not allow the \nPresident to spend funds on constructing a border wall or delegate congressional appropriations \npower to the President.  Such acts are all the more unlawful because Congress specifically \naddressed border-fence funding in the appropriations law the President signed the same day he \nissued the Proclamation.  Under well-established rules of statutory construction, a specific law \ncontrols over more general laws and statutes are construed to avoid constitutional conflicts. \n10.  Beyond this, the Proclamation itself and the President’s accompanying statements \nbelie the notion that there is a qualifying “emergency” within the terms of the NEA.  While \nannouncing the Proclamation in the White House Rose Garden, the President acknowledged that \nthe “emergency” was his inability to persuade Congress to authorize the construction of a border \nwall or to appropriate funds to do so in the manner and amount he wants.  As the President said, \n“I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it \nmuch faster.”4   \n11.  By declaring a national emergency where none exists, the Proclamation also \nviolates long-standing laws prohibiting the military from engaging in domestic activity that \nCongress has not authorized.  Invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12302, the Proclamation purports to \nauthorize the Secretary of Defense to deploy Ready Reserve Units to the southern border in \n                                                 \n4 President Donald J. Trump, Remarks from the White House Rose Garden (Feb. 15, 2019), \navailable at https://bit.ly/2GAsKgG. \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 6 of 50\n \ncontravention of laws limiting the military’s ability to engage in domestic law enforcement. The \nPresident’s Proclamation therefore represents a dangerous abuse of executive power of the sort \nthe Framers of our Constitution sought to—and did—guard against. \n12.  The issuance of the Proclamation imposed concrete and immediate harms on \nPlaintiffs El Paso County and Border Network for Human Rights.  El Paso County is a \nflourishing border community that has already been harmed by the President’s declaration of an \nemergency and faces additional imminent harm from the actions authorized by the Proclamation.  \nBNHR likewise has sustained concrete harms to itself as an organization and to its members—\nhundreds of families and thousands of individuals living along the border where the President \nhas declared an emergency, ordered the area’s militarization, and authorized construction. The \nharm to Plaintiffs does not stop with the Proclamation but will further increase with the actions \nalready being taken pursuant to the President’s Proclamation.  The Department of Defense has \nalready transferred funds to provide for wall construction in the El Paso Sector in Doña Ana \nCounty and also planned for further wall construction in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. \n13.  Seeking redress for those harms, Plaintiffs come before this Court to ask it to \nfulfill its role in our constitutional system by saying what the law is and enforcing the plain \nmeaning of statutes passed by Congress and the constitutional provisions on which they rest. \nCongress and the President must each observe their proper constitutional roles. When the \nPresident misapplies a statute as if it delegates to him the constitutional powers of the legislative \nbranch, it is the appropriate role of the judicial branch to enforce the separation of powers.  See, \ne.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998). The executive branch often seeks great \ndeference from the courts in carrying out its discretionary functions, especially where “national \nsecurity” is allegedly at stake. But no such deference is owed to the executive here, where the \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 7 of 50\n \nPresident is violating statutes and usurping the legislative branch’s role. The only deference \nowed in this instance is to Congress and to the Constitution, which grants to Congress the powers \nthat the President purports to exercise. Put another way, having seized the power of the \nlegislative branch to make law and spend federal funds, the President may not attempt to sideline \nthe judicial branch by arguing that it cannot interpret and apply the law. Plaintiffs urge this Court \nto reject any such entreaties. Otherwise, it would license the executive to accumulate all \npowers—legislative, executive, and judicial—in just the way the Framers feared.     \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff El Paso County, Texas (“El Paso County”) is a county recognized as a \nlegal subdivision of the State of Texas. Tex. Const. art. 11, § 1.  El Paso County has the \nconstitutional and statutory authority to set policies and regulations, raise revenue, and \nadminister programs for its residents in certain areas, including administering its County judicial \nsystem and providing health and social services to many County residents regardless of their \nnational origin.  \n15.  Plaintiff El Paso County is bilingual, bi-national, multicultural, and \ngeographically distinct. El Paso County has over 800,000 residents, more than 82 percent of \nwhom are Hispanic and more than 25 percent of whom are foreign born. It is part of the largest \nborder community on the Rio Grande and one of the safest communities in the nation. El Paso \nCounty takes great pride in protecting all its residents and its values, and has been a leader in the \nfight against discrimination of all types for decades, with a special focus on protecting the civil \nrights of its immigrant communities. \n16.  Plaintiff Border Network for Human Rights is a community-based membership \norganization incorporated in Texas with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  Founded in 1998, BNHR \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 8 of 50\n \nis one of the leading human rights advocacy and immigration reform organizations located at the \nsouthern border. BNHR has over 5,000 members in West Texas and southern New Mexico. For \nover 20 years, it has worked with border communities to fulfill its mission: to use human rights \neducation to organize and mobilize border communities and to ignite change in immigration and \nborder enforcement policy and practice.  BNHR facilitates the education, organizing, and \nparticipation of marginalized border communities in defending and promoting human and civil \nrights. BNHR supports these communities’ work to create political, economic, and social \nconditions where every human being is equal in dignity and rights. BNHR brings this action on \nits own behalf, but in so doing seeks to protect the interests of its members, who live and work in \nEl Paso County and southern New Mexico.  \n17.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States, and is sued in \nhis official capacity. He issued the Proclamation in contravention of the NEA, other statutes, and \nthe United States Constitution. \n18.  Defendant Patrick M. Shanahan is the Acting Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Defense (“DOD”), and is sued in his official capacity. According to the \nProclamation and White House announcement of February 15, 2019, Acting Secretary Shanahan \nis responsible for exercising military construction authority and spending under 10 U.S.C. \n§ 2808, for reprogramming funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284, for deploying Ready Reserve Units to \nthe southern border under 10 U.S.C. § 12302, and for taking other action to use or support the \nuse of those authorities, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over \nborder lands. \n19.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and is sued in his official capacity. According to the \n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 9 of 50\n \nProclamation, Acting Secretary McAleenan is responsible for taking all appropriate actions to \nuse or support the use of 10 U.S.C. § 2808 and 10 U.S.C. § 12302, including, if necessary, the \ntransfer and acceptance of jurisdiction over border lands. \n20.  Defendant Todd T. Semonite is the Commanding General of the United States \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and is sued in his official capacity.  The Army Corps of Engineers is \nresponsible for awarding construction contracts pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808 and 10 U.S.C. \n§ 284.   \n21.  Defendant David Bernhardt is Acting Secretary of the United States Department \nof the Interior, and is sued in his official capacity. According to the Proclamation, Acting \nSecretary Bernhardt is responsible for taking all appropriate actions to use or support the use of \n10 U.S.C. § 2808 and 10 U.S.C. § 12302, including, if necessary, the transfer and acceptance of \njurisdiction over border lands. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \naction arises under the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \nthe NEA, and other federal statutes.  \n23.  This Court is authorized to award the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \nunder the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706, and its \nequitable powers.  \n24.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). A \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred in this district, the Plaintiffs \nreside in this district, and each Defendant is an officer of the United States sued in his or her \nofficial capacity.   \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 10 of 50\n \nRELEVANT STATUTORY BACKGROUND \nA.  The 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act  \n25.  Congress passed and the President signed into law the 2019 Consolidated \nAppropriations Act on February 15, 2019.  Congress enacted the measure after extensive debate, \nincluding a government shutdown, over the appropriate funding levels for border wall \nconstruction. \n26.  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress authorized and appropriated the \nexpenditure of $1.375 billion to repair certain existing border fencing or barriers and to provide \nfor 55 miles of new fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, using a previously deployed \ndesign.  This was less funding, fewer miles of fencing, and a different design than the President \nhad proposed in his fiscal year 2019 budget request.  \nB.  The National Emergencies Act  \n27.  Congress enacted the NEA in 1976 with overwhelming majorities in both houses, \nrecognizing that presidents were overusing the powers that Congress had granted them to act \nquickly in situations where Congress lacked adequate time to do so. The NEA terminated \nexisting emergencies (some of which had persisted for decades) and created a new framework to \ncabin the President’s authority. 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. The NEA’s primary purpose was to \nprevent the President from exercising unbounded authority to declare emergencies and to \ncontinue states of emergency in perpetuity. \n28.  The NEA provides: “with respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, \nduring the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is \nauthorized to declare such national emergency.” 50 U.S.C. § 1621. \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 11 of 50\n \n29.  The NEA does not define the term “emergency,” so it is construed “‘in \naccordance with [its] ordinary meaning.’” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369, 376 (2013) (citation \nomitted).  In 1976, “emergency” was understood, as it is today, as an unforeseen combination of \ncircumstances that calls for immediate action.  \n30.  The NEA further provides that when the President declares an emergency, he \nmust specify which statutes authorize the acts he proposes to address it: “When the President \ndeclares a national emergency, no powers or authorities made available by statute for use in the \nevent of an emergency shall be exercised unless and until the President specifies the provisions \nof law under which he proposes that he, or other officers will act.” 50 U.S.C. § 1631. \n31.  The NEA thus permits the President to direct the use of certain resources, but only \nin a qualifying emergency and only in the manner and to the extent that Congress has previously \nauthorized by statute. While the NEA gives the President broad authority to declare an \nemergency, it does not permit the President to do so when no emergency exists, or to fabricate an \nimproper or pretextual basis for the declaration. And even under a proper declaration of \nemergency, the NEA does not give the President the power to do anything he wants.  \n32.  The statute’s legislative history makes clear that the NEA was intended to ensure \nthat “the extraordinary powers which now reside in the hands of the Chief Executive . . . could \nbe utilized only when emergencies actually exist”; that “[r]eliance on emergency authority, \nintended for use in crisis situations would no longer be available in non-crisis situations”; and \nthat “the United States travels a road marked by carefully constructed legal safeguards.”5  \n                                                 \n5 S. Rep. No. 94-1168, at 291 (1976), available at https://bit.ly/2UYaRvb. \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 12 of 50\n \nSenator Charles Mathias, Republican from Maryland and one of the Act’s co-sponsors, called it a \n“safeguard” against abuses of presidential power.6   \n33.  Nothing in the NEA suggests that it was intended to delegate congressional \nappropriations power, or any other legislative power, to the President. \nC.  The Specific Statutes and Authorities Invoked in the Proclamation \n34.  The Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement invoke 10 U.S.C. \n§ 2808(a), which permits certain military construction activities during national emergencies and \n10 U.S.C. § 284, which allows specified counterdrug activities for the Department of Defense.  \nThese statutes do not permit the President to override specific congressional appropriations for \nconstruction at the southern border or specific authorizations for the use of the United States \nmilitary, either by their plain language or under the constitutional separation of powers.  \n  1.  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) \n35.  Article I enumerates congressional powers over the military and national defense. \nCongress has the power to make and limit military appropriations, raise and support armies, \nprovide for and maintain a navy, declare war, and provide for organizing and calling forth the \nnational guard. And Congress has taken specific action to enforce its powers to oversee the \nmilitary, exercising extensive oversight and spending authority over military construction \nthrough the enactment of the Military Construction Codification Act and the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.  \n36.  The Military Construction Codification Act provides a narrowly cabined \nexception to the requirement of congressional authorization for all military construction projects. \nIt provides that, in the event the President declares war or a national emergency under the NEA \n                                                 \n6 Id. \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 13 of 50\n \nthat “requires use of the armed forces,” the Secretary of Defense “may undertake military \nconstruction projects . . . not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use \nof the armed forces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  \n37.  Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a), a president could order military construction to \nsupport the use of U.S. troops that were deployed to respond to a national emergency of a kind \nrequiring use of the armed forces. But the statute vests the authority to determine whether the \nnational emergency “requires use of the armed forces” in the Secretary of Defense, not the \nPresident. See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to take certain actions \n“in the event of” a national emergency “that requires use of the armed forces”). A president’s \nattempt to make this determination in place of the Secretary of Defense is therefore without force \nor effect. And any determination by the Secretary of Defense that “use of the armed forces” is \n“require[d]” must be made consistent with the APA. \n38.  Even if a President had authority to determine that the use of the armed forces is \nrequired and could thereby unilaterally invoke the powers created by section 2808, any \ninvocation of the statute must be consistent with the statute’s terms.  The statute authorizes a \nconstruction project “necessary to support . . . use of the armed forces,” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  It \ndoes not authorize deploying the armed forces for purposes of engaging in a domestic, non-\nmilitary construction project.  A non-military construction project does not become an authorized \nexercise of the statute simply by deploying troops to do such work—that approach would turn \nthe statute on its head.  \n39.  In addition, the statute defines “military construction” in subsection (a) of 10 \nU.S.C. § 2801 as a project “carried out with respect to a military installation,” defined as “a base, \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 14 of 50\n \ncamp, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military \ndepartment.” \n40.  History makes clear the meaning of “military installation” under 10 U.S.C. \n§ 2808.  Presidents have twice invoked military construction authority pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \n§ 2808 and the NEA. President George H.W. Bush invoked the pair of statutes during Operation \nDesert Shield, and President George W. Bush invoked them in the aftermath of the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001. According to the Congressional Research Service, “from 2001 \nthrough 2014, the [Department of Defense] funded a total of 18 projects under 10 U.S.C. § 2808, \nafter the President invoked the NEA, with a combined value of $1.4 billion. With the exception \nof one project dating from December 2001 related to security measures for weapons of mass \ndestruction at sites in the continental United States, most of the projects took place at overseas \nlocations.”7  Military construction projects funded under the NEA have included, inter alia, \nbarracks and airport runways in Afghanistan and courthouse security at the U.S. Naval Base at \nGuantanamo Bay.  \n  2.  10 U.S.C. § 284 \n41.  Congress authorized and funded the Department of Defense to support certain \ncounterdrug activities under 10 U.S.C. § 284. Within limits, one type of support enumerated in \nsection 284 is “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug \nsmuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.” 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). \n42.  In enacting 10 U.S.C. § 284, Congress authorized the Defense Secretary only “to \nprovide support” for the counterdrug activities of other agencies, not to undertake a major \n                                                 \n7 Michael J. Vassalotti & Brendan W. McGarry, Military Construction Funding in the Event of a \nNational Emergency, Congressional Research Service (Jan. 11, 2019), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2Ipi3zi.  \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 15 of 50\n \nconstruction project.  (Emphasis added).  The statute’s plain language makes that clear. \nSubsection (h)(1)(B) requires the Defense Secretary to give Congress fifteen days’ written notice \nbefore providing such support, including “a description of any small scale construction project \nfor which support is provided.” (Emphasis added). The statute defines “small scale construction” \nas “construction at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for any project.” Congress would not have \nrequired a description of “any small scale construction” projects if it was, at the same time, \nauthorizing support for $2.5 billion of fences. Cf. Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 531 \nU.S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”). \n43.  The scale of the “[c]onstruction of roads and fences . . . to block drug smuggling \ncorridors across international boundaries” authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 284 must also be \nunderstood relative to the scale of the other types of “support” authorized by the statute. Those \ninclude providing maintenance and repair of equipment, transporting personnel, and \n“establish[ing] (including an unspecified minor military construction project) and operat[ing] \nbases of operations or training facilities for the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities.” \n10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(4) (emphasis added). None of these are on the scale of constructing a \nmultibillion-dollar border wall. \n44.  Furthermore, the entirety of the 1,954-mile southern border does not constitute a \n“drug smuggling corridor” under 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). The term “corridor” refers to a \npassageway. At most, section 284(b)(7) allows support for up to $750,000 of fencing along \nspecific passageways across which drug smuggling is known to occur, not an extensive barrier \nalong the international border.   \n \n \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 16 of 50\n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  After extensive debate, Congress has enacted, and the President has signed into law, \nappropriations for a limited amount of funding for border construction. \n \n45.  Since at least 1996, Congress has exercised its legislative authority with respect to \nissues surrounding the southern border and, more specifically, has limited the funding and \nconstruction of fencing along the border. \n46.  In 1996, for example, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”) (Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. C), section 102 of \nwhich authorized no more than $12 million for construction of fencing and road improvements \nnear the San Diego, CA border.  IIRIRA section 102(b)(4) also sets out express limitations on \nmileage, stating that “the Attorney General shall provide for the construction along the 14 miles \nof the international land border of the United States, starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending \neastward, of second and third fences, in addition to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads \nbetween the fences.”  (Emphasis added). \n47.  In 2006, Congress amended section 102(b) of IIRIRA (Pub. L. No. 104-208; \n8 U.S.C. § 1103) to mandate fencing in specific and geographically defined places. For example, \nCongress mandated fencing extending only 10 miles west and 10 miles east of the Tecate, CA \nport of entry; 10 miles west of the Calexico, CA port of entry and five miles east of the Douglas, \nAZ port of entry; five miles west of the Columbus, NM port of entry and 10 miles east of the El \nPaso, TX port of entry; five miles northwest of the Del Rio, TX port of entry and five miles \nsoutheast of the Eagle Pass, TX port of entry; and 15 miles northwest of the Laredo, TX port of \nentry to the Brownsville, TX port of entry.8 \n                                                 \n8 Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3 (2006).  \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 17 of 50\n \n48.  In 2007, Congress passed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct of 2007 (H.R. 5441), appropriating $1,187,565,000 “for customs and border protection \nfencing, infrastructure, and technology.” \n49.  In 2008, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (Pub. L. \nNo. 110-161, div. E), appropriating $1,225,000,000 for customs and border protection fencing, \ninfrastructure, and technology, and directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to “construct \nreinforced fencing” only “where fencing would be most practical and effective.” \n50.  In 2018, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1625), \nagain expressly setting limits as to both money and miles.  Section 230 of this Act limited border \nfunding to $1,571,000,000 for “[p]rocurement, [c]onstruction and [i]mprovements” along the \nsouthern border, to be distributed in specific amounts for specific projects at specific locations.  \n51.  Congress rejected numerous other proposed pieces of legislation for more funding \nfor a border wall.  \n52.  In early 2019, the President asked Congress to appropriate $5.7 billion for \nconstructing border barriers.  He also asked Congress to approve border barrier construction in \nany location, using any design.  Congress considered these proposals in the “End the Shutdown \nand Secure the Border Act” (Senate Amendment 5 to H.R. 268), but the Senate rejected them.   \n53.  Instead, Congress enacted the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.J. Res. \n31), which provides $1.375 billion for “the construction of primary pedestrian fencing, including \nlevee pedestrian fencing, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector,” per section 230. The Act does not \nprovide any funding for fencing in or within hundreds of miles of El Paso, Texas, nor does it \nprovide funding for fencing along the New Mexico-Mexico border in Doña Ana County.  The \nAct provides additional restrictions, including restricting fencing to only that utilizing a \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 18 of 50\n \npreviously developed design, prohibiting construction of fencing within several wildlife areas \nalong the southern border, requiring DHS and local officials to reach mutual agreement about the \ndesign and alignment of physical barriers within each border city, and providing for a notice and \ncomment period.  \n54.  President Trump signed this bill into law on February 15, 2019. \nB.  After signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the President issued a \nProclamation and Statement declaring an emergency and directing the government \nto spend additional funds on border fencing. \n \n55.  On the same day the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, \nFebruary 15, 2019, he also issued the Proclamation along with an accompanying White House \nStatement setting forth the authority under which he purported to act. The Proclamation seeks to \ndeclare a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act and to direct federal agencies \nto take action at the southern border under certain specified statutes. The White House Statement \nissued with the Proclamation further states that $6.7 billion in additional funds “will be available \nto build the border wall” upon declaration of an emergency.  This includes $601 million from the \nTreasury Department’s Asset Forfeiture Fund; up to $2.5 billion under the Department of \nDefense funds transferred from Support for Counterdrug Activities (10 U.S.C. § 284); and up to \n$3.6 billion reallocated from Department of Defense military construction projects under the \nPresident’s declaration of a national emergency (10 U.S.C. § 2808).  The White House Statement \nindicates that “[n]ew projects could include: new levee wall, new and replacement primary \npedestrian barrier, new vehicle-to-pedestrian barrier, and new secondary barrier.”9 \n                                                 \n9 Statement, White House, President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory (Feb. 15, \n2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-\nsecurity-victory/. \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 19 of 50\n \n56.  The Proclamation does not acknowledge the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations \nAct that the President signed the very same day he issued the Proclamation.  Nor does it \nacknowledge other specific Acts of Congress, set forth above, which govern construction of \nborder fencing. \n57.  On February 25, 2019, DHS officially requested that the Department of Defense \nsupply it with military funds to construct approximately 200 miles of barriers along the southern \nborder. \n58.  On February 26, 2019, the House of Representatives passed a resolution pursuant \nto the National Emergencies Act to terminate the President’s emergency declaration.  Shortly \nthereafter, the Senate passed the same resolution with a 59-41 bipartisan majority.  On March 15, \n2019, President Trump vetoed the disapproval resolution.  \n59.  By March 11, 2019, Defendants informed Congress that they were preparing a \ntransfer of funds into the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Narcotics Activities account under \n10 U.S.C. § 284 for diversion to border barrier construction.  This transfer was necessary \nbecause DOD had already spent more than 90 percent of the $881.5 million appropriated for that \naccount in fiscal year 2019, while the administration had announced its intention to funnel $2.5 \nbillion to the wall through that account.  \n60.  On March 18, 2019, Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan sent a “Fact Sheet” to \nCongress identifying a pool of military construction funding sources available for use under \n10 U.S.C. § 2808 to construct border barriers.  Among the military construction funds identified \nas available for such use is $52.3 million for three projects at Fort Bliss Army Base in El Paso.  \nFort Bliss is a primary driver of the El Paso County and regional economy. \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 20 of 50\n \n61.  On March 25, 2019, DOD confirmed the transfer of $1 billion from previously \nappropriated military personnel accounts to the depleted Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug \nActivities account for further diversion to DHS wall construction.  \n62.  In making that transfer, DOD relied on section 8005 of the 2019 Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 115-245.  That section allows for transfers of funds \nonly “based on unforeseen military requirements,” and “in no case where the item for which \nfunds are requested has been denied by the Congress.”  And it further states that transfers may be \nmade only “for military functions (except military construction).”  \n63.  On March 25, 2019, Defendant Shanahan confirmed in a letter to DHS that he \n“ha[d] decided to undertake Yuma Sector Projects 1 and 2 and El Paso Sector Project 1 by \nconstructing 57 miles of 18-foot-high pedestrian fencing.”  El Paso Sector Project 1 entails the \nconstruction of 46 miles of new or replacement border walls in southern New Mexico.  This \nproject will cover the entirety of the border in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, which is \nimmediately adjacent to El Paso County. Residents of Plaintiff El Paso County and members of \nPlaintiff BNHR frequently drive back and forth between El Paso County and the New Mexico \nborder in Doña Ana County, use natural resources on the New Mexico-Mexico border, are \naffected by traffic and congestion in the region’s ports, and will be injured by the construction of \na border wall in this area.  \n64.  In the letter, Defendant Shanahan authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \n“coordinate directly with DHS/CBP and immediately begin planning and executing up to $1B in \nsupport of DHS/CBP.”  \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 21 of 50\n \n65.  According to a spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers, contracts for \nconstruction in these areas will be sent to builders in April 2019, and construction could begin in \nMay 2019.     \n66.  On April 9, 2019, DOD announced the award of a $789 million fixed-firm \ncontract “for border replacement wall construction.”  It further announced that “[w]ork will be \nperformed in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, with an estimated completion date of Oct. 1, 2020.” \nThe Santa Teresa port of entry is 15 miles from downtown El Paso and is used frequently by \nresidents of Plaintiff El Paso County and members of Plaintiff BNHR. The construction of this \nborder replacement wall in Santa Teresa will result in additional harm to residents of El Paso \nCounty and members of BNHR. \nC.  The Proclamation does not meet the NEA’s definition of “emergency.” \n \n67.  As set forth above, the NEA permits the President to act in unforeseen situations \nthat require action so immediate that only the President is capable of ordering it. That is the \nopposite of what the President has done here. \n68.  As alleged, supra, Congress has acted repeatedly to make policy and to \nappropriate funds for construction on the southern border over a sustained period of time. And \nthe President has repeatedly acknowledged that the situation at the border is not unforeseen and \nthat he was not compelled to act with immediacy to respond to it. \n69.  The President and Congress have disagreed over how to address immigration and \ndrug enforcement issues at the southern border for the entirety of the President’s time in office.  \nPresident Trump campaigned on the promise of building a wall along the length of the southern \nborder that Mexico would pay for. During the first two years of his presidency, after it became \nclear that Mexico would not be paying for the promised border wall, Congress declined to grant \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 22 of 50\n \nthe President’s full requests for funding for new border barriers, notwithstanding that the \nPresident’s party controlled both chambers of Congress.  \n70.  For fiscal year 2017, Congress voted to appropriate $341 million to DHS to \nreplace existing barriers on the southern border.10  For fiscal year 2018, Congress voted to \nappropriate $1.57 billion to build or replace fencing on the southern border.11  \n71.  The disagreement came to a head prior to the 2018 midterm elections and \nescalated after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives (but before the new, \nDemocratic-controlled House, was sworn in). As part of his proposed 2019 budget for DHS, \nPresident Trump twice requested that Congress appropriate $1.6 billion for the construction of 65 \nmiles of new border wall.12  Congress three times rejected that request: twice before the 2018 \nmidterm elections, when both houses of Congress were controlled by Republicans, and once \nafter, when Democrats won control of the House of Representatives.  \n72.  There was no absence of action by Congress on border security policy.  There was \nno absence of action by Congress on funding for border fences.  And there was no lack of time \nfor Congress to act. \n73.  In December 2018 and January 2019, the President refused to sign a budget \nresolution that did not contain funding for construction of a border wall, resulting in a 35-day \npartial government shutdown.  The shutdown ended when the President agreed to sign a three-\nweek continuing resolution with $1.6 billion in appropriations for border security, but no funds \nfor new border wall construction.   \n                                                 \n10 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-31, 131 Stat. 433–34 (2017).  \n11 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, H.R. 1625—269 (2018). \n12 See, e.g., Office of Mgmt. & Budget, An American Budget: Budget of the U.S. Government—\nFiscal Year 2019 (Feb. 12, 2018), available at https://bit.ly/2nTPE7s.  \n22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 23 of 50\n \n74.  On January 4, 2019, in the midst of the budget standoff, the President began \nthreatening to reframe his policy dispute with Congress as an “emergency.” On that day, the \nPresident asserted that if Congress did not give him the border wall funding he wanted, he would \ndeclare a national emergency as an alternative. He called the Proclamation “another way of \ndoing it” if he could not achieve his agenda through “a negotiated process”: “We can call a \nnational emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven’t \ndone it. I may do it. I may do it, but we could call a national emergency and build [the wall] very \nquickly, and it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re \ngiving that a shot.”   \n75.  Thereafter, on multiple occasions over the ensuing six weeks, the President \npublicly asserted that he had the power to declare an emergency.  But he acknowledged both in \nhis words and his actions that there was no immediate need to declare one, saying at various \ntimes that he would not do it “right now,” or “so fast.” Instead, the President characterized his \nclaimed emergency power as a backup plan “if I can’t make a deal with people [in Congress] that \nare unreasonable.” This posture stands in direct contradiction with the purpose of the NEA, \nwhich is to empower the President to act when, because of the unforeseen nature of the \nemergency, Congress lacks the time to do so.  \n76.  Following a series of warnings over several weeks, the President finally declared \nan emergency at the southern border after signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which \nlimited appropriations for border fencing to a lower amount and fewer miles than he wanted for \nconstruction of a border wall. During his announcement of his Proclamation declaring an \nemergency, and after recounting his disagreement with Congress over funding for a border wall, \nthe President said that “I didn’t need to do this.”   \n23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 24 of 50\n \n77.  The President’s Proclamation marks the first time a President has used the NEA \nto contravene the clearly expressed will of Congress on a policy and appropriations matter.  \n78.  The President’s Proclamation states that the “emergency” at the southern border \nderives from the fact that the southern border is “a major entry point for criminals, gang \nmembers, and illicit narcotics,” and in his remarks that day, the President repeatedly stated that \nthere was “an invasion” of drugs, criminals and gangs across the border. None of this is true. \nThere is no evidence that the southern border is a “major entry point” for criminals or gang \nmembers. On January 10, 2019, the President stated that without a wall, “you’re going to have \nMS-13 and the gangs coming in” and had previously (February 23, 2018) tweeted that “MS-13 \ngang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands.”  \nHowever, according to the U.S. Border Patrol, of the hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied \nchildren who entered the U.S. between 2012 and 2017, only 56 were suspected of having MS-13 \nties.   \n79.  Nor, contrary to the Declaration, would a wall affect any flow of drugs into the \nU.S.  Although the President stated on February 15 that, “a big majority of the big drugs—the \nbig drug loads—don’t go through ports of entry.  They can’t go through ports of entry,” the Drug \nEnforcement Administration (“DEA”) has stated just the opposite, that “Mexican TCOs \n[Transnational Criminal Organizations] transport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest \nBorder through ports of entry (“POEs”) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.”  In its most \nrecent drug threat assessment, the DEA reported that marijuana was the only illicit drug which \nsaw a majority smuggled between ports of entry.  As to all other drugs, the DEA said “the \nmajority of the flow is through POVs [privately owned vehicles] entering the United States at \nlegal ports of entry.” \n24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 25 of 50\n \n80.  The President also cites “the problem of large-scale unlawful migration through \nthe southern border,” but acknowledges that it is “long-standing.”  Indeed, illegal crossings at the \nsouthern border have declined dramatically over time.  Combining several metrics, DHS recently \nestimated a “91 percent decline” in illegal crossings between 2000 and 2016.  Efforts by DHS to \nEstimate Southwest Border Security Between Ports of Entry, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security \nOff. of Immigr. Stat. 1 (Sept. 2017), http://tinyurl.com/DHSOISReport.  The President then cites \nas his only example of this “unlawful migration” the “sharp increases in the number of family \nunits entering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space \nfor many of these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending.”  However, these families \ncome to the border to present themselves for asylum, which they have a legal right to do under \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a), meaning that the Proclamation’s entire predicate of “unlawful migration” is \nfalse.  Southwest Border Migration FY 2019, U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs & \nBorder Protection (Apr. 2019), https://tinyurl.com/l5p7rgq. \n81.  In addition, there is nothing unforeseen about the “emergency” the President’s \nProclamation describes at the southern border.  Even if it were true, there is nothing unforeseen \nabout the border being a “major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.” \nMoreover, the Proclamation describes “unlawful migration” as a “long-standing” problem.  \n82.  A President’s wish for more money to build a border wall, based on decades-old \nissues, does not meet the definition of an emergency. And construction, in whatever form, is not \nan “immediate” solution to the long-standing “emergency” the President has discussed since he \nannounced his candidacy in 2015.  To the extent there is a crisis at the southern border involving \nmigrants seeking asylum, a wall has no impact because migrants are presenting themselves for \n25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 26 of 50\n \nsurrender.  Furthermore, additional segments of border wall will take months or years to \nconstruct.    \n83.  Furthermore, an “emergency” is not something that is addressed after a purposeful \nweeks-long delay.  \n84.  The President issued his Proclamation six weeks after first suggesting that he \ncould use a national emergency for funding that Congress decided to withhold. During that time, \nCongress voted multiple times not to fund a border wall.   \n85.  President Trump’s treatment of an emergency Proclamation as a backup plan to \nbe invoked only if Congress rejected his policy proposal, along with his usurpation of Congress’s \nrole on an appropriations issue, establish that the President’s Proclamation does not address an \n“emergency” within the meaning of the NEA and that this Court should enjoin its \nimplementation.  \nD.  The Proclamation directs activities that are not authorized by the statutes it invokes. \n \n86.  Even if the Proclamation did lawfully invoke the NEA, the statutes and authorities \ncited in the Proclamation and White House Statement do not permit construction of a border \nwall.   \n87.  The principal funding statute cited in the Proclamation is 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  But \nthis statute does not permit the President to fund border-barrier construction that Congress has \nnot authorized.  To begin, because the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, like the 2018 Act, \nspecifically addresses border fencing, section 2808 simply does not apply. \n88.  Moreover, section 2808 does not authorize border-barrier construction even if \nthere were a bona fide emergency.  As set forth above, in the event of a declaration of an \nemergency that (1) “requires use of the armed forces,” this statute permits the Secretary of \n26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 27 of 50\n \nDefense to (2) “undertake military construction projects . . . that are necessary to support such \nuse of the armed forces.” \n89.  The Proclamation does not satisfy either of these two statutory requirements for \ninvoking section 2808.  First, the Proclamation itself counters the claim that an emergency \n“requires use of the armed forces.”  The Proclamation describes criminal law and humanitarian \nchallenges, as well as long-standing civilian problems on the border—but does not articulate any \nsituation that requires the use of the armed forces. \n90.  Second, the construction of a border wall does not qualify as “military \nconstruction” as defined by subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. § 2801, which describes “military \nconstruction” as a project “carried out with respect to a military installation.” And in subsection \n(c)(4), “military installation” refers to “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity \nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  But “[a] border wall, by \ncontrast, is a civilian structure to be manned by civilian authorities to perform a civilian mission. \nThe troops would not be creating a military fortification for military use.”13   \n91.  The non-military nature of this construction project is reinforced by two decades \nof experience. Since 1996, hundreds of miles of southern border barriers have been built without \nany use of the armed forces. Likewise, policing the southern border has been the function of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and prior to that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nnot the military.14  \n                                                 \n13 David French, Trump’s Emergency Declaration Is Contemptuous of the Rule of Law, National \nReview (Feb. 15, 2019), https://bit.ly/2TWwY56.   \n14 Federation for American Immigration Reform, The Current State of the Border Fence (Jan. \n2017), https://www.fairus.org/issue/national-security/current-state-border-fence.  \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 28 of 50\n \n92.  Beyond that, the construction of a border wall is not (in the language of section \n2808) “necessary to support [the required] use of the armed forces.”  The Proclamation turns the \nstatute on its head, seeking to mobilize the armed forces to engage in a civilian construction \nproject; not to engage in a construction project necessary to support the mobilization of the \narmed forces. \n93.  Section 284 also does not permit using the funds Congress has designated for \ncounterdrug programs for border-barrier construction.  As explained above, this statute only \nallows DOD to provide support for designated small-scale construction projects—not to fund its \nown large-scale construction.   \n94.  Nor does section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act \nauthorize DOD to reprogram funds to provide support for the border wall under 10 U.S.C. § 284. \nDefendants’ purported need to construct a border wall is not an “unforeseen military \nrequirement[].”  And the President’s request for funds above the appropriated $1.375 billion to \nconstruct a border wall was “denied by Congress.” \n95.  In relying on section 8005, Defendants must argue that the border wall is not \n“military construction,” because that provision expressly prohibits fund transfers for “military \nconstruction.”  Yet in relying on section 2808, Defendants press the exact opposite argument: \nthat the border wall is “military construction.”  Both interpretations cannot be correct.  \nE.  The issuance of the Proclamation injures Plaintiffs El Paso County and BNHR. \n \n96.  The President’s Proclamation, through its declaration of an emergency on the \nborder and invocation of statutes allowing military mobilization, causes immediate and concrete \ninjury to border communities, including Plaintiffs.   \n \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 29 of 50\n \nEl Paso County’s Reputation Is Damaged by the Proclamation \n97.  During the latter half of the Twentieth Century, El Paso County, anchored by the \nCity of El Paso, grew as a population and economic center. In addition to housing Fort Bliss, \nwhich continues to anchor the local economy, it was a center for copper mining, oil refining, and \nthe garment industry. In the 1990s, the economy of the region underwent a significant shift with \nthe signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lower-wage manufacturing labor \nacross the southern border displaced low-wage manufacturing, such as textiles, in El Paso \nCounty. El Paso County’s services industry grew in its place. According to the Federal Reserve \nBank of Dallas El Paso Branch, “The growth of the service sector . . . more than offset the \ndecline in manufacturing employment.”15  \n98.  El Paso County and the City within it emphasize tourism as a local economic \ndriver and have various programs for the explicit purpose of attracting visitors to El Paso.  Since \n2016, the County has invested $1,137,582 in tourist promotion, which includes promoting the \nhistoric Mission Trail. For that same time period, El Paso County has also spent $13,003,405 in \noperating the El Paso Coliseum, which, located approximately half a mile from the southern \nborder, draws visitors from all over the country for various entertainment acts. The results of the \nCounty’s promotion of tourism have been impressive. The number of people visiting El Paso has \nsteadily increased since 2014.16  This has led to an increase in the number of jobs in the region \ndedicated to the travel and hospitality industries, as well as increases in government revenues \nstemming from tourism. \n                                                 \n15 Jesus Cañas, A Decade of Change: El Paso’s Economic Transition of the 1990s, EL PASO \nBUSINESS FRONTIER (2002), https://bit.ly/2BLqhMh. \n16 Michael Ikahihifo, Tourism in El Paso Is on the Rise, KFOX14 (Apr. 12, 2018), \nhttps://bit.ly/2GC2PVB.  \n29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 30 of 50\n \n99.  The Rio Grande Council of Governments (“RGCOG”), which is an association of \nlocal governments established under state law that includes El Paso County, has recognized that: \n“The travel industry makes a substantial contribution to local government tax revenue across the \n[West] Texas counties. Local tax revenue is collected by counties and municipalities, as levied \non applicable travel-related businesses and includes the transient lodging and local sales taxes. \nThe economic impact of tourism in most [West] Texas Counties has increased consistently from \n2010 to 2015.”17  This increase includes El Paso County. \n100.  A central driver of El Paso County’s success has been the remarkable safety of the \ncommunity, and just as importantly, the national perception of El Paso County and its environs \nas a safe destination to live, work, and travel. The City of El Paso, located within El Paso \nCounty, has been recognized as one of the top 10 safest cities in the country for two consecutive \nyears based on its low rates of violent crime and property crime.18  El Paso’s murder rate is \napproximately half that of the national average19 and much lower than that of other major \ncities.20  \n101.  These safe conditions have not just allowed for growth in tourism and revenue in \nrecent years in El Paso County; they are the foundation upon which El Paso County has already \nplanned for future growth.  In 2017, the RGCOG’s Board of Directors, which also serves as the \nWest Texas Economic Development District (“WTEDD”), updated the 2016-2020 \n                                                 \n17 Rio Grande Council of Governments, West Texas Economic Development District: 2016-2020 \nComprehensive Economic Development Strategy (Jan. 27, 2017), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2NiIeWX.  \n18 Press Release, City of El Paso, City of El Paso Named Second Safest City in America (Aug. \n2017), available at https://bit.ly/2TZkGsX.  \n19 Jane C.

This strategy lays out El \nPaso County’s economic development plans for the next several years and informs County \ndecision-making and local economic planning.  It projects that the region “will become a \npreferred area for businesses creation and relocation looking for,” among other things, “[h]igh \nquality of life for new and existing residents.”21  It bases this projection, in part, on an \nassessment that one of the “strengths” of the region is “[a]mple availability of land at affordable \nprices,” and that an “opportunity” for the region is the “[i]ncrease[d] awareness of the region’s \nstrong assets.”22  But it warns of several weaknesses that could impair growth, including \n“[n]egative perceptions of low quality and high crime,” “[l]osses due to inefficiency in border \ncrossings,” and “[t]ourism slumps.”  And most notably and especially relevant to this complaint, \nit cites as a “threat” to future growth: “[p]erception of unrest along the Mexico border.”23 \n102.  Prior to issuance of the Proclamation, President Trump’s messages about El Paso \nwere mixed.  Most dominantly, he has repeatedly warned of the crisis levels of drugs, gang \nviolence, and crime taking place in border communities like El Paso. Yet he also has said that \nwhile El Paso was once one of the most dangerous places in the country, it is “one of America’s \nsafest cities now.”24  He attributed that supposed change to the construction of border barriers \nwithin El Paso, but that is not true. Violent crime in the City of El Paso has fallen steadily since \nthe mid-90s, mirroring crime trends around the country.  Even while this trend has been national, \nEl Paso’s crime rates have been substantially lower than other areas its size.25  When El Pasoans \n                                                 \n21 Rio Grande Council of Governments, supra note 17. \n22 Id.  \n23 Id. \n24 President Donald J.

The President then superseded this dispute with his emergency Proclamation, \nwhich described the southern border where both El Paso County and Border Network for Human \nRights are located as the site of a “humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security \ninterests and constitutes a national emergency.”27  He went on to use the full force of the federal \ngovernment to officially declare that “[t]he southern border is a major entry point for criminals, \ngang members, and illicit narcotics,” and, contrary to his statements at the El Paso rally, that “the \nsituation has worsened in certain respects in recent years.” The White House issued a Statement \ncalling the area “highly dangerous.”28  The President declared that the situation at the border \nwhere Plaintiffs are located is so bad that it requires a militarization effort and the deployment of \nthe armed forces.  \n104.  The President’s Proclamation and the activity it directs by its very issuance create \nthe negative perception the County has sought to counter. In particular, the Proclamation is an \nofficial government statement that the southern border is the site of crisis levels of crime and low \nquality of life.   \n                                                 \n26 Justin Wise, Trump: People Saying Wall Hasn’t Made Difference in El Paso Are “Full of \nCrap,” The Hill (Feb. 11, 2019), https://bit.ly/2SJydar. \n27 Proclamation, supra note 1.  \n28 White House Statement, supra note 3. \n32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 33 of 50\n \n105.  The President’s re-appropriation of billions of dollars of funds to militarize the \nregion sends an immediate message to businesses or travelers thinking of spending time or \nmoney in El Paso County that it will be a far less attractive place to work, visit, or live.  \n106.  The President’s Proclamation has, by its very signing, materialized the \nweaknesses and threats identified by El Paso County as to what would derail future economic \ngrowth in its strategic economic plan for 2016-2020. \n107.  In addition, Plaintiff El Paso County is injured by the Proclamation’s frustration \nof the County’s national campaign to promote El Paso’s history and culture and its ongoing \nefforts to attract visitors to the County who will spend money and engage in commerce.  El Paso \nCounty employees who work on tourist and economic development initiatives are daily required \nto defend the County’s reputation and to disabuse misconceptions that, in their experience, and \nthat of their professional advertisers, are a deterrent to people visiting or investing in El Paso \nCounty.  \nEl Paso Is Further Harmed by the Planned Border Construction \n108.  Plaintiff El Paso County is further injured by the Proclamation’s mandate for \nconstruction and the deployment of troops to the southern border, and by the government’s now \nimminent plans to commence wall construction in neighboring Doña Ana County, New Mexico. \nEl Paso County relies on its geographic location, local history, environment, and natural beauty \nto attract development. El Paso County’s resources and development efforts are harmed by \ndisruptive nearby construction, seizure of private property, noise and air pollution, and the \nblocking of aesthetic views of the local scenery.  \n109.  Plaintiff El Paso County’s economy and culture also rely on its proximity to \nMexico and the accessibility of its ports of entry. Substantial delays in crossings at the ports \n33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 34 of 50\n \ninjure El Paso County by making it difficult for people and products to cross the southern border. \nThe government’s policies for processing migrants are currently causing lengthy wait times at \nthe El Paso ports. Nearby wall construction that threatens to restrict or delay use of alternative \nports of entry in New Mexico, or that affects the movement of traffic on nearby highways, \nfurther undermines El Paso County’s status as a desirable place to visit and invest. \n110.  These collective harms, including reputational harm to El Paso County, threaten a \ndecline in revenue for the County. \nThe Proclamation Injures BNHR by Harming its Mission and Diverting its Resources \n111.  During the period in which El Paso County was experiencing both a decline in \ncrime and growth in economic activity and population, various community organizations were \ncentral players in the region’s turnaround. One of those organizations is Plaintiff Border Network \nfor Human Rights.  \n112.  Plaintiff BNHR provides a variety of services and programs for families living \nnear the southern border. These services include working with the community and local and \nfederal law enforcement to promote public safety, informing residents of their civil rights, and \nconducting campaigns to integrate residents of El Paso and neighboring communities into city \ngovernment, public safety departments, and the local economy.  Among BNHR’s long-standing \ncore mission functions is organizing and advocating for comprehensive immigration reform.  \nBNHR has also devoted and continues to devote substantial resources to advocacy opposing \nadditional construction of border barriers and militarization of the border in order to protect the \ninterests of BNHR as an organization and of its members.   \n113.  The Proclamation’s mandate for construction and the deployment of troops to the \nsouthern border injures BNHR in at least four ways.  First, it has forced BNHR to divert \n34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 35 of 50\n \norganizational resources from its normal programming to respond to the President’s \nProclamation. In the aftermath of the President’s Proclamation, BNHR has been forced to spend \nresources responding to the consequences of the Proclamation, including counseling and \nresponding to concerns from members about the effects of the Proclamation on their well-being, \ntheir property and rights, and their opportunities to engage in public advocacy to mitigate the \ndamage to BNHR members. Every weekend since the Proclamation, BNHR has conducted some \nactivity—an advocacy event, a community training, or something similar—related to the \nPresident’s Proclamation. Even more, since the Proclamation, BNHR has conducted 10 to 15 \n“Know Your Rights” presentations per week in member communities. In the three years \npreceding the Proclamation, BNHR conducted between one and three such presentations per \nweek.  BNHR has also hired an additional policy consultant at an organizational cost of $14,400 \nto assist with an advocacy campaign to combat the division and fear sparked by the \nProclamation’s misinformation. Finally, as a direct result of the Proclamation, BNHR has been \nsending regular delegations to meet with members of Congress in Washington D.C. to provide \nthem with accurate information regarding the situation at the southern border; it has hosted \nseveral fact-finding congressional delegations in El Paso; and it has had to increase the frequency \nwith which it works with local attorneys. As of April 17, 2019, these additional efforts have cost \nBNHR $26,956.00—$9,948 toward marches and protests; $7,995 toward travel; and $6,013 \ntoward materials, equipment, rentals, and supplies. \n114.  The efforts in responding to the Proclamation have caused BNHR to abandon \nmany of the services that it normally provides to its members and programs that are central to its \nmission, such as BNHR’s immigration reform advocacy campaign and BNHR’s annual Hugs \nNot Walls event, which aims to build trust between the community and law enforcement, \n35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 36 of 50\n \nincluding border patrol. For years, border patrol granted BNHR a permit to reunite families—for \na day—along the Rio Grande canal. Due to the Proclamation and the diversion in resources it is \nrequiring, BNHR was forced to cancel the event for 2019.  \n115.  Even more, the Proclamation has caused BNHR staff and central members of the \norganization to divert their attention away from activities that are vital to sustaining the \norganization. For example, the day-to-day tasks of Fernando Garcia, BNHR’s Executive \nDirector, have shifted dramatically since the Proclamation. Since the Proclamation, he meets \nwith BNHR’s regional partners and allies on a daily basis to discuss new enforcement strategies \nat the border, he checks in daily with BNHR’s administrative team on the status of various \nfinancial and administrative processes, and he meets with directors twice daily, when he \npreviously only met with them once a day. These efforts have minimized the time he is able to \ndedicate to his other executive director duties, such as fund-raising.  The Proclamation, therefore, \nhas caused the waste of both human and monetary resources that BNHR spent in preparation for \nupcoming Hugs Not Walls events. \n116.  Second, the Proclamation’s mandate for construction and the deployment of \ntroops to the border injures BNHR’s organizational mission.  As alleged above, the Proclamation \nis impairing BNHR’s key programs of immigration reform advocacy and initiatives to build trust \nand engagement between law enforcement and community members.  The Proclamation has \nstigmatized BNHR’s community members, reducing their ability and willingness to cooperate \nwith local and federal law enforcement.  This stigmatization frustrates BNHR’s mission and \ncampaigns, and increases the public safety risk for its members.  And the President’s order that \nadditional armed forces are necessary at the southern border is requiring BNHR to prepare and \nplan for how it will achieve its mission of building trust between its members and law \n36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 37 of 50\n \nenforcement when it now expects an influx of law enforcement and military personnel from \noutside the community with whom it will need to start its mission-based activities anew. \n117.  Third, the Proclamation’s mandate for border wall construction, the now-\nimminent construction along the New Mexico border, and threatened deployment of troops \nharms BNHR’s member families’ quality of life by creating the risk of public safety and traffic \nissues; clogged ports of entry where BNHR members and their families cross back and forth into \nMexico; and the potential for high levels of noise and other forms of pollution from military and \nconstruction activity.  BNHR members have already suffered because of escalating delays in \nborder crossings at the El Paso ports of entry. The increase in time it now takes to cross the \nborder in El Paso has hindered BNHR members in their ability to travel to Ciudad \nJuárez, Mexico, welcome family members from Ciudad Juárez, travel to their places of \nemployment, and travel to medical appointments. BNHR must expend organizational resources \nto respond to these harms to its members.  Additional harms are imminent, as DOD has \ntransferred funds to provide “support” under 10 U.S.C. § 284 for a wall in the El Paso Sector in \nDoña Ana County, New Mexico, and has awarded contracts for construction at Santa Teresa, \nNew Mexico.  Residents of Plaintiff El Paso County and members of Plaintiff BNHR travel back \nand forth in this area, using roads and ports that will be affected by the construction.  \nConstruction in this area of a regional economy will also affect Plaintiffs’ economic interests. \n118.  And lastly, the Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement in intent \nand effect have stigmatized immigrant communities, heightening racial tensions and causing fear \namong BNHR’s member families. The President’s Proclamation and pledge to militarize the area \nbecause of threats he claims are caused by immigrants at the southern border have caused \nBNHR’s member families to suffer.  They reasonably fear race-based violence towards them as a \n37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 38 of 50\n \nresult of the false claims on which the Proclamation is based. They also reasonably fear an influx \nof law enforcement with whom they have not built up the levels of trust that BNHR has worked \nfor years to cultivate in the El Paso community. BNHR member families are afraid to take their \nchildren to school, go to doctor’s appointments, show up at work, and even seek help from law \nenforcement when they need it. The President’s Proclamation has thus put BNHR’s member \nfamilies at greater risk of rights violations.  As a result of all of this, they fear increased public \nsafety risks for children and for the community, which they must take steps now to mitigate \nunless and until the President’s unlawful action is stopped.  BNHR must expend organizational \nresources to respond to these harms to its members.    \n119.  For at least these reasons, the Proclamation has caused immediate and concrete \ninjury to El Paso County and to BNHR. That injury would be remedied by a declaration from \nthis Court that the President’s Proclamation is unlawful and by an order from this Court \nenjoining the Proclamation from taking any effect or federal officials from acting upon it. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Proclamation Violates National Emergencies Act) \n120.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n121.  Under the National Emergencies Act, the President “is authorized to declare [a] \nnational emergency” and thereby invoke certain “provisions of law conferring powers and \nauthorities to be exercised during a national emergency . . . .”  50 U.S.C. § 1621. \n122.  The Proclamation violates the NEA because the current situation at the southern \nborder does not qualify as an “emergency” under that term’s plain meaning.  Whereas an \nemergency is an unforeseen event requiring immediate action, the issue of illegal immigration \nacross the southern border is long-standing and has improved in recent years.  Indeed, Congress \n38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 39 of 50\n \nconsidered the problem of illegal immigration and resoundingly rejected the idea that it required \na wall stretching the length of the southern border.  At bottom, illegal immigration is a political \nissue with which the legislative and executive branches have been grappling for years; it is not an \n“emergency” necessitating unilateral presidential action.    \n123.  In signing the Proclamation, the President himself acknowledged that no \n“emergency” exists, stating, among other things, that: “I could do the wall over a longer period \nof time. I didn’t need to do this.”  \n124.  If the current border situation qualifies as an “emergency,” then nothing would \nlimit the President’s authority under the Act, raising significant constitutional doubts under the \nnondelegation doctrine.  See Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935).  The Act must be \nconstrued to avoid these constitutional concerns and thus to preclude the President’s declaration \nof an “emergency” at the southern border.  See Indus. Union Dep’t AFL-CIO v. Am. Petroleum \nInst., 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980) (construing statute to avoid “a sweeping delegation of legislative \npower that might be unconstitutional” (quotation marks and citation omitted)).  \n125.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin unlawful executive \naction.  See Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1332 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \n126.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by the Proclamation \nand Defendants’ actions taken pursuant thereto.   \nCOUNT II \n(National Emergencies Act, As Construed By the Proclamation, Violates the Nondelegation \nDoctrine) \n127.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n128.  A statute unconstitutionally delegates legislative power when it confers \npolicymaking authority on the executive branch without providing an “intelligible principle to \n39 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 40 of 50\n \nwhich” the executive branch “is directed to conform.” Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. \n457, 472 (2001); Panama Ref. Co., 293 U.S. 388. \n129.  The NEA allows the President to invoke “Acts of Congress authorizing the \nexercise . . . of any special or extraordinary power” whenever the President “declare[s] [a] \nnational emergency.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  The NEA does not define “emergency” or expressly \nspecify any “intelligible principle” to guide the President’s “emergency” determination. \n130.  As noted supra, to avoid constitutional concerns, the NEA should be construed to \nrequire an actual “emergency,” viz., an unforeseen combination of circumstances that calls for \nimmediate action.  Under that definition, the Proclamation violates the NEA, because the \nsituation at the southern border is not unforeseen, does not call for immediate action, and has \nbeen considered and addressed by Congress. \n131.  If the NEA is instead construed to authorize the Proclamation, the NEA amounts \nto an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.  That is especially so, because the \nappropriations authority triggered by an emergency declaration is a quintessentially legislative \npower.  See, e.g., OPM v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990) (the Appropriations Clause’s \n“straightforward and explicit command” is that “no money can be paid out of the Treasury unless \nit has been appropriated by an act of Congress” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). \n132.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin the instant \napplication of the NEA as unconstitutional executive action taken pursuant to an excessive \ndelegation of legislative power.  See Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 801 (1992).  \nDefendants have relied, and will rely, on the President’s emergency declaration to fund a border \nwall under 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  Those actions should be declared unlawful and enjoined. \n40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 41 of 50\n \n133.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by the Proclamation, \nthe NEA as construed by the Proclamation, and Defendants’ actions taken pursuant thereto.   \nCOUNT III \n(Use of Unappropriated Funds to Construct Border Wall Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 Violates \nArticle I, § 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n134.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n135.  Defendants may not “draw[] [Money] from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \nAppropriations made by Law . . . .”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. \n136.  10 U.S.C. § 2808 does not authorize Defendants to spend up to $3.6 billion to \nconstruct a wall along the southern border. \n137.  Even assuming that the President has declared a valid national emergency under \nthe National Emergencies Act, section 2808 places limitations on DOD’s use of funds pursuant \nto that declaration.  In particular: (1) the national emergency must “require[] the use of the armed \nforces”; (2) the funding must be spent on a “military construction project”; and (3) the project \nmust be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808. \n138.  Defendants’ expenditure of section 2808 funds on a border wall satisfies none of \nthese limitations. \n139.  First, the asserted national emergency at the southern border does not “require[] \nthe use of the armed forces.”   \n140.  Second, the construction of a border wall along the southern border is not a \n“military construction project.” \n141.  Third, the construction of a border wall along the southern border is not \n“necessary to support the use of the armed forces.”  \n41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 42 of 50\n \n142.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin unconstitutional \nexecutive action.  See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr. Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1384 (2015); \nFranklin, 505 U.S. at 801.  \n143.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by Defendants’ \nunconstitutional actions.   \nCOUNT IV \n(Use of Unappropriated Funds to Construct Border Wall Under 10 U.S.C. § 284 Violates \nArticle I, § 9, Clause 7 of the Constitution) \n144.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n145.  Defendants may not “draw[] [Money] from the Treasury, but in Consequence of \nAppropriations made by Law . . . .”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7. \n146.  Congress has enacted a series of specific statutes that limit the location, type, and \nfunding of additional fencing at the southern border.  In particular, Congress enacted and the \nPresident signed into law the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which specifically limited \nthe level and nature of appropriations for border fencing, the location of new fencing, and the \ndesign of new fencing.  The Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement direct \nconstruction of a wall that violates each of these limits on new border fencing appropriations, \nlocations, and design.  The Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, in \nturn, have taken concrete steps to carry out this construction pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284.  \n147.  Congress has not appropriated $2.5 billion in funds for the purposes authorized by \n10 U.S.C. § 284 to construct a wall along the southern border. \n148.  10 U.S.C. § 284 allows the Secretary of Defense to “provide support for the \ncounterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency . . . .”  One form of authorized \n42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 43 of 50\n \nsupport is the “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug \nsmuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.”  Id. § 284(b)(7). \n149.  But providing $2.5 billion in funding for a border wall is not “support” under \n10 U.S.C. § 284’s terms.  Nor is a wall stretching the length of the entire southern border a \n“fence . . . to block drug smuggling corridors.”  \n150.  Section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense Appropriations Act authorizes \nthe Secretary of Defense to reprogram funds “for military functions (except military \nconstruction) . . . based on unforeseen military requirements,” but “in no case where the item for \nwhich funds are requested has been denied by the Congress.”  Pub. L. No. 115-245 § 8005. \n151.  Citing section 8005, DOD has transferred $1 billion in military pay and pension \nfunds to the drug interdiction fund tied to 10 U.S.C. § 284 for purposes of building a border wall, \na portion of which will be built in the El Paso Sector, where members of Plaintiff BNHR live.    \n152.  That transfer is not authorized by section 8005.  Defendants’ purported need to \nconstruct a border wall is not based on an “unforeseen military requirement[].”  And the \nPresident’s request for funds above $1.375 billion to construct a border wall was “denied by \nCongress.”   \n153.  The transfer also founders under Defendants’ own logic.  Defendants claim that \nthe border wall is a “military construction project” for purposes of 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  That is \nwrong.  But to the extent the Defendants are correct that construction of a border wall is a \n“military construction project” under section 2808, their transfer of funds is prohibited for that \nsame reason under section 8005, which precludes reprogramming for “military construction.”  \n154.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin unconstitutional \nexecutive action.  See Armstrong, 135 S. Ct. at 1384; Franklin, 505 U.S. at 801.  \n43 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 44 of 50\n \n155.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by Defendants’ \nunconstitutional actions.    \nCOUNT V \n(Use of Funds Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and 31 U.S.C. § 9705 to Construct \nBorder Wall Violates the Administrative Procedure Act) \n156.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n157.  Relying on 10 U.S.C. § 2808, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and 31 U.S.C. § 9705, the \nProclamation directs Defendants to transfer appropriated money for purposes of funding a border \nwall.  Defendants have taken concrete steps to do so: for instance, DOD has transferred $1 \nbillion to the drug interdiction fund tied to section 284, and the Department of Treasury has \nmade available $242 million to DHS.  Such actions, among others, constitute “final agency \naction” subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. § 704.   \n158.  The APA directs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is, \ninter alia, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw”; “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n159.  Section 739 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 applies \n“Government-Wide” and states: “None of the funds made available in this or any other \nappropriations Act may be used to increase . . . funding for a program, project, or activity as \nproposed in the President’s budget request for a fiscal year until such proposed change is \nsubsequently enacted in an appropriation Act, or unless such change is made pursuant to the \nreprogramming or transfer provisions of this or any other appropriations Act.”  Pub. L. No. 116-\n6, § 739. \n44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 45 of 50\n \n160.  Section 739 applies to and prohibits all of the administration’s proposed border \nwall funding.  Those funds have been “made available” in appropriations Acts, and the border \nwall is a “program, project, or activity” for which the President’s budget has requested funds.  \nAccordingly, “[n]one of [those] funds . . . may be used to increase” funding for the border wall. \n161.  The administration’s proposed funding increases do not fall under section 739’s \nexception for “change[s] . . . made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of this \nor any other appropriations Act.”  The statutory provisions invoked—10 U.S.C. § 2808, 10 \nU.S.C. § 284(b)(7), and 31 U.S.C. § 9705(g)(4)—are not “reprogramming or transfer provisions” \nof an “appropriations Act.”   \n162.  Because the Defendants’ border wall funding plan violates the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, as well as 10 U.S.C. § 2808, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and 31 U.S.C. § 9705, it is “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction” and “not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  It therefore \nmust be “set aside.”  Id. \n163.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin final agency action \nin violation of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 702.   \n164.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by Defendants’ \nactions in violation of the APA. \nCOUNT VI \n(Transfer of Funds to Construct Border Wall Under 10 U.S.C. § 284 Violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act) \n165.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n166.  On March 25, 2019, invoking section 8005 of the 2019 Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, Defendants transferred $1 billion for purposes of constructing a border wall \n45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 46 of 50\n \nunder 10 U.S.C. § 284.  That transfer constitutes “final agency action” subject to judicial review \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. § 704. \n167.  The APA directs courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is, \ninter alia, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw”; “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706. \n168.  Defendants’ transfer of $1 billion for purposes of constructing a border wall is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” “contrary \nto constitutional . . . power,” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority.”  It therefore \nviolates the APA and should be set aside. \n169.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to declare unlawful and enjoin final agency action \nin violation of the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 702.   \n170.  Plaintiffs have been injured, and will continue to be injured, by Defendants’ \nactions in violation of the APA.  \nCOUNT VII \n(The Take Care Clause) \n171.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n172.  The Proclamation violates the President’s constitutional duty to “take Care that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed . . . .” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, cl. 5.  The Supreme Court has \ncalled this duty the President’s “most important constitutional duty.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 577 (1992).   \n173.  This duty of “faithful” execution of the laws imposes on the President a duty to \nact in good faith in his execution of the laws.  That encompasses an obligation to act honestly—\n46 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 47 of 50\n \nin good faith—in rendering declarations, determinations, and findings that he may only render \nbecause of a delegation of authority from Congress.    \n174.  The President has not acted in good faith in his declaration that there exists a \nnational emergency of the type described in the NEA.  President Trump has access to \ninformation sources that renders in bad faith his repeated reliance on demonstrably false claims \nto support a declaration of a national emergency and to support other findings or determinations. \n175.  The President has not acted in good faith in rendering his determination that the \npurported national emergency “requires” the use of the military.  President Trump’s public \nstatement that “I didn’t need to” declare a national emergency shows that his purported \ndetermination that the situation at the southern border “requires” use of the armed forces is not \nmade in good faith.  Moreover, by declaring an emergency as an express response to legislation \nenacted by Congress that specifically limits border fence funding, President Trump has not acted \nin good faith. The President’s issuance of the Proclamation in violation of the duty to faithfully \nexecute the laws inflicts ongoing harm on Plaintiffs.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the President’s Proclamation of February 15, 2019 is unauthorized by, and \ncontrary to, the Constitution and laws of the United States;  \nB.  Enjoin Defendants from taking any action pursuant to the Proclamation, the NEA, or any \nstatutes cited in the Proclamation or the White House Statement issued February 15, 2019, or any \nother statutes Defendants have cited to justify actions taken pursuant to or arising out of the \nProclamation; and \nC.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require.   \n47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 52   Filed 04/25/19   Page 48 of 50\n \nDated: April 25, 2019       By: /s/ Richard Mancino_____________ \nRichard Mancino (Pro hac vice) \nWILLKIE FARR & GALLAGHER LLP \n787 Seventh Avenue \nNew York, NY  10019 \nTelephone:  (212) 728-8000 \nFacsimile:  (212) 728-8111 \nrmancino@willkie.com \n \nKristy Parker (Pro hac vice) \nJustin Florence (Pro hac vice) \nErica Newland (Pro hac vice) \nTHE PROTECT DEMOCRACY PROJECT, INC. \n2020 Pennsylvania Avenue., NW, #163 \nWashington, DC  20006 \nTelephone:  (202) 579-4582 \nFacsimile:  (929) 777-8428 \nkristy.parker@protectdemocracy.org \njustin.florence@protectdemocracy.org \nerica.newland@protectdemocracy.org \n \nDeana K.

TRUMP, in his official  § \ncapacity as President of the United States  § \nofA  merica, et al.,  § \nDefendants.  § \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nOn October 11, 2019, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion granting \nPlaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, (\"El Paso County\") and Border Network for Human Rights's \n(\"BNHR\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") \"Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, a \nPreliminary Injunction\" (\"Motion for Summary Judgment\") and denying Defendants•  Donald J. \nTrump, Mark T.

Op., ECF No. 129.  Therein, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to \nfile a proposed preliminary injunction specifying the scope of said injunction and Defendants \nwere given an opportunity to respond.  !d. at 33. \nOn this day, the Court considered Plaintiffs' \"Supplemental Brief Addressing \nScope of Remedy\" (\"Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief') filed in the above-captioned case on \nOctober 21, 2019.  ECF No. 130.  The Plaintiffs were granted leave to file an Amended \nI.  In suits against a public officer in an official capacity who cease to hold office while the action is pending, the \nofficer's successor is automatically substituted as a party.  Fed. R Civ.

On October 28, 2019, Defendants filed \ntheir \"Supplemental Brief Addressing Scope of Remedy\" (\"Defendants' Supplemental Brief'). \nECF No. 134.  After due consideration, the Court is of the opinion that a declaratory judgment \nand permanent injunction shall be granted in Plaintiffs' favor. \nBACKGROUND \nOn October 11, 2019, this Court held that Plaintiffs had standing to sue \nDefendants.  Mem. Op. 32, ECF No. 129.  Further, it held that because the Presidential \nProclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United \nStates (\"the Proclamation\") seeks additional funds for border barrier funding in violation of the \n2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (\"CAA\") generally and § 739 of the CAA specifically, it \nis unlawful.  Id. \nIn its opinion, the Court requested that Plaintiffs \"file a proposed preliminary \ninjunction specifying the scope of said injunction.\"  ld. at 33.  In Plaintiffs' Supplemental \nBrief, Plaintiffs ask the Court to: \n( 1) issue a declaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful \nto  the extent it authorizes border wall  construction using funds \nappropriated  by the  CAA  for  \"military  construction\"  under  10  \nU.S.C. § 2808, and that Defendants' use of funds appropriated by \nthe CAA for \"military construction\" under 10 U.S.C. § 2808 and \n\"support for counterdrug activities\" under 10 U.S.C. § 284 funds on \nbuilding a border wall is unlawful; and \n(2)  permanently  enjoin  Defendants  Esper,  [Wolf],  Semonite, \nBernhardt, and Mnuchin (\"the agency head Defendants\") from using \nfunds appropriated by the CAA for \"military construction\" under \n§ 2808  and \"support for counterdrug activities\" under § 284 on \nbuilding a border wall. \nPls.' Supp. Br. 5-6, ECF No. 130. \nDefendants counter in their Supplemental Brief that the Court should decline to \nenter an injunction and should exclude the Proclamation from the Court's declaratory relief. \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 3 of 21\nDefs.' Supp. Br.  .1, 2-3, ECF No. 134.  Alternatively, if the Court did enter any injunctive \nrelief, Defendants argue that it should enter an administrative stay pending appeal.  ld. at \n13-14.  The Court disagrees with Defendants and will not stay its decision to permanently \nenjoin their use of § 2808 funds for border barrier funding, though it will not extend this \ninjunction to§ 284 funds. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nTo obtain any injunction, a plaintiff must show: \n( 1) that [they have] suffered an irreparable injury; \n(2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; \n(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff \nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and \n(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent \ninjunction. \nMonsanto Co. v.  Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156-58 (2010); see also, e.g., eBay Inc. v. \nMercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006), and Winte?  v. Nat. Res. Def Council, 555 U.S. \n7, 32-33 (2008).  ''[l]njunctive relief is a drastic remedy, not to be applied as a matter of \ncourse.\"  0 'Donnell v. Harris Cty., 892 F.3d 147, 155 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Marshall v. \nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 554 F.2d 730, 733 (5th Cir. 1977)) (internal quotations omitted). \nInjunctive relief never \"follow[ s] from success on the merits as a matter of \ncourse,\" Winter, 555 U.S. at 32, and, \"[a]s with any equity case, the nature of the violation \ndetermines the scope of the remedy.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklemburg Bd. ofE d., 402 U.S. 1, \n16 ( 1971 ).  As such, an injunction \"should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief.\"  Califano v.  YamasaA:i, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); see \n2.  Throughout this opinion, the Court refers to these four factors as the \"Winter\" or \"permanent injunction\" factors \nfor sake ofbrevity. \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 4 of 21\nalso John Doe #1 v.  Veneman, 380 F.3d 807, 818 (5th Cir. 2004) (\"The district court must \nnarrowly tailor an injunction to remedy the specific action which gives rise to the order.\"). \nFurthermore, \"[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude \na declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 57.  A declaratory \njudgment is appropriate when it will \"terminate the controversy'' giving rise to the proceeding. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 57 advisory committee's 1937 note.  It is within the discretion of a trial court to \ngrant declaratory relief on motion of party.  Delno v. Market St. R. Co., 124 F.2d 965, 967 (9th \nCir. 1942) (citing § 6 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act). \nANALYSIS \nTo begin, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should issue a declaratory judgment that \nthe Proclamation's invocation of§ 2808 and the Defendants' use of § § 2808 and 284 funds on \nthe border wall are unlawful.  Pis.' Supp. Br. 2, ECF No. 130.  This declaratory judgment and \nthe permanent injunction would only need to issue against the agency head Defendants, rather \nthan the President himself.  !d. at 2 n.1. \nNext, Plaintiffs assert that a permanent, rather than preliminary, injunction should \nissue to stop the agency head Defendants from using these funds for border wall construction \nbecause the Court's grant of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment was a final judgment \nending the litigation on the merits.  !d. at 3.  Finally, Plaintiffs go through the permanent \ninjunction factors and describe how they meet each.  !d. at 4-7. \nIn response, Defendants call Plaintiffs' requested injunction overbroad and \nunjustified because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate irreparable injury and the Government's \ncompelling interests in constructing border barriers outweigh the Plaintiffs' interests.  Defs.' \nSupp. Br. 1, ECF No. 134.  And Defendants claim that Plaintiffs' proposed injunction conflicts \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 5 of 21\nwith the Supreme Co~rt's recent order staying an injunction that the District Court for the \nNorthern District of California entered.  /d. at 1-2 (citing Trump v. Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. I \n(2019)).  Finally, Defendants argue that the Proclamation should be excluded from the Court's \ndeclaratory judgment as there is no basis for such extraordinary relief that would necessarily run \nagainst President Trump in his official capacity.  Id. at 2-3. \nBecause both sides and the Court agree that any declaratory judgment shall not \nrun against the President, the Court does not address the merits of this argument.  Instead, the \nCourt discusses the merits of a declaratory judgment against the agency head Defendants. \nThen, because the Court's injunction§ 2808 funds does not conflict with Supreme Court \nprecedent, the Court weighs the permanent injunction factors to conclude that a permanent \ninjunction shall be granted in Plaintiffs' favor, though more narrowly tailored than the injunction \nthey propose on both§§ 284 and 2808 funds. \nI.  A Declaratory Judgment Shall Enter Against the Agency Head Defendants. \nPlaintiffs highlight that this Court expressly held that \"[t  ]he Proclamation is \nunlawful\" and \"the funding plan violates the CAA generally and specifically violates § 739.\" \nPis.' Supp. Br. 2, ECF No. 130 (quoting Mem. Op. 24, ECF No. 129) (internal quotations \nomitted).  In accordance with that holding, Plaintiffs argue that this Court should issue a \ndeclaratory judgment that the Proclamation is unlawful to the extent it authorizes border wall \nconstruction using funds that the CAA appropriated for \"military construction\" under § 2808. \nld. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 220l(a) (court \"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any \ninterested party seeking such declaration\"); ECF No. 52, at 4 7 (Plaintiffs seeking declaratory \nrelief)).  And, according to Plaintiffs, the declaratory judgment should state that the agency head \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 6 of 21\nDefendants' use of CAA funds appropriated for. \"military construction\" under § 2808, and \n\"support for counterdrug activities\" under § 284 on building a border wall is unlawful.  I d. \nDefendants counter that \"such an order would not be appropriate in light of the \nCourt's merits determination, which did not conclude the Proclamation was unlawful.\"  Defs.' \nSupp. Mot. 13, ECF No. 134.  Defendants highlight that this Court's Memorandum Opinion \nonly concluded that the use of§ 2808 was inconsistent with the CAA.  I d.  Thus, according to \nDefendant, no declaratory judgment .should issue against the Proclamation.  I d. \nA declaratory judgment is appropriate here because it will \"terminate the \ncontroversy\" giving rise to the proceeding.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 advisory committee's 1937 \nnote.  Contrary to Defendants' argument, the conclusion in the Memorandum Opinion reads: \n\"[b ]ecause the Proclamation seeks additional funds for border barrier funding in violation of the \nCAA generally and§ 739 of the CAA specifically, it is unlawful.  There is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact, so Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Mem. Op. 32, \nECF No. 129.  It is within this Court's discretion to grant declaratory relief on Plaintiffs' \nmotion.  See Delno, 124 F.2d at 967 (citing§ 6 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act). \nThus, a declaratory judgment shall be granted in Plaintiffs' favor against the agency head \nDefendants' attempt to use CAA funds appropriated for \"military construction\" under§ 2808 for \nborder wall construction above and beyond the lawfully appropriated $1.375 billion.  CAA \n§§ 230, 231.  However, it will not extend to the CAA funds appropriated for \"support for \ncounterdrug activities\" under § 284, explained further below. \nII.  The Court's Decision to Enjoin Does Not Conflict.with Supreme Court Precedent. \nDefendants point out that the Supreme Court has already stayed an injunction \nissued by another district court prohibiting the DOD from proceeding with the § 284 border \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 7 of 21\nbarrier projects.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 7, ECF No. 134 (citing Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. 1).  In issuing \n~at stay, the Supreme Court determined that the balance of the equities tipped in the \nGovernment's favor.  !d. (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (explaining that stay \nfactors include irreparable injury, the balance of hardships, and the public interest)); Sierra Club, \n140 S. Ct. at 1.  Consequently, the Defendants argue that there is no basis for this Court to issue \nan injunction regarding the§ 284 projects that would effectively override the Supreme Court's \norder.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 7, ECF No. 134.  And this Court agrees. \nAs acknowledged in this Court's Memorandum Opinion, the Supreme Court \ngranted a stay in Defendants' favor, reasoning \"that the Government has made a sufficient \nshowing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the Acting \nSecretary's compliance with[~] 8005.\"  Sierra Club, 140 S. Ct. at 1.  Because DOD \nAppropriations Act, § 8005, authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Defense to transfer \nthe $2.5 billion for§ 284 Support for Counterdrug Activities, this Court found Plaintiffs' \nargument that the DOD Secretary exceeded his statutory authority under § 284 unviable.  Mem. \nOp. 6, ECF No. 129.  However, this conclusion and the Supreme Court's decision do not \nmandate that this Court is prohibited from enjoining the use of§ 2808 funds to augment border \nwall funding in violation of the CAA.  See id. \nIII.  The Winter Factors Tip in Favor of Plaintiffs, so a Permanent Injunction Shall Issue \nAgainst Defendants. \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to issue a permanent injunction against the agency head \nDefendants from using § 2808 funds on a border wall, while Defendants claim that Plaintiffs are \nnot entitled to such relief because they cannot demonstrate irreparable injury, and the balance of \nthe equities and public interest weigh against injunctive relief.  Pis.' Supp. Br. i, ECF No. 130; \nDefs.' Supp. Br. 4, 6, ECF No. 134. \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 8 of 21\nBecause Plaintiffs satisfy the four Winter factors, the Court disagrees with the \nDefendants and issues a permanent injunction against the agency head Defendants' use of \nadditional § 2808 funds to fund border barrier construction.  After addressing the first Winter \nfactor, irreparable injury, the Court will tum to the third and fourth factors, the balance of the \nequities and public interest, respectively.  Because Defendants do not address the second Winter \nfactor-that_remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate \nfor the injury-the Court will agree with Plaintiffs' argument that \"[m]oney damages cannot \nsubstitute for injunctive relief in this case\" without further discussion.  Pis.' Supp. Br. 4, ECF \nNo. 130 (citing Paulsson Geophysical Servs., Inc. v. Sigmar, 529 F.3d 303, 313 (5th Cir. 2008)). \n1.  Plaintiffs Have Suffered Irreparable Iniury. \nPlaintiffs claim irreparable injury citing this Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs \nhave standing due to their reputational, economic, and organizational injuries.  Id. at 8 (citing \nMem. Op. 9-22, ECF No. 129).  Further, according to the Plaintiffs, \"[t]hose injuries are \nirreparable absent an injunction: the County's reputational and economic harm will persist as \nlong as Defendants are allowed to carry out their plan to build a wall; and BNHR will continue to \ndivert resources to counteract Defendants' unlawful actions as long as those actions remain in \neffect.\"  I d. \nFirst, Defendants attack the v:iability of reputational harm as the basis for an \ninjunction.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 4, ECF No. 134.  Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' \neconomic injury is indirect and, thus, cannot form the basis for an injunction.  Jd. at 4-5. \nFinally, according to Defendants, BNHR's reallocation of resources also does not justify an \ninjunction.  ld. at 5-6. \n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 9 of 21\ni.  Plaintiffs have shown more than reputational harm, which alone supports \nan injunction. \nAs an initial matter, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have not submitted any \nevidence to establish that they are injured by specific § 2808 projects that the Department of \nDefense (\"the DOD\") plans to undertake, as all of Plaintiffs' declarations pre-date the Secretary \nof Defense's decision.  ld. at 4.  This Court rejected this same argument in its Memorandum \nOpinion as it related to standing because there is more than a substantial risk that the DOD will \nuse§ 2808 funds on a border wall, at Fort Bliss's expense.  Mem. Op. 24, ECF No. 129. \nHowever, Defendants argue. that standing is a separate and independent inquiry \nthan evaluating irreparable harm for an injunction, which requires separate and convincing proof. \nDefs.' Supp. Br. 4, ECF No. 134 (citing City ofL os Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983); \n0 'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 499 (1974); White v. Carlucci, 862 F.2d 1209, 1212 (5th Cir. \n1989)).  All the cases that Defendants cite for this proposition are inapposite in this context as \nthey involve distinguishable fact patterns and do not illustrate how the concrete injury facet of \nthe standing inquiry is insufficient to satisfy the irreparable harm requirement for equitable relief \nFirst, Carlucci, involves an employment dispute wherein respondent \nclaimed Title VII plaintiffs did not need to establish irreparable harm at all and the Fifth Circuit \nmerely held that irreparable harm was a requirement for an injunction to issue, not that concrete \nirijury is insufficient to meet the test.  862 F.2d at 1212.  In Littleton, the Supreme Court \ndistinguished between the case or controversy requirement of standing and the irreparable injury \nWinter factor-again distinct from the assertion Defendants make that the concrete injury \nrequirement of standing is insufficient to establish irreparable injury.  414 U.S. at 499. \nMoreover, Littleton involved the particularly fraught area of criminal prosecution and enjoining \nstate actors that enveloped distinct federalism issues, not relevant to this case.  Jd.  Likewise, in \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 10 of 21\nLyons, the Supreme Court distinguished between the case or controversy requirement and \nirreparable injury; it did not hold that concrete injury may never suffice to show irreparable \nharm.  461 U.S. at 103.  Distinguishing between the case or controversy requirement and \nirreparable h~ does not necessarily imply, as Defendants argue, that showing concrete injury is \ninsufficient to show irreparable harm. \nFurthermore, even if concrete injury did not suffice on its own, Carlucci \nillustrates that irreparable injury is intimately linked with the second Winter factor.  862 F.2d at \n1212.  The. Supreme Court emphasized in Carlucci that the injuries all could be made whole by \nmoney damages or other relief, thus were not irreparable.  I d.  In contrast, the Plaintiffs here \nwill not be made whole with traditional remedies at law-and Defendants do not contest this. \nSee supra 8. \nNext, Defendants cite Sampson v. Murray in which \"the Supreme Court \nrecognized that reputational harm 'falls far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a \nnecessary predicate to the issuance' of an injunction.\"  Jd. (quoting 415 U.S. 61,91-92 (1974)). \nThus, according to Defendants, El Paso County's reputational injury from the President's \nproclamation itself cannot serve as the basis for injunctive relief against construction pursuant to \nstatutory authorities dependent on that proclamation.  Jd. \nHowever, the Court disagrees with Defendants' analysis of Sampson v. Murray \nfor two reasons.  First, Sampson dealt with a distinguishable factual situation involving a \nrespondent who was a probationary worker alleging humiliation and reputational harm after \nbeing discharged without additional procedural safeguards.  415 U.S. at 91.  The Supreme \nCourt highlighted that it was not the discharge itself that was the harm, but \"only that she was \nentitled to additional procedural safeguards in effectuating the discharge.\"  ld.  The Court \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 11 of 21\nconcluded \"that no significant loss of reputation would be inflicted by procedural irregularities in \neffectuating respondent's discharge, and that whatever damage might occur would be fully \ncorrected by an administrative determination requiring the agency to conform to the applicable \nregulations.\"  !d. \nSecond, while the Court concluded that even assuming reputational damage did \noccur, it would not suffice for irreparable injury, the Court added a footnote: \nWe recognize  that  cases may  arise  in  which the  circumstances \nsurrounding an employee's discharge, together with the resultant \neffect on the employee; may so far depart from the normal situation \nthat irreparable injury might be found.  Such extraordinary cases \nare hard to define in advance of their occurrence.  We have held \nthat  an  insufficiency  of savings  or  difficulties  in  immediately \nobtaining other employment-external  factors  common  to  most \ndischarged employees and not attributable to any unusual actions \nrelating  to  the  discharge  itself.-will  not  support  a  finding  of \nirreparable injury, however severely they may affect a particular \nindividual.  But we do not wish to be understood as foreclosing \nrelief in the genuinely extraordinary situation.  Use of the court's \n,.  injunctive  power,  however,  when  discharge  of  probationary \nemployees is an issue, should be reserved for that situation rather \nthan employed in the routine case. \n!d. at 92, n.68 (citing Wettre v. Hague, 74 F.Supp. 396 (Mass. 1947); vacated and remanded on \nother grounds, 168 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1948)). \nTherefore, this Court refuses to extend the conclusion in Sampson to this case, \nespecially when the Supreme Court was careful to confine its conclusions to the facts of that case \nand specifically left open the possibility of irreparable injury in other employment situations with \na \"result[ing] effect on the employee['s]\" reputation that warrants an injunction.  See id.  Far \nfrom foreclosing injunctive reli~f from all entities suffering reputational harm, the Supreme \nCourt carefully left open the possibility.  See id. \nMoreover, here El Paso County's reputational harm is distinguishable in \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 12 of 21\nimportant ways from Sampson.  To begin, El Paso· County is far from a mere probationary \nworker entitled to less procedural safeguards than a permanent employee.  /d. at 81.  El Paso \nCounty and BNHR are central stakeholders.  See Mem. Op. 9, ECF No. 129.  Indeed, this \nCourt concluded that El Paso County is the object of the Proclamation, entitled to protection \nfrom Defendants' statutory violations.  /d.  And unli~e the Supreme Court in Sampson, this \nCourt cannot summarily conclude \"that no significant loss of reputation would be inflicted by \nprocedural irregularities in effectuating respondent's discharge, and that whatever damage might \noccur would be fully corrected by an administrative determination requiring the agency to \nconform to the applicable regulations.\"  415 U.S. at 91.  This Court has already concluded that \nPlaintiffs' reputational harm is significant.  See Mem. Op. at 10-14. ECF No. 129.  Finally, \nunlike the plaintiff in Sampson who had other recourse through the administrative agency, \nDefendants do not contest the second Winter factor that no other adequate remedies at law can \ncompensate Plaintiffs' injury.  See generally Defs.' Supp. Br., ECF No. 134.  While the \nreputational harm alone is enough to satisfy the irreparable injury requirement, Plaintiffs also \nhave demonstrated economic harm. \nii.  Plaintiffs economic harm is irreparable absent an injunction. \nDefendants next argue that El Paso County's purported loss of tax revenue from \nthe deferral of the roads project at Fort Bliss also cannot support a finding of irreparable injury \nbecause it is a generalized grievance insufficient to support standing.  /d. at 4 (citing Iowa ex \nref. Miller v. Block, 771 F.2d 347, 353 (8th Cir. 1985)).  Defendants claim that any decision to \nthe contrary would conflict with Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where the Supreme Court recognized \nstanding to challenge \"a direct injury in the form of a loss of specific tax revenues,\" but \ndistinguished cases where \"actions taken by United States Government agencies [have injured \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 13 of 21\ntheir] econom[ies] and thereby caused a decline in general tax revenues.\"  !d. at 4-5 (quoting \n502 U.S. 437, 448 (1992)) (internal quotations omitted).  In reaching that conclusion, the \nSupreme Court emphasized that States must establish a direct link between the tax at issue and \nthe administrative action being challenged to meet the requirements for Article III standing.  !d. \nat 5 (citing Wyoming, 502 U.S. at 448). \nDefendants argue that the direct causal connection that the Supreme Court found \ncritical to the finding of an injury in Wyoming is not present in this case, as El Paso merely \nasserts generalized allegations of harm resulting from reduced tourism and business \ndevelopment, as well as the deferral of the roads project at Fort Bliss.  !d. at 5.  Defendants \npoint to the affidavit of Judge Samaniego, who is responsible for the County's tax rate and \nbudget, in which only the threat of generalized \"economic harm\" is raised.  !d. (citing Decl. of \nJudge Samaniego ~IJ 2, 16 ECF No. 55-26).  Defendants conclude that this is fatal to Plaintiffs' \nclaims and to their request for equitable relief.  !d. \nThis Court has already rejected this argument because the diversion of resources \nfrom Fort Bliss can hardly be described as generalized-it is directly tied to the unlawful deferral \nof resources to border wall funding in violation of the CAA.  Mem. Op. 4, ECF No. 129.  Far \nfrom a general decline in tax revenue, Defendants will divert $20 million away from a planned \nmilitary construction project at Fort Bliss in El Paso County.  Supp. Notice of the DOD \nDecision 3, ECF No. 114.  \"F~rt Bliss is the lifeblood of the El Paso economy,\" contributing \nbillions of dollars and creating thousands of jobs.  Samaniego Decl., 15, ECF. No. 55-26. \nLosing funds that had been appropriated for use at Fort Bliss \"creates the imminent prospect of \neconomic harm to El Paso County.\"  Jd.IJ 16.  That loss of funds also represents a missed \nopportunity to \"obtain a benefit,\" which can also suffice to show injury in fact.  N.E. Associated \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 14 of 21\nGen. Contractors v. City ofJ acksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).  Defendants recognize the \nlegitimacy of this economic harm when they contest the breadth of the Plaintiffs' proposed \ninjunction, but are forced to admit that \"the absolute most Plaintiffs are entitled to is an \ninjunction prohibiting DOD from using the $20 million in military construction funds initially \nassociated with Fort Bliss.\"  Defs. Supp. Br. 12-13.  And in addition to the economic and \nreputational harm ofEl Paso County, BNHR has also suffered irreparable harm. \niii.  BNHR 's organizational harm is irreparable absent an injunction. \nDefendants claim that BNHR's diversion-of-resources theory fails to carry \nBNHR's burden to show irreparable injury in the absence of its requested injunction.  Defs.' \nSupp. Br. 5-6, ECF No. 134.  In Defendants' retelling, BNHR has not established that its \nreallocation of resources has imposed concrete irreparable harm beyond simply undertaking a \ndifferent form ofborder policy advocacy.  !d. \nThis too the Court has already addressed to the contrary in its Memorandum \nOpinion and does so again here because BNHR has established irreparable injury.  Mem. Op. \n18-22, ECF No. 129.  More than being forced to undertake a different form of border policy \nadvocacy, BNHR's resources have been drained and diverted, as illustrated by the cancelation of \na signature event and additional expenditures to counteract Defendants' unlawful actions that \ndiffer from its routine expenses.  !d. at 18, 21.  Because BNHR and El Paso County have \nsatisfied the first and second Winter. factors, irreparable harm that cannot be treated with \ntraditional remedies at law, the Court will address the remaining factors. \n2.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Weigh in Favor oflniunctive Relief. \nWhere, as here, the Government is a party to the case, the third and fourth \npermanent injunction factors merge: the balance of the equities and public interest.  See Nken v. \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 15 of 21\nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nPlaintiffs reiterate the irreparable injury facts described above, which would cause \nsevere hardship absent an injunction and tips the balance of the equities in their favor.  See Pls.' \nSupp. Br. 8, ECF No. 130.  Plaintiffs further argue that Defendants have no legitimate interest \nin taking actions that violate the CAA, or in spending funds that Congress appropriated for \npurposes other than a border wall~  !d.  And while the importance of border security should not \nbe minimized, according to Plaintiffs, that concern cannot override the public's interest in the \nExecutive Branch complying with the law.  !d.  That is especially so when Congress-the \nPeople's representatives-determined that securing the border required only $1.375 billion, not \n$6.1 billion, to be spent on a wall.  !d. (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sa1ryer, 343 \nU.S. 579,655 (1952)). \nDefendants argue to the contrary that these factors tip in their favor because the \nSupreme Court has recognized that the Government has \"compelling interests in safety and in the \nintegrity of our borders.\"  Defs.' Supp. Br. 6, ECF No. 134 (citing Nat 'I Treasury Emps. Union \nv.  Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 672 (1989)).\"  Defendants address§ 284 and§ 2808 projects \nseparately. \ni.  § 2 84 construction shall not be enjoined. \nBecause the Court agrees with the Supreme Court, as stated above, an injunction \non the use of§ 284 funds will not issue.  See supra 7.  However, Defendants largely repeat \ntheir arguments for why equity and public interest weigh against a permanent injunction on both \n§ 284 and § 2808 funding for border wall construction.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 8, ECF No. 134. \nThus, the Court will address Defendants' arguments as they pertain to § 2808. \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 16 of 21\nii.  § 2808 construction shall be enjoined. \nDefendants argue that enjoining § 2808 projects would prohibit the Government \nfrom taking critical steps needed to prevent the continuing surge of illegal drugs from entering \nthe country through the southern border.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 6, 7-9, ECF No. 134 (citing United \nStates v. Guzman-Padilla, 573 F.3d 865, 889 (9th Cir. 2009) (Government has a \"strong interest \n[ ]\"in \"interdicting the flow of drugs\" entering the United States)).  Defendants explain that \nthese undisputed harms \"plainly outweigh[]\" Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arising from \nconstruction with§ 2808 funds.  Jd. (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 26, 33).  And according to \nDefendants, Plaintiffs' asserted reputational, economic, and organizational harms, which arise \nprincipally from the Proclamation's message, have essentially no connection to the legal \nviolation of the CAA that the Court identified.  !d.  Given that, and in light of Defendant's \nself-proclaimed \"weighty and undisputed interest in undertaking projects to assist with drug \ninterdiction at the southern border, it would be an abuse of discretion for this Court to award the \n'extraordinary remedy' of a permanent injunction on§ [2808 construction to provide Plaintiffs \nrelief from the specific violation the Court identified.\"  !d. at 7 (citing Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). \nDefendant's first citation to Von Raab, see supra 15, is unpersuasive in this \ncontext because while the Supreme Court did hold that the Government has \"compelling \ninterests in safety and in the integrity of our borders[,]\" it did so in contrast to the less \ncompelling privacy expectations of an armed customs officer who had to submit to urine \nanalysis.  489 U.S. at 672.  Likewise, Guzman-Padi/la does not counsel a ruling in \nDefendants' favor as it was similarly decided within a distinct Fourth Amendment context.  573 \nF .3d at 889 (9th Cir. 2009). \nDrawing upon Guzman-Padilla for support, Defendants overstate this Court's \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 17 of 21\npermanent injunction as aimed at all § 284 projects-and impliedly § 2808 projects.  See Defs.' \nSupp. Br. 6, 8, ECF No. 134.  Far from enjoining all § 2808 projects, this Court only enjoins the \nuse of funds to increase funding in contravention of the fixed amount prescribed in the CAA. \nSee infra 20.  Defendants are not prohibited from taking steps to prevent illegal drugs from \nentering the country through the southern border, but they are prohibited from violating the \nCAA.  ld. \nNext, Defendants liken Plaintiffs to the unsuccessful plaintiffs in Winter whose \ninterests in whale watching trips, observing marine mammals underwater, and conducting \nscientific research on marine mammals was outweighed by both the Navy's interest and the \npublic interest in sonar training exercises.  555 U.S. at 26.  An injunction on these unique \ntraining exercises would force the Navy to deploy unprepared antisubmarine forces and, thus, \njeopardize the safety of the entire feet.  !d.  The Supreme Court was careful to limit its holding \nbecause \"[o  ]f course, military interests do not always trump other considerations, and we have \nnot held that they do.\"  !d. \nFar from enjoining a unique or sole source of funding, which would make this \ncase more analogous to Winter, this injunction merely stops the unlawful augment of the funds \nthat were already appropriated for border wall funding.  See Mem. Op. 32, ECF No. 129. \nFinally, granting a preliminary injunction would not \"disserve the public interest.\"  Pis.' Mot. \nSumm. J. 50, ECF No. 54 (quoting Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast Inc. v. Gee, 862 F.3d 445, \n479 (5th Cir. 2017).  To the contrary, because Defendants' actions are unlawful and the \npeople's representatives-Congress-declined to augment the border wall budget as Defendants \nattempt, the public interest would be served by halting them.  !d. \nFinally, Defendants argue that both the Government and the public have a \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 18 of 21\ncompelling interest in ensuring that its military forces are properly supported with necessary \nresources for successful missions.  Defs.' Supp. Br. 7, ECF No. 134.  Defendants cite \nGoldman v.  Weinberger for the proposition that courts must \"give great deference to the \nprofessional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular \nmilitary interest.\"  475 U.S. 503, 507 (1986).  However, the Supreme Court was careful in that \ncase to limit its holding to the particular military context where First Amendment rights are \nnecessarily circumscribed.  !d.  So when it held that the Air Force did not have to make an \nexception to its dress code for religious apparel, it did so with great deference to military \njudgment.  !d. at 509.  This context is distinct from the present case and so is the level of \ndeference required.  See id. at 507.  Thus, Plaintiffs satisfy all four Winter factors and a \npermanent injunction shall issue in their favor. \nFor the same reasons, Defendants do not have compelling reasons justifying an \nadministrative stay of this decision as they have requested, though they are free to pursue a stay \npending appeal before the Fifth Circuit.  Defs.' Supp. Mot. 13-14, ECF No. 134; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 8. \n3.  A Permanent Injunction, Rather than Preliminary Injunction, Is Appropriate Here. \nThe Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, which is a final \njudgment that \"ends the litigation on the merits.\"  McLaughlin v. Mississippi Power Co., 376 \nF.3d 344, 350 (5th Cir. 2004).  When a court grants a plaintiff summary judgment, a \npermanent-rather than preliminary-injunction should issue.  See, e.g., Dep 't of Texas, \nVeterans ofF oreign Wars v. Texas Lottery Comm 'n, 760 F.3d 427,441 (5th Cir. 2014) (en bane) \n(affirming summary judgment and permanent injunction); Vais Arms, Inc. v.  Vais, 383 F.3d 287, \n296 (5th Cir. 2004) (same); Sierra Club v. Trump, 2019 WL 2715422, at *6 (N.D. Cal. June 28, \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 19 of 21\n20 19) (granting summary judgment and permanently enjoining border wall construction under § \n8005).  After all, there is no need to determine whether the plaintiff is \"likely to succeed on the \nmerits\" (as a court does in a preliminary-injunction posture, see Pendergest-Holt v. Certain \nUnderwriters at Lloyd's ofL ondon, 600 F.3d 562,568-69 (5th Cir. 2010)) once the court \ndetermines that the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits.  Because this Court granted Plaintiffs' \nsummary judgment and because Plaintiffs have met all four Winter factors,. a permanent \ninjunction is the proper form of equitable relief. \nIV.  The Permanent Injunction on the Use of§ 2808 Funds Beyond the $1.375 Billion in \nthe CAA Is Not Overbroad. \nDefendants make much of the difference between the Plaintiffs' original and \namended proposed injunction order, calling the latter especially overbroad.  Defs.' Supp. Br. \n9-10.  The relevant portion of Plaintiffs' original Proposed Order reads: the Defendants \"are \nenjoined from border wall construction using funds appropriated by the 2019 Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for 'military construction' under 10 U.S.C. § 2808, and 'support for \ncounterdrug activities' under 10 U.S.C. § 284.\"  Proposed Order 2, ECF No. 130-1 (emphasis \nadded)..  The Plaintiffs' Amended Proposed Order reads: the Defendants \"are enjoined from \nborder wall construction using funds appropriated for 'military construction' under 10 U.S.C. § \n2808, and 'support for counterdrug activities' under 10 U.S.C. § 284.\"  Amended Proposed \nOrder 2, ECF No. 131-1.  The bold language has been taken out and, according to Defendants, \nthis shows that Plaintiffs are aware that an injunction is inappropriate because no \"funds \nappropriated by the 2019 [CAA]\" are being used to carry out the disputed construction.  Defs.' \nSupp. Br. 9 (citing Mem. Op. 30-31, ECF No. 129).  Defendants go on to reargue the merits of \nthe CAA' s prohibition on additional funding for border wall construction, limiting that \nprohibition to only other provisions within the CAA itself.  !d.  The Court disagreed in its \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 136   Filed 12/10/19   Page 20 of 21\nMemorandum Opinion and continues to uphold the \"general principle of statutory interpretation\" \nthat \"a more specific statute·will be given precedence over a more general one,\" which \nnecessitates an injunction against the unlawful a~gment of funds for border wall construction. \nMem. Op. 25, ECF No. 129 (quoting Nevada v. Dep 't ofE nergy, 400 F.3d 9, 16 (D.C. Cir. \n2005)) (internal quotations omitted). \nCONCLUSION \nAfter succeeding on the merits of their claim at summary judgment, Plaintiffs are \nentitled to a declaratory judgment against the agency head Defendants' unlawful attempt to \naugment the CAA funds with§ 2808 funds above the appropriated $1.375 billion.  Far from \nconflicting with the Supreme Court's decision in Sierra Club, this Court's decision is not based \non whether the DOD Secretary exceeded his statutory authority under § 284 and, indeed, the \nCourt deemed Plaintiffs' argument relying on this line of reasoning invalid.

TRUMP, in his official \n§ \ncapacity as President of the United States  § \nof America, et al.,  § \nDefendants. \n§ \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nOn this day, the Court considered Plaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, (\"El Paso \nCounty\") and Border Network for Human Right's (\"BNHR\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") \"Motion \nfor Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, a Preliminary Injunction\" (\"Motion\"), filed in the \nabovecaptioned case on April 25, 2019.  On June 10, 2019, Defendants Donald J. Trump, \nPatrick M. Shanahan, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, David Bernhardt, Steven T. Mnuchin, William Barr, \nJohn F. Bash, and Todd T. Semonite (collectively, \"Defendants\") filed their \"Memorandum in \nSupport of the Government's CrossMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, and \nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and a Preliminary Injunction\" (\"Cross- \nMotion\").  On July 10, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Reply.  The Defendants filed their Reply on \nJuly 31, 2019.  The Court held a hearing on the Motion and Cross-Motion on August 29, 2019. \nOn September 10, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their \"Supplemental Brief in Light of \nNotice of Decision by the Department of Defense to Authorize Border Barrier Projects Pursuant \nto 10 U.S.C.  2808.\"  On September 20, 2019, Defendants filed their \"Supplemental Brief \n§ \nAddressing Border Barrier Construction Pursuant to 10 U.S.C.  2808.\"  On September 24, \n§ \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 2 of 33\n2019, Plaintiffs filed their Reply.  After due consideration, the Court is of the opinion that the \nPlaintiffs' Motion shall be granted. \nBACKGROUND \nThis case presents questions regarding whether the proposed plan for funding \nborder barrier construction exceeds the Executive Branch's lawful authority under the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act (\"CAA\"), the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, the \nMilitary Construction Act  10 U.S.C. § 2808 (\"  2808\"), the Funding for Counterdrug \nActivities  10 U.S.C. § 284 (\"  284\"), and the National Emergency Act (\"NEA\"). \nIn 2017, President Trump requested $999 million in congressional appropriations \nfor \"the first installment of the border wall.\"  Budget Request, Pl.'s Mot. 5, ECF No. 55-6.  A \nRepublicancontrolled Congress instead provided the Department of Homeland Security \n(\"DHS\") with $341.2 million \"to replace approximately 40 miles of existing primary pedestrian \nand vehicle border fencing along the southwest border.\"  CAA, Pub. L. No. 115-31, 131  Stat. \n135, 434 (2017).  In 2018, President Trump requested $1.6 billion in congressional \nappropriations for 74 miles of new or replacement border wall.  FY 2018 Budget in Brief, Pl.'s \nMot. 3, ECF No. 55-7.  In response, Congress appropriated $1.57  billion for new border \n1 \nsecurity technology and new and replacement fencing in specified areas on the southern border. \nCAA, Pub. L. No. 115-141(2018) (to be printed at 132 Stat. 348, 616). \nIn January 2019, President Trump formally requested $5.7 billion for fiscal year \n2019 \"for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border.\"  Letter to Appropriations \nChairman 1, ECF No. 55-28.  On February 14, 2019, Congress passed the 2019 CAA.  Pub. L. \nNo. 116-6 (2019) (to be printed at 133 Stat. 13).  The CAA provides $1.375 billion for \"the \nconstruction of primary pedestrian fencing\" in \"the Rio Grande Valley Sector.\"  CAA \n§ \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 3 of 33\n23 O(a)( 1).  And it states that none of the funds appropriated by the Act can be used \"for the \nconstruction of pedestrian fencing\" in any other areas of the border.  Id.  231.  A component \n§ \nof the CAA, § 739 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, states: \nNone of the funds made available in this or any other appropriations \nAct may be used to increase, eliminate, or reduce funding  for a \nprogram, project, or activity as proposed in the President's budget \nrequest for a fiscal year until such proposed change is subsequently \nenacted in an appropriation Act,  or unless  such change is made \npursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of this or any \nother appropriations Act. \nPub. L. No. 116-6, div. D, § 739.  On February 15, 2019, President Trump signed the CAA into \nlaw. \nAlso on February 15, 2019, the President issued a proclamation declaring that a \nnational emergency exists at the southern border.  See Presidential Proclamation on Declaring a \nNational Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States, 2019 WL 643819, at \n*1 (Feb. 15, 2019) (\"Proclamation\"). \nThe proclamation itself states: \nThe  current  situation  at  the  southern  border  presents  a  border \nsecurity and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security \ninterests  and  constitutes  a  national  emergency.  The  southern \nborder is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit \nnarcotics.  The problem of largescale unlawful migration through \nthe  southern border is  longstanding,  and  despite  the executive \nbranch's exercise of existing statutory authorities, the situation has \nworsened in certain respects in recent years.  In particular, recent \nyears  have  seen  sharp  increases  in the number  of family units \nentering and seeking entry to the United States and an inability to \nprovide detention space for many of these aliens while their removal \nproceedings are pending.  If not detained,  such aliens are often \nreleased into the country and are often difficult to remove from the \nUnited States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply \nwith  orders of removal,  or are otherwise difficult to locate.  In \nresponse to the directive in my April 4, 2018, memorandum and \nsubsequent  requests  for  support  by the  Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity,  the  Department  of Defense  has provided  support  and \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 4 of 33\nresources to the Department of Homeland Security at the southern \nborder.  Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, \nit is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to \naddress the crisis. \nProclamation No. 9844, 84 Fed. Reg. 4, 949. \nIn addition to declaring a national emergency, the President announced a plan, to \nbe carried out by Defendant Acting Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, to use funds \nthat Congress appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall.  Most relevant, President \nTrump directed those Acting Secretaries to use: (1) $2.5 billion of the Department of Defense \n(\"DOD\") funds appropriated for Support for Counterdrug Activities under  284; and (2) $3.6 \n§ \nbillion of DOD funds appropriated for \"military construction projects\" under  2808.  President \n§ \nDonaldJ. Trump's Border Security Victory, White House Fact Sheet (Feb. 15, 2019) (\"Fact \nSheet\"), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j -trumps-border- \nsecurity-victory!. \nOn September 3, 2019, Defendants gave the Court notice that the DOD has made \na final determination to build eleven border wall projects using $3.6 billion in military \nconstruction funds under 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  Notice of DOD Decision, ECF No. 112.  And on \nSeptember 5, 2019, Defendants gave notice identifying the military construction projects that \nCongress had already appropriated money for that will now lose funding in order to build those \neleven wall projects.  Supplemental Notice of DOD Decision, ECF No. 114.  Most relevant for \nthis case: the DOD will divert $20 million away from a planned military construction project at \nFort Bliss in El Paso County, and one of the new wall projects will take place in southern New \nMexico, in El Paso County's close vicinity.  2808 Deferrals in United States Territories 2, ECF \nNo. 114-1. \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 5 of 33\nLEGAL STANDARDS \nThe parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  Rule 56 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates entry of summary judgment \"if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 \n(1986); Curtis v. Anthony, 710 F.3d 587, 594 (5th Cir. 2013).  Defendants agree with Plaintiffs \nthat this case presents questions of law for the Court to resolve that do not require further factual \ndevelopment through discovery.  In these circumstances, the Court should enter either summary \njudgment for Defendants based on the parties' moving papers or dismiss the First Amended \nComplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12. \nFurthermore, the Court must dismiss a case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n1 2(b)( 1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if it lacks the statutory or constitutional power to \nadjudicate the case.  Home Builders Ass 'n ofM  iss., Inc. v.  City of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, \n1010 (5th Cir. 1998).  The party asserting subjectmatter jurisdiction has the burden of proving \nit exists by a preponderance of the evidence.  See New Orleans & Gulf Coast Ry. Co. v. \nBarrois, 533 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir. 2008). \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.\"  Ashcrofi v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  A complaint that \n\"tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement\" is insufficient.  Id.  (internal \ncitation and alteration omitted).  At the summaryjudgment stage, plaintiffs \"must 'set forth' by \naffidavit or other evidence 'specific facts\" to establish their standing.  Lujan v. Def of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  When evaluating plaintiffs' standing, \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 6 of 33\ncourts must \"take as true\" the factual evidence plaintiffs submit.  McCardell v. Dep 't ofH ous. \n& Urban Dev., 794 F.3d 510, 520 (5th Cir. 2015);seeLujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \nFinally, Plaintiffs have requested a preliminary injunction, which is a matter of \nequitable discretion and is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\"  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 22 (2008).  \"A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must establish that [it] is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.\"  Id. at 20. \nANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs make several claims in their Amended Complaint and seek summary \njudgment, as well as permanent declaratory and injunctive relief, because the President's \nJ \nProclamation is unlawful.  Considering the Supreme Court's recent decision in Donald \nTrump, President of the United Sates, et al. v. Sierra Club, et al., the Court will not further \naddress either parties' arguments regarding the statutory authority of DOD Secretary Shanahan \nto spend under § 8005.  See No. 19A60, 2019 WL 3369425, at*l (2019).  The Supreme Court \ngranted a stay in Defendants' favor and reasoned \"that the Government has made a sufficient \nshowing at this stage that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the Acting \nSecretary's compliance with [] 8005.\"  Id.  The DOD Appropriations Act,  8005, authorizes \n§ \nthe Secretary of the Department of Defense to transfer the $2.5 billion for  284 Support for \n§ \nCounterdrug Activities.  Thus, the Court finds Plaintiffs' argument that the DOD Secretary \nexceeded his statutory authority under  284 unviable.  In addition, the Court will not address \n§ \nthe Plaintiffs' arguments regarding the Treasury Forfeiture Funds, as Plaintiffs abandoned these \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 7 of 33\nclaims at oral argument.  Hr'g Tr. 67-68, ECF No. 115. \nApart from the aforementioned  284 and Treasury Forfeiture Funds arguments, \n§ \nPlaintiffs argue that the Proclamation exceeded the President's authority under the National \nEmergency Act (\"NEA\").  Mot. 19, ECF No. 54.  Alternatively, according to Plaintiffs, the \nNEA is unconstitutional if it authorizes the President's Proclamation because it runs afoul of the \nnondelegation doctrine and the Take Care Clause of the Constitution.  Id. at 26.  Next, the \nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants' use of the funds to build a border wall violates the CAA, the \nAppropriations Clause of the Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").  Id. \nat 33, 45-46. \nDefendants counter that all Plaintiffs' claims fail because Congress intended to \npreclude judicial review of national emergency declarations, that the challenge presents a \nnonjusticiable political question, and that Plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief against the \nPresident.  CrossMot. 20 and 23, ECF No. 95.  Regarding Plaintiffs' alternative argument, \nDefendants argue that the nondelegation challenge to the NEA is meritless.  Id. at 30. \nAccording to Defendants, Plaintiffs' claims based on the APA are unsuccessful because they \nhave not satisfied the APA' s requirements for review of agency action and they fail on the \nmerits.  Id. at 44 and 49.  Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under \nthe CAA because nothing in the CAA modifies or disables the use of the permanent statutes at \nissue in this case.  Id. at 54. \nPrior to the Court's discussion of the merits of these claims and counterclaims, the \nCourt will address standing.  Plaintiffs claim they have standing because El Paso County is the \n\"object\" of the Defendants' Proclamation to build a border wall in the community.  Mot. 10, \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 8 of 33\nECF No. 54.  Furthermore, El Paso County has suffered reputational and economic injuries. \nId. at 11-13.  For its part, BNHR asserts organizational standing.  Id. at 14. \nDefendants counter, first, that Plaintiffs cannot challenge either the Proclamation \nor  284 because the alleged reputational harm is not an injury in fact, it is not fairly traceable to \n§ \nthe Defendants' action, it is too speculative, and it is not redressable by a favorable outcome. \nCrossMot. 35-39, ECF No. 95.  Second, according to Defendants, the pecuniary injuries are \nnot sufficiently concrete or imminent, and even if they were, they are not traceable to the \nProclamation and subsequent actions.  Id. at 40.  Third, Plaintiffs' cannot establish standing to \nsue under  2808.  Id. at 34. \n§ \nFinally, Defendants argue that BNHR lacks standing because there is no nexus \nbetween the organizational activities and the Defendants'  conduct, rather BNHR relies on an \n\"abstract social interest.\"  Id. at 41-42.  According to Defendants, not only is \"stigmatization\" \nnot a cognizable injury for Article III standing, but other alleged harm to the quality of life of \nBNHR members is not sufficiently concrete or imminent.  Id. at 43.  As discussed below, the \nCourt finds that the Plaintiffs do have standing and are entitled to summary judgment based on \ntheir CAA claim. \nI.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING. \nTo establish Article III standing, \"a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an \n'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) \nit is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.\"  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 \n(2000). \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 9 of 33\nAt the summary judgment stage, plaintiffs \"must 'set forth' by affidavit or other \nevidence 'specific facts\" to establish their standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (quoting Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(e)).  When evaluating plaintiffs' standing, courts must \"take as true\" the factual \nevidence that plaintiffs submit.  McCardell, 794 F.3d at 520; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \nThus, El Paso County has standing, and BNHR has standing both as an organization and because \nits members have suffered a concrete injury. \n1.  El Paso County Has Standing. \nEl Paso County has standing to sue Defendants because they are the \"object\" of \nthe border wall construction, and they have suffered concrete reputational and economic injury. \nAlthough either reputational or economic injury alone would suffice to justify El Paso County's \nday in federal court, the Court will address the viability of each in turn. \na.  El Paso County Is the Object of the Proclamation to Build a Border Wall. \nWhen a plaintiff \"challeng[es] the legality of government action,\" the \"nature and \nextent of facts that must be averred\" to establish standing \"depends considerably upon whether \nthe plaintiff is [itself] an object of the action\" at issue.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-62.  If it is, \n\"there is ordinarily little question that the action. . . has caused [it] injury, and that a judgment \npreventing. .  .  the action will redress [that injury].\"  Id.; see Duarte ex rel. Duarte v.  City of \nLewisville, 759 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (\"It follows from Lujan that if a plaintiff is an \nobject of a government regulation, then that plaintiff ordinarily has standing to challenge that \nregulation.\") \nThe Supreme Court in Lujan held the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the \nSecretary of the Interior's refusal to extend Endangered Species Act protections to animals \nabroad.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  The Supreme Court dismissed the case because the individual \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 10 of 33\nplaintiffs expressed mere \"some day intentions\" and failed to produce evidence on summary \njudgment of \"concrete plans\" to visit the endangered animals abroad.  Id. at 564-65 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  In contrast, the Fifth Circuit held that a plaintiff, a registered child \nsex offender, was the target of a local ordinance restricting where registered child sex offenders \ncould live.  Duarte, 759 F.3d at 518.  There the plaintiff submitted evidence that, taken in the \nlight most favorable to him, established that he had \"concrete plans\" to eventually reside in areas \nimpacted by the local ordinance, unlike the plaintiffs in Lujan.  Id. \nThe President's Proclamation is aimed at building a border wall along the \nsouthern border between El Paso County and Mexico.  Thus, unlike the plaintiffs in Lujan who \nhad only intentions of visiting a targeted area without any concrete plans, El Paso County is the \n\"object\" or target of the government action.  Even more clearly than the plaintiff in Duarte, who \nmerely had concrete plans to eventually reside in an impacted area, El Paso County itself is the \nimpacted area of the government's action.  The Court agrees with the Plaintiffs that because El \nPaso County is the object of the Proclamation, it has standing to bring this challenge. \nb.  El Paso County's Reputation Has Been Injured. \nSpecifically, El Paso County has shown an injury to its reputation and has had to \ntake affirmative steps to avoid harm.  According to El Paso County Judge Samaniego (\"Judge \nSamaniego\"), El Paso County takes pride in its \"reputation as a safe place to live, work, and \nvisit,\" and as a vibrant \"bilingual, hinational, multicultural\" community.  Samaniego Decl. \n¶IJ \n3-4, ECF No. 55-26.  But Defendants' actions have \"falsely told the world the exact opposite:\" \n\"that El Paso County and the Southern border are crimeridden and dangerous, that [its] \nimmigrant community comprises criminals and drug traffickers. .  ., that [its] proximity to \nMexico is an existential threat, and that [it] can be rescued only through the blight of massive \nIE& \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 11 of 33\nwall construction and militarization.\"  Id. ¶ 8; see also id. ¶ 10 (\"I have already heard \npersonally from people who have a false impression that El Paso County is a dangerous place \nand who do not want to come here [because of the President's Proclamation].\").  And according \nto Chief Administrator of El Paso County Keller (\"Ms. Keller\"), Defendants' actions amount to a \nmessage \"transmitted all over the world\" that \"all of [the County's] strengths are actually \nweaknesses\" and that the County is \"so endangered by immigrants and [its] closeness to Mexico \nthat [it] need{s] a wall to protect [it].\"  Keller Dccl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 55-25.  Because of \nDefendants' actions, Ms. Keller now must \"not only promot[e] El Paso's image, but actively \ndefend[] it.\"  Id.  As Judge Samaniego explained, \"every meeting anyone promoting El Paso \nhas now must include extra efforts to persuade people that El Paso County is a good place to \ninvest in and visit.\"  Samarnego Deci. ¶ 11, ECF No. 55-25. \nEl Paso County asserts that they have standing because \"injury to reputation can \nconstitute a cognizable injury sufficient for Article III standing.\"  Foretich v.  United States, 351 \nF.3d 1198, 1211 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see Walker v. City ofM  esquite, 129 F.3d 831, 832-33 (5th \nCir. 1997).  \"[W]here reputational injury derives directly from an unexpired and unretracted \ngovernment action, that injury satisfies the requirements of Article III standing to challenge that \naction.\"  Foretich, 351 F .3d at 1213.  Even \"the need to take.  affirmative steps to avoid the \n.  . \nrisk of harm to [one's] reputation constitutes a cognizable injury.\"  Meese v. Keene, 481 U.s. \n465, 475 (1987); see also Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Far,ns, 561 U.S. 139, 154 (2010) \n(finding standing based on plaintiffs' need \"to take certain measures to minimize the likelihood\" \nof harm). \nIn Meese, for instance, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff had standing, based \non reputational injury, to challenge a federal law classifying films he wished to show as \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 12 of 33\n\"political propaganda.\"  Id. at 4 72-77.  By forcing the plaintiff to \"choose between exhibiting \nthe films and incurring the risk that public perception of this [legal] scheme will harm [his] \nreputation,\" the law inflicted concrete injury.  Id. at 477.  And in NCAA v. Governor of New \nJersey, which the Fifth Circuit has favorably cited for its standing analysis (see Texas v. United \nStates, 809 F.3d 134, 156 (5th Cir. 2015)), the court held that sports leagues had standing, based \non reputational injury, to challenge a state law legalizing sports gambling.  730 F.3d 208, 220 \n(3d Cir. 2013), rev 'd on other grounds sub nom., 138 S. Ct. 1461(2018).  The leagues had \nshown cognizable reputational injury because \"they are harmed by their unwanted association \nwith an activity they (and large portions of the public) disapprove ofgambling.\"  Id. \nHowever, \"[s]tanding is not available to just any resident of a jurisdiction to \nchallenge a government message without a corresponding action about a particular belief.\" \nBarber v. Bryant, 860 F.3d 345, 355 (5th Cir. 2017) (rejecting \"purported stigmatic injury\"); see \nalso Ingebretsen v. Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist., 88 F.3d 274, 284 (5th Cir.  1996) (\"[Nb  parent ought \nto be allowed to sue over a school policy with which he disagrees unless the policy has \ndemonstrably injured him or his child.\"); Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. US. Naiy (In \nre Naiy Chaplaincy), 534 F.3d 756, 764-65 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J.) (allowing standing \nbased on offense to a government message would \"eviscerate wellsettled standing limitations\"). \nAnd to assert standing, more is required than alleging a \"possible future injury.\"  Clapper v. \nAmnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  Finally, the Court cannot indulge \"speculation \nabout 'the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court\" that cannot \nsupport standing.  Id. at 410, 414 n. 5 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562). \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Proclamation and subsequent \ngovernment actions of obtaining funding from various sources to build a border wall between El \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 13 of 33\nPaso County and Mexico incurs the risk of harm to El Paso County's reputation.  Like the \nleagues in NCAA, El Paso County has shown cognizable reputational injury on the ground that \n\"they are harmed by their unwanted association with an activity they (and large portions of the \nof\" \npublic) disapprove  the construction of a border wall through executive action.  730 F.3d \nat 220. \nDefendants' attempt to distinguish Meese and NCAA which each involved \"self \neffectuating\" statutes from the current case, which involves the Proclamation as a catalyst for the \nstatutory authority that appropriates the construction funds, is unpersuasive.  Even though the \nProclamation is not selfeffectuating, it directly authorizes actions under other statutes that give \nrise to an injury in fact.  Like Foretich, reputational injury derives from an unexpired and \nunretracted government action and El Paso County's \"need to take.  affirmative steps to avoid \n.  . \nthe risk of harm to {its] reputation constitutes a cognizable injury.\"  351 F.3d at 1213. \nFurthermore, combined with the abovereasoned conclusion that El Paso County \nis the \"object\" of the government action, it is not speculative that El Paso has suffered an injury \nin fact to its reputation that is traceable to the Proclamation.  See supra 9.  El Paso County \nsubmitted affidavit testimony from Ms. Keller and Judge Samaniego who testified to taking \naffirmative steps to avoid the risk of harm to El Paso County's reputation.  See supra 10-11. \nUnlike Clapper with its \"highly attenuated chain of possibilities\" involving five \nincreasinglyspeculative logical leaps between the government action under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act and the fear that their communication with foreign contacts would \nbe intercepted in the future, El Paso County's injury is far more direct.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at \n408.  El Paso County is not indulging in speculation about the unfettered choices of unknown \ninvestors or tourists, rather El Paso County's reputation has been injured because, as in Meese, \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 14 of 33\nthe risk of harm to public perception is enough to constitute a concrete injury. \nFinally, the Court disagrees with the Defendants' argument that El Paso County's \nreputational injury is selfinflicted.  See Resp. 38, ECF No. 95 (citing Clapper, 568 U.s. at 408; \nZimmerman v.  City ofAustin, 881 F.3d 378, 389 (5th Cir. 2018); Assoc. for Retarded Citizens of \nDallas v. Dallas Cnty. Mental Health & Mental Retardation Ctr. Rd. of Trustees, 19 F.3d 241, \n244 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Again unlike Clapper where the standing inquiry was particularly \nrigorous because the court was asked to find the actions of the other branches of government \nunconstitutional, here the Court will not reach the constitutionality of the NEA nor whether use \nof the funds to build a border wall violates the Appropriations Clause. \nSecond, the Fifth Circuit in Association for Retarded Citizens ofD  allas held that \nredirection of an organization's \"resources to litigation and legal counseling in response to \nactions or inactions of another party is insufficient to impart standing upon the organization.\" \n19 F.3d at 244.  Here Defendants have not submitted any argument or evidence regarding El \nPaso County's redirection of resources to litigation or legal counseling expenses.  See generally \nDef.'s CrossMot., ECF No. 95.  Finally, unlike the plaintiff in Zimmerman whose desire to \nsolicit funds did not establish an intent to accept funds above the proscribed limit in the \nchallenged law, El Paso County has made concrete plans with objective evidence demonstrating \nan investment of time and resources to combat the Proclamation.  881 F.3d at 3 89-90; see, e.g., \nKeller Decl. ¶J 9-11, ECF No. 5 5-25; Samaniego Decl. ¶J 11-12, ECF No. 5 5-26 (\"I have \nspent approximately 30% of my time [as County Judge]  to defending El Paso's reputation.\"). \n.  .  . \nEl Paso County's reputational injurythough alone enough for standingis also intimately tied \nto \"a direct pecuniary injury that generally is sufficient to establish injuryinfact\" to be \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 15 of 33\naddressed in the next section.  KP. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 122 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted). \nc.  El Paso County Has Suffered Economic Harm. \nAny drop in the $4 million tax revenue El Paso County earns from tourism \n\"would significantly damage the county's financial health.\"  Samaniego Deci. ¶ 5, ECF No. 55- \n26).  Ms. Keller explained, \"[t]here is nothing more detrimental to a drive to bring in tourists \nthan the perception that a community is chaotic and dangerous and that the tourists['] access to \nhistorical and scenic destinations will be impeded by construction.\"  Keller Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. \n55-25; see also Samaniego Deci. ¶ 6, ECF No. 55-26 (\"[T]he President's Proclamation \ndeclaring an emergency at the Southern border is a serious threat to both tourism and economic \ndevelopment because of the false and negative impression of El Paso that it creates.\").  Judge \nSamaniego likewise emphasized that recent meetings with \"local business leaders\" have \nindicated that Defendants' actions are \"generating fears of potential investors that the community \nwill be mired in a longterm state of chaos that includes.  violent crime, the blight of \n.  . \nconstruction, and impediments to crossing back and forth across the border.\"  Samaniego Decl. \n¶ 11, ECF No. 55-26. \nWhen a plaintiff suffers \"a direct pecuniary injury\" that, too, is generally \n\"sufficient to establish injuryinfact.\"  KP. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 122 (5th Cir. 2010); see \nalso Texas Democratic Party v. Benkiser, 459 F.3d 582, 586 (5th Cir. 2006) (\"economic injury is \na quintessential injury upon which to base standing\").  For example, a municipality's \n\"diminish[ed] .  .  . tax base\" constitutes injury in fact.  See Gladstone Realtors v.  Village of \nBellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 110-11 (1979).  That is equally true where the economic injury stems \nfrom the \"loss of a nonillusory opportunity\" to obtain \"a benefit.\"  Ecosystem Investment \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 16 of 33\nPartners v. Crosby Dredging, L.L.C., 729 F. App'x 287, 292 (5th Cir. 2018); see also Czyzewski \nv. Jevic Holding Corp.,  137 S. Ct. 973, 983 (2017) (finding standing where challenged action \ndeprived party of \"a chance to obtain a settlement that respected [its] priority\" in bankruptcy). \nEven if we were to view Judge Samaniego and Ms. Keller's current fears of \nconstruction and chaos as unpersuasive, more economic harm is \"certainly impending\" and may \nconstitute an injury in fact despite having \"not yet materialized.\"  SBA v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. \n149, 158 (2014) (quotations omitted); LeBlanc, 627 F.3d at 122.  The longer the President's \nProclamation remains in effect, the more El Paso County's reputation will be tarnished in the \neyes of tourists and developers, and the more hours El Paso County officials will have to devote \nto combating negative messaging, as opposed to \"meeting directly with business leaders to bring \nbusiness to El Paso.\"  Samaniego DecI. ¶ 12, ECF No. 55-26. \nMoreover, Defendants will divert $20 million away from a planned military \nconstruction project at Fort Bliss in El Paso County, and one of the new wall projects will take \nplace in southern New Mexico, in El Paso County's close vicinity.  Supplemental Notice of \nDOD Decision 3, ECF No. 114.  \"Fort Bliss is the lifeblood of the El Paso economy,\" \ncontributing billions of dollars and creating thousands of jobs.  Samaniego Dccl. ¶ 15, ECF. No. \n55-26.  Losing funds that had been appropriated for use at Fort Bliss \"creates the imminent \nprospect of economic harm to El Paso County.\"  Id. ¶ 16.  That loss of funds also represents a \nmissed opportunity to \"obtain a benefit,\" which can also suffice to show injury in fact.  N.E. \nAssociated Gen. Contractors v.  City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993). \nd.  Causation and Redressability Have Been Shown. \nWhile Defendants admit that negative impressions of the southern border or El \nPaso County are associated with the Proclamation, they argue that El Paso County cannot \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 17 of 33\ndemonstrate causation.  CrossMot. 39, ECF No. 95.  Nor can El Paso County show how a \nfavorable decision will redress its injury of lost business and tourism.  Id. \nHowever, the causation element is satisfied because the County's reputational and \neconomic injuries are \"fairly traceable\" to Defendants' actions.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n167 (1997).  The President's Proclamation expressly declares a \"national emergency\" on the \n\"southern border\"including El Paso Countybased on its status as a \"major entry point for \ncriminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.\"  Proclamation 1, ECF 55-14.  And \nDefendants' desired deployment of the military to build a border wall reinforces El Paso \nCounty's image as dangerous and uninviting, while threatening to increase noise and congestion \nin the area.  Id.; see also To Secure the Border and Make America Safe Again,  We Need to \nDeploy the National Guard, Department of Homeland Security (Apr. 4, 2018), https://www. \ndhs.gov/news/20 18/04/04/secure-border-and-make-america- safe-again-we-need-deploy-national- \nguard. \nAs El Paso County officials explained, these precise actions bear a \"causal \nconnection\" to the County's reputational and economic injuries described above.  Driehaus, \n573 U.S. at 158; see Keller Decl. ¶ 6 (\"The President's Proclamation.  is an official \n.  . \ngovernment statement that damages El Paso County's ability to compete for business investment \nand toism.\"), ¶ 10 (\"Because of the President's Proclamation, we are now in the process of \nstrategizing how to combat a falsely negative image.\"),  12-13 (impending wall construction \n¶IJ \nwill create a \"massive construction zone,\" deterring \"tourism and business development\"), ECF \nNo. 55-25; Samaniego Dec. ¶ 10 (\"The President's Proclamation has falsely told the world the \nexact opposite of who we are and what we promote\"), ¶ 16 (diversion of funds from Fort Bliss \n\"creates the imminent prospect of economic harm\"), ECF No. 55-26. \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 18 of 33\nFinally, where, as here, a plaintiff challenges government action, \"[c]ausation and \nredressability typically overlap as two sides of a causation coin.\"  Carpenters Indus. Council v. \nZinke, 854 F.3d 1, 6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  \"After all, if a government action causes an injury, \nenjoining the action usually will redress that injury.\"  Id.  That is true here.  As to El Paso \nCounty's reputational injuries, enjoining Defendants' actions will allow El Paso County officials \nto refocus their resources on improving tourism and commerce, not defending El Paso County \nagainst Defendants' attacks.  See Foretich, 351 F.3d at 1214 (invalidating government action \nfrom which \"reputational injury.  derives\" \"provide[s] meaningful relief').  And as to El Paso \n.  . \nCounty's pecuniary injuries, enjoining Defendants' actions will help restore El Paso County's \nimage in the eyes of tourists and investors and forestall disruptive border wall construction. \nAccordingly, El Paso County has standing to bring its claims. \n2.  BNHR Has Standing. \nBNHR is a community organization headquartered in El Paso, Texas.  Decl. of \nFernando Garcia (\"Garcia Decl.\") ¶J 2-3, ECF No. 55-27.  It consists of about 5,000 members \nwho live and work in west Texas, metropolitan El Paso, and southern New Mexico.  Id. at ¶ 4. \nBNHR's mission is to \"organize border communities through human rights education\" and \n\"mobilize [its] members to advocate for positive change in policies\" affecting \"the immigrant \ncommunity.\"  Id. at ¶ 3.  To fulfill that mission, BNHR \"educate[s] [its] own members about \ntheir rights\" and \"train[s} them to educate and organize other members of the immigrant \ncommunity.\"  Id.  It also works to forge bonds between its members and the area's law \nenforcement officials.  Id. at ¶ 10.  BNHR claims that the Proclamation has impaired its \norganization's mission and caused it to expend an additional $23,956 to combat the unlawful \nconduct.  Id. at ¶J 16, 21; see also id. at ¶J 13, 37, ECF No. 55-27 (explaining that BNHR has \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 19 of 33\n\"divert[ed] resources\" away from its core mission toward \"counsel[ing] members who are \nfearful,\" \"organizing [its] community in opposition to the President's declaration,\" and \n\"opposing the illegal [border wall] construction.\"). \nIn addition to draining and diverting resources, BNHR had to cancel the signature \nevent, \"Hugs Not Walls,\" for one of its \"major initiatives\" to build trust between the immigrant \ncommunity and law enforcement.  Id. at ¶ 32.  Defendants argue that there is an insufficient \nnexus between BNHR' s organizational activities and the Proclamation because the Proclamation \ndoes not actually inhibit BNHR from carrying out its organizational mission, neither by imposing \nbarriers nor by neglecting a legal duty.  CrossMot. 40, ECF No. 95. \n\"An organization has standing to sue on its own behalf if it meets the same \nstanding test that applies to individuals.\"  Fowler, 178 F.3d at 356.  In Havens Really Corp. v. \nColeman, the Supreme Court held a \"housing counseling service\" whose organizational mission \nincluded \"the investigation and referral of complaints concerning housing discrimination\" met \nthat test, enabling it to challenge defendants' \"racial steering practices.\"  455 U. S. 363, 379 \n(1982).  Havens Realty Corporation sent testers to an apartment complex in order to determine \nwhether it practiced unlawful \"racial steering,\" and subsequently sued to challenge the practice it \ndiscovered.  Id. at 363.  The Supreme Court found sufficient the organization's allegation that \nit \"had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract\" defendants' unlawful practices. \nId.  If defendants' \"practices have perceptibly impaired [the organization's] ability to provide\" \nits services, the Supreme Court explained, \"there can be no question that the organization has \nsuffered injury in fact.\"  Id.  \"Such concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization's \nactivitieswith the consequent drain on the organization's resourcesconstitutes far more than \nsimply a setback to the organization's abstract social interests.\"  Id. \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 20 of 33\nApplying Havens Realty, the Fifth Circuit has announced the following rule: \"an \norganization has standing to sue on its own behalf where it devotes resources to counteract a \ndefendant's allegedly unlawful practices.\"  Fowler, 178 F.3d at 360; see also Scott v. Schedler, \n771 F.3d 831, 837 (5th Cir. 2014).  In Scott, the Fifth Circuit held that the Louisiana NAACP \nhad standing to challenge Louisiana's alleged failure to comply with the National Voter \nRegistration Act.  771 F.3d at 837.  Because one NAACP member \"devoted resources to \ncounter[acting] [the State's] allegedly unlawful practices\" by conducting \"voterregistration \ndrives,\" the NAACP \"suffered injury in fact.\"  Id. \nIn a similar vein, the Fifth Circuit held in OCAGreater Houston v.  Texas that an \nadvocacy organization had standing to challenge a Texas law restricting the \"interpretation \nassistance that Englishlimited voters may receive.\"  867 F.3d 604, 606 and 612 (5th Cir. \n2017).  The plaintiffs expended resources to educate members about the restrictions so they \ncould rely on the interpreter of their choice at the polls.  Id. at 612.  Because the organization \n\"went out of its way to counteract the effect of Texas's allegedly unlawful\" restrictionfor \nitthe \ninstance, by \"educat[ing] voters\" about  organization had suffered cognizable injury, even \nif that \"injury was not large.\"  Id. \nHowever, absent such a direct impairment on its mission caused by the challenged \naction, standing does not exist whenever a public interest organization decides to spend money \nopposing a governmental policy of concern or the organization suffered a \"setback to [its] \nabstract social interests.\"  Id. (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 739 (1972) \n(explaining that \"a mere interest in a problem, no matter how longstanding the interest and no \nmatter how qualified the organization is in evaluating the problem, is not sufficient by itself. \n. \n(internal quotations omitted)). \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 21 of 33\nThe Fifth Circuit rejected a claim of organizational standing in NAACP v. City of \nKyle.  626 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 2010).  There the plaintiff tried to ground standing to challenge \nrevised housing ordinances in a study it had commissioned regarding the impact of the revisions, \nas well as lobbying efforts designed to persuade the defendant municipality not to implement the \nrevised ordinances, but did not explain how those efforts \"differ from the HBA's routine \nlobbying activities,\" or \"identif]jy] any specific projects that the HBA had to put on hold or \notherwise curtail in order to respond to the revised ordinances.\"  Id.  at 238.  The Kyle court \nalso reaffirmed that \"redirect[ing]  resources to litigation and legal counseling in response to \n.  .  . \nactions or inactions of another party is insufficient to impart standing upon the organization.\" \nId. (quoting La. ACORN Fair Hous. v. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d 298, 305 (5th Cir. 2000). \nHere BNHR has explained how its current expenditures differ from its routine \nactivities and, unlike the plaintiff in Kyle, it has not merely redirected resources to litigation and \nlegal counseling in response to the Proclamation.  In normal circumstances, BNHR \ndedicates its resources to \"its core mission\" of human rights education and \"promoting \nimmigration reform.\"  Garcia Decl. ¶ 13, ECF No. 55-27.  Because of Defendants' emergency \ndeclaration and attendant transfer of funds to build a wall, however, BNHR has had to \"divert \nresources\" away from that core mission, and toward \"counsel[ing] community members who are \nfearful,\" \"organizing [its] community in opposition to the President's declaration,\" and \n\"opposing the illegal [border wall] construction.\"  Id. at ¶J 13, 37. \nIn addition, BNHR has held and scheduled Proclamation-related weekend events \nthat it would not otherwise hold and has increased the frequency of its \"Know Your Rights\" \npresentations approximately five-fold.  Id. at ¶J 14-15.  It has also hired another policy \nconsultant (costing $14,400) to deal with its increased advocacy workload in light of the \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 22 of 33\nProclamation, and has sent delegations to discuss the Proclamation's effects with congressional \nmembers in Washington, D.C.  Id. at  16, 19.  In short, as the organization's Executive \n¶f \nDirector stated in his declaration, the Proclamation and Defendants' subsequent actions have \n\"required BNHR to expend significant resources that could have, and would have, gone \nelsewhere,\" leading to a total of $23,956 in additional organizational expenses.  Id. at ¶  16, 21. \nLike the organizational plaintiffs in Havens Really, OCAGreater Houston, and \nScott, BNHR has standing to challenge Defendants' actions.  As shown, BNHR has gone \"out \nof its way to counteract\" those actions by diverting resources from its traditional activities \ntoward \"counsel[ing]\" and \"organizing\" community members in relation to the national \nemergency and border wall.  OCAGreater Houston, 867 F.3d at 612; Garcia Decl.  13, 37, \n¶f \nECF No. 55-27.  And Defendants' actions have inflicted \"demonstrable injury to the \norganization's activities\" because those actions have forced BNHR to cancel initiatives, like the \n\"Hugs Not Walls\" campaign signature event, it would otherwise spearhead.  Havens Really, \n455 U.S. at 379; Garcia Dccl. ¶ 32, ECF No. 55-27. \nAll BNHR's organizational injuries, moreover, have a \"causal nexus\" to \nDefendants' actions, and would be redressed if this Court were to enjoin those actions.  See \nScott, 771 F.3d at 838-39.  Defendants raise the same arguments regarding causation and \nredressability as brought up against El Paso County, but BNHR similarly will be able to refocus \ntheir resources on their core mission after summary judgment and injunction in their favor.  See \nsupra 18.  Thus, BNHR has standing and this case will not be dismissed for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. \n3.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Sue Under  2808. \n§ \nFinally, Defendants initially argued that Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge \n§ \n22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 23 of 33\n2808 construction because the border barrier construction projects funded under  2808 had not \n§ \nbeen decided.  Rapuano Deci. ¶J 5-7, ECF No. 95-7.  At the time of Defendants' Cross \nMotion the process was still ongoing as to which specific military construction projects would be \nauthorized.  Id.  But on September 5, 2019, Defendants gave notice that the DOD had made \nthe final determination to divert $20 million away from planned construction on \"Defense \nAccess Roads\" at Fort Bliss, to be used on building a wall under  2808.  Supplemental Notice \n§ \nof DOD Decision 2, ECF No. 114. \nA federal district court recently rejected Defendant's same argument in Sierra \nClub v. Trump, 379 F. Supp.3d 883, 907-08 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (reversed on other grounds).  A \n\"future\" pecuniary injury may suffice so long as there is a \"substantial risk that the harm will \noccur.\"  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014).  Furthermore, though \nstanding may rest not rest on the independent actions of third parties, it may rest on \"injury \nproduced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.\"  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997) (finding standing to challenge an agency's biological opinion \nthat \"ha[d] a powerful coercive effect on the agency action.  though the action agency was \n. . \ntechnically free to disregard the Biological Opinion... [all were] keenly aware of the virtually \ndeterminative effect of its biological opinions.\") \nEspecially considering the most recent developments, the Court agrees with the \nPlaintiffs that they have standing to challenge Defendants' use of  2808 funds.  Plaintiffs have \n§ \ndemonstrated a \"substantial risk\" that Defendants will rely on  2808 to fund a border wall. \n§ \nReply 11-12, ECF No. 101 (quoting Driehaus, 573 U.S. at 158).  The Proclamation expressly \n\"invoke[s]\" and \"ma[kes] available\" \"the construction authority provided in [] 2808 of title 10.\" \nProclamation 1, ECF No. 55-14.  And the same day the President issued his Proclamation, the \n23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 24 of 33\nWhite House identified the amount of  2808 funds \"that will be available to build the border \n§ \nwall:\" $3.6 billion.  Facts Sheet 4, ECF No. 95-5.  There is a substantial risk that the Acting \nDefense Secretary will follow the President's directive to use  2808 funds to build a border \n§ \nwall, rather than disregard it.  See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  The fact that the Acting Secretary \nis \"technically free to disregard the\" Proclamation is irrelevant in light of its \"virtually \ndeterminative effect\" on his actions.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 170. \nThe Government's position is made more implausible by the fact that the DOD \nhas taken significant steps toward building the border wall using  2808 fundsnamely \n§ \nidentifying the deferred projects that will serve as sources of the funding.  See supra 22.  That \ndiversion of funds substantiates the County's \"direct pecuniary injury\" that suffices for Article \nIII standing.  LeBlanc, 627 F.3d at 122.  After all, it takes funds from the \"lifeblood of the El \nPasc economy,\" and it eliminates jobs that new construction at Fort Bliss would have created. \nSee Samaniego Deci.  14-16, ECF No. 55-26.  Such \"economic injur[ies] [are] quintessential \n¶IJ \ninjur[iesj upon which to base standing.\"  Texas Democratic Party, 459 F.3d at 586.  There is a \nmore than substantial risk that the DOD will use  2808 funds on a border wall, at Fort Bliss's \n§ \nexpense.  Having established that Plaintiffs have standing to challenge Defendants' actions, the \nCourt turns to the merits. \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION IS UNLAWFUL. \nThe Proclamation is unlawful because the funding plan violates the CAA \ngenerally and specifically violates  739.  Because this disposes of the case, the Court will not \n§ \naddress the other merits arguments raised, including the constitutionality of the Proclamation and \nthe NEA, nor the Appropriations Clause and Administrative Procedures Act  Following \nclaims.1 \nDefendants do not repeat their arguments that Plaintiffs do not fall within the zone of interests of the CAA, and \n24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 25 of 33\nRule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court will enter summary judgment \nbecause \"the movant [has shown] []that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex, 477 \nU.S. at 322-23; Curtis, 710 F.3d at 594.  Defendants agree with Plaintiffs that this case presents \nlegal questions for the Court to resolve without the need for further factual development. \nFinally, Plaintiffs have requested a preliminary injunction, which is a matter of \nequitable discretion and is \"an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\"  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 \nU.s. 7, 22 (2008).  Defendants have countered that Plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief \nagainst the President.  CrossMot. 20 and 23, ECF No. 95.  The Court has requested additional \nbriefing on this issue arid will reserve judgment in this regard for a later date. \n1.  Defendants' Use of Funds to Build a Border Wall Violates the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act. \nTo resolve this case, the Court turns to one of the three golden rules of statutory \nconstruction \"established from time immemorial\" that \"a more specific statute will be given \nprecedence over a more general one.\"  Nevada v. Dep 't of Energy, 400 F.3d 9, 16 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (quoting 1  Comp. Dec. 126, 127 (1894) and Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 \n(1980)).  This rule \"appli[es] to appropriations bills.\"  See id.  Thus, \"[a]n appropriation for \na specific purpose is exclusive of other appropriations in general terms which might be \napplicable in the absence of the specific appropriation.\"  Id. (quoting 4 Comp. Gen. 476, 476 \n(1924)).  Applying this rule, the D.C. Circuit has held, for instance, that Congress's specific \neven if they did the Court agrees with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which reasoned \nthat when a plaintiff seeks equitable relief against a defendant for exceeding its statutory authority, the zone-of- \ninterests test is inapposite.  Sierra Club, 379 F.Supp.3d at 910. \n25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 26 of 33\nappropriation of $1 million to Nevada for conducting \"scientific oversight responsibilities\" \nprecluded a more general $190 million appropriation for \"nuclear waste disposal activities\" from \nbeing directed to Nevada.  Id. \nLike the specific appropriation in Nevada, the CAA specifically appropriates \n$1.3 75 billion for border-wall expenditures and requires those expenditures to be made on \n\"construction.  in the Rio Grande Valley Sector\" alone.  CAA  230, 231.  Defendants' \n.  .  § § \nfunding plan, by contrast, will transfer $6.1 billion of funds appropriated for other more general \npurposesmilitary construction, under  2808, and counterdrug activities, under  284.  Their \n§  § \nplan therefore flouts the cardinal principle that a specific statute controls a general one and \nviolates the CAA.  See Nevada, 400 F.3d at 16; United States v. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 321 \n(1976). \nDefendants counter by pointing out that the CAA does not modify any of the \nstatutes at issue here and, therefore, Congress did not intend to disable the use of other available \nfunding authorities.  See Cross-Mot. 54, ECF No. 95.  The DOD Secretary may exercise his \ndiscretion to spend because he is only cabined by the text of the appropriation.  Id. (citing \nSalazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, 200 (2012) (quotation omitted).  In absence \nof CAA provisions that specifically alter the meaning or availability of \"permanent statutes\" like \n284 and  2808, it cannot be inferred that Congress meant to restrict the use of other \n§  § \nappropriated funds for similar purposes.  Id. at 54-55 (citing Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 \nU.S. 153, 190 (1978) (\"doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication applies with full vigor when \nthe subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure\")); see also Donovan v. Carolina Stalite \nCo., 734 F.2d 1547, 1558 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\"{W]hen appropriations measures arguably conflict \nwith the underlying authorizing legislation, their effect must be construed narrowly.\") \n26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 27 of 33\nHowever, Defendants' reliance on Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter is \nmisplaced.  At issue in that case is whether the Government must pay the full amount of \ncontract support costs when Congress appropriates enough funds to pay in full any individual \ncontractor's contract support costs, but not enough funds to cover the aggregate amount due \nevery contractor.  Salazar, 567 U.S. at 185.  Consistent with longstanding principles of \ngovernment contracting law, the Supreme Court held that the Government must pay each tribe's \ncontract support costs in full.  Id.  Defendants rely on dicta in this case: \"[in the absence of \ncontrary language, the grant of a specific appropriation cannot be read to restrict the use of other \nappropriated funds for similar purposes pursuant to other statutory authority.\"  CrossMot. 54- \n55 (citing Salazar, 567 U.s. at 200), ECF No. 95. \nBut in Salazar the Supreme Court reasoned that because Congress merely \nappropriated a lumpsum amount (for tribes to pay contract support costs) without a statutory \nrestriction on what could be done with those funds, a clear inference arose that Congress did not \nintend to impose legally binding restrictions.  567 U.S. at 200 (citing Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. \n182, 192).  The Supreme Court cites Lincoln v. Vigil, which underscores the conclusion that \n\"[t]he allocation of funds from a lumpsum appropriation is {an] administrative decision... \ncommitted to agency discretion.  After all, the very point of a lumpsum appropriation is to \ngive an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory \nresponsibilities in. .  .  the most effective. . . way.\"  Vigil, 508 U.S. at 192.  However, the CAA \nis not a lump sum appropriation without restrictions, and Defendants do not profess it to be such. \nSee CAA § 230.  The CAA provides $ 1.375 billion for \"the construction of primary pedestrian \nfencing\" in \"the Rio Grande Valley Sector.\"  CAA  230(a)(1).  And it states that none of the \n§ \nfunds appropriated by the Act can be used \"for the construction of pedestrian fencing\" in any of \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 28 of 33\nthe five other areas of the border.  Id.  231. \n§ \nMoreover, in Salazar and Lincoln, the Supreme Court makes much of the fact that \nthe \"indicia in committee reports and other legislative history as to how funds should or are \nexpected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on the agency.\"  567 U.S. at 200 \n(quoting 508 U.S. at 192).  Here we have far more than \"indicia\" or legislative history \nestablishing Congressional expectations as to how the funds are spent: the plain text of the CAA \nrestricts the amount and location of funding for border barrier construction.  See CAA \n§ \n230(a)(1), 231. \nDefendants reliance on Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill is similarly inapposite. \n437 U.S. 153, 190 (1978) (\"doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication 'applies with full vigor \nwhen.  the subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure.\" (quoting Committee for \n.  . \nNuclear Responsibility v. Seaborg, 463 F.2d 783, 785 (1971))).  There the Supreme Court held \nthat congressional appropriations to finish a dam that would eradicate an endangered species did \nAct \nnot impliedly repeal the Endangered Species  \"the most comprehensive legislation for \npreservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.\"  Tennessee Valley Auth., 437 \nU.S. at 180, 184.  Defendants imply that Plaintiffs' argument requires a repeal of the Military \nConstruction Act and Funding for Counterdrug Activities.  See CrossMot. 54-55, ECF No. 95. \nIt does not.  See Mot. 33, ECF No. 54.  Plaintiffs argue, and this Court agrees, that the \nProclamation and its use of the statutes has violated the CAA; repeal of  284 and  2808 is not \n§  § \nnecessary to reach this conclusion.  Id. \nFinally, Defendants cite Donovan v. Carolina Stalite Co. for the proposition that \n\"when appropriations measures arguably conflict with the underlying authorizing legislation, \ntheir effect must be construed narrowly.\"  CrossMot. 55, (citing 734 F.2d 1547, 1558 (D.C. \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 29 of 33\nCir. 1984)).  However, the CAA does not conflict with any underlying authorizing legislation, \nrather the Proclamation's use of other legislation to commit additional funds to border barrier \nconstruction conflicts with the CAA.  Compare CAA  230 with  284, 2808.  Donovan \n§  § \nrelies on Tennessee Valley Authority, which is inapplicable as described above.  See supra 26. \nDonovan also relies on US. v. Langston, which is illustrative of the problem with \nDefendants' argument in general: Congress did not need to be prescient and specifically \"alter\" \nor repeal § 284 and § 2808 in order to limit border barrier funding to the amount appropriated in \nthe CAA.  See 734 F.2d at 1558 (citing 118 U.S. 389 (1886)).  InLangston, the salary of the \nminister to Haiti was originally fixed at the sum of $7,500.  118 U.S. at 394.  Then subsequent \nacts appropriated $5,000 for his benefit, but did not contain any language to the effect that such \nsum shall be \"in full compensation\" for those years, nor was there in either of the subsequent acts \nan appropriation of money \"for additional pay,\" from which it might be inferred that Congress \nintended to repeal the act fixing his annual salary at $7,500.  Id.  Repeals by implication are \nnot favored, and the Supreme Courtin  886was able to look to several precedents \n1 \nestablishing this rule specifically in the context of appropriations for public officials' salaries. \nId. at 392-93 (citing US. v. Fisher, 109 U.S. 143, 146 (1883); US. v. Mitchell, 109 U.S. 146, \n149 (1883)).  In contrast, this case presents an unprecedented issue, albeit with a familiar \nsolution that the Langston opinion recommends: the congressional language in the CAA itself \nreveals Congress's intent to limit the border barrier funding.  See id. and CAA  739.  And \n§ \nnowhere is this made more apparent than in  739 of the CAA detailed below. \n§ \n2.  In Addition, the Proclamation Violates  739. \n§ \nCAA § 739 expressly forbids Defendants'  funding plan.  § 739 states: \nNone of the funds made available in this or any other appropriations \nAct may be used to increase.  funding for a program, project, or \n. . \n29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 30 of 33\nactivity as proposed in the President's budget request for a fiscal \nyear  until such proposed  change is  subsequently  enacted  in  an \nappropriation Act, or unless such change is made pursuant to the \nreprogramming  or  transfer  provisions  of  this  or  any  other \nappropriations Act. \n739 creates a general rule and an exception.  The general rule is that \"[n]one of \n§ \nthe funds made available\" in an \"appropriations Act\" (including the CAA) \"may be used to \nincrease funding for a program, project, or activity\" that was \"proposed in the President's budget \nrequest for a fiscal year.\"  CAA  739.  The exception is that appropriations may be used to \n§ \nincrease such funding if that use is authorized by \"the reprogramming or transfer provisions\" of \nan \"appropriations Act.\" \n739 prohibits Defendants' plan to fund the border wall because the plan is \n§ \nbarred by that provision's general rule and the plan does not fall within its exception. \nDefendants' plan is barred by § 73 9's general rule, because it (1) seeks to use funds \"made \navailable in\" an \"appropriations Act\"; (2) \"to increase funding for a program, project, or \nactivity\"; (3) that was \"proposed in the President's budget request for a fiscal year.\" \nFirst, Defendants' plan seeks to use funds \"made available in\" an \"appropriations \nAct.\"  CAA  739.  It taps appropriated military construction funds under  2808 and \n§  § \ncounterdrug support funds under  284.  As the White House has acknowledged, all funds have \n§ \nbeen \"appropriated by Congress.\"  Fact Sheet, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings- \nstatements/president-donald-jtrumps-border-security-victory/.  The Military Construction \nAppropriation Acts dating back to 1982 \"made available\" the  2808 military construction funds. \n§ \nSee, e.g., Pub. L. No. 97-106, 95 Stat. 1503; see also § 2808(a) (military construction projects \n\"may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds that have been appropriated for \nmilitary construction\").  And the DOD Appropriations Act \"made available\" the  284 \n§ \n30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 31 of 33\ncounterdrug support funds.  See Pub. L. No. 115-245 (2019).  So while  2808 and  284 \n§  § \nthemselves are not appropriations act, which is why they do not fall within the  739 exception \n§ \n(detailed below, infra 31), they were \"made available\" by an appropriation act. \nSecond, Defendants' plan also seeks to use these appropriations to \"increase \nfunding for a program, project, or activity.\"  CAA  739.  Construction of a wall along the \n§ \nsouthern border is a singular \"project\" under that word's ordinary meaning.  See Merriam \nWebster's Dictionary 932 (11th ed. 2003) (defining \"project\" as \"a specific plan or design\") \nIndeed, the Executive Branch has consistently referred to the wall in this manner.  In the first \ndays of his administration, the President signed an executive order stating that it is \"the policy of \nthe executive branch\" to construct \"a physical wall on the southern border,\" defined as \"a \ncontiguous, physical wall, or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical \nbarrier.\"  82 Fed. Reg. 8793-94, ECF No. 55-5, (2017).  Likewise, on the day of the \nPresident's Proclamation, a White House fact sheet announced that the Executive Branch would \nuse over $6 billion in additional funds to \"build the border wall.\"  Fact Sheet, https://www. \nwhitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-security-victory/. \nThird, funding for the border wall was \"proposed in the President's budget \nrequest for a fiscal year.\"  CAA  739.  On January 6, 2019, President Trump formally \n§ \nrequested $5.7 billion for fiscal year 2019 \"for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest \nborder.\"  Letter to Appropriations Chairman 1, ECF No. 55-28.  And he was denied, which \nled to the longest government shutdown in our country's history.  See Pl.'s Mot. 4-5, ECF No. \n54; see also Sierra Club, 379 F.Supp.3d at 892. \nNext, Defendants' funding plan is not saved by  739's exception: the funding \n§ \nincreases it proposes are not \"change[s]  made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer \n.  .  . \n31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 32 of 33\nprovisions of this or any other appropriations Act.\"  Under federal law, an \"appropriations Act\" \nis an Act whose title begins: \"An Act making appropriations.\"  2 U.S.C.  622(5);  U.S.C. \n§  1  § \n105.  Neither  2808 nor  284 begins with this language.  2808 is a provision of the Military \n§  §  § \nConstruction Codification Act, Pub. L. No. 97-124, 96 Stat. 153 (1982), which says nothing \nabout appropriations in its title, nor makes any appropriations in its body.  And  284 is a \n§ \nprovision of the National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 114-328, 130 Stat. 2000, 2381, \n2497 (2016), which by title and substance is not an \"appropriations Act.\"  Cf Pub. L. No. 115- \n31, 131  Stat. 135, 229 (2017) (separate statute appropriating DOD funds).  The Proclamation \nviolates  739 of the CAA. \n§ \nCONCLUSION \nEl Paso County and Border Network for Human Rights have standing to sue \nDefendants.  Because the Proclamation seeks additional funds for border barrier funding in \nviolation of the CAA generally and  739 of the CAA specifically, it is unlawful.  There is no \n§ \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact, so Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, and Border \nNetwork for Human Right's \"Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the alternative, a Preliminary \nInjunction\" is GRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants Donald J. Trump, Patrick M. \nShanahan, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, David Bernhardt, Steven T. Mnuchin, William Barr, John F. \nBash, and Todd T. Semonite's \"CrossMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, and \nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and a Preliminary Injunction\" IS \nDENIED. \n32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 129   Filed 10/11/19   Page 33 of 33\nIT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Plaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, and Border \nNetwork for Human Right shall FILE A PROPOSED PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nspecifying the scope of said injunction WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THIS MEMORANDUM \nOPINION and then Defendants Donald J.

See Presidential Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency \nConcerning the Southern Border of the United States, 2019 WL 643819, at *1 (Feb. 15, 2019) \n(“Proclamation”).  The situation at the southern border places a tremendous strain on the limited \nresources of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), exacerbating risks to border security, \npublic safety, and the safety of the migrants themselves. See Letter from Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity Kirstjen M. Nielsen to Members of Congress (Mar. 28, 2019) (Nielsen Letter) (Ex. 1).    \nFacilities are overcrowded, officers are stretched thin, and resources are being redirected away from \nlaw enforcement to address this humanitarian and security crisis. Id.  In May 2019, over 132,887 people \nwere apprehended between ports of entry on the southern border, compared with 99,304 in April and \n92,840 in March.  See DHS Sw. Border Migration Statistics FY 2019, at 2 (dated June 5, 2019) (Ex. 2); \nsee also U.S. Customs & Border Protection Announces May 2019 Migration Statistics (Ex. 3). \nThe Government has been building barriers along the southern border since the 1990s \npursuant to congressional authorization.  To address the current national emergency at the southern \nborder, three statutory authorities and sources of funding have been identified to continue the \nconstruction of additional barriers, in addition to the $1.375 billion recently appropriated by Congress \nfor such construction:  (1) the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (31 U.S.C. § 9705); (2) the Department of \nDefense’s (DoD) counter-drug support authority (10 U.S.C. § 284); and (3) the authority to spend \nunobligated military construction funds to undertake military construction projects necessary to \nsupport the use of the armed forces in response to a national emergency (10 U.S.C. § 2808).  Plaintiffs \nEl Paso County and Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) challenge the Proclamation and the \nGovernment’s reliance on these authorities. \nThe Proclamation follows a 40-year tradition of multiple Presidents of both parties declaring \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 15 of 75\n \nnational emergencies to address a wide range of problems.  Indeed, many of the declarations \nconcerned situations that did not involve unforeseen circumstances or call for immediate action on \nthe part of the federal government.  Thus, for example, President Obama declared a national \nemergency to address “political repression” in Burundi, Exec. Order No. 13712, 80 Fed. Reg. 73633 \n(Nov.  23,  2015);  President  George  W.  Bush  declared  a  national  emergency  to  address  the \n“fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections” in Belarus, Exec. Order No. 13405, 71 Fed. Reg. \n35485 (June 16, 2006); and President Clinton declared a national emergency because “the Government \nof Burma has committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma,” Exec. Order \nNo. 13047, 62 Fed. Reg. 28301 (May 22, 1997).  And Presidents similarly have used this power to \naddress longstanding problems, such as when George H.W. Bush declared a national emergency in \n1990 to address the “proliferation of chemical and biological weapons” around the world.  Exec. \nOrder No. 12735, 55 Fed. Reg. 48587 (Nov. 16, 1990).  President Trump’s Proclamation concerning \nthe national emergency at our Nation’s southern border is neither unprecedented nor fundamentally \ndifferent from past uses of the same authority, and is in fact more closely tied to exigent circumstances. \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ challenge to the President’s decision to declare a national \nemergency on the southern border is not subject to judicial review.  Judicial review of the Proclamation \nis not available under the National Emergencies Act (NEA), and in any event such challenges raise \npolitical questions the judiciary is not equipped to answer, as courts overwhelmingly have recognized.  \nIndependent separation-of-powers concerns also require dismissal of the President as a defendant \nbecause there is no cause of action against the President, and Plaintiffs may not obtain equitable relief \ndirectly against the President for his official conduct, where, as here, the relief Plaintiffs seek could be \nprovided by subordinate agency officials.  And since the ultimate exercise of power under an \nemergency declaration is channeled by the statutory requirements of § 2808, there is no concern in \nthis case that the NEA runs afoul of the non-delegation doctrine. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 16 of 75\n \nPlaintiffs also lack standing to challenge the Proclamation or the Government’s use of \nconstruction authorities.  Plaintiffs’ challenge to DoD’s use of its § 2808 authority is premature \nbecause DoD has not yet decided to undertake or authorize any barrier construction projects pursuant \nto § 2808.1  They have no standing to challenge funding transfers under § 8005 of the 2019 DoD \nAppropriations Act.  And neither plaintiff can show a redressible injury-in-fact caused by either the \nProclamation or the sole § 284 project slated for the El Paso Sector. \nEven if Plaintiffs’ statutory claims were justiciable, they fail on the merits for numerous \nreasons.  With respect to § 2808, Plaintiffs’ APA claims fail because there is no final agency action, \nand any such action would be committed to agency discretion by law.  Plaintiffs’ APA claims for \nviolations of § 284, § 2808, and § 8005 also fail because the plaintiffs’ interests fall outside the zone of \ninterests of those provisions.  And Plaintiffs have failed to show a violation of the statutes they invoke, \nor any arbitrary and capricious agency action, that would support their APA claims.   \nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ constitutional claims are meritless.  Defendants are relying on express \ncongressional authorization to fund border construction, not the President’s independent Article II \nauthority.  Plaintiffs’ efforts to reframe alleged statutory violations as violations of the constitution \ncontravene the principle that “claims simply alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory \nauthority are not ‘constitutional’ claims.”  Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 473 (1994).   \nAccordingly, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment or a \npreliminary injunction, and either grant the Government’s motion to dismiss the First Amended \nComplaint or award summary judgment to the Government on all counts. \n  \n                                                 \n1 Once a § 2808 decision is made, the Government will notify opposing counsel about the decision, \nat which juncture the parties can determine if any modifications to the briefing schedule are needed \nto address § 2808 on the merits. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 17 of 75\n \nBACKGROUND \n  Congress’s Authorization of Border Barrier Construction \nCongress has repeatedly authorized the construction of border barrier infrastructure to \nprevent illegal entry of people and contraband.  In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which authorizes the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to “take such actions as may be necessary to install additional physical barriers and roads \n(including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) in the vicinity of the United States \nborder to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry into the United States.”  Pub. L. No. 104-\n208, Div. C., Title I § 102(a), 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), as amended (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103 note).  \nCongress amended IIRIRA on three occasions to expand the Government’s authority to construct \nbarriers along the southern border.   In 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. \nNo. 109-13, Div. B, Title I §102, 119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (2005), which authorized the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to “to waive all legal requirements” that, in the “Secretary’s sole discretion,” are \n“necessary to ensure expeditious construction” of barriers and roads.  Id. § 102(c)(1).  The following \nyear, Congress again amended IIRIRA as part of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, requiring construction \nof “physical barriers, roads, lights, cameras, and sensors” across hundreds of miles of the southern \nborder in five specified locations, including “from 5 miles west of the Columbus, New Mexico, port \nof entry to 10 miles east of El Paso, Texas.”  Pub. L. No. 109-367, § 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (2006).  In 2007, \nCongress expanded this requirement and directed “construct[ion of] reinforced fencing along not less \nthan 700 miles of the southwest border.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-\n161, Div. E, Title V § 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (2007).   \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 18 of 75\n \nRelying on these authorities, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has installed 650 \nmiles of vehicle and pedestrian barriers along the southern border since 1996. 2  See S. Appropriations \nHr’g on the DHS FY 2018 Budget, 2017 WL 2311065 (May 25, 2017) (Testimony of then-Secretary \nof Homeland Security John Kelly).  These efforts have been subject to diverse legal challenges, but \ncourts have uniformly dismissed every lawsuit.  See In re Border Infrastructure Envtl. Litig., 915 F.3d 1215 \n(9th Cir. 2019); N. American Butterfly Ass’n v. Nielsen, 2019 WL 634596 (D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2019); Cty. of \nEl Paso v. Chertoff, 2008 WL 4372693 (W.D. Tex. 2008), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 915 (2009). \n  DHS’s Recent Efforts to Expedite Border Barrier Construction \nOn January 25, 2017, the President issued an Executive Order directing federal agencies “to \ndeploy all lawful means to secure the Nation’s southern border.”  Border Security and Immigration \nEnforcement Improvements, Exec. Order No. 13767, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 25, 2017).  The Order \nrequired that agencies “take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design and construct a physical \nwall along the southern border,” including “[i]dentify[ing] and, to the extent permitted by law, \nallocat[ing] sources of Federal funds” to that effort.  Id. at 8794.  In furtherance of this directive, DHS \nhas expedited border barrier projects in the El Paso region.  See, e.g., Determination Pursuant to Section \n102 of IIRIRA, 84 Fed. Reg. 17185–87 (Apr. 24, 2019) (construction in New Mexico portions of the \nEl Paso Sector). \n  Congress’s Authorization for U.S. Military Support of DHS’s Border Security \nEfforts \nCongress also has expressly authorized the U.S. military to provide a wide range of support at \nthe southern border, including the “construction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to \n                                                 \n2 The Court may consider facts outside the complaint on a motion to dismiss without converting the \nmotion into a motion for summary judgment when the facts are subject to judicial notice.  Kaempe v. \nMyers, 367 F.3d 958, 965 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  “[I]t is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take \njudicial notice of matters of public record.”  Norris v.

Since the early 1990s, military personnel have supported civilian law-\nenforcement agency activities to secure the border, counter the spread of illegal drugs, and respond to \ntransnational organized crime and other transnational threats.  See H. Armed Servs. Comm. Hr’g on \nS. Border Defense Support (Jan. 29, 2019) (Joint Statement of John Rood, Under Secretary of Defense \nfor Policy, and Vice Admiral Michael Gilday, Director of Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff) \n(Joint Statement of Rood and Gilday) (Ex. 4).  Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both \ndeployed military personnel to the southern border to support DHS’s security efforts.  Id.  \nFor decades, U.S. military forces have played an active role in barrier construction and \nreinforcement during their deployments to the southern border.  Military personnel were critical to \nconstruction of the San Diego border barrier in the early 1990s as well as other border fence projects.  \nSee H.R. Rep. No. 103-200, at 330–31 (1993) (commending the Department of Defense’s Joint Task \nForce 6 for its role in construction of the San Diego primary fence); Hr’g Before the S. Comm. On \nArmed Servs. Subcomm. On Emerging Threats and Capabilities, 1999 WL 258030 (Apr. 27, 1999) \n(Test. of Barry R. McCaffrey, Dir. of the Office of Nat’l Drug Control Policy) (military personnel \nconstructed over 65 miles of barrier fencing).  In 2006, National Guard personnel improved the \nsouthern border security infrastructure by building more than 38 miles of fence, 96 miles of vehicle \nbarrier, and more than 19 miles of new all-weather road, and performing road repairs exceeding 700 \nmiles.  See Joint Statement of Rood and Gilday.  More recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \nassisted DHS by providing planning, engineering, and barrier construction support.  See, e.g., Gringo \nPass, Inc. v. Kiewit Sw. Co., 2012 WL 12905166, at *1 (D. Ariz. Jan. 11, 2012).    \n  DoD’s Current Support for DHS’s Efforts to Secure the Southern Border \nBuilding on this decades-long practice, on April 4, 2018, the President issued a memorandum \nto the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General titled, \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 20 of 75\n \n“Securing the Southern Border of the United States.”  See Presidential Memorandum, 2018 WL \n1633761 (Apr. 4, 2018).  The President stated “[t]he security of the United States is imperiled by a \ndrastic surge of illegal activity on the southern border” and pointed to the “anticipated rapid rise in \nillegal crossings,” as well as “the combination of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity, and extensive \nillegal immigration.”  Id.  The President determined the situation at the border had “reached a point \nof crisis” that “once again calls for the National Guard to help secure our border and protect our \nhomeland.”  Id.  To address this crisis, the President directed the Secretary of Defense to support \nDHS in “securing the southern border and taking other necessary actions to stop the flow of deadly \ndrugs and other contraband, gang members and other criminals, and illegal aliens into this country.”  \nId.  The President also directed the Secretary of Defense to request the use of National Guard \npersonnel to assist in fulfilling this mission.   In October 2018, the President expanded the military’s \nsupport to DHS to include active duty military personnel.  See Joint Statement of Rood and Gilday.  \nOver the course of the last year, military personnel have provided a wide range of border security \nsupport to DHS, including hardening U.S. ports of entry, erecting temporary barriers, and emplacing \nconcertina wire.  See id. \n  The President’s Proclamation Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern \nBorder \nOn February 15, 2019, in accordance with requirements of the NEA, 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq., \nthe President issued a proclamation declaring that “a national emergency exists at the southern border \nof the United States.”  See Proclamation.  The President determined that “[t]he current situation at the \nsouthern border presents a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens core national security \ninterests and constitutes a national emergency.”  Id.  The President explained:  \nThe southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit \nnarcotics.  The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the southern border \nis long-standing, and despite the executive branch’s exercise of existing statutory \nauthorities, the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years.  In particular, \nrecent years have seen sharp increases in the number of family units entering and \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 21 of 75\n \nseeking entry to the United States and an inability to provide detention space for many \nof these aliens while their removal proceedings are pending.  If not detained, such \naliens are often released into the country and are often difficult to remove from the \nUnited States because they fail to appear for hearings, do not comply with orders of \nremoval, or are otherwise difficult to locate. \n \n“Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation,” the President determined that “this \nemergency requires use of the Armed Forces” and “it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide \nadditional support to address the crisis.”  Id. \nTo achieve its purpose, the Proclamation makes 10 U.S.C. § 2808 authority available to the \nActing Secretary of Defense.  See id.  The statute provides that “without regard to any other provision \nof law,” the Secretary of Defense “may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize \nthe Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise \nauthorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).   \nOn March 15, 2019, the President vetoed a joint resolution passed by Congress that would \nhave terminated the President’s national emergency declaration.3  See Veto Message for H.J. Res. 46, \n2019 WL 1219481 (Mar. 15, 2019).  In doing so, the President relied upon statistics published by CBP \nas well as recent congressional testimony by the Secretary of Homeland Security to reaffirm that a \nnational emergency exists along the southern border.  See id.  The President highlighted (1) the recent \nincrease  in  the  number  of  apprehensions  along  the  southern  border,  including  76,000  CBP \napprehensions in February 2019, the largest monthly total in the last five years; (2) CBP’s seizure of \nmore than 820,000 pounds of drugs in fiscal year 2018; and (3) arrests in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 \nof 266,000 aliens previously charged with or convicted of crimes.  See id.  The President also \nemphasized that migration trends along the southern border have changed from primarily single adults \n                                                 \n3 Congress’s efforts to override the President’s veto to enact the joint resolution into law were \nunsuccessful.  See Summary, H.J. Res. 46, 116th Cong. (2019), https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-joint-resolution/46.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 22 of 75\n \nfrom Mexico, who could be easily removed upon apprehension, to caravans that include record \nnumbers of families and unaccompanied children from Central America.  See id.  The President \nexplained that this shift requires frontline border enforcement personnel to divert resources away \nfrom border security to humanitarian efforts and medical care.  See id.  Further, the President stated \nthat criminal organizations are taking advantage of the large flows of families and unaccompanied \nminors to conduct a range of illegal activity.  See id.  With new surges of migrants expected in the \ncoming months, the President stated that border enforcement personnel and resources are strained \n“to the breaking point.”  See id.  The President concluded that the “situation on our border cannot be \ndescribed as anything other than a national emergency, and our Armed Forces are needed to help \nconfront it.”  See id. \nThe situation at the southern border has continued to deteriorate and DHS is facing “a system-\nwide meltdown.”  See Nielsen Letter (Ex. 1).  “DHS facilities are overflowing, agents and officers are \nstretched too thin, and the magnitude of arriving and detained aliens has increased the risk of life \nthreatening incidents.”  Id.  So far this fiscal year there have been a total of 593,507 individuals \napprehended between ports of entry, as compared to 396,579 total apprehensions during all of fiscal \nyear 2018.  See DHS Sw. Border Migration Statistics FY 2019; see also U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection Announces May 2019 Migration Statistics. \n  The Use of Statutory Authorities for Barrier Construction \nOn the same day the President issued the Proclamation, the White House publicly released a \nfact sheet setting forth the sources of funding that are to be used to construct additional barriers along \nthe southern border.  In addition to the $1.375 billion appropriation in the Fiscal Year 2019 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act for the construction of border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley \nsector of Texas, see Pub. L. No. 116-6, § 230, 133 Stat. 13 (2019), the fact sheet identifies the following \nadditional sources of funding for potential barrier construction, which it explains will be used \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 23 of 75\n \nsequentially and as needed: (1) About $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, 31 U.S.C. \n§ 9705; (2) Up to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred for Support for \nCounterdrug Activities (10 U.S.C. § 284); (3) Up to $3.6 billion reallocated from Department of \nDefense military construction projects under the President’s declaration of a national emergency (10 \nU.S.C. § 2808).  See President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory (Feb. 26, 2019), (Ex. 5) \nIn accordance with § 284, on February 25, 2019, DHS requested DoD’s assistance in blocking \n11 specific drug-smuggling corridors on Federal land along certain portions of the southern border.  \nSee Declaration of Kenneth Rapuano ¶ 3 (April 25, 2019) (Ex. 6) (“Rapuano 4/25 Decl.”).  The request \nsought the replacement of existing vehicle barricades or dilapidated pedestrian fencing with new \npedestrian fencing, the construction and improvement of existing patrol roads, and the installation of \nlighting.  Id.  On March 25, 2019, the Acting Secretary of Defense approved two projects in Arizona \nand  one  in  Luna  County  and  Doña  Ana  County,  New  Mexico,  designed  to  replace  existing \ninfrastructure at the border.  Id. \nTo devote additional resources to border barrier construction under its counter-drug support \nauthority, DoD transferred $1 billion in surplus Army compensation funds to the counter-narcotics \nsupport appropriation on March 25, 2019.  See Rapuano 4/25 Decl. at ¶¶ 5, 6.  The Acting Secretary \nof Defense directed the transfer of funds pursuant to DoD’s general transfer authority under § 8005 \nof the DoD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which authorizes the transfer of certain DoD \nfunds between appropriations provided “[t]hat the authority to transfer may not be used unless for \nhigher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements than those for which originally \nappropriated and in no case where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by the \nCongress.”  Pub. L. No. 115-245, § 8005; see also Rapuano 4/25 Decl. ¶ 5. \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 24 of 75\n \nSTATUTORY BACKGROUND \n  The National Emergencies Act \nThe National Emergencies Act (NEA), Pub. L. No. 94-412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976) (codified as \namended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1651), was an effort by Congress to “establish procedural guidelines \nfor the handling of future emergencies with provision for regular Congressional review.”  S. Rep. No. \n94-922, at 1 (1976).4  Title II of the NEA—codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1621—prescribes rules for the \ndeclaration of national emergencies by the President.  Section 1621(a) authorizes the President to \n“declare [a] national emergency” with respect to statutes “authorizing the exercise, during the period \nof a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power.” 50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  Section 1621(b) \nstates that “[a]ny provisions of law conferring powers and authorities to be exercised during a national \nemergency shall be effective and remain in effect (1) only when the President (in accordance with \nsubsection (a) of this section), specifically declares a national emergency, and (2) only in accordance \nwith [the NEA].”  Id. § 1621(b).  \nCongress did not define the term “national emergency” or place any conditions on the \nPresident’s  ability  to  declare  a  national  emergency.    Instead,  Congress  intentionally  left  this \ndetermination to the President.  As the co-chairmen of the Special Congressional Committee on \nNational Emergencies that studied the issue and drafted the NEA explained, “[W]e did review this \npossibility of defining what national emergencies might be comprehended; and we decided you would \ncause more trouble by trying to define it than just saying ‘national emergency’ . . .”.  We felt it would \nbe wrong to try to circumscribe with words with what conditions a President might be confronted.”  \n                                                 \n4 The NEA was the culmination of a multi-year effort by Congress to examine the field of emergency \nstatutes and procedures.  See S. Comm. on Gov’t Operations & the Special Comm. on Nat’l \nEmergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., The National Emergencies Act \nSource Book: Legislative History, Texts, and Other Documents, at 3-9 (1976) (summarizing legislative \nhistory  of  NEA  from  1972-1976,  including  extensive  work  conducted  by  the  Senate  Special \nCommittee on National Emergencies) (hereinafter “NEA Source Book”).  \n  \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 25 of 75\n \nNat’l Emergencies Act: Hr’gs Before the Subcomm. On Admin. Law and Governmental Relations, \n94th Cong. 27 (March 6, 1975) (statement of Sen. Mathias); see id. at 31 (“[W]e didn’t attempt to define \nit specifically because we were afraid we would circumscribe the President’s constitutional powers.”); \nsee id. at 27 (statement of Sen. Church) (“[O]nce we got into that thicket [of defining a national \nemergency] it became evident that we would be creating more problems than we would be solving.”).  \nAnd during the final debate on the NEA, the House of Representatives specifically rejected an \namendment that would have limited the circumstances in which the President could declare a national \nemergency only to times of war or attacks upon the United States only.  See NEA Source Book at 278–\n80; see id. at 280 (statement of Rep. Moorhead) (“[T]his amendment would completely take away from \nthe President the flexibility of acting in times of crisis or an emergency” and “it is important that we \ngive our President some flexibility from time to time.”).  At the time of its passage, Congress therefore \nexpressly recognized that the NEA “makes no attempt to define when a declaration of national \nemergency is proper.”  Id. at 9 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-1168). \nThe NEA was “an effort by the Congress to establish clear procedures and safeguards for the \nexercise by the President of emergency powers conferred upon him by other statutes.”  See S. Rep. \nNo. 94-1168, at 3 (1976).  Accordingly, the NEA provides that “[w]hen the President declares a \nnational emergency, no powers or authorities made available by statute for use in the event of an \nemergency shall be exercised unless and until the President specifies the provisions of law under which \nhe proposes that he, or other officers will act.”  50 U.S.C. § 1631.  The NEA thus establishes \nprocedural guidelines for the President to follow before he may invoke other statutory authorities.   \nIn the more than 40 years since Congress enacted the NEA, Presidents have exercised broad \ndiscretion in determining what challenges amount to national emergencies, declaring nearly 60 national \nemergencies addressing a wide variety of national and international challenges.  For example, prior \nnational emergency declarations have authorized the invocation of statutory powers to restrict the \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 26 of 75\n \ntrade in uncut diamonds used to fund Sierra Leone’s civil war, Exec. Order No. 13194, 66 Fed. Reg. \n7389 (Jan. 18, 2001), to address the spread of swine flu in the United States, Proc. No. 8443, 74 Fed. \nReg. 55439 (Oct. 23, 2009), and to promote democracy or conflict resolution in various countries \naround the world, see, e.g., Exec. Order No. 13712, 80 Fed. Reg. 73633 (Nov. 22, 2015) (President \nObama declared a national emergency to address the “violence against civilians” and “political \nrepression” in Burundi). \nThe NEA also authorizes the President to renew declared emergencies annually without \nlimitation.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1622(d).  Thirty-one national emergencies remain in effect today, with many \nhaving been renewed by multiple Presidents over several decades.  For example, President Clinton \ndeclared a national emergency in 1996 after Cuban military aircraft intercepted and destroyed two \nunarmed U.S. registered civilian aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba.  See Proc. No. 6867, \n61 Fed. Reg. 8843 (Mar. 1, 1996) (authorizing the Secretary of Transportation to issue rules regulating \nthe anchorage and movement of vessels that may travel into the territorial waters of Cuba).  The \nemergency remains in effect today, having been renewed over the course of 23 years by Presidents \nBush, Obama, and Trump, even though President Obama concluded in 2016 that “the descriptions \nof the national emergency set forth in Proclamations 6867 and 7757 no longer reflect the international \nrelations of the United States related to Cuba.”  See Proc. No. 9398, 81 Fed. Reg. 9737 (Feb. 24, 2016).  \nIndeed, the first national emergency declared under the NEA—President Carter’s 1979 emergency \ndeclaration stemming from the Iran hostage crisis—has been in effect for 39 years and is now being \ncontinued because “relations with Iran have not yet normalized, and the process of implementing the \nagreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is ongoing.”  See Cont. of Nat’l Emergency With Respect \nto Iran, 2016 WL 6518765 (Nov. 3, 2016) (Ltr. from President Obama); see also 83 Fed. Reg. 56251 \n(Nov. 8, 2018) (renewal by President Trump). \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 27 of 75\n \nNothing in the NEA requires that a national emergency be a sudden or unforeseen event, as \nsome emergencies build through an accretion of events and exist over a considerable period of time.  \nIn 1990, for example, President George H. W. Bush declared a national emergency arising from the \n“proliferation of chemical and biological weapons” around the world.  Exec. Order No. 12735, 55 \nFed. Reg. 48587 (Nov. 16, 1990).  Four years later, President Clinton added nuclear weapons \nproliferation to that emergency declaration.  Exec. Order No. 12938, 59 Fed. Reg. 58099 (Nov. 14, \n1994).  President Clinton also declared a national emergency arising from narcotics trafficking centered \nin Colombia, Exec. Order No. 12978, 60 Fed. Reg. 54579 (Oct. 21, 1995), and President Obama \ndeclared  a  national  emergency  arising  from  the  activities  of  certain  transnational  criminal \norganizations, Exec. Order No. 13581, 76 Fed. Reg. 44757 (July 24, 2011).  These declarations, like \nthe President’s Proclamation, addressed long-standing policy challenges confronting the United States, \neven though they were neither new nor unforeseen at the time they were declared to be a national \nemergency.  Indeed, the President’s Proclamation acknowledged that the situation at the southern \nborder is a “long-standing” problem and builds on the efforts of President Obama’s previous \ndeclaration of a national emergency targeting the threats posed by four transnational criminal \norganizations, including a Mexican cartel known as Los Zetas.  See id.  \nRecognizing that, by their very nature, declarations of national emergency require the need for \nflexibility in policy choices that are the province of the political branches of the federal government, \nCongress gave itself the exclusive authority to exercise oversight of a President’s national emergency \ndeclaration.  As a remedy to potential overreach, Congress has authority to terminate a national \nemergency by enacting into law “a joint resolution.”  50 U.S.C. § 1622(a)(1).5  Emphasizing the political \n                                                 \n5 The original draft of the NEA would have automatically terminated a national emergency after six \nmonths.  See NEA Source Book, at 7.  Congress eliminated this provision during debate and replaced \nit with the requirement in the final version of the law that Congress pass a “concurrent resolution” to \nterminate a national emergency.  See id.; Beacon Prods. Corp. v. Reagan, 814 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1987) \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 28 of 75\n \njudgment that Congress must make, the NEA expressly requires Congress to meet “[n]ot later than \nsix months after a national emergency is declared, and not later than the end of each six-month period \nthereafter that such emergency continues, . . . to consider a vote on a joint resolution to determine \nwhether that emergency shall be terminated.”  Id. § 1622(b); see also id. § 1622(c) (establishing procedure \nfor both Houses of Congress to vote on a joint resolution terminating a national emergency).  \nAdditionally, Congress has imposed extensive reporting requirements on the Executive Branch when \nthe President declares a national emergency.  See id. § 1641(a)–(b) (requiring the President and each \nexecutive agency to maintain a file and index of, and transmit to Congress, certain orders, rules, and \nregulations); id. § 1641(c) (requiring the President to periodically transmit to Congress “a report on \nthe total expenditures incurred by the United States Government . . . which are directly attributable to \nthe exercise of powers and authorities conferred by such declaration”).  The NEA does not provide \nany role for the courts in reviewing a national emergency declaration, as it does not create a private \nright of action or contain a civil enforcement mechanism.  \n  10 U.S.C. § 284 \n10  U.S.C.  §  284  states  that  “[t]he  Secretary  of  Defense  may  provide  support  for  the \ncounterdrug activities . . . of any other department or agency of the Federal Government,” if requested \nby the relevant “official who has responsibility for [such] counterdrug activities.”  10 U.S.C. § 284(a), \n(a)(1)(A).  This support includes express authority for “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and \ninstallation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United \nStates.”  Id. § 284(b)(7).  This authority does not require a declaration of national emergency. \nCongress first provided DoD this authority in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n                                                 \n(Breyer, J.).  In 1985, Congress amended this provision and replaced the “concurrent resolution” \nrequirement with one that calls for termination of a national emergency by “joint resolution.”  Pub. \nL. No. 99-93, § 801, 99 Stat. 405, 448 (1985).  This amendment was the result of the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983), which invalidated a similar provision as \nunconstitutional.  See United States v. Amirnazmi, 645 F.3d 564, 581 n.26 (3d Cir. 2011). \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 29 of 75\n \nFiscal Year 1991.  Pub. L. No. 101-510, § 1004, 104 Stat. 1485 (1991).  As a specific fiscal year \nappropriation, § 1004 had to be periodically renewed to continue DoD’s authority to support counter-\ndrug activities.  See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 107-107, § 1004, 115 Stat. 1012 (2001).  Not only did Congress \nregularly renew § 1004, it frequently praised DoD’s involvement in building barrier fences along the \nsouthern border and allocated additional funds to DoD to encourage its support of counter-drug \nconstruction projects.  For example, in 1993, Congress “commend[ed]” DoD’s efforts to reinforce \nthe border fence along a 14-mile drug smuggling corridor in the San Diego-Tijuana border area, calling \nthe project “precisely the kind of federal-local cooperative effort the Congress had in mind in enacting \nsection 1004.”  H.R. Rep. No. 103-200, at 330-31, 1993 WL 298896 (1993).  Government officials and \nCongress alike have noted the particular importance of DoD’s involvement in southern border \nenhancement projects to prevent drug smuggling.  See Hr’g Before the S. Comm. On Armed Servs. \nSubcomm. On Emerging Threats and Capabilities, 1999 WL 258030 (Apr. 27, 1999) (Test. of Barry \nR.  McCaffrey,  Dir.  of  the  Office  of  Nat’l  Drug  Control  Policy)  (testifying  about  the  “vital \ncontributions” made by DoD to construct barrier fencing along the southern border); see, e.g., H.R. \nRep. No. 110-652, 420 (2008) (recommending a $5 million increase to DoD’s funding to continue \nconstruction of a southern border fence, which was described as an “invaluable counter-narcotics \nresource”); see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-452, 368-69 (2006) (allocating a total of $5 million of DoD \nfunding for constructing border fencing in California, Texas, and Arizona); H.R. Rep. No. 110-146, \n385-86 (2007) (recommending an $8 million increase in DoD funding to build border fencing in \nCalifornia and Arizona).  In light of the continuing “threat posed by the production and trafficking of \nheroin, fentanyl (and precursor chemicals), and other illicit drugs” across our nation’s borders, \nCongress codified § 1004 at 10 U.S.C. § 284 in December 2016, directing DoD “to ensure appropriate \nresources are allocated to efforts to combat this threat.”  H.R. Rep. No. 114-840, 1146 (2016).   \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 30 of 75\n \n  10 U.S.C. § 2808 \nFirst enacted as part of the 1982 Military Construction Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 97-99, \n§ 903, 95 Stat. 1359 (1981), and later amended by the Military Construction Codification Act of 1982, \nPub. L. No. 97-214, § 2, 96 Stat. 153 (codifying 10 U.S.C. §§ 2801–08), 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) provides: \nIn the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the President of a national \nemergency in accordance with the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) \nthat requires use of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any \nother  provision  of  law,  may  undertake  military  construction  projects,  and  may \nauthorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction \nprojects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the \narmed forces.  Such projects may be undertaken only within the total amount of funds \nthat have been appropriated for military construction, including funds appropriated \nfor family housing, that have not been obligated. \n \nCongress recognized that “it is impossible to provide in advance for all conceivable emergency \nsituations” and wanted to fill “a gap that now exists with respect to restructuring construction \npriorities in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency.”  H.R. Rep. No. 97-4472 (1981). \nThe term “military construction” as used in § 2808 “includes any construction, development, \nconversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military installation, whether to \nsatisfy temporary or permanent requirements, or any acquisition of land or construction of a defense \naccess road (as described in section 210 of title 23).”  10 U.S.C. § 2801(a).  Congress in turn defined \nthe term “military installation” to mean “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity \nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department or, in the case of an activity in a foreign \ncountry, under the operational control of the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of \nDefense, without regard to the duration of operational control.”  Id. § 2801(c)(4). \nPresidents have invoked the military construction authority under Section 2808 on two prior \noccasions.  First, in August 1990, President George H.W. Bush authorized the use of § 2808 in 1990 \nfollowing the Government of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.  See Exec. Order No. 12722, 55 Fed. Reg. \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 31 of 75\n \n31803 (Aug. 2, 1990); Exec. Order No. 12734, 55 Fed. Reg. 48099 (Nov. 14, 1990).6  Second, President \nGeorge W. Bush invoked Section 2808 in response to the terrorist attacks against the United States \non September 11, 2001.  See Proc. No. 7463, 66 Fed. Reg. 48199 (Sept. 14, 2001); Exec. Order No. \n13235, 66 Fed. Reg. 58343 (Nov. 16, 2001).  The national emergency declaration stemming from the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, remains in effect today, see 83 Fed. Reg. 46067 (Sept. 10, 2018), \nand DoD has used its § 2808 authority to build a wide variety of military construction projects, both \ndomestically and abroad, over the past 17 years, see Cong. Research Serv., Military Construction \nFunding in the Event of a National Emergency at 1–3 & tbl. 1 (updated Jan. 11, 2019) (listing projects \nworth $1.4 billion performed domestically and abroad using § 2808 between 2001 and 2014). \n  31 U.S.C. § 9705 \nThe Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund collects proceeds from “seizures and forfeitures \nmade pursuant to any law (other than section 7301 or 7302 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) \nenforced or administered by the Department of the Treasury or the United States Coast Guard.”  31 \nU.S.C. § 9705(a).  Congress established the fund in 1992, and the authorizing legislation sets forth the \npurposes for which the fund’s revenue may be used.  See S. Rep. No. 102-398 (1992).  As relevant \nhere, § 9705(g)(4)(B) states that any surplus unobligated funds (after reserving certain statutorily \nrequired amounts) “shall be available to the Secretary, without fiscal year limitation, . . . for obligation \nor expenditure in connection with the law enforcement activities of any Federal agency or of a \nDepartment of the Treasury law enforcement organization.”   \nPLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS \nPlaintiffs allege that the Proclamation violates the NEA, and, alternatively, that the NEA, “as \nconstrued by the Proclamation,” runs afoul of the “nondelegation doctrine.”  Id. ¶¶ 120–33 (Counts \n                                                 \n6 President George W.

Plaintiffs assert that the Government’s use of § 2808 and § 284 violates the Appropriations \nClause of the Constitution, and that the use of these authorities, as well as § 9705, also violates the \nAPA.  Id. ¶¶ 134–64 (Counts III-V).  Plaintiffs also challenge DoD’s use of its transfer authority to \nmake additional funding available for border barrier construction under § 8005 of the 2019 DoD \nAppropriations Act.  Id.  ¶¶ 165–70 (Count VI).  Finally, Plaintiffs assert that the President’s invocation \nof the NEA violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution.  Id. ¶¶ 171–75 (Count VII). \nSTANDARDS OF REVIEW \n  Rule 12 Standard \nA court must dismiss a case under Civil Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if \nit lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.  Home Builders Ass’n of Miss., Inc. v. \nCity of Madison, 143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).  The party asserting subject-\nmatter jurisdiction has the burden of proving it exists by a preponderance of the evidence.  See New \nOrleans & Gulf Coast Ry. Co. v. Barrois, 533 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir. 2008).  To survive a motion to \ndismiss under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).  A complaint that “tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement” \nis insufficient.  Id. (internal citation and alteration omitted). \n  Rule 56 Standard \nThe parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure mandates entry of summary judgment “if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986); Curtis v. Anthony, 710 F.3d 587, 594 \n(5th Cir. 2013).  The Government agrees with Plaintiffs that this case presents questions of law for \nthe Court to resolve that do not require further factual development through discovery, Pls.’ Mot. for \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 33 of 75\n \nSumm. J. or, in the Alternative, a Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ MSJ”) at 1, ECF No. 54; in these circumstances, \nthe Court should enter either summary judgment for the Government based on the parties’ moving \npapers, or dismiss the First Amended Complaint under Civil Rule 12.  \nARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs’ Challenge to the President’s Declaration of a National Emergency \nShould Be Dismissed (Counts I-II, VII).7 \n  The NEA Evidences Congress’s Intent to Preclude Judicial Review of \nNational Emergency Declarations. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed that in determining whether a statute “precludes judicial \nreview,” a court must examine the “express language” as well as “the structure of the statutory scheme, \nits objectives, its legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action involved.”  Block v. \nCmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984).  That Congress intended to preclude judicial review \nneed only be “fairly discernible.”  Id. at 350-51. \nHere, Congress’s intent to preclude judicial review is evidenced by the text of the NEA, which \ndoes not define the term national emergency or provide courts with any standards by which to evaluate \nthe President’s exercise of this authority.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1621.  The lack of a definition in the statute \nreflects Congress’s intentional decision to leave to the President the determination about when and \nunder what circumstances to declare a national emergency.  The absence of any judicially enforceable \nremedy is further supported by the fact that the NEA establishes only procedural and reporting \nguidelines that the President must follow when he invokes other statutory authorities conditioned on \na declaration of a national emergency declaration.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1631, 1641.   In the event the \nPresident declares a national emergency, he must notify Congress of the statutory authorities he \nintends to rely upon and provide information to Congress about how those authorities are being \n                                                 \n7 In a footnote, Plaintiffs raise a “Take Care Clause” claim against the President stemming from \nviolations of the NEA.  Pls.’ MSJ at 26 n.10.  Judgment for the Government on this count is \nappropriate for the same reasons Plaintiffs’ direct challenge to the NEA fails. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 34 of 75\n \nutilized by the Executive Branch.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1631, 1641.  Accordingly, the NEA does not give \nlitigants any role in the statutory process, let alone a role that Plaintiffs could enforce in court.  See \nAmirnazmi, 645 F.3d at 581 (stating that the “NEA places the onus on Congress to ensure emergency \nsituations remain anomalous and do not quietly evolve into default norms”).  \nThe lack of a judicial enforcement mechanism to challenge a national emergency declaration \nis reinforced by the NEA’s exclusive remedial scheme for Congress to challenge through political \nmeans the President’s determination that a particular national emergency exists.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1622;  \nsee also Middlesex Cty. Sewerage Auth. v. Nat’l Sea Clammers Ass’n, 453 U.S. 1, 15, (1981) (“In the absence \nof strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, we are compelled to conclude that Congress \nprovided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.”).   As explained above, Congress has the \nauthority to terminate a national emergency by enacting into law “a joint resolution.”  50 U.S.C. § \n1622(a)(1).  Further, the NEA expressly requires Congress to vote on whether to terminate the \ndeclared emergency within six months of the President’s declaration and establishes expedited \nprocedures for Congress to vote on such a measure once a termination resolution is introduced.  Id. § \n1622(b), (c).  Here, majorities of both houses of Congress attempted to terminate the President’s \nnational emergency declaration by passing a joint resolution, but the President vetoed that measure, \nand there was insufficient support to override the President’s veto to enact the joint resolution into \nlaw.  See supra at n.3.  Congress’s inability to terminate the Proclamation through the NEA’s statutory \nprocedures only underscores that the Court should not step in to adjudicate this dispute.  Cf. Ariz. \nState Legislature v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n, 135 S. Ct. 2652, 2664 (2015) (“Having failed to prevail \nin their own Houses, the suitors could not repair to the Judiciary to complain.”). \nMoreover, when Congress had the opportunity to change the oversight structure of the NEA \nin  response  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  Chadha  decision  that  declared  the  “legislative  veto” \nunconstitutional, Congress notably changed the termination threshold from a “concurrent resolution,” \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 35 of 75\n \nwhich does not involve Presidential approval, to a “joint resolution,” which requires either Presidential \napproval or adequate congressional support to override a Presidential veto in order to be enacted.8  \nSee supra pp. 14–15 & n.5.  Congress could have instituted a different mechanism, such as creating a \njudicial-enforcement regime, but did not do so.  See Beacon Prods. Corp., 814 F.2d at 4 (Breyer, J.) (“This \nlegislative history makes clear that Congress intended to impose upon itself the burden of acting \naffirmatively to end an emergency.”).  Instead, Congress gave itself the power to oversee the \nPresident’s use of statutory emergency authority, and there is no basis for the Court to create a new \njudicial remedy on top Congress’ carefully-crafted framework.   Where, as here, the statute expressly \nprovides Congress with authority to terminate a national emergency, it is “an ‘elemental canon’ of \nstatutory construction that . . . courts must be especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.”  \nKarahalios v. Nat’l Fed’n of Fed. Emps., Local 1263, 489 U.S. 527, 533 (1989) (citations omitted). \nFurther, the NEA was the product of a multi-year study by Congress to address the field of \nnational emergency authorities, and nothing in that extensive legislative history suggests that Congress \nintended to allow judicial challenges to the President’s national emergency declarations.  To the \ncontrary, the legislative history shows that Congress, not  the courts, would be the branch of \ngovernment to oversee the President’s use of his emergency powers.  See NEA Source Book at 338 \n(“every type and class of presidentially declared emergency will be subjected to congressional control” \nand “the legislative branch will be in a position to assert its ultimate authority”); see also Block, 467 U.S. \nat 349 (preclusion of judicial review may be implied from “specific legislative history” alone).  \nMoreover, given the President’s “unique position in the constitutional scheme,” Nixon v. Fitzgerald, \n457 U.S. 731, 749–50 (1982), any remedial scheme where litigants could sue the President to challenge \n                                                 \n8 The NEA’s “provision for termination by concurrent resolution is unconstitutional because, unlike \na joint resolution, termination by concurrent resolution would enable Congress to take legislative \naction without presenting the action to the President for his signature.” Beacon Prods. Corp. v. Regan, \n633 F. Supp. 1191, 1196 (D. Mass. 1986), aff’d, 814 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1987); see supra note 3. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 36 of 75\n \na national emergency declaration would raise separation of powers concerns and create tension with \nthe Supreme Court’s admonition that federal courts have “no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the \nPresident in the performance of his official duties.”  Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 \n(1866).  There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress gave consideration to those \nweighty issues or concluded that such lawsuits against the President should proceed.  See NEA Source \nBook at 342 (stating that “there is [no] intent here to limit either the President’s power or flexibility to \ndeclare a national emergency” and there is no intent to limit “the subject matter of the emergency or \nthe timing of its declaration”) (statements of Reps. Moorhead and Flowers).  In the absence of clear \ndirection from Congress, the Court should not imply a remedy that would conflict with longstanding \nseparation-of-powers principles. \nIn light of the NEA’s text, structure, and legislative history, Congress has precluded judicial \nreview of the President’s national emergency Proclamation.  \n  Plaintiffs’ Challenge to the President’s National Emergency Declaration \nPresents a Nonjusticiable Political Question. \nCourts that have considered the issue have uniformly concluded that a Presidential declaration \nof a national emergency is a nonjusticiable political question.  See Soudavar v. Bush, 46 F. App’x 731 \n(5th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (affirming district court decision dismissing a challenge to executive orders \nimposing national emergency sanctions on Iran as involving a “nonjusticiable political question”); \nChichakli v.

Both the separation-of-powers doctrine and the policy of judicial self-\nrestraint require that federal courts refrain from intrusion into areas committed by the Constitution to \nthe Legislative and Executive Branches of the Government.  See Baker v.

United States, 859 F.2d 893, 896 n.3 (Fed. Cir. \n1988) (“Furthermore, to the extent that the plaintiffs’ inquiry into the ‘true facts’ of the Libyan crisis \nwould seek to examine the President’s motives and justifications for declaring a national emergency, \nsuch an inquiry would likely present a nonjusticiable political question.”).   \n \n10 Past practice also belies Plaintiffs’ suggestion that this national emergency declaration is both \njusticiable and invalid because the President stated that he “didn’t need” to issue the declaration and \n“could do the wall over a longer period of time.”  See Pls.’ MSJ at 6, 23.  A national emergency \ndeclaration necessarily reflects an exercise of discretion, and Presidents have often chosen to declare \nnational emergencies to address circumstances that were neither new nor unforeseen at the time the \ndeclaration issued.  See supra Statutory Background, Pt. I.  No court has ever conducted the type of \njudicial second guessing that Plaintiffs propose here by evaluating whether an emergency could have \nbeen addressed without relying on emergency statutory authorities. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 38 of 75\n \nclaim raises nonjusticiable political questions: \nProminent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found \na textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate \npolitical  department;  or  a  lack  of  judicially  discoverable  and  manageable \nstandards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial \npolicy  determination  of  a  kind  clearly  for  nonjudicial  discretion;  or  the \nimpossibility of a court’s undertaking independent resolution without expressing \nlack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need \nfor  unquestioning  adherence  to  a  political  decision  already  made;  or  the \npotentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various \ndepartments on one question.  \n \nId. at 217.  The existence of any one of these factors indicates the existence of a political question.  Id.  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ assertion that the situation along the southern border does not constitute a national \nemergency runs afoul of most, if not all, of these factors. \nFirst, there are no judicially manageable standards to ascertain whether or when to declare a \n“national emergency.”  As explained above, Congress intentionally chose not to define the term \n“national emergency” and left that determination to the President, subject only to oversight from \nCongress.  See supra, Statutory Background, pt. I.  The NEA sets forth no criteria from which the \nCourt could judge the President’s action or make a determination about whether a particular issue \nconstitutes a national emergency.  See Spawr Optical Research, 685 F.2d at 1080 (“The statute contained \nno standards by which to determine whether a national emergency existed or continued.”).  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to take the remarkable step of supplanting the President’s determination with \nthe “courts’ own unmoored determination of what United States policy toward [the southern border] \nshould be.”  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 196 (2012).  The Court could not decide \nthis question “without first fashioning out of whole cloth some standard for when” a national \nemergency “is justified.”  El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v. United States, 607 F.3d 836, 845 (D.C. Cir. \n2010).  To grant Plaintiffs’ requested relief, the Court would have to conduct a standardless inquiry \ninto how the current humanitarian and security crisis at the border impacts immigration policy, foreign \nrelations, public safety, and national security.  “The judiciary lacks the capacity for such a task.”  Id. \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 39 of 75\n \nSecond, any such determinations would require precisely the sort of “policy determination of \na kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion” that the Supreme Court has indicated is a hallmark of a \npolitical question.  Baker, 369 U.S. at 217.  As the Supreme Court has long recognized, illegal \nimmigration creates “significant economic and social problems” in the United States. United States v. \nBrignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975); see also Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 237 (1982) (Powell, J., \nconcurring) (recognizing illegal immigration to be “a problem of serious national proportions”).  More \nrecently, in Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), the Court emphasized that the problems posed \nby illegal immigration “must not be underestimated” and credited evidence in the record of various \nproblems “associated with the influx of illegal migration across private land near the Mexican border,” \nincluding “an epidemic of crime” and “safety risks.”  Id. at 397-98 (citation omitted).   \nThe President has chosen to confront these and other challenges traceable to the current crisis \nat the border by declaring a national emergency and invoking the express powers delegated to him by \nCongress.  See Proclamation.  Under these circumstances, the Court cannot review the matter without \nsecond-guessing the President’s policy determinations.  Decisions “about how best to enforce the \nnation’s immigration laws in order to minimize the number of illegal aliens crossing our borders \npatently involve policy judgments about resource allocation and enforcement methods.”  New Jersey v. \nUnited States, 91 F.3d 463, 370 (3d Cir. 1996).  These “issues fall squarely within a substantive area \nclearly committed by the Constitution to the political branches; they are by their nature peculiarly \nappropriate to resolution by the political branches of government both because there are no judicially \ndiscoverable and manageable standards for resolving them.”  Id. (citation omitted); see Sadowski v. Bush, \n293 F. Supp. 2d 15, 19 (D.D.C. 2003) (“[D]eciding how to best enforce existing immigration laws and \npolicies and how to keep out illegal immigrants requires making policy judgments that are suited for \nnonjudicial discretion and thus should not be made by the judiciary.”).  Accordingly, the President’s \nProclamation is not reviewable. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 40 of 75\n \nThird, the type of policy decisions that Plaintiffs ask this Court to make are entrusted to the \npolitical branches, not the courts.  “[T]he power to exclude aliens is inherent in sovereignty, necessary \nfor  maintaining  normal  international  relations  and  defending  the  country  against  foreign \nencroachments and dangers—a power to be exercised exclusively by the political branches of the \ngovernment.”  Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 765 (1972).  As the Supreme Court has explained: \nFor reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for regulating the \nrelationship  between  the  United  States  and  our  alien  visitors  has  been \ncommitted to the political branches of the Federal Government.  Since decisions \nin these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers, and since a \nwide variety of classifications must be defined in the light of changing political \nand economic circumstances, such decisions are frequently of a character more \nappropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary. \nMathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 81 (1976) (footnote omitted); see also Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) \n(“Our cases have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign \nattribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from judicial control.”).  \nThe President’s decision to declare a national emergency is a quintessential policy decision in an area \nreserved to the political branches involving matters of immigration, foreign relations, use of military \nforces, and national security.  See, e.g., Hernandez v. Mesa, 885 F.3d 811, 819 (5th Cir. 2018) (en banc) \n(recognizing that “border security” presents important “[n]ational-security concerns”), petition for cert. \ngranted, No. 17-1678 (June 20, 2018); Texas v. United States, 106 F.3d 661, 664-65, 667 (5th Cir. 1997) \n(holding that the federal government’s alleged failure to control illegal immigration is a nonjusticiable \npolitical question).11  There is no basis for the Court to substitute its judgment for that of the President \non sensitive policy issues that are nonjusticiable political questions. \n                                                 \n11 See also United States v. Delgado–Garcia, 374 F.3d 1337, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[T]his country’s border-\ncontrol policies are of crucial importance to the national security and foreign policy of the United \nStates.”); Sierra Club v. Ashcroft, 2005 WL 8153059, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2005) (holding that the \nconstruction of border barriers “relates to matters over which the Executive Branch has independent \nand significant constitutional authority: immigration and border control enforcement and national \nsecurity”). \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 41 of 75\n \n  The President Should Be Dismissed as a Party to this Lawsuit Because There \nIs No Cause of Action Against the President and Plaintiffs Cannot Obtain \nEquitable Relief Against the President. \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the President (including the issuance of the Proclamation and their \nTake Care Clause claim) confront yet another obstacle:  there is no cause of action against the \nPresident, and Plaintiffs may not obtain—and the Court may not order—equitable relief directly \nagainst the President for his official conduct.   \nPlaintiffs lack a cause of action to sue the President.  The actions of the President are not \nreviewable under the APA, see Dalton, 511 U.S. at 479, and likewise there is no implied equitable cause \nof action to do so.  Although courts of equity may in some circumstances permit suits to “enjoin \nunconstitutional actions by . . . federal officers,” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, \n1384 (2015), the availability of such relief depends on whether it “was traditionally accorded by courts \nof equity,” Grupo Mexicano De Desarrollo v. All. Bond Fund, 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999).  Here, there is no \ntradition of equitable relief against the President.  To the contrary, the Supreme Court recognized over \n150 years ago in Mississippi v. Johnson that federal courts lack jurisdiction to “enjoin the President in the \nperformance of his official duties,” 71 U.S. at 501, a principle the Court reaffirmed more recently in \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992); id. at 827 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in \nthe judgment) (“apparently unbroken historical tradition supports the view” that courts may not order \nthe President to “perform particular executive . . . acts”).   \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has twice held that causes of action that are available against \nother government officials should not be extended to the President absent a clear statement by \nCongress.  See Nixon, 475 U.S. at 748 n.27 (declining to assume that Bivens and other implied statutory \ndamages “cause[s] of action run[] against the President of the United States”); Franklin, 505 U.S. at \n801 (declining to find cause of action against the President under the APA “[o]ut of respect for the \nseparation of powers and the unique constitutional position of the President”).  Accordingly, in the \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 42 of 75\n \nabsence of an express statutory cause of action against the President or a tradition of recognizing such \nsuits as a matter of equity, there is no basis for the Court to infer equitable relief against the President.  \n“The reasons why courts should be hesitant to grant such relief are painfully obvious” given the \nPresident’s unique constitutional role and the potential tension with the separation of powers.   Swan \nv. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Further, the Supreme Court has taken a “traditionally \ncautious approach to equitable powers, which leaves any substantial expansion of past practice to \nCongress.”  Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 329.  Any expansion of an equitable remedy against the \nPresident here would create its own set of separation-of-powers problems by usurping “the role of \nCongress in determining the nature and extent of federal-court jurisdiction under Article III.”  See \nZiglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1858 (2017). \nLower courts have followed the logic of Franklin and Massachusetts by dismissing the President \nas a defendant in civil cases and declining to impose either declaratory or injunctive relief against him \nin his official capacity.  See Int’l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, 857 F.3d 554, 605 (4th Cir. 2017) (“In \nlight of the Supreme Court’s clear warning that such relief should be ordered only in the rarest of \ncircumstances we find that the district court erred in issuing an injunction against the President \nhimself.”), vacated and remanded, 138 S. Ct. 353 (2017); Hawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 788 (9th Cir. \n2017) (“the extraordinary remedy of enjoining the President is not appropriate here”), vacated as moot, \n138 S. Ct. 377 (2017); Newdow v. Roberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“With regard to the \nPresident, courts do not have jurisdiction to enjoin him, and have never submitted the President to \ndeclaratory relief . . . .”); Doe 2 v. Trump, 319 F. Supp. 3d 539, 541 (D.D.C. 2018) (dismissing “the \nPresident himself as a party to this case”).   \n These restrictions foreclose Plaintiffs’ attempt to seek relief against the President in issuing \nthe Proclamation. As regards the Government’s use of § 284, § 2808, and § 9705 to facilitate border \nbarrier construction, Plaintiffs could potentially obtain relief against the agency Defendants because \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 43 of 75\n \nthe agencies, not the President, will construct or fund border barriers pursuant to these authorities.  \nAccordingly, in addition to the reasons explained above, the President should be dismissed in order \nto avoid an unnecessary separation-of-powers conflict. 12  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 978 (“In most cases, \nany conflict between the desire to avoid confronting the elected head of a coequal branch of \ngovernment and to ensure the rule of law can be successfully bypassed, because the injury at issue can \nbe rectified by injunctive relief against subordinate officials.”).13  \n  Plaintiffs’ Nondelegation Challenge to the NEA Is Meritless (Count II). \nPlaintiffs also challenge the President’s declaration of a national emergency as inconsistent \nwith the nondelegation doctrine implicit in the Constitution’s conferral of the legislative power on \nCongress.  They approach this issue in two ways.  First, they argue that the NEA’s definition of an \n“emergency” should be cabined to “unforeseen circumstances requiring immediate action,” in order \nto avoid an interpretation of the NEA that would run afoul of the nondelegation doctrine.  Pls.’ MSJ \nat 24–26.  Second, they argue that the NEA is unconstitutional because it does not provide an \n“intelligible principle” for channeling Executive conduct.  Id. at 26–30.  Neither argument succeeds. \nCongress may delegate its law-making authority to another branch of government so long as \nit provides “an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to \n                                                 \n12 It is appropriate to dismiss the President even before resolving Article III standing, for two \nreasons.  First, the Supreme Court has repeatedly described the bar against suing the President for his \nofficial duties as jurisdictional in nature.  See Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802-03 (quoting Mississippi, 4 Wall at \n501.).  Second, even if not technically jurisdictional, it is the sort of categorical threshold defense that \nshould be resolved prior to an exercise of jurisdiction.  Cf. Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 6 n.4 (2005).  At a \nminimum, the relief against the President should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. \n \n13 Although district courts in some recent cases have declined to dismiss the President at the motion-\nto-dismiss stage on grounds that doing so would be premature in light of uncertainty about the relief \nthat could be provided by the defendant agencies, that is not the situation here.  See Centro Presente v. \nDHS, 332 F. Supp. 3d 393, 418 (D. Mass. 2018); CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, 355 F. Supp. 3d 307 \n(D. Md. 2018); Saget v. Trump, 345 F. Supp. 3d 287, 297 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).  Here, however, there is no \nquestion that relief against the agencies in this case would be sufficient to redress Plaintiffs’ claims \nseeking to halt border barrier construction.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 978.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 44 of 75\n \nconform.” J.W. Hampton, Jr. Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  To provide a constitutionally \npermissible “intelligible principle,” Congress need only “clearly delineate[] the general policy, the \npublic agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.”  Mistretta v. United \nStates, 488 U.S. 361, 372–73 (1989).  And Congress may delegate in even broader terms in the realm \nof immigration, foreign affairs, and national security.  See In re Nat’l Security Agency Telecomm. Records, \n671 F.3d 881, 897 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that when the delegation “arises within the realm of national \nsecurity . . . the intelligible principle standard need not be overly rigid”); see also Loving v. United States, \n517 U.S. 748, 772 (1996) (finding that delegations may be broader “where the entity exercising the \ndelegated  authority  itself  possesses  independent  authority  over  the  subject  matter”);  Knauff  v. \nShaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 542-43 (1950) (“The exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty \n. . . [and] is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation.”).  “The \nSupreme Court has only twice invalidated legislation under this doctrine, the last time being” over \neighty years ago.  In re Nat’l Security Agency Telecomm. Records, 671 F.3d at 896. \nPlaintiffs first argue that the Court should adopt a narrowing construction of the term \n“emergency” in the NEA to avoid a potential conflict between the NEA and the nondelegation \ndoctrine, under the theory of constitutional avoidance.  This canon of constitutional avoidance can be \nused to resolve a statutory interpretation issue when a “section admits of two interpretations, one of \nwhich brings it within, and the other presses it beyond the constitutional authority of congress.”  United \nStates v. Coombs, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 72, 76 (1838) (Story, J.).  In Industrial Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. Am. \nPetroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607 (1980), the principal case on which Plaintiffs rely, it was the absence “of a \nclear mandate in the Act” for the “extreme position” the government advocated that led the Court to \nadopt a narrowing construction of an agency’s regulatory authority and thereby avoid declaring as \nunconstitutional the regulatory scheme Congress created.  Id. at 641, 645–46.   \nBut even if one accepts Plaintiffs’ inapt characterization of the NEA as an “extreme” \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 45 of 75\n \ndelegation of authority to the President, it is quite clear that Congress intended it.  Congress did not \nspecify what would constitute a “national emergency” under the NEA and the legislative history shows \nthat Congress deliberately chose to leave to the President the determination of what circumstances \nconstituted an emergency, believing such determinations to be effectively unreviewable.  See generally \nsupra, Statutory Background, at pt. I.  Past practice reveals many cases in which a national emergency \ndid not involve unforeseen circumstances or require immediate action on the part of the federal \ngovernment, as Plaintiffs insist it must.  Id.  And in those instances Congress never even convened a \nvote under the NEA to overturn the President’s declaration.  See Beacon Prod. Corp., 814 F.2d at 4.  \nHere, the Court would not be choosing one plausible reading of the statute over another in order to \naccept Plaintiffs’ argument, as it would in a typical constitutional-avoidance case.  It would instead be \nsubstantially rewriting the NEA to adopt Plaintiffs’ policy view of what circumstances should \nconstitute a “national emergency.”  But where (as here) there is no ambiguity, “the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance has no role to play.”  Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 50 (2014). \nSetting aside Plaintiffs’ meritless “avoidance” theory, there is no basis for striking down the \nNEA on nondelegation grounds.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has not struck down a federal statute \non that basis since 1935, Whitman v. Am. Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457, 474 (2001), and this case \ndoes not present a viable platform for departing from that historical streak.  Plaintiffs focus on \nCongress’s choice not to limit the circumstances under which the President may declare a national \nemergency, but that focus is misplaced.  The declaration of a national emergency does not, on its own, \ngive the President any new powers.  Rather, the NEA is a procedural statute that requires the President \nto “specif[y] the provisions of law under which he proposes that he, or other officers will act.”  50 \nU.S.C. § 1631.  The statute does not “enlarge or add to Executive power.”  See Report of the \nCommittee on Government Operations: National Emergencies Act, S. Rep. No. 1168, 94th Cong., 2d \nSess. 3 (1976).  Instead, the NEA was “an effort by the Congress to establish clear procedures and \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 46 of 75\n \nsafeguards for the exercise by the President of emergency powers conferred upon him by other \nstatutes.”  See id. (emphasis added).  The only power at issue here is military construction authority \nunder § 2808.  And § 2808 plainly contains “intelligible standards” that cabin DoD’s authority: \nconstruction under § 2808 must meet the definition of “military construction” set forth in § 2801 and \nmust be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  The congressional notification and \nreporting requirements of the NEA also impose meaningful constraints for nondelegation purposes, \nas the Fifth Circuit has recognized.  United States v. Mirza, 454 Fed. App’x 249, 256 (5th Cir. 2011) \n(agreeing with three other circuits that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which \nauthorizes the President to take certain actions upon a declaration of a national emergency, does not \nviolate the nondelegation doctrine).  Congress’s provision of sufficient guidance to DoD in § 2808 is \nthus sufficient to dispose of Plaintiffs’ non-delegation claim.   \n  Plaintiffs Cannot Establish Article III Standing Over Any of Their Claims. \nTo establish Article III standing, “a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an ‘injury in fact’ \nthat is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) \nthe injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed \nto merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000).  The standing inquiry is particularly \nrigorous where, as here, a court is asked to find the actions of the other branches of government \nunconstitutional.  See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).   \n  Plaintiffs Have No Standing to Challenge Future Border Barrier Construction \nUnder § 2808. \nPlaintiffs lack standing to challenge possible § 2808 construction because the Acting Secretary \nof Defense has not yet decided to undertake or to authorize any barrier construction projects under \n§ 2808.  Rapuano 4/25/19 Decl. ¶¶ 13–14; see also Declaration of Kenneth Rapuano ¶¶ 5–7 (May 15, \n2019) (“Rapuano 5/15 Decl.”) (Ex. 7) (providing latest status of § 2808 deliberations).  \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 47 of 75\n \nThe President’s invocation of § 2808 in the Proclamation is not itself sufficient to establish \ncertainly  impending  injury  where  the  subsequent  decision  to  undertake  or  authorize  barrier \nconstruction projects under § 2808 lies with the Acting Secretary of Defense.   Before authorizing \n§ 2808 construction, the Acting Secretary of Defense will determine whether a project is “necessary \nto support such use of the armed forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808.  That determination can be considered \nonly within the context of the Acting Secretary of Defense authorizing specific military construction \nprojects presented to him for approval, a process that is ongoing.  See Rapuano 5/15/19 Decl. ¶¶ 5–\n7.    Moreover  DoD  will  need  to  defer  military  construction  projects  to  which  Congress  has \nappropriated funds that have yet to be obligated in order to fund § 2808 construction.  See id.  \nSpeculation about injuries that might result from yet-to-be-identified barrier construction projects that \nmight be funded under § 2808 is the type of “possible future injury” that is not sufficient to establish \nArticle III jurisdiction.  See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409.  The Court should not rule on Plaintiffs’ § 2808 \nclaim in the abstract when these specific decisions have not been made, let alone made in a manner \nthat would injure Plaintiffs.  Given the absence of any concrete harm, Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue \ntheir § 2808 claims. \n  Plaintiffs Have No Standing to Challenge an Alleged Violation of § 8005 of \nthe DoD Appropriations Act. \n Plaintiffs also cannot establish standing to challenge DoD’s use of § 8005 of the 2019 DoD \nAppropriations Act to effectuate an internal transfer of funds between DoD appropriations.  They \nneither claim an entitlement to the money transferred, nor assert that they are the “object” of that \ntransfer, which simply moved funds among DoD’s accounts.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  Accordingly, \ntheir standing to challenge the transfer of funding from one DoD appropriation to another is no \ngreater than that of any taxpayer to challenge any expenditure of taxpayer money from a particular \nbudget account. As the Supreme Court has explained, “federal courts would cease to function as \ncourts of law and would be cast in the role of general complaint bureaus” if “every federal taxpayer \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 48 of 75\n \ncould sue to challenge any Government expenditure.”  Hein v. Freedom From Religion Found., Inc., 551 \nU.S. 587, 593 (2007).  The intervening step of invoking § 284 is necessary to connect DoD’s use of \n§ 8005 to the border barrier construction that is the source of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries, and Plaintiffs \ncannot invoke their alleged harm from the separate act of constructing barriers utilizing authority \nprovided by § 284 to establish standing for a claimed violation of § 8005. Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, \n497 U.S. 871, 891–94 (1990) (holding that APA review is limited to review of discrete agency action \nand multiple actions cannot be aggregated together). \n  El Paso County Has No Standing to Challenge the Proclamation or § 284 \nConstruction. \nTo date, the Government has not authorized any border barrier construction to go forward in \nEl Paso County.  Only one project—to replace existing vehicle barriers with new pedestrian fencing \nin Luna County, New Mexico and Doña Ana County, New Mexico—is even within close proximity.  \nSee Rapuano 4/25 Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, Ex. A at 8-9 (El Paso Sector Project 1).  To overcome this obvious \nproblem with its standing, the County alleges “two interconnected, concrete injuries stemming from \nDefendants’ actions”: injury to its reputation due to the Proclamation, and impact to its pecuniary \ninterests.  Pls.’ MSJ at 11.  Neither provides a basis for standing. \n1.  Reputational Harm \nThe County avers that the Proclamation “create[s] the negative perception” that the southern \nborder is an area of unrest, high crime, and low quality of life.  First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 104, 107, ECF \nNo. 52.  To counter this view, the County alleges its employees are “daily required to defend the \nCounty’s reputation and to disabuse misconceptions that . . . are a deterrent to people visiting or \ninvesting in El Paso County.”  Id. ¶ 105, 107.  In its view, the “Proclamation frustrat[es] … the \nCounty’s national campaign to promote El Paso’s history and culture and its ongoing efforts to attract \nvisitors to the County who will spend money and engage in commerce.”  Id. ¶ 107.   \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  these  allegations  have  nothing  to  do  with  actual  border-barrier \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 49 of 75\n \nconstruction and thus could not provide standing to challenge construction under § 284, § 2808, or \n§ 9705.  Plaintiffs repeatedly allege that “[t]he President’s Proclamation and the activity it directs by \nits very issuance create the negative perception the County has sought to counter.”  Id. ¶ 94; see also id. \n¶¶ 93, 96-97.  But both § 284 and § 9705 are available regardless of the Proclamation, while a decision \non § 2808 projects has yet to be made.  Accordingly, the County’s theory goes solely to the \nProclamation itself, which is unreviewable for a number of reasons entirely separate from the County’s \n(lack of) standing.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 411.   \nBut even aside from all that, the County’s standing theory is not viable.  “Standing is not \navailable  to  just  any  resident  of  a  jurisdiction  to  challenge  a  government  message  without  a \ncorresponding action about a particular belief.”  Barber v. Bryant, 860 F.3d 345, 355 (5th Cir. 2017) \n(rejecting “purported stigmatic injury”); see also Ingebretsen v. Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist., 88 F.3d 274, 284 \n(5th Cir. 1996) (“[N]o parent ought to be allowed to sue over a school policy with which he disagrees \nunless the policy has demonstrably injured him or his child.”); Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. U.S. \nNavy (In re Navy Chaplaincy), 534 F.3d 756, 764-65 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Kavanaugh, J.) (allowing standing \nbased on offense to a government message would “eviscerate well-settled standing limitations”).  So \ntoo here, while the Proclamation authorizes actions under other statutes that may later give rise to an \ninjury-in-fact, it is not self-effectuating.  That distinguishes this case from all those cited by the County \nin their brief, which rely on a statute authorizing sports gambling in contravention of federal law, a \nstatute requiring the plaintiff to label himself a distributor of “foreign propaganda,” an order of judicial \nsanctions against an individual attorney, and a congressional bill of attainder against an individual \ncitizen.14  None of these are remotely similar to the Proclamation.  \n                                                 \n14 Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 472–77 (1987) (politician’s likely injury to his reputation as a result of \ncomplying with statutory disclosure requirements for distribution of “propaganda” grounded standing \nbecause “the Department of Justice has placed the legitimate force of its criminal enforcement powers \nbehind the label”); NCAA v. New Jersey, 730 F.3d 208, 220–24 (3d Cir. 2013) (plaintiff sports leagues \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 50 of 75\n \nPlaintiffs’ theory also fails because, unlike the very specific targets of the government actions \nat issue in the cases it cites, the Proclamation does not specifically disparage the reputation of the \nCounty.  The Proclamation does not refer to the County, and it does not follow from the Proclamation \nthat the County necessarily has “crisis levels of crime and low quality of life.”  First Am. Compl. ¶ 104.  \nIndeed, the First Amended Complaint admits the President called the city of El Paso “one of \nAmerica’s safest cities” in his State of the Union address just weeks before issuing the Proclamation.  \nId. at ¶ 102. El Paso is frequently invoked in debates over funding for construction along the southern \nborder precisely because it “has been recognized as one of the top 10 safest cities in the country for two \nconsecutive years.”  Id. ¶ 100; see also id. ¶ 100 n.19, ¶ 102 n.26 (articles about the debate over the role \npast barrier construction played in El Paso’s low crime rate).  And far from treating all parts of the \nsouthern border as equally dangerous, the Government has used its construction authority in a focused \nmanner, and provided justifications as to why projects are needed in discrete areas of the southern \nborder.  See Rapuano 4/25 Decl., Ex. A (Request for Assistance from DHS to DoD, Feb. 25, 2019).   \nIgnoring the contradictions in its interpretation of the Proclamation, the County indulges in \n“speculation about ‘the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the court’” that \ncannot support standing.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 410, 414 n.5 (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 562 (1992)).  Ms. Keller, the Chief Administrator of the County, explains that she devotes time \nto “plan[ning] for counteracting the emergency declaration,” including “planning for conversations in \nwhich I will have to debunk myths about El Paso,” as well as time “strategizing how to combat a \nfalsely negative image” and adjusting to “the expectation that I will not get as many applicants as I \n                                                 \nhad standing to enforce a statutory prohibition on sports gambling both because the leagues were the \neffective object of efforts to legalize gambling and “the proven stigmatizing effect of having sporting \ncontests associated with gambling”), overruled on other grounds, Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018); \nForetich v. United States, 351 F.3d 1198, 1214 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (plaintiff had standing to present bill of \nattainder claim after Congress enacted a statute targeted at a single individual, leading to “harassment \nby the media, estrangement from his neighbors, and loss of business and professional opportunities”). \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 51 of 75\n \nhave gotten in the past” for certain jobs.  Decl. of Betsy Keller (“Keller Decl.”) ¶¶ 9–11, ECF No. 55-\n25.  Likewise, Judge Samaniego explains that the Proclamation is a “serious threat to both tourism and \neconomic development” and that it is “harming our economic development efforts . . . by generating \nfears of potential investors that the community will be mired in a long-term state of chaos.”  Decl. of \nRichard Samaniego (“Samaniego Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 11, ECF No. 55-26.  But fears that unknown third \nparties will, in response to the Proclamation’s general statements about the situation on the southern \nborder, make their own independent judgments about whether or not to visit or spend money in El \nPaso County are precisely the sort of speculative harms the Supreme Court found insufficient for \nstanding in Clapper.15 \nThese  allegations  are  not  improved  by  the  declarants’  statements  about  their  alleged \ninvestment of time and resources to combat the Proclamation.  See, e.g., Keller Decl. ¶¶ 9–11; \nSamaniego Decl. ¶¶ 11–12.  “[A]sserti[ons] that [the County] suffer[s] present costs and burdens that \nare based on a fear of” negative economic impact cannot ground standing, even if reasonable.  Clapper, \n568 U.S. at 416.  Such harm is traceable not to the actions the government has taken.  See id. at 418; \nsee also Zimmerman v. City of Austin, 881 F.3d 378, 389 (5th Cir. 2018) (“standing cannot be conferred \nby a self-inflicted injury”); Assoc. for Retarded Citizens of Dallas v. Dallas Cnty. Mental Health & Mental \nRetardation Ctr. Bd. of Trustees, 19 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir. 1994) (rejecting theory that “any sincere \nplaintiff could bootstrap standing by expending its resources in response to actions of another”).   \nThe County’s “reputational injury” argument also founders even if one were to assume an \n                                                 \n15 Judge Samaniego also declared that, “In my capacity as County Judge, I have already heard personally \nfrom people who have a false impression that El Paso County is a dangerous place and who do not \nwant to come here.”  Samaniego Decl. ¶ 10.  But he does not claim that the “people” he “heard” from \ngot the “false impression” that “El Paso County is a dangerous place” from the Proclamation.  Plaintiffs’ \nbrief inserts the phrase “because of the President’s Proclamation” at the end of this statement, Pls.’ \nMSJ at 12, but the relevant paragraph from Judge Samaniego’s declaration, quoted in full here, does \nnot contain, or suggest, such a qualifier. \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 52 of 75\n \n“injury-in-fact”  has  been  established,  for  two  reasons.    First,  the  County  has  not  shown  the \nProclamation itself caused the reputational injury it complains about.  Public debate on the southern \nborder has been ongoing for decades, and the County’s declarants provide little more than conclusory \nstatements linking the Proclamation to whatever reputational harm has resulted from that debate.  \nNegative  impressions  of  the  southern  border  or  the  County  may  be  “associated  with”  the \nProclamation, Keller Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, but unless the County demonstrates causation, there is no standing. \nSecond, the County has failed to show how a favorable decision will redress its injury.  The \nCounty asks the Court to “[d]eclare that the President’s Proclamation . . . is unauthorized by, and \ncontrary to, the Constitution and laws of the United States,” and to enjoin the Government from \n“taking any actions pursuant” to it.  First Am. Compl. at 47 (prayer for relief).  But it is entirely \nspeculative to suggest a judicial finding that the Proclamation does not satisfy the NEA would bring \nadditional business and tourists to the County or would remedy the “false and negative impression of \nEl Paso” that the Proclamation’s description of the southern border creates.  Samaniego Decl. ¶ 6.  \nBecause the proposed remedy does nothing to redress the County’s asserted injuries, there is no \nstanding for the County’s claims.   \n2.  Pecuniary Injuries \nThe County also argues that its “pecuniary injuries” suffice to establish standing.  But neither \nMs. Keller nor Judge Samaniego present evidence of concrete, imminent injury to such interests as a \nresult of an alleged downturn in El Paso’s reputation caused by the Proclamation.  Rather, their \ndeclarations speak of the Proclamation as “threat to both tourism and economic development,” \nSamaniego Decl. ¶ 6, and the “fears of potential investors,” id. ¶ 11.  But threats and fears about the \nactions of third parties are not forms of “certainly impending” injury, and the County has failed to \npoint to even a single example of actual or threatened loss of tourism dollars or business investment \nas a result of the Proclamation.  Even if the County could eventually show, for example, that its tax \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 53 of 75\n \nrevenues from tourism diminished since the Proclamation, Pls.’ MSJ at 14, it would also have to \nestablish the diminution in revenue was the result of the Proclamation, not other factors, and that a \ndeclaratory judgment would undo the alleged harm caused by the statements in the Proclamation.  The \nCounty has not come close to making that showing. \nThe remaining pecuniary injuries advanced by the County fare no better.  The County argues \nthat construction taking place across state lines “will surely disrupt the County’s ‘regional economy,’” \nPls.’ MSJ at 14 (quoting Keller Decl. ¶ 13), but Ms. Keller and Judge Samaniego offer no evidence, \nbeyond conclusory statements and speculation, that there will in fact be serious disruption to the \nCounty’s interests due to the replacement of vehicle barriers with pedestrian fencing outside of \nrecognized ports of entry on federal land entirely outside of the County.  The County also asserts that \nfunding designated for Fort Bliss may be diverted to use under § 2808, but even assuming that is a \ncognizable harm, a decision has yet to be made by the Assistant Secretary of Defense regarding § 2808.  \nAccordingly, the County’s claims should be dismissed in full for lack of Article III standing. \n  BNHR Lacks Standing to Challenge the Proclamation or § 284 Construction. \nBNHR asserts organizational standing to challenge the Proclamation and border barrier \nconstruction.  First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 113–19; Pls.’ MSJ at 16–19.  But the four types of organization \nharm it alleges are not sufficient for standing purposes, either. \nFirst,  BNHR  claims  it  has  had  to  “divert  organizational  resources  from  its  normal \nprogramming to respond to the President’s Proclamation,” including “counseling” and “recruit[ing] \nand train[ing] attorneys to handle the increase in incoming complaints,” hiring a policy consultant, \nsending a lobbying delegation to Washington D.C., and working longer hours  First Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n113–15; Decl. of Fernando Garcia (“Garcia Decl.”) ¶¶ 13–31, ECF No. 55-27.  BNHR contends these \ninjuries establish standing under Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), and cases applying \nit.  But Havens Realty is a narrow decision that does not sanction standing on these facts.   \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 54 of 75\n \nThe  plaintiff  organization  in  Havens  Realty  was  a  “housing  counseling  service”  whose \norganizational mission included “the investigation and referral of complaints concerning housing \ndiscrimination.”  455 U.S. at 363.  It sent testers to an apartment complex in order to determine \nwhether it practiced unlawful “racial steering,” and subsequently brought suit to challenge the practice \nit discovered.  In rejecting a challenge to its standing, the Supreme Court agreed that the defendant’s \n“racial steering” had “impaired [plaintiff’s] ability to provide counseling and referral services for low-\nand moderate-income homeseekers,” establishing injury-in-fact.  Id. at 379.  Absent such a direct \nimpairment on its mission caused by the challenged action, standing does not exist whenever a public \ninterest organization decides to spend money opposing a governmental policy of concern or the \norganization suffered a “setback to [its] abstract social interests,” id. (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 \nU.S. 727, 739 (1972)).  The Fifth Circuit case law Plaintiff relies upon upholds this principle by \nrecognizing  standing  only  when  a  defendant  actually  inhibits  a  plaintiff  from  carrying  out  its \norganizational mission, either by imposing barriers or by neglecting a legal duty.16 \nThis case lacks the nexus between organizational activities and defendant conduct present in \nHavens Realty.  BNHR’s mission is community organizing, education, and advocacy.  Garcia Decl. ¶ 3.  \nBut the Proclamation imposes no obstacles or constraints on BNHR’s ability to engage in these \nactivities.  BNHR cannot identify any legal or factual way in which the message of the Proclamation \nimposes new constraints on its members or the public, or identify a legal duty the Government is no \n                                                 \n16 OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 610–12 (5th Cir. 2017) (finding plaintiff, an organization \nthat encourages civic participation, had standing to challenge state law restricting interpreter assistance \nfor voters because it expended resources to educate members about the restrictions so they could rely \non the interpreter of their choice at the polls);  Scott v. Schedler, 771 F.3d 831, 837–38 (5th Cir. 2014) \n(finding injury-in-fact and causation over a National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) claim after \napplying Fowler); Assoc. of Community Organizations for Reform Now v. Fowler, 178 F.3d 350, 362 (5th Cir. \n1999) (recognizing potential standing of political advocacy group to challenge states’ implementation \nof the NVRA because “it has expended resources registering voters in low registration areas who \nwould have been registered if the appellees had complied with” the statute). \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 55 of 75\n \nlonger fulfilling in reliance on the Proclamation.  Rather, BNHR’s efforts are explicitly intended to \nvindicate its “abstract social interest” in opposing the Government’s policies.  See, e.g., Garcia Decl. ¶¶ \n13–14  (explaining  shift  in  resources  to  “combat  the  false  negative  message  fostered  by  the \nProclamation” and that purpose of events put on by BNHR is the “constant need to respond to \nimmediate developments at the border and to denounce the administration’s false rhetoric.”). \nThe Fifth Circuit rejected a very similar claim of organizational standing to the one BNHR \nmakes here in NAACP v. City of Kyle, 626 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 2010).  There, the plaintiff tried to ground \nstanding to challenge revised housing ordinances on a study it had commissioned regarding the impact \nof the revisions, as well as lobbying efforts designed to persuade the defendant municipality not to \nimplement the revised ordinances, but did not explain how those efforts “differ from the HBA’s \nroutine lobbying activities,” or “identif[y] any specific projects that the HBA had to put on hold or \notherwise curtail in order to respond to the revised ordinances.”  Id. at 238.  The Kyle court also \nreaffirmed that “redirect[ing] . . . resources to litigation and legal counseling in response to actions or \ninactions of another party is insufficient to impart standing upon the organization.”  Id. (quoting La. \nACORN Fair Hous. v. LeBlanc, 211 F.3d 298, 305 (5th Cir. 2000).  BNHR’s post-Proclamation activities \nare not different, in kind, from its pre-Proclamation mission of education, advocacy, and organizing \naround its views about the southern border.  Moreover, BNHR does not identify any specific project \nit has been required to put on hold because of the Proclamation.  It notes one event, “Hugs Not \nWalls,” that was “effectively ended” by the Proclamation, but that outcome was a choice by BNHR. \nMr. Garcia’s declaration explains that the campaign could not continue because “law enforcement is \nno longer supportive” of reunifying families near the border.  Garcia Decl. ¶ 32.  That choice has \nnothing to do with a diversion of resources attributable to the Proclamation.  Because its alleged harm \nis purely incidental to the “abstract social interest” for which it advocates, BNHR cannot avail itself \nof standing under Havens Realty. \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 56 of 75\n \nSecond, BNHR avers that the Proclamation “injures BNHR’s organizational mission,” not \nonly because it diverts resources, but because it “stigmatize[s] BNHR’s community members” and \ndisrupted their “ongoing campaign to build and maintain trust between community members and law \nenforcement.”  First Am. Compl. ¶ 116; see also Garcia Decl. ¶ 31.  This is an axiomatic “abstract social \ninterest” as described in Havens Realty.  Even so, the reasons Mr. Garcia gives for this deterioration \n(“our members’ fears and the shift in attitude by the Border Patrol brought on by the rhetoric that \nunderpins the Proclamation”) are both speculative and in any event not remotely attributable to the \nProclamation.  Garcia Decl. ¶ 31.  Moreover, “stigmatization” is not a cognizable Article III injury, as \nthose who “are not themselves affected by a government action except through their abstract offense \nat the message allegedly conveyed by that action” only have standing to bring certain First Amendment \nclaims.  Barber, 860 F.3d at 353 n.4 (quoting In re Navy Chaplaincy, 534 F.3d at 764-65).   \nThird, the First Amended Complaint (but not the motion for summary judgment) alleges that \ncurrent and future border wall construction will harm the quality of life of its members by delaying \nborder crossings and creating unwanted pollution and noise.  First Am. Compl. ¶ 117; Garcia Decl. \n¶¶ 33–37.  Such allegations would only permit standing to challenge the § 284 project moving forward \nin New Mexico.  But as was true of the County’s allegations of pecuniary harm, these asserted threats \nlack the necessary imminence and concreteness for Article III standing.  Current slowdowns at border \ncrossings  cannot  be  the  result  of  “recently  announced”  construction  on  federal  land  outside \nestablished ports of entry, and indeed, all Mr. Garcia claims is that the construction “threatens to make \nthis problem worse” without explaining how the project will “congest[] all of the nearby ports and \naccess roads.”  Garcia Decl. ¶ 34.  Past negative experience with construction does not make future \nharm imminent, id. ¶ 36, and BNHR does not even allege that they have members who live in sufficient \nproximity to the federal land near the border such that construction would disturb them. \nFinally, BNHR alleges that “the Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement in \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 57 of 75\n \nintent  and  effect  have  stigmatized  immigrant  communities,”  causing  their  member  families  to \n“reasonably fear race-based violence,” “fear an influx of law enforcement,” and “fear increased public \nsafety risks for children and for the community, which they must take[] steps now to mitigate.”  First \nAm. Compl. ¶ 118.  But even if BNHR reasonably and sincerely believes that it must take present \naction in order to mitigate risks arising from fear of future events, Clapper squarely holds that such \nfears do not suffice for purposes of Article III standing.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 416 (“[R]espondents \ncannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of \nhypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”).  \nBNHR also faces similar causation and redressability problems similar to those faced by the \nCounty, insofar as their challenge focuses on the Proclamation.  It provides no explanation as to how \nthe general statements about the southern border in the Proclamation, separate from decades of \nintense debate about the state of the southern border generally, led to their alleged harm.  And it \nprovides no answer as to why a declaratory judgment that the Proclamation does not meet the legal \nrequirements of the NEA cures BNHR’s concerns about “false rhetoric” at the border, since a positive \nlitigation outcome for BNHR would not disprove the factual accuracy of the statements in the \nProclamation.  Accordingly, BNHR also lacks standing. \n  Plaintiffs Have Not Satisfied the APA’s Requirements for Review of Agency \nAction. \n  There Is No “Final Agency Action” Respecting § 2808 Because the Acting \nSecretary Has Not Yet Decided to Undertake or Authorize Any Barrier \nConstruction Projects Under That Authority. \nBecause § 2808 does not provide for judicial review, APA review, if available at all, is only \npermitted if there has been “final agency action.”  Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Herman, 176 F.3d 283, 287 (5th \nCir. 1999).  Final agency action is marked by two characteristics.  First, final agency action “mark[s] \nthe consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process”; it is not “tentative” or “interlocutory.”  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (internal citation omitted).  Second, the action “must be \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 58 of 75\n \none by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  \nId. at 178 (internal citation omitted).  Thus, even when agency action affects the public, it cannot be \nchallenged in court if it is interlocutory, or if it does not fix any legal rights.  See, e.g., Resident Council of \nAllen Parkway Vill. v. U.S. Dep’t of Urban Hous. & Dev., 980 F.2d 1043, 1056 (5th Cir. 1993).  \nAs discussed earlier, see supra at Argument, pt. II.A, the Acting Secretary of Defense has not \nyet decided to authorize any projects under § 2808.  Rapuano 5/15/19 Decl. ¶ 13.  The Proclamation \ndoes  not  mandate  that  DoD  undertake  any  specific  construction  projects,  much  less  projects \nimpacting  Plaintiffs.    The  Proclamation  makes  available  to  the  Acting  Secretary  of  Defense \nconstruction authority available under § 2808 to use at his discretion.  The APA does not entitle \nPlaintiffs to challenge the Acting Secretary of Defense’s decision until it is final.     \n  The Use of § 2808 Construction Authority Is Committed to Agency Discretion \nby Law and Is Unreviewable Under the APA. \nEven if there were final agency action, any decision by the Acting Secretary of Defense to \nundertake military construction under § 2808 is not subject to judicial review because it is “committed \nto agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  Courts may not review final agency action “if the \nstatute is drawn so that court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s \ndiscretion.”  Ellison v. Conner, 153 F.3d 247, 251 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. \n821, 830 (1985)).  “[I]f no judicially manageable standards are available for judging how and when an \nagency should exercise its discretion, then it is impossible to evaluate agency action for ‘abuse of \ndiscretion.’”  Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830.  Courts in this circuit “look first to the statutory text, paying \nparticular attention to the words Congress has chosen,” as well as “the structure and purpose of the \nstatute” to determine whether Congress intended to place a particular set of agency decisions beyond \nAPA review.  Gulf Restoration Network v. McCarthy, 783 F.3d 227, 233 (5th Cir. 2015).   \nHere, there is no meaningful standard by which the Court could review any ultimate decision \nby the Acting Secretary of Defense to exercise his authority under § 2808.  The statute gives significant \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 59 of 75\n \ndiscretion to the Acting Secretary, providing only that, in the event of a declaration of national \nemergency, the Secretary “may” authorize military construction projects “that are necessary to support \nsuch use of the armed forces.”  10 U.S.C. § 2808.  That is a quintessential military judgment, and the \nstatute does not specify any criteria that the Secretary must consider in making his determination.  See \nGilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 (1973) (“The complex subtle, and professional decisions as to the \ncomposition, training, equipping, and control of a military force are essentially professional military \njudgments . . . .”); Perales v. Casillas, 903 F.2d 1043, 1048 (5th Cir. 1990) (finding agency action \ncommitted to discretion by law when there were “no statutory standards for the court to apply”).  Nor \ndoes  it  include  any  specific  prohibitions  limiting  the  Secretary’s  determination  of  what  would \nconstitute a project “necessary” to support the use of the armed forces.  See Ellison, 153 F.3d at 253 \n(determining that agency action was committed to agency discretion by law when there were no \n“procedural or substantive requirements” imposed on the decision maker).    \nEven if § 2808 contained “standards to apply,” such standards would not be “judicially \nmanageable” because the determination regarding what is “necessary to support such use of the armed \nforces” is an inherent military judgment to which courts have routinely deferred.  See North Dakota v. \nUnited States, 495 U.S. 423, 443 (1990) (“When the Court is confronted with questions relating to \nmilitary discipline and military operations, we properly defer to the judgment of those who must lead \nour Armed Forces in battle.”); Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 93 (1953) (“judges are not given the \ntask of running the Army”).  Any judicial review of the Acting Secretary of Defense’s decision to \nauthorize border barrier construction under § 2808 as necessary to support the use of the armed forces \nwould necessarily require this Court to second-guess the Secretary’s considered judgment on core \nmilitary matters such as allocation of military resources, readiness, and the relative value of various \nmilitary construction projects within the military’s global national security strategy.  There are no \njudicially manageable standards for conducting that type of review.  See NFFE v. United States, 905 \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 60 of 75\n \nF.2d 400, 405–06 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (concluding that decisions about which military bases to close were \ncommitted to agency discretion by law because “the federal judiciary is ill-equipped to conduct reviews \nof the nation’s military policy”).  Such judgment is “better left to those more expert in issues of \ndefense,” id. at 406, and inherently requires a determination of the “military value” of the proposed \nconstruction projects.  Dist. No. 1, Pac. Coast Dist., Marine Eng’rs Beneficial Ass’n v. Maritime Admin., 215 \nF.3d 37, 41–42 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  Indeed, “[t]his court has consistently followed the command that \nmatters implicating . . . military affairs are generally beyond the authority or competency of a court’s \nadjudicative powers.”  Spectrum Stores, Inc. v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 632 F.3d 938, 950 (5th Cir. 2011) \n(internal citation omitted).  For these reasons, there are no judicially manageable standards to apply, \nand the Secretary’s determination is committed to agency discretion by law under the APA.  \n  Plaintiffs’ Claims Do Not Fall Within the Zone of Interest of § 8005, § 284, or \n§ 2808. \nThe APA’s “zone of interests” test forecloses suit “when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed \nthat Congress intended to permit the suit.” Match–E–Be–Nash–She–Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225 (2012) (quotation omitted).  The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing \nthat the injury he complains of “falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected by the \nstatutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.” Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 \nU.S. at 883.  Here, Plaintiffs seek to vindicate reputational and pecuniary interests that have absolutely \nno connection to the interests protected by § 8005, § 284, and § 2808.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have no \nAPA claim for violations of these statutes. \nDoD’s transfer authority for appropriated funds under § 8005 comes with certain limitations \nthat Plaintiffs now seek to have judicially enforced.  But Congress never contemplated third parties \ninserting themselves into the DoD funding process through litigation.  The Constitution puts \nCongress and the Executive at the center of military policy, including the military budget. See U.S. \n47 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 61 of 75\n \nConst., art. I, § 8, cl. 12. “The ultimate responsibility for these decisions” about the allocation of \nlimited resources appropriated to DoD “is appropriately vested in branches of the government which \nare periodically subject to electoral accountability,” not the courts. Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 10 \n(1973).  Section 8005 was designed to “tighten congressional control of the re-programming process,” \nH. Rep. 93-662 at 16-17 (9174), but it was “phrased as a directive to” DoD, “not as a conferral of the \nright to sue upon” those who disagree with DoD’s decision to reprogram funds. See Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1378, 1387 (2015).17 The notice provisions of § 8005 allow DoD \nand Congress to resolve reprogramming disagreements as a matter of comity, or via legislation and \noversight. Plaintiffs’ interest in the reprogramming process is “‘so marginally related to … the \npurposes implicit in’” § 8005 “that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress authorized” suit \nunder the statute. Lexmark Int’l Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 527 U.S. 118, 130 (2014) (quoting \nPatchak, 567 U.S. at 225). \nMuch the same reasoning applies to Plaintiffs’ challenges of § 284 and § 2808.  Section 284’s \nlimitations on when DoD can provide counter-drug support are designed to regulate the relationship \nbetween Congress, DoD, and state or federal agencies seeking assistance with drug trafficking, based \non budgetary control and agency focus.  Likewise, § 2808 exists to regulate the relationship between \nCongress and the Executive Branch regarding the diversion of unobligated military construction funds \nfor other purposes during a national emergency.  The “interests protected by the” statutes are \ncompletely unrelated to the interests Plaintiffs seek to vindicate in this case.  See Lexmark, 527 U.S. at \n                                                 \n17 This problem cannot be avoided by reframing Plaintiffs’ claims as implied equitable actions under \nthe Appropriations Clause.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2019 WL 2247689, at *17.  On \nthe contrary, a stricter test applies, because “what comes within the zone of interests of a statute for \npurposes of obtaining judicial review . . . under the APA may not do so for other purposes.”  Lexmark, \n527 U.S. at 130.  The Supreme Court has suggested that, where a plaintiff seeks to bring an implied \ncause of action in equity to enforce a statutory or constitutional provision, the zone-of-interests test \nrequires that the provision be intended for the “especial benefit” of protecting the plaintiff at issue.  See \nClarke v. Securities Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 396, 400 & n. 16 (1987). \n48 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 62 of 75\n \n131.  Neither statute is intended to give private parties a remedy for protecting themselves from \nnegative externalities of construction.  As such, the APA does not provide a remedy for alleged \nviolations of these statutes. \n  Plaintiffs’ APA Claims Related to the Funding of the Border Wall (Counts V–VI) \nFail On the Merits. \nPlaintiffs challenge the legality of the Government’s use of § 9705, § 284, and § 2808 to engage \nin construction along the southern border, as well as the legality of funding transfers to support § 284 \nconstruction under § 8005.  None of them succeed.  Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of \nDefendants on these counts is proper.  \n  Section 9705 \nAlthough raised in their complaint, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment does not \nchallenge Treasury’s use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) to fund border barrier construction \nby DHS under 31 U.S.C. § 9705(g)(4)(B).  The Government is entitled to summary judgment on these \nclaims for at least three reasons.  First, Plaintiffs have no standing to bring a § 9705 claim, as § 9705 \nfunds are not being used for construction in the El Paso area, and Plaintiffs do not assert they are \neligible to receive funding from the TFF that will otherwise be diverted to DHS.  See Decl. of Loren \nFlossman ¶¶ 9–12 (April 1, 2019) (Ex. 8) (CBP will use TFF money for construction in the Rio Grande \nValley Sector).  Second, the allocation of TFF funds is committed to agency discretion by law and is \nthus unreviewable under the APA.  See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993) (allocation of lump \nsum appropriation not reviewable).  Third, the use of the TFF to fund border barrier construction \nsatisfies the minimal requirements of § 9705(g)(4)(B), which authorizes Treasury to use surplus funds \nto support “the law enforcement activities of any Federal agency.”  CBP was established to “ensure \nthe interdiction of persons and goods illegally entering or exiting the United States,” “interdict . . . \npersons who may undermine the security of the United States,” and “safeguard the borders of the \nUnited States,” among other duties.  6 U.S.C. § 211(c)(2), (5), (6); see Arizona, 567 U.S. at 397 \n49 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 63 of 75\n \n(describing the role that DHS and CBP play in enforcing the country’s immigration laws and “securing \nthe country’s borders”).  And Congress has recognized that barriers prevent unlawful entries by aliens \nand smuggling of contraband across the border, see Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-367, \n§§ 2–3, 120 Stat. at 2638–39, and thus help enforce the laws that prohibit such activities, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1325 (improper entry by an alien); 18 U.S.C. § 545 (smuggling goods into the United States); 21 \nU.S.C.  §  865  (smuggling  methamphetamine  into  the  United  States).    As  such,  Treasury’s \n§ 9705(g)(4)(B)  transfer  is  lawful  and  judgment  on  Plaintiffs’  claims  should  be  entered  in  the \nGovernment’s favor. \n  Section 2808 \nPlaintiffs argue that the Government cannot use § 2808 for border barrier construction \nbecause (1) the Proclamation does not establish a “national emergency” that “requires use of the \narmed forces”; (2) border barriers are not a “military construction project”; and (3) such projects will \nnot be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”  Pls.’ MSJ at 36–40.  But Plaintiffs cannot \nshow at this stage that the Government has failed to meet any of these requirements. \n   The use of § 2808 is predicated on a Presidential declaration of a national emergency “that \nrequires the use of the armed forces,” and provides the Secretary of Defense with authority to \n“undertake military construction projects” that are “necessary to support such use of the armed \nforces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a). The statutory scheme leaves to the President the determination of \nwhether a national emergency “requires the use of the armed forces,” and courts have uniformly \nconcluded that a Presidential declaration of a national emergency is a nonjusticiable political question. \nSee supra at Discussion, pt. I.B.  Similarly, determinations about whether specific construction projects \nwould be “necessary to support such use of the armed forces” are vested in the expertise of the \nSecretary of Defense, and courts are not free to “second-guess military judgments.”  Bynum v. FMC \nCorp., 770 F.2d 556, 563 (5th Cir. 1985); see North Dakota, 495 U.S. at 443 (1990) (“we properly defer \n50 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 64 of 75\n \nto the judgment of those who must lead our Armed Forces in battle.”).  \nFurther, although “military construction project” is a statutorily defined term, its definition is \nbroad  and  illustrative,  not  specific  or  exclusive.  See  10  U.S.C.  §  2801(b).  The  term  “military \nconstruction” is broadly defined to “include[] any construction . . . of any kind carried out with respect \nto a military installation.” Id. § 2801(a) (emphasis added). A “military installation,” in turn, “means a \nbase, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military \ndepartment.”  Id.  §  2801(c)(4)  (emphasis  added).  Broad  terms  defining  military  construction  as \n“includ[ing]” (but not limited to, see 10 U.S.C. § 101(f)(4)) construction with respect to a military \ninstallation.  The Court has no concrete record upon which to assess whether these statutory \nrequirements  have  been  satisfied  with  respect  to  particular  construction  projects.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have not made out an APA violation with respect to § 2808. \n  Section 284 \nPlaintiffs’ challenges to § 284 also miss the mark.  They argue (1) that the $ 2.5 billion DoD \nhas redirected toward border barrier construction does not qualify as “support,” and (2) that the entire \nsouthern border would have to qualify as a “drug smuggling corridor[]” in order for the authority to \napply.  Pls.’ MSJ at 40–44.  Both arguments lack merit. \nThe text and history of § 284 contradict Plaintiffs’ claim that the construction allowed under \nthe  statute  to  support  counterdrug  activities  of  other  agencies  is  limited  only  to  “small  scale \nconstruction projects” under $750,000.  Pls.’ MSJ at 42.  No such monetary restriction appears in the \ntypes of support permitted under § 284.  See 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)-(c).  To the contrary, the statute broadly \napproves “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling \ncorridors across international boundaries of the United States” without regard to the size, scale, or \nbudget of the project.  Id. § 284(b)(7).  And since Congress first provided this authority in 1990, DoD \nhas repeatedly used it, with Congress’s explicit approval, to complete large-scale fencing projects along \n51 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 65 of 75\n \nthe southern border in support of DHS’s counterdrug activities.  For example, under authority of the \nfirst counterdrug activities support appropriation, DoD built a 14-mile fence in a drug smuggling \ncorridor along the San Diego-Tijuana border—a project Congress described as “precisely the kind of \nfederal-local cooperative effort the Congress had in mind” in enacting such authority.  H.R. Rep. No. \n103-200, at 330-31 (1993).  As of 2006, Congress reported with approval that, since 1990, DoD’s use \nof its authority to support counterdrug activities through “construction and rehabilitation” along the \nsouthern border “resulted in 7.6 miles of double-layer fencing, 59 miles of single fencing, and 169.5 \nmiles of road.”  H.R. Rep. No. 109-452, at 368.  And in determining appropriations for these \nconstruction activities, Congress recommended that DoD spend millions of dollars on specific border \nprojects.  See, e.g., id. at 369 (recommending a $10 million increase in DoD’s budget for fence and road-\nbuilding activity on the southern border with instructions that “not less than $3.0 million” and “not \nless than $2.0 million” be used for fence construction projects in Texas and Arizona, respectively).  \nSection 284 requires the Acting Secretary of Defense to provide “a description of any small \nscale construction project”—which it defines as “construction at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for \nany project”—“for which support is provided” under § 284(b) or (c) at least 15 days in advance of \nproviding such support.  10 U.S.C. § 284(h)(1)(B), (i)(3).  Contrary to Plaintiffs’ suggestion, there is \nnothing inherently implausible about Congress choosing to require notice for some, but not all, \nprojects that DoD could construct under § 284.  See Pls.’ MSJ at 42.  Certain types of support \nauthorized under § 284 explicitly refer—but are not limited—to “small scale” or “minor” construction.  \nSee  10  U.S.C.  §  284(b)(4)  (authorizing  “[t]he  establishment  (including  an  unspecified  minor  military \nconstruction project) and operation of bases of operations or training facilities for the purpose of \nfacilitating counterdrug activities . . . within or outside the United States” (emphasis added)); id. \n§ 284(c)(1)(B) (authorizing “[t]he establishment (including small scale construction) and operation of bases \nof operations or training facilities for the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities . . . outside the \n52 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 66 of 75\n \nUnited States” (emphasis added)).  Accordingly, if Congress wanted to limit all § 284 construction to \n“small scale construction,” it could have and “presumably would have done so expressly.”  Russello v. \nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983).  Regardless of whether Plaintiffs think the scope of permissible \nconstruction activities under § 284 should be coextensive with the scope of the congressional \nnotification requirement, “[t]he short answer is that Congress did not write the statute that way.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs likewise fail to show that Defendants have violated § 284 by constructing border \nbarriers outside of “drug smuggling corridors” permitted by the statute.  Plaintiffs allege that § 284 \ndifferentiates between an “international boundary” and a “corridor” within that boundary, such that \nthe entire southern border cannot qualify as a “drug smuggling corridor.”  Pls.’ MSJ at 43–44.  But \nthere is no need for the Court to address the status of the entire southern border because the only \n§ 284 project at issue in this case for which Plaintiffs would arguably have standing is El Paso Sector \nProject 1.  With respect to that project, the record sets forth extensive evidence to support recent drug \nsmuggling activities in that area.  See Rapuano Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A at 8 (thousands of pounds of illegal \ndrugs seized between ports of entry in the El Paso Sector in fiscal year 2018).  Accordingly, the \nGovernment’s use of § 284 is appropriate and does not give rise to an APA violation. 18 \n  The Consolidated Appropriations Act \nPlaintiffs have also failed to show a violation of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 \n(CAA).  Pls.’ MSJ at 33–36.  Although one component of the CAA—the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act, 2019—places restrictions on border-barrier construction funded with \nDHS appropriations, the CAA does not expressly or implicitly limits the ability of the Government to \n                                                 \n18 Additionally, there is no merit to Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendants have violation § 8045 of the DoD \nAppropriations Act, which prohibits the transfer of DoD counter-drug funds to another agency.  See \nPls.’ MSJ at 46.  DoD is not transferring its counter-drug funds to DHS.  Instead, DoD is constructing \nthe border barriers using its own funds in support of DHS pursuant to § 284.  \n \n53 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 67 of 75\n \nrely upon other statutory authorities to fund the additional border-barrier construction at issue here. \nAnd the use of such statutory authorities does not violate any other provision of the CAA.  \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ contentions, Congress’s decision not to appropriate to DHS the full \namount of funds requested by the President for fiscal year 2019 border-barrier construction does not \nlimit the Acting Secretary of Defense’s ability to utilize other available statutory authorities for such \nconstruction.  Plaintiffs posit that Congress’s specific appropriation to DHS to fund, with restrictions, \ncertain border-barrier construction is tantamount to a prohibition of expenditures on any other \nstatutorily authorized border-barrier construction.19  See Pls.’ MSJ at 33–34.  Not so. “An agency’s \ndiscretion to spend appropriated funds is cabined only by the text of the appropriation.” Salazar v. \nRamah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182, 200 (2012) (quotation omitted). Plaintiffs have identified no \nrestriction in the CAA on the funding of border-barrier construction pursuant to other statutory \nauthorities, nor does its plain text include one. See Pls.’ MSJ at 6–7; see generally Pub. L. No. 116-6 \n(2019). Congress did not modify any of the statutes at issue here in the CAA. See id. And the CAA’s \nfunding provisions do not otherwise alter the meaning or availability of permanent statutes already in \neffect.  The absence of such provisions precludes any inference that Congress intended to, or actually \ndid, disable the use of other available authorities.  See Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 190 \n(1978) (“doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication applies with full vigor when the subsequent \nlegislation is an appropriations measure”); see also Donovan v. Carolina Stalite Co., 734 F.2d 1547, 1558 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[W]hen appropriations measures arguably conflict with the underlying authorizing \nlegislation, their effect must be construed narrowly.”).  In the absence of contrary language, the grant \n                                                 \n19 The DHS Appropriations Act restricts the location and manner of border-barrier construction \nfunded by Congress’s 2019 $1.375 billion appropriation to DHS for the purpose of such construction. \nSee Pub. L. No. 116-6, div. A, §§ 230–32. Most of these restrictions expressly apply to the use of those \nfunds only.  See id.  Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants have violated the few restrictions that apply \nmore generally. \n54 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 68 of 75\n \nof a specific appropriation cannot be read to restrict the use of other appropriated funds for similar \npurposes pursuant to other statutory authority. Had Congress wished to restrict all other border-\nbarrier construction—including construction authorized funded under other statutory authorities—it \ncould have plainly so stated.  Because the CAA’s text includes no such restrictions, neither its limits \non border-barrier construction funded by specific DHS appropriations, nor the history of negotiations \nregarding border barrier construction funding constrains the Acting Secretary of Defense’s ability to \nexpend funds pursuant to other statutory authorities. See Salazar, 567 U.S. at 200.  \nIn the absence of language specifically restricting the Acting Secretary of Defense’s actions, \nPlaintiffs claim that those actions are nonetheless prohibited by § 739 of the Financial Services and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act, 2019 (a component of the CAA). That provision states: \nNone of the funds made available in this or any other appropriations Act may \nbe used to increase, eliminate, or reduce funding for a program, project, or \nactivity as proposed in the President’s budget request for a fiscal year until such \nproposed change is subsequently enacted in an appropriation Act, or unless \nsuch change is made pursuant to the reprogramming or transfer provisions of \nthis or any other appropriations Act. \n \nPub. L. No. 116-6, div. D, § 739 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs’ allegations rest upon a faulty premise: \nthat any funds used for barrier construction are necessarily adding to a CBP appropriation.  That is \nuntrue.  Any funds utilized for border barrier construction pursuant to § 2808 or § 284 will be used \nfor the purpose for which they were appropriated—military construction and counter-drug activities, \nrespectively—and consistently with their underlying statutes, not to increase funding for a CBP \nprogram, project, or activity as proposed in the President’s budget request.  The mere fact that \nappropriations to different agencies can be used for similar purposes does not transform a valid use \nof one source of appropriated funds into an improper expenditure simply because another agency \nmay request funds for a similar purpose.  The use of funds at issue here complies with § 739, and \nPlaintiffs have not stated a claim for violation of the CAA. \n55 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 69 of 75\n \n  Section 8005 \nPlaintiffs assert that DoD’s transfer of funds under section 8005 is unlawful because it is (1) \nnot “based on unforeseen military requirements,” (2) the item requested had already been “denied by \nCongress,” and (3) the transfer was not “for military functions (except military construction).”  Pls.’ \nMSJ at 46–48.  But none of these arguments has merit.20 \nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that DoD violated § 8005’s requirement that transfers be for “higher \npriority items, based on unforeseen military requirements,” because the situation at the southern \nborder is not “unforeseen.”  Pls.’ MSJ at 47.  But § 8005 uses the term “unforeseen” in the context of \nthe budgeting process.  Congress does not appropriate funds to DoD on a “line item basis,” and \n§ 8005 gives DoD authority to make “changes in the application of financial resources from the \npurposes originally contemplated and budgeted for, testified to, and described in the justifications \nsubmitted to congressional committees in support of budget requests.”  H. Rep. No. 93-662, at 15–\n16.  Here, the need for DoD to exercise its § 284(b)(7) authority did not arise until February 2019, \nwhen DHS requested support from DoD to construct fencing in drug trafficking corridors.  See 10 \nU.S.C. § 284(a)(1) (authorizing DoD to support counter-drug activities only once “such support is \nrequested”).  Accordingly, the need to provide support for these projects was an unforeseen military \nrequirement at the time of the President’s fiscal year 2019 budget request.  See Rapuano Decl., Ex. C, \n                                                 \n20 In Sierra Club v. Trump, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered a \npreliminary injunction prohibiting further action to construct the El Paso Sector project at issue in \nthis case.  The court concluded that DoD had not satisfied two of § 8005’s requirements, holding that \nDoD had transferred funds for an “item” that was previously “denied” by Congress and that \nsupported a military requirement that was not “unforeseen.”  See 2019 WL 2247689, at *18–21. The \nCourt’s rationale was that, at the time of DoD’s appropriation, the Executive Branch’s general desire \nfor border-wall funding was foreseen and Congress denied DoD funding by providing DHS a smaller \namount of funding than it originally requested from Congress.  See id.  But that reasoning considers \nthe appropriations process at far too high a level of generality in light of § 8005’s text and context.  \nUnder § 8005, an “item for which funds are requested” is a particular budget item requiring additional \nfunding beyond the amount in the DoD appropriation for the fiscal year.  And Congress’s decision to \nappropriate less money to DHS cannot be a denial to DoD of its preexisting § 284 authority \n56 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 70 of 75\n \nat 1-2.  And it remained an unforeseen military requirement through Congress’s passage of DoD’s \nfiscal year 2019 budget in September 2018, which was five months before DHS’s request.  See Pub. L. \nNo. 115-245, 132 Stat. 2981.  DoD’s need to provide counter-drug assistance under § 284 in response \nto DHS’s request was thus not accounted for in DoD’s fiscal year 2019 budget and is accordingly \n“based on unforeseen military requirements” for purposes of § 8005. \nSecond, Congress has not “denied” any request by DoD to fund “the item” referenced in the \ntransfer—namely counter-drug activities funding, including fence construction, under § 284.  Plaintiffs \nassume that § 8005 can refer to a legislative judgment concerning the appropriation of funds for a \ndifferent agency under different statutory authorities.  But Congress’s affirmative appropriation of \n$1.375 billion to CBP for the construction of “primary pedestrian fencing” in the Rio Grande Valley \nSector, Pub. L. 116-6, div. A, § 230, does not constitute a “denial” of appropriations to DoD for its \ncounter-drug activities in furtherance of DoD’s mission under § 284.  The statutory language of § 8005 \nis located in, and directed to, DoD’s appropriations, and nothing in the DHS appropriations statute \nindicates  that  Congress “denied” a  request  to  fund  DoD’s  statutorily  authorized  counter-drug \nactivities, which include fence construction  10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7).  Nor did Congress otherwise restrict \nthe use of available appropriations for that purpose.  See CAA, Pub. L. No. 116-6.  Section 8005 was \ninstalled to ensure that DoD would not transfer funds for budget items that “ha[d] been specifically \ndeleted in the legislative process.”  H.R. Rep. No. 93-662, at 16 (emphasis added).  And because \nCongress never denied DoD funds to undertake the § 284 projects at issue, Plaintiffs’ claims fail.   \nThird, Plaintiffs argue that border fencing cannot be built using funds transferred pursuant to \n§ 8005 because the statute “does not authorize transferring funds for ‘military construction.’”  But \nthat overstates the scope and application of the “military construction” exception in § 8005.  The text \nof § 8005 lists the two types of “funds” and “appropriations” that may be transferred:  1) “working \ncapital funds” or 2) “funds made available in this Act” (i.e., the DoD FY19 Appropriations Act) “for \n57 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 71 of 75\n \nmilitary functions (except military construction).”  There is no violation of § 8005 here because neither \nthe surplus Army personnel funds from which the original $1 billion was transferred, nor the counter-\nnarcotics support line of the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense, to which the \nfunds were transferred, constitute military construction funds.  See Pub. L. No. 115-245, title I (military \npersonnel appropriation); title VI (Drug Interdiction and counter-drug activities appropriation); see also \nRapuano 4/25/19 Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. D (notice to Congress explaining in detail the sources of funds \ntransferred between appropriations).  Nor is there a contradiction between § 8005 and the definition \nof “military construction” for purposes of § 2808.  In the context of § 8005, “military construction” \nis a term of art that generally refers to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs budget (also \nknown as the MILCON budget). Congress has previously allowed DoD to use § 8005 to transfer \nfunds for use under its § 284 authority and to provide support for activities on the southern border.21  \nCongress’s failure to object to these transfers belies the claim that DoD cannot transfer funds under \n§ 8005 while asserting that border barrier projects also constitute “military construction” under § 2808. \n  Plaintiffs’ Appropriations Clause Claims Must Be Dismissed (Counts III–IV). \nPlaintiffs also seek to challenge the Government’s plan for funding border barrier construction \nunder the Appropriations Clause.  But these counts merely recast statutory claims in constitutional \nterms, and “claims simply alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority are not \n‘constitutional’ claims.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473.  The Government is not relying on independent \nArticle II authority in order to undertake border construction; the actions alleged are being undertaken \npursuant to statutory authority alone.  The President did not seek to reallocate appropriated funds \n                                                 \n21 See Reprogramming Application & Congressional Approvals, Sept. 2007 (Ex. 9) (DoD infrastructure \nproject in Nicaragua pursuant to § 284 authority); Reprogramming Application & Congressional \nApprovals, Sept. 2006 (transferring funds to support the National Guard’s involvement in Operation \nJump Start, the DoD mission in 2006-08 to support CBP’s border security efforts, which included \nconstruction efforts by the National Guard) (Ex. 10); see also Joint Statement of Rood and Gilday \n(describing Operation Jump Start and National Guard’s role in “building more than 38 miles of fence”) \n(Ex. 4).   \n58 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 72 of 75\n \nbased upon any claim of inherent constitutional authority.  Nor did the President claim that the \ndeclaration of a national emergency gave him any authority that had not been expressly conferred by \nCongress.  Rather, the Government relies solely upon available statutory authorities—31 U.S.C. \n§ 9705, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and 10 U.S.C. § 2808—that Congress has delegated to the Executive Branch.  \nThe outcome of this case thus turns entirely on whether the statutes authorize or proscribe the \nGovernment’s action.   \nIn Dalton, the Supreme Court rejected the proposition that “whenever the President acts in \nexcess of his statutory authority, he also violates the constitutional separation-of-powers doctrine.”  \n511 U.S. at 471.  The Court recognized that the “distinction between claims that an official exceeded \nhis statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on \nthe other, is too well established to permit this sort of evisceration.”  Id. at 474.  By asserting that \nactions  allegedly  exceeding  statutory  authority  are,  for  that  reason  alone,  violations  of  the \nAppropriations Clause, Plaintiffs’ complaint does what the Court disapproved of in Dalton.  Plaintiffs \nassert no violation of the Appropriations Clause separate from alleged statutory violations.  See First \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 134–55 (describing violations of the CAA, the NEA, § 284, § 2808, and § 8005).  These \nallegations do not state constitutional claims.  See Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473–74. \nPlaintiffs do not allege that the President has exercised his inherent authority under Article II \nof the Constitution.  Nor does the President purport to do so.  Despite Plaintiffs’ allusions to President \nTruman’s seizure of steel mills during the Korean War, First Am. Compl. ¶ 5, this case stands in sharp \ncontrast to Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), where the President’s order to \nthe Secretary of Commerce rested solely upon “the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution,” \nthereby  conceding  a  lack  of  statutory  authority.    Id.  at  585–87.    The  Court  held  the  action \nunconstitutional.  Id. at 589.  In his concurrence, Justice Jackson emphasized that the President had \nacted in the absence of congressional authorization, where his “power is at its lowest ebb” and such \n59 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 73 of 75\n \nexercise of power must be “scrutinized with caution.”  Id. at 637–38 (Jackson, J. concurring).  That is \nnot the situation here.  To the contrary, each action—including the Proclamation—is based on express \nstatutory authority.  The President and the executive agencies are acting “pursuant to an express . . . \nauthorization of Congress,” the situation in which “his authority is at its maximum.”  Youngstown Sheet, \n343 U.S. at 635 (Jackson, J. concurring).  Youngstown is therefore inapposite.  See AFLCIO v. Kahn, 618 \nF.2d 784, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (en banc); see also Dalton, 511 U.S. at 473. \nIf Plaintiffs’ allegations rise to the level of constitutional issues, then any allegation that the \nPresident or his agents exceeded their statutory authority could be pled as a constitutional or \nseparation-of-powers  claim.    The  Supreme  Court  has  foreclosed  such  tactics,  “distinguish[ing] \nbetween claims of constitutional violations and claims that an official has acted in excess of his \nstatutory authority.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472.  Once “the President concedes . . . that the only source \nof his authority is statutory, no constitutional question whatever is raised,” and all constitutional claims \nshould be dismissed.  Id. at 474 n.6. (internal quotation marks omitted).22  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint in full under Civil Rule 12, \nor grant summary judgment to the Government pursuant to Rule 56.23 \n                                                 \n22 Even if this Court were to determine that the Complaint stated a constitutional cause of action, \nchallenges to the constitutionality of agency action must be brought pursuant to the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(B); see also, e.g., Jarita Mesa Livestock Grazing Ass’n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 58 F. Supp. 3d 1191, \n1237–38 (D.N.M. 2014) (“While a right to judicial review of agency action may be created by a . . . \nconstitutional provision, once created it becomes subject to the judicial review provisions of the APA \nunless specifically excluded.”); Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England v. Thompson, 318 F. Supp. 2d 1, \n10–11 (D.R.I. 2004) (“The APA’s restriction of judicial review to the administrative record would be \nmeaningless if any party seeking review based on . . . constitutional deficiencies was entitled to broad-\nranging discovery.”). \n23 Plaintiffs, in the alternative, request a preliminary injunction.  Pls.’ MSJ at 48–50.  As explained in \nthis brief, Plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, and cannot even \nestablish Article III standing, let alone the sort of irreparable injury that would warrant a preliminary \ninjunction.  Moreover, the balance of equities tips sharply in the government’s favor in light of the \nemergency situation at the border and the high levels of drug trafficking that prompted DHS to seek \nassistance from DoD pursuant to § 284. \n60 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066-DB   Document 95   Filed 06/10/19   Page 74 of 75\n \nDated:  June 10, 2019  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  JOSEPH H.

Plaintiffs El Paso County, Texas, and Border Network for Human Rights, Inc. \n(“BNHR”), bring this action seeking relief from the President’s unlawful conduct in declaring a \nnational emergency and violating laws of Congress limiting funding for barriers at the United \nStates-Mexico border (the “southern border”). Plaintiffs ask this Court to provide redress by \ndeclaring that the President’s actions are unauthorized by, and contrary to, the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States, and by enjoining the Secretaries of Defense, Interior, Homeland \nSecurity, and Treasury from taking any action pursuant to the President’s Proclamation of \nFebruary 15, 2019, on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the \nUnited States (the “Proclamation”).1 \n2.  The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to decide how the \ngovernment spends money. “The United States Constitution exclusively grants the power of the \npurse to Congress, not the President.” City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, \n1231 (9th Cir. 2018). The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause provides that “No Money shall \nbe drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 9, cl. 7. And the Spending Clause grants Congress alone the “Power To lay and collect \nTaxes . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the \nUnited States.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. As James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers, \n“[t]he power over the purse may [be] the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \nconstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people.” THE FEDERALIST NO. 58.  \nIndeed, when “the decision to spend [is] determined by the Executive alone, without adequate \n                                                \n1 Proclamation, Donald J.

City of \nNew York, 524 U.S. 417, 451 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n3.  The Constitution also grants Congress the exclusive power to make laws.  The \nPresident may propose measures to Congress (U.S. Const. art. II, § 3), and he must sign bills for \nthem to go into law (U.S. Const. art. I, § 7), unless his veto is overridden. But otherwise the \nPresident’s role in our system of checks and balances is to execute the laws Congress has enacted \n(U.S. Const. art. II, § 3), not to make the laws himself. \n4.  The Constitution further charges Congress to conduct oversight of the military. \nPursuant to this power, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. §1385, which bars \nthe military from engaging in domestic law enforcement except where expressly authorized by \nthe Constitution or Congress. This statute enshrines the democratic norm, which took root at this \nnation’s founding, that the military shall not be used for domestic purposes. \n5.  Domestic deployment of the military without legislative authority was such an \naffront to the Founders that they discussed it in the Declaration of Independence, in their catalog \nof George III’s tyrannical conduct: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, \nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.” The Supreme Court has warned of the dangers of a \nPresident deploying the armed forces to disrupt the checks and balances in our Constitution. In \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, Justice Robert Jackson observed that no doctrine could \nbe “more sinister and alarming” than to allow a President to “vastly enlarge his mastery over the \ninternal affairs of the country by his own commitment of the Nation’s armed forces to some \nforeign venture.” 343 U.S. 579, 642 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  \n6.  The architects of our Constitution understood that executive usurpation of \nlegislative powers would lead to tyranny, and they saw the separation of powers as among the \nConstitution’s primary safeguards against it. Madison cautioned that “[t]he accumulation of all \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 4 of 39\npowers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, \nand whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition \nof tyranny.” THE FEDERALIST NO. 47.   \n7.  Pursuant to this constitutional framework, the President asked Congress to \nauthorize and appropriate certain funding for barriers at the southern border.  After careful \nconsideration and extensive political debate within each House and with the President, Congress \nenacted the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act.  It included $1.375 billion in funding for \nfencing in specific locations along the border, limiting the fencing to a previously deployed \ndesign.  President Trump signed this measure into law on February 15, 2019. \n8.  The same day the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, he also \nissued his Proclamation declaring a national emergency to access additional unappropriated \nfunds for the unauthorized construction of a border wall.2 \n9.  The President’s Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement3 laid \nclaim to $6.7 billion that Congress did not appropriate, for the purpose of building a border wall \nthat Congress did not authorize. In an attempt to override the limits that Congress had enacted \nand he had signed, the President purported to issue his Proclamation under the National \nEmergencies Act (“NEA”), 50 U.S.C. §1601 et seq., citing 10 U.S.C. § 2808, the military \nconstruction statute, as a funding source. He also issued a White House Statement announcing \nthat he would use—for the purpose of building a border wall—money that Congress had \ndesignated for use under different laws.  In particular, the Proclamation and White House \nStatement direct the use of funds under 10 U.S.C. § 284, which permits the Department of \n                                                \n2 References to “border wall” in this Complaint refer to any barrier or border-related infrastructure \nand/or project relating to the construction of a barrier or border-related infrastructure along the \nsouthern border that President Trump has called for and has not been approved by Congress.  \n3 Statement, White House, “President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory” (Feb. 15, \n2019), available at https://bit.ly/2GLqvGD. \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 5 of 39\nDefense to support drug interdiction activities, and the Treasury Department’s Asset Forfeiture \nFund, which is governed by 31 U.S.C. § 9705.  As explained below, none of these laws allow the \nPresident to spend funds on constructing a border wall.  That is all the more so because Congress \naddressed border-fence funding specifically in the appropriations law the President signed the \nsame day he issued the Proclamation.  And under well-established rules of statutory construction, \na specific law controls over more general laws.   \n10.  Beyond this, the Proclamation itself and the President’s accompanying statements \nbelie the notion that there is a qualifying “emergency” within the terms of the NEA.  While \nannouncing the Proclamation in the White House Rose Garden, the President acknowledged that \nthe “emergency” was his inability to persuade Congress to authorize the construction of a border \nwall or to appropriate funds to do so in the manner and amount he wants.  As the President said, \n“I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it \nmuch faster.”4   \n11.  By declaring a national emergency where none exists, the Proclamation also \nviolates long-standing laws prohibiting the military from engaging in domestic activity that \nCongress has not authorized.  Invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12302, the Proclamation purports to \nauthorize the Secretary of Defense to deploy Ready Reserve Units to the border in contravention \nof laws limiting the military’s ability to engage in domestic law enforcement. The President’s \nProclamation therefore represents a dangerous abuse of executive power of the sort the Framers \nof our Constitution sought to—and did—guard against. \n12.  The issuance of the Proclamation imposed concrete and immediate harms on \nPlaintiffs El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights.  El Paso County is a \n                                                \n4 President Donald J. Trump, Remarks from the White House Rose Garden (Feb. 15, 2019) \navailable at https://bit.ly/2GAsKgG. \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 6 of 39\nflourishing border community that has already been harmed by the President’s declaration of an \nemergency and faces additional imminent harm from the actions authorized by the Proclamation.  \nThe BNHR likewise has sustained concrete harms to itself as an organization and to its members, \nhundreds of families and thousands of individuals living along the border where the President \nhas declared an emergency, ordered the area’s militarization, and authorized construction. \n13.  Seeking redress for those harms, Plaintiffs come before this Court to ask it to \nfulfill its role in our constitutional system by saying what the law is and enforcing the plain \nmeaning of statutes passed by Congress and the constitutional provisions on which they rest. \nWhen the President oversteps his authority and overrides the constitutional powers of the \nlegislative branch, it is the appropriate role of the judicial branch to enforce the separation of \npowers.  See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998). The executive branch often \nseeks great deference from the courts in carrying out its discretionary functions, especially where \n“national security” is allegedly at stake. But no such deference is owed to the executive here, \nwhere the President is violating statutes and usurping the legislative branch’s role. The only \ndeference owed in this instance is to Congress and to the Constitution, which grants to Congress \nthe powers that the President purports to exercise. Put another way, having seized the power of \nthe legislative branch to make law and spend federal funds, the President may not attempt to \nsideline the judicial branch by arguing that it cannot interpret and apply the law. Plaintiffs urge \nthis Court to reject any such entreaties. Otherwise, it would license the executive to accumulate \nall powers—legislative, executive, and judicial—in just the way the Framers feared.     \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff, El Paso County, Texas, (“El Paso County”) is a county recognized as a \nlegal subdivision of the State. Tex. Const. art. 11, § 1. El Paso County has the constitutional and \nstatutory authority to set policies and regulations, raise revenue, and administer programs for its \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 7 of 39\nresidents in certain areas, including administering its County judicial system and providing \nhealth and social services to many County residents regardless of their national origin.  \n15.  Plaintiff El Paso County is bilingual, bi-national, multicultural, and \ngeographically distinct. El Paso County has over 800,000 residents, more than 82 percent of \nwhom are Hispanic and more than 25 percent of whom are foreign born. It is part of the largest \nborder community on the Rio Grande, and one of the safest communities in the nation. El Paso \nCounty takes great pride in protecting all its residents and its values, and has been a leader in the \nfight against discrimination of all types for decades, with a special focus on protecting the civil \nrights of its immigrant communities. \n16.  Plaintiff Border Network for Human Rights is a community-based membership \norganization incorporated in Texas with 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  Founded in 1998, BNHR \nis one of the leading human rights advocacy and immigration reform organizations located at the \nsouthern border. BNHR has over 4,000 members in West Texas and southern New Mexico. It \nhas been working with border communities for over 20 years with a mission to organize them \nthrough human rights education and to mobilize its members to ignite change in immigration and \nborder enforcement policy and practice. BNHR facilitates the education, organizing, and \nparticipation of marginalized border communities in defending and promoting human and civil \nrights. BNHR supports these communities’ work to create political, economic, and social \nconditions where every human being is equal in dignity and rights. BNHR brings this action on \nits own behalf and on behalf of its members, who live and work in El Paso County, as well as \nsouthern New Mexico.  \n17.  Defendant Donald J.

The 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act  \n25.  Congress passed and the President signed into law the 2019 Consolidated \nAppropriations Act on February 15, 2019.  Congress enacted the measure after extensive debate, \nincluding a government shutdown, over the appropriate funding levels for border wall \nconstruction. \n26.  In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress authorized and appropriated the \nexpenditure of $1.375 billion to repair certain existing border fencing or barriers and to provide \nfor 55 miles of new fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, using a previously deployed \ndesign.  This was less funding, fewer miles of fencing, and a different design than the President \nhad proposed in his fiscal year 2019 budget request.  \n \n \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 10 of 39\nB.  The National Emergencies Act  \n27.  Congress enacted the NEA in 1976 with overwhelming majorities in both houses, \nout of a recognition that Presidents were overusing the powers that Congress had granted them to \nact quickly in situations where Congress lacked adequate time to do so. The NEA terminated \nexisting emergencies (some of which had persisted for decades) and created a new framework to \ncabin the President’s authority. 50 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. The NEA’s primary purpose was to \nprevent the President from exercising unbounded authority to declare emergencies and to \ncontinue states of emergency in perpetuity. \n28.  The NEA provides: “with respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, \nduring the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is \nauthorized to declare such national emergency.” 50 U.S.C. § 1621. \n29.  The NEA does not define the term “emergency,” so it is construed “in accordance \nwith [its] ordinary meaning.’” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369, 376 (2013). In 1976, \n“emergency” was understood, as it is today, as an unforeseen combination of circumstances that \ncalls for immediate action.  \n30.  The NEA further provides that when the President declares the emergency, he \nmust specify which statutes authorize the acts he proposes to address it: “When the President \ndeclares a national emergency, no powers or authorities made available by statute for use in the \nevent of an emergency shall be exercised unless and until the President specifies the provisions \nof law under which he proposes that he, or other officers will act.” 50 U.S.C. § 1631. \n31.  The NEA thus permits the President to direct the use of certain resources, but only \nin a qualifying emergency and only in the manner and to the extent that Congress has previously \nauthorized by statute. While the NEA gives the President broad authority to declare an \nemergency, it does not permit the President to do so when no emergency exists, or to fabricate an \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 11 of 39\nimproper or pretextual basis for the declaration. And even under a proper declaration of \nemergency, the NEA does not give the President the power to do anything he wants.  \n32.  The statute’s legislative history makes clear that the NEA was intended to ensure \nthat “the extraordinary powers which now reside in the hands of the Chief Executive . . . could \nbe utilized only when emergencies actually exist”; that “[r]eliance on emergency authority, \nintended for use in crisis situations would no longer be available in non-crisis situations”; and \nthat “the United States travels a road marked by carefully constructed legal safeguards.”5 Senator \nCharles Mathias, Republican from Maryland and one of the Act’s co-sponsors, called it a \n“safeguard” against abuses of presidential power.   \nC.  The Specific Statutes and Authorities Invoked in the Proclamation \n33.  The Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement invoke 10 U.S.C. § \n2808(a), which permits certain military construction activities during national emergencies; 10 \nU.S.C. § 284, which allows specified counterdrug activities for the Department of Defense; and \nthe Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which is governed by 31 U.S.C. § 9705.  These \nstatutes do not permit the President to override specific congressional appropriations for \nconstruction at the southern border or specific authorizations for the use of the United States \nmilitary, either by their plain language or under the constitutional separation of powers.  \n  1.  10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) \n34.  Article I enumerates congressional powers over the military and national defense. \nCongress has the power to make and limit military appropriations, raise and support armies, \nprovide for and maintain a navy, declare war, and provide for organizing and calling forth the \nnational guard. And Congress has taken specific action to enforce its powers to oversee the \nmilitary, exercising extensive oversight and spending authority over military construction \n                                                \n5 S. Rep. No. 94-1168, at 291 (1976), available at https://bit.ly/2UYaRvb. \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 12 of 39\nthrough the enactment of the Military Construction Codification Act and the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.  \n35.  The Military Construction Codification Act provides a narrowly cabined \nexception to the requirement of congressional authorization for all military construction projects. \nIt provides that, in the event the President declares war or a national emergency under the NEA \nthat “requires use of the armed forces,” the Secretary of Defense “may undertake military \nconstruction projects . . . not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use \nof the armed forces.” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  \n36.  Under 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a), a President could order military construction to \nsupport the use of U.S. troops that were deployed to respond to a national emergency of a kind \nrequiring use of the armed forces. But the statute vests the authority to make the determination \nof whether the national emergency “requires use of the armed forces” in the Secretary of \nDefense, not the President. See 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a) (authorizing the Secretary of Defense to take \ncertain actions “in the event of” a national emergency “that requires use of the armed forces”). A \nPresident’s attempt to make this determination in place of the Secretary of Defense is therefore \nwithout force or effect. And any determination by the Secretary of Defense that “use of the \narmed forces” is “require[d]” must be made consistent with the APA. \n37.  Even if a President had authority to determine that the use of the Armed Forces is \nrequired and could thereby unilaterally invoke the powers created by section 2808, any \ninvocation of the statute must be consistent with the statute’s terms.  The statute authorizes a \nconstruction project “necessary to support . . . use of the armed forces,” 10 U.S.C. § 2808(a).  It \ndoes not authorize deploying the armed forces for purposes of engaging in a domestic, non-\nmilitary construction project.  A non-military construction project does not become an authorized \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 13 of 39\nexercise of the statute simply by deploying troops to do the work—that approach would turn the \nstatute on its head.  \n38.  In addition, the statute defines “military construction” in subsection (a) of 10 \nU.S.C. § 2801 as a project “carried out with respect to a military installation.” And “military \ninstallation” refers to “a base, camp, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the \nSecretary of a military department.” \n39.  Decades of experience demonstrate the meaning of “military installation” for the \npurposes of 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  Presidents have twice invoked military construction authority \npursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 2808 and the NEA. President George H.W. Bush invoked the pair of \nstatutes during Operation Desert Shield, and President George W. Bush invoked them in the \naftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, “from 2001 through 2014, the [Department of Defense] funded a total of 18 \nprojects under 10 U.S.C. § 2808, after the President invoked the NEA, with a combined value of \n$1.4 billion. With the exception of one project dating from December 2001 related to security \nmeasures for weapons of mass destruction at sites in the continental United States, most of the \nprojects took place at overseas locations.”6 Military construction projects funded under the NEA \nhave included, inter alia, barracks and airport runways in Afghanistan and courthouse security at \nthe U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay.  \n  2.  10 U.S.C. § 284 \n40.  Congress authorized and funded the Department of Defense to support certain \ncounterdrug activities under 10 U.S.C. § 284. Within limits, one type of support enumerated in \n                                                \n6 Michael J. Vassalotti & Brendan W. McGarry, Military Construction Funding in the Event of a \nNational Emergency, Congressional Research Service (Jan. 11, 2019), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2Ipi3zi.  \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 14 of 39\nsection 284 is “[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug \nsmuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.” 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). \n41.  In enacting 10 U.S.C. § 284, Congress authorized the Defense Secretary only “to \nprovide support” for the counterdrug activities of other agencies, not to undertake a major \nconstruction project (emphasis added). The plain language of the statute makes that clear. \nSubsection (h)(1)(B) requires the Defense Secretary to give Congress fifteen-days’ written notice \nbefore providing such support, including “a description of any small scale construction project \nfor which support is provided” (emphasis added). The statute defines “small scale construction” \nas “construction at a cost not to exceed $750,000 for any project.” Congress would not have \nrequired a description of “any small scale construction” projects if it was, at the same time, \nauthorizing support for $2.5 billion of fences. Cf. Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc., 531 \nU.S. 457, 468 (2001) (“Congress . . . does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”). \n42.  The scale of the “[c]onstruction of road and fences . . . to block drug smuggling \ncorridors across international boundaries” authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 284 must also be \nunderstood relative to the scale of the other types of “support” authorized by the statute. Those \ninclude providing maintenance and repair of equipment, transporting personnel, and \n“establish[ing] (including an unspecified minor military construction project) and operat[ing] \nbases of operations or training facilities for the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities.” 10 \nU.S.C. § 284(b)(4) (emphasis added). None of these are on the scale of constructing a multi-\nbillion-dollar border wall. \n43.  Furthermore, the entirety of the 1,954-mile southern border does not constitute a \n“drug smuggling corridor” under 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7). The term “corridor” refers to a \npassageway. At most, section 284(b)(7) allows support for up to $750,000 of fencing along \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 15 of 39\nspecific passageways across which drug smuggling is known to occur, not an extensive barrier \nalong the international border. \n  3.  The Treasury Department’s Forfeiture Fund \n44.  The President has announced that up to $601 million will be drawn from the \nDepartment of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to fund the border wall.  \n45.  Congress, however, placed clear restrictions on the use of that Fund. Those \nrestrictions are found in 31 U.S.C. § 9705. There, Congress expressly limited the Secretary of \nTreasury’s use of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to specific purposes, including maintaining the \nfund itself, paying overtime and salaries of law enforcement officers, paying informants, and \nupgrading law enforcement vehicles. \n46.  Construction projects are not among the authorized uses of the Treasury \nForfeiture Fund. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  After extensive debate, Congress has enacted, and the President has signed into law, \nappropriations for a limited amount of funding for border construction. \n \n47.  Since at least 1996, Congress has exercised its legislative authority with respect to \nissues surrounding the southern border and, more specifically, has limited the funding and \nconstruction of fencing along the border. \n48.  In 1996, for example, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) (Pub. L. 104-208, div. C), section 102 of which \nauthorized no more than $12 million for construction of fencing and road improvements near the \nSan Diego, CA border. IIRIRA Section 102(b)(4) also sets out express limitations on mileage, \nstating that “the Attorney General shall provide for the construction along the 14 miles of the \ninternational land border of the United States, starting at the Pacific Ocean and extending \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 16 of 39\neastward, of second and third fences, in addition to the existing reinforced fence, and for roads \nbetween the fences.” (emphasis added). \n49.  In 2006, Congress amended Section 102(b) of IIRIRA (Pub. L. 104 208; 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1103) to mandate fencing in specific and geographically-defined places. For example, \nCongress mandated fencing extending only 10 miles west and 10 miles east of the Tecate, CA \nport of entry; 10 miles west of the Calexico, CA port of entry and five miles east of the Douglas, \nAZ port of entry; five miles west of the Columbus, NM port of entry and 10 miles east of the El \nPaso, TX port of entry; five miles northwest of the Del Rio, TX port of entry and five miles \nsoutheast of the Eagle Pass, TX port of entry; and 15 miles northwest of the Laredo, TX port of \nentry to the Brownsville, TX port of entry.7 \n50.  In 2007, Congress passed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct of 2007 (H.R. 5441), appropriating $1,187,565,000 “for customs and border protection \nfencing, infrastructure, and technology.” \n51.  In 2008, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (Pub. L. \n110-161, div. E), appropriating $1,225,000,000 for customs and border protection fencing, \ninfrastructure, and technology, and directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to “construct \nreinforced fencing” only “where fencing would be most practical and effective.” \n52.  In 2018, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1625), \nagain expressly setting limits as to both money and miles. Section 230 of this Act limited border \nfunding to $1,571,000,000, for “[p]rocurement, [c]onstruction and [i]mprovements” along the \nsouthern border, to be distributed in specific amounts for specific projects at specific locations.  \n53.  Congress rejected numerous other proposed pieces of legislation for more funding \nfor a border wall.  \n                                                \n7 Secure Fence Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-367, §3 (2006).  \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 17 of 39\n54.  In early 2019, the President asked Congress to appropriate $5.7 billion for \nconstructing border barriers.  He also asked Congress to approve border barrier construction in \nany location and using any design.  Congress considered these proposals in the “End the \nShutdown and Secure the Border Act” (Senate Amendment 5 to H.R. 268), but the Senate \nrejected them.   \n55.  Instead, Congress enacted the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.J. Res. \n31) which provides $1.375 billion for “the construction of primary pedestrian fencing, including \nlevee pedestrian fencing, in the Rio Grande Valley Sector,” per Section 230. The Act does not \nprovide any funding for fencing in or within hundreds of miles of El Paso, Texas.  The Act also \nrestricts the fencing to that which uses a previously developed design, prohibits construction of \nfencing within several wildlife areas along the southern border, requires DHS and local officials \nto reach mutual agreement about the design and alignment of physical barriers within each \nborder city, and provides for a notice and comment period.  \n56.  President Trump signed this bill into law on February 15, 2019. \nB.  After signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the President issued a \nProclamation and Statement declaring an emergency and directing the government \nto spend additional funds on border fencing. \n \n57.  On the same day the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, \nFebruary 15, 2019, he also issued the Proclamation along with an accompanying White House \nStatement setting forth the authority under which he purported to act. The Proclamation seeks to \ndeclare a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act and to direct federal agencies \nto take action at the southern border under certain specified statutes. The White House Statement \nissued with the Proclamation further states that $6.7 billion additional funds “will be available to \nbuild the border wall” upon declaration of an emergency. This includes $601 million from the \nTreasury Forfeiture Fund; up to $2.5 billion under the Department of Defense funds transferred \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 18 of 39\nfrom Support for Counterdrug Activities (10 U.S.C. § 284); and up to $3.6 billion reallocated \nfrom Department of Defense military construction projects under the President’s declaration of a \nnational emergency (10 U.S.C. § 2808).  The White House Statement indicates that “[n]ew \nprojects could include: new levee wall, new and replacement primary pedestrian barrier, new \nvehicle-to-pedestrian barrier, and new secondary barrier.”8 \n58.  The Proclamation does not acknowledge the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations \nAct the President signed the very same day he issued the Proclamation.  Nor does it acknowledge \nother specific Acts of Congress, set forth above, which govern construction of border fencing.   \nC.  The Proclamation does not meet the NEA’s definition of “emergency.” \n \n59.  As set forth above, the NEA permits the President to act in unforeseen situations \nthat need action so immediate that only the President is capable of ordering it. That is the \nopposite of what the President has done here. \n60.  As alleged, supra, Congress has acted repeatedly to make policy and to \nappropriate funds for construction on the southern border over a sustained period of time. And \nthe President has repeatedly acknowledged that the situation at the border is not unforeseen and \nthat he was not compelled to act with immediacy to respond to it. \n61.  The President and Congress have disagreed over how to address immigration and \ndrug enforcement issues at the southern border for the entirety of the President’s time in office.  \nPresident Trump campaigned on the promise of building a wall along the length of the southern \nborder that Mexico would pay for. During the first two years of his presidency, after it became \nclear that Mexico would not be paying for the promised border wall, Congress declined to grant \n                                                \n8 Statement, White House, President Donald J. Trump’s Border Security Victory (Feb. 15, \n2019), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trumps-border-\nsecurity-victory/. \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 19 of 39\nthe President’s full requests for funding for new border barriers, notwithstanding that the \nPresident’s party controlled both chambers of Congress.  \n62.  For fiscal year 2017, Congress voted to appropriate $341 million to DHS to \nreplace existing barriers on the southern border.9 For fiscal year 2018, Congress voted to \nappropriate $1.57 billion to build or replace fencing on the southern border.10  \n63.  The disagreement came to a head prior to the 2018 midterm elections and \nescalated after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives (but before the new, \nDemocratic-controlled House, was sworn in). As part of his proposed 2019 budget for DHS, \nPresident Trump twice requested that Congress appropriate $1.6 billion for the construction of 65 \nmiles of new border wall.11 Congress three times rejected that request: twice before the 2018 \nmidterm elections, when both houses of Congress were controlled by Republicans, and once \nafter, when Democrats won control of the House of Representatives.  \n64.  There was no absence of action by Congress on border security policy.  There was \nno absence of action by Congress on funding for border fences.  And there was no lack of time \nfor Congress to act. \n65.  In December 2018 and January 2019, the President refused to sign a budget \nresolution that did not contain funding for construction of a border wall, resulting in a 35-day \npartial government shutdown.  The shutdown ended when the President agreed to sign a three-\nweek continuing resolution with $1.6 billion in appropriations for border security, but no funds \nfor new border wall construction.   \n                                                \n9 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub.

No. 115-141, H.R. 1625—269 (2018). \n11 See, e.g., Office of Mgmt. & Budget, An American Budget: Budget of the U.S. Government—\nFiscal Year 2019 (Feb. 12, 2018), available at https://bit.ly/2nTPE7s.  \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 20 of 39\n66.  On January 4, 2019, in the midst of the budget standoff, the President began \nthreatening to reframe his policy dispute with Congress as an “emergency.” On that day, the \nPresident asserted that if Congress did not give him the border wall funding he wanted, he would \ndeclare a national emergency as an alternative. He called the Proclamation “another way of \ndoing it” if he could not achieve his agenda through “a negotiated process”: “We can call a \nnational emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven’t \ndone it. I may do it. I may do it, but we could call a national emergency and build [the wall] very \nquickly, and it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re \ngiving that a shot.”   \n67.  Thereafter, on multiple occasions over the ensuing six weeks, the President \npublicly asserted that a he had the power to declare an emergency.  But he acknowledged both in \nhis words and his actions that there was no immediate need to declare one, saying at various \ntimes that he would not do it “right now,” or “so fast.” Instead, the President characterized his \nclaimed emergency power as a backup plan “if I can’t make a deal with people [in Congress] that \nare unreasonable.” This posture stands in direct contradiction with the purpose of the NEA, \nwhich is to empower the President to act when, because of the unforeseen nature of the \nemergency, Congress lacks the time to do so.  \n68.  Following a series of warnings over several weeks, the President finally declared \nan emergency at the southern border after signing the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which \nlimited appropriations for border fencing to a lower amount and fewer miles than he wanted for \nconstruction of a border wall. During his announcement of his Proclamation declaring an \nemergency, and after recounting his disagreement with Congress over funding for a border wall, \nthe President said that “I didn’t need to do this.”   \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 21 of 39\n69.  The President’s Proclamation marks the first time a President has used the NEA \nto contravene the clearly expressed will of Congress on a policy and appropriations matter.  \n70.  The President’s Proclamation states that the “emergency” at the southern border  \nderives from the fact that the southern border is “a major entry point for criminals, gang \nmembers, and illicit narcotics.”  But this problem is not new, and in fact, most illegal drugs enter \nthe country through legal ports of entry.12  The President also cites “the problem of large-scale \nunlawful migration through the southern border,” but acknowledges that it is “long-standing.”  \nIndeed, illegal crossings at the southern border have declined dramatically over time.  He also \ncites a “sharp increases in the number of family units entering and seeking entry to the \nUnited States and an inability to provide detention space for many of these aliens while their \nremoval proceedings are pending.”  However, most migrants come to the border to present \nthemselves for asylum, which they have a legal right to do under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).  The \nProclamation is thus based on false factual predicates. \n71.  In addition, there is nothing unforeseen about the “emergency” the President’s \nProclamation describes at the southern border. Even if it were true, there is nothing unforeseen \nabout the border being a “major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics.” \nMoreover, the Proclamation describes “unlawful migration” as a “long-standing” problem.  \n72.  A President’s wish for more money to build a border wall, based on decades-old \nissues, does not meet the definition of an emergency. And construction, in whatever form, is not \nan “immediate” solution to the longstanding “emergency” the President has discussed since he \nannounced his candidacy in 2015.  \n                                                \n12 Alan Gomez, Fact-Checking Trump Officials: Most Drugs Enter US Through Legal Ports of \nEntry, Not Vast, Open Border, USA TODAY (Jan. 16, 2019), https://bit.ly/2GUa0I5. \n \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 22 of 39\n73.  Furthermore, an “emergency” is not something that is addressed after a purposeful \nweeks-long delay.  \n74.  The President issued his Proclamation six weeks after first suggesting that he \ncould use a national emergency for funding that Congress decided to withhold. During that time, \nCongress voted multiple times not to fund a border wall. \n75.  President Trump’s treatment of an emergency Proclamation as a back-up plan to \nbe invoked only if Congress rejected his policy proposal, along with his usurpation of Congress’s \nrole on an appropriations issue, establish that the President’s Proclamation does not address an \n“emergency” within the meaning of the NEA and that this Court should enjoin its \nimplementation.  \nD.  The Proclamation directs activities that are not authorized by the statutes it invokes. \n \n76.  Even if the Proclamation did lawfully invoke the NEA, the statutes and authorities \ncited in the Proclamation and White House Statement do not permit construction of a border \nwall.   \n77.  The principal funding statute cited in the Proclamation is 10 U.S.C. § 2808.  But \nthis statute does not permit the President to fund border-barrier construction that Congress has \nnot authorized.  To begin, because the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, like the 2018 Act, \nspecifically addresses border fencing, section 2808 simply does not apply. \n78.  Moreover, section 2808 does not authorize border-barrier construction even if \nthere were a bona fide emergency.  As set forth above, in the event of a declaration of an \nemergency that (1) “requires use of the armed forces,” this statute permits the Secretary of \nDefense to (2) “undertake military construction projects . . . that are necessary to support such \nuse of the armed forces.” \n22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 23 of 39\n79.  The Proclamation does not satisfy either of these two statutory requirements for \ninvoking section 2808.  First, the Proclamation itself counters the claim that an emergency \n“requires use of the armed forces.”  The Proclamation describes criminal law and humanitarian \nchallenges, as well as long-standing civilian problems on the border—but does not articulate any \nsituation that requires the use of the armed forces. \n80.  Second, the construction of a border wall does not qualify as “military \nconstruction” as defined by subsection (a) of 10 U.S.C. § 2801, which describes “military \nconstruction” as a project “carried out with respect to a military installation.” And in subsection \n(c)(4), “military installation” refers to “a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity \nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.”  But “[a] border wall, by \ncontrast, is a civilian structure to be manned by civilian authorities to perform a civilian mission. \nThe troops would not be creating a military fortification for military use.”13   \n81.  The non-military nature of this construction project is reinforced by two decades \nof experience. Since 1996, hundreds of miles of southern border barriers have been built without \nany use of the armed forces. Likewise, policing the southern border has been the function of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and prior to that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nnot the military.14  \n82.  Beyond that, the construction of a border wall is not (in the language of section \n2808) “necessary to support [the required] use of the armed forces.”  The Proclamation turns the \nstatute on its head, seeking to mobilize the armed forces to engage in a civilian construction \n                                                \n13 David French, Trump’s Emergency Declaration Is Contemptuous of the Rule of Law, \nNATIONAL REVIEW (Feb. 15, 2019), https://bit.ly/2TWwY56.   \n14 Federation for American Immigration Reform, The Current State of the Border Fence, (Jan. \n2017), https://www.fairus.org/issue/national-security/current-state-border-fence.  \n23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 24 of 39\nproject; not to engage in a construction project necessary to support the mobilization of the \narmed forces. \n83.  Section 284 also does not permit using the funds Congress has designated for \ncounterdrug programs for border-barrier construction.  As explained above, this statute only \nallows DOD to provide support for designated small-scale construction projects—not to fund its \nown large-scale construction.   \n84.  The Treasury Forfeiture Fund, invoked in the White House Statement, also cannot \nbe used to fund barrier construction at the border.  The statute governing the Fund articulates \ncertain lawful purposes—but construction is not one of them. 31 U.S.C. § 9705. \nE.  The Issuance of the Proclamation Injures Plaintiffs El Paso County and the BNHR. \n \n85.  The President’s Proclamation, through its declaration of an emergency on the \nborder and invocation of statutes allowing military mobilization, causes immediate and concrete \ninjury to border communities, including Plaintiffs.   \n86.  During the latter half of the Twentieth Century, El Paso County, anchored by the \nCity of El Paso, grew as a population and economic center. In addition to housing Fort Bliss, it \nwas a center for copper mining, oil refining, and the garment industry. In the 1990s, the economy \nof the region underwent a significant shift with the signing of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Lower-wage manufacturing labor across the border displaced low-wage \nmanufacturing, such as textiles, in El Paso County. El Paso County’s services industry grew in \nits place. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas El Paso Branch, “The growth of the \nservice sector . . . more than offset the decline in manufacturing employment.”15  \n                                                \n15 Jesus Cañas, A Decade of Change: El Paso’s Economic Transition of the 1990s, EL PASO \nBUSINESS FRONTIER (2002), https://bit.ly/2BLqhMh. \n24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 25 of 39\n87.  El Paso County and the City within it emphasize tourism as a local economic \ndriver and have various programs for the explicit purpose of attracting visitors to El Paso.  Since \n2016, the County has invested $1,137,582 in tourist promotion, which includes promoting the \nhistoric Mission Trail. For that same time period, El Paso County has also spent $13,003,405 in \noperating the El Paso Coliseum, which, located approximately half a mile from the border, draws \nvisitors from all over the country for various entertainment acts. The results of the County’s \npromotion of tourism have been impressive. The number of people visiting El Paso has steadily \nincreased since 2014.16  This has led to an increase in the number of jobs in the region dedicated \nto the travel and hospitality industries, as well as increases in government revenues stemming \nfrom tourism. \n88.  The Rio Grande Council of Governments (“RGCOG”), which is an association of \nlocal governments established under state law that includes El Paso County, has recognized that: \n“The travel industry makes a substantial contribution to local government tax revenue across the \n[West] Texas counties. Local tax revenue is collected by counties and municipalities, as levied \non applicable travel-related businesses and includes the transient lodging and local sales taxes. \nThe economic impact of tourism in most [West] Texas Counties has increased consistently from \n2010 to 2015.”17  This increase includes El Paso County. \n89.  A central driver of El Paso County’s success has been the remarkable safety of the \ncommunity, and just as importantly, the national perception of El Paso County and its environs \nas a safe destination to live, work, and travel. The City of El Paso, located within El Paso \nCounty, has been recognized as one of the top 10 safest cities in the country for two consecutive \n                                                \n16 Michael Ikahihifo, Tourism in El Paso Is on the Rise, KFOX14 (Apr. 12, 2018), \nhttps://bit.ly/2GC2PVB.  \n17 Rio Grande Council of Governments, West Texas Economic Development District: 2016-2020 \nComprehensive Economic Development Strategy (Jan. 27. 2017), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2NiIeWX.  \n25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 26 of 39\nyears based on its low rates of violent crime and property crime.18 El Paso’s murder rate is \napproximately half that of the national average19 and much lower than that of other major \ncities.20  \n90.  Although the President has claimed that El Paso’s crime rate dropped when \nborder barriers were constructed in El Paso, that is not true. Violent crime in the City of El Paso \nhas fallen steadily since the mid-90s, mirroring crime trends around the country. Even while this \ntrend has been national, El Paso’s crime rates have been substantially lower than other areas its \nsize.21    \n91.  These conditions have not just allowed for growth in tourism and revenue in \nrecent years in El Paso County; they are the foundation upon which El Paso County has already \nplanned for future growth. In 2017, the RGCOG’s Board of Directors, which also serves as the \nWest Texas Economic Development District (“WTEDD”), updated the 2016-2020 \nComprehensive Economic Development Strategy (“CEDS”) for the WTEDD. This Strategy lays \nout El Paso County’s economic development plans for the next several years and informs County \ndecision-making and local economic planning. It projects that the region “will become a \npreferred area for businesses creation and relocation looking for,” among other things, “[h]igh \nquality of life for new and existing residents.”22 It bases this projection, in part, on an assessment \nthat one of the “strengths” of the region is “[a]mple availability of land at affordable prices,” and \nthat an “opportunity” for the region is the “[i]ncrease[d] awareness of the region’s strong \n                                                \n18 Press Release, City of El Paso, City of El Paso Named Second Safest City in America (Aug. \n2017), available at https://bit.ly/2TZkGsX.  \n19 Jane C.

Prior to issuance of the Proclamation, President Trump’s messages about El Paso \nwere mixed.  Most dominantly, he has repeatedly warned of the crisis levels of drugs, gang \nviolence, and crime taking place in border communities like El Paso. Yet he also has said that \nwhile El Paso was once one of the most dangerous places in the country, it is “one of America's \nsafest cities now.”25  He attributed that supposed change to the construction of border barriers \nwithin El Paso, but that is not true. El Paso was a low-crime area even before sections of wall \nwere added in the 2000s.  When El Pasoans attempted to fact check the President’s misleading \nclaims about their region by pointing out that El Paso has long been one of the safest places in \nAmerica, the President responded by accusing El Paso of trying to doctor crime data, saying at a \nFebruary 11, 2019 political rally in El Paso: “they’re full of crap.”26  \n93.  The President then superseded this dispute with his emergency Proclamation, \nwhich described the southern border where both El Paso County and the Border Network for \nHuman Rights are located as the site of a “humanitarian crisis that threatens core national \nsecurity interests and constitutes a national emergency.”27 He went on to use the full force of the \nfederal government to officially declare that “[t]he southern border is a major entry point for \ncriminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics,” and, contrary to his statements at the El Paso \n                                                \n23 Id.  \n24 Id. \n25 President Donald J. Trump, State of the Union Address (Feb. 5, 2019), available \nat https://bit.ly/2BmeYdo. \n26 Justin Wise, Trump: People Saying Wall Hasn't Made Difference in El Paso Are ‘Full of \nCrap’, THE HILL (Feb. 11, 2019), https://bit.ly/2SJydar. \n27 Proclamation, supra note 1.  \n27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 28 of 39\nrally, that “the situation has worsened in certain respects in recent years.” The White House \nissued a Statement calling the area “highly dangerous.”28 The President declared that the \nsituation at the border where plaintiffs are located is so bad that it requires a militarization effort \nand the deployment of the Armed Forces.  \n94.  The President’s Proclamation and the activity it directs by its very issuance create \nthe negative perception the County has sought to counter. In particular, the Proclamation is an \nofficial government statement that the southern border is the site of crisis levels of crime and low \nquality of life.   \n95.  The President’s re-appropriation of billions of dollars of funds to militarize the \nregion sends an immediate message to businesses or travelers thinking of spending time or \nmoney in El Paso County that it will be a far less attractive place to work, visit, or live.  \n96.  Because the President’s Proclamation has, by its very signing, materialized the \nweaknesses and threats identified by El Paso County as to what would derail future economic \ngrowth in its strategic economic plan for 2016-2020, the County must now repurpose resources \nto respond to the President’s action, plan for revenue changes, and devote resources that would \nhave gone to other activities and services for its residents to this planning and the actions it \nrequires. County officials have already devoted significant amounts of human resource hours to \nplanning a response to the Proclamation and its effects on the County’s residents and economy. \n97.  In addition, Plaintiff El Paso County is injured by the Proclamation’s frustration \nof the County’s national campaign to promote El Paso’s history and culture and its ongoing \nefforts to attract visitors to the County who will spend money and engage in commerce. People \nall over the country are deterred from coming to El Paso County by the presidential designation \nof a national emergency there.  \n                                                \n28 White House Statement, supra note 3. \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 29 of 39\n98.  Plaintiff El Paso County is further injured by the Proclamation’s mandate for \nconstruction and the deployment of troops to the border. El Paso County relies on its geographic \nlocation, local history, environment, and natural beauty to attract development. El Paso County’s \nresources and development efforts are harmed by disruptive construction, seizure of private \nproperty, noise and air pollution, and the blocking of aesthetic views of the local scenery.  \n99.  These collective harms, including reputational harm to El Paso County, result in a \ndecline in revenue for the County, causing damage to the County fisc. \n100.  During the period in which El Paso County was experiencing both a decline in \ncrime and growth in economic activity and population, various community organizations were \ncentral players in the region’s turnaround. One of those organizations is Plaintiff Border Network \nfor Human Rights.  \n101.  Plaintiff BNHR provides a variety of services and programs for families living \nnear the southern border. These services include working with the community and local and \nfederal law enforcement to promote public safety, informing residents of their civil rights, and \nconducting campaigns to integrate residents of El Paso and neighboring communities into city \ngovernment, public safety departments, and the local economy.  BNHR has devoted and \ncontinues to devote substantial resources to advocacy opposing additional construction of border \nbarriers and militarization of the border in order to protect the interests of BNHR as an \norganization and of its members.   \n102.  The Proclamation’s mandate for construction and the deployment of troops to the \nborder injures BNHR in at least three ways.  First, it has forced BNHR to divert organizational \nresources from its normal programming to respond to the President’s Proclamation. In the \naftermath of the President’s Proclamation, BNHR has been forced to spend resources responding \nto the consequences of the Proclamation, including counseling and responding to concerns from \n29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 30 of 39\nmembers about the effects of the Proclamation on their well-being, their property and rights, and \ntheir opportunities to engage in public advocacy to mitigate the damage to BNHR members.  In \naddition, BNHR is shifting and spending resources to recruit and train attorneys to handle the \nincrease in incoming complaints and concerns that the Proclamation is generating among its \nmembers. The demand for these resources is causing BNHR to divert resources from two \nprograms that are central to its mission.  One is BNHR’s immigration reform advocacy \ncampaign.  The other is BNHR’s annual Hugs Not Walls event, which aims to build trust \nbetween the community and law enforcement, including border patrol. For years, border patrol \ngranted BNHR a permit to reunite families—for a day—along the Rio Grande canal. Due to the \nProclamation and the diversion in resources it is requiring, BNHR has been forced to cancel the \nevent for 2019. The Proclamation, therefore, has caused the waste of both human and monetary \nresources that BNHR spent in preparation for upcoming Hugs Not Walls events. \n103.  Second, the Proclamation’s mandate for construction and the deployment of \ntroops to the border injures BNHR’s organizational mission.  As alleged above, the Proclamation \nis impairing BNHR’s key programs of immigration reform advocacy and initiatives to build trust \nand engagement between law enforcement and community members.  The Proclamation has \nstigmatized BNHR’s community members, reducing their ability and willingness to cooperate \nwith local and federal law enforcement.  This stigmatization frustrates BNHR’s mission and \ncampaigns, and increases the public safety risk for its members.  And the President’s order that \nadditional Armed Forces are necessary at the border is requiring BNHR to prepare and plan for \nhow it will achieve its mission of building trust between its members and law enforcement when \nit now expects an influx of law enforcement and military personnel from outside the community \nwith whom it will need to start its mission-based activities anew. \n30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 31 of 39\n104.  Third, the Proclamation’s mandate for border wall construction and deployment \nof troops harms BNHR’s member families’ quality of life by creating public safety issues and \nhigh levels of noise and other forms of pollution from military and construction activity.  The \nProclamation and wall construction also impair BNHR members’ ability to enjoy the natural \nenvironment in which they have made their homes.  And lastly, the Proclamation and \naccompanying White House Statement in intent and effect have stigmatized immigrant \ncommunities, heightening racial tensions and causing fear among BNHR’s member families. The \nPresident’s Proclamation and pledge to militarize the area because of threats he claims are \ncaused by immigrants at the border have caused BNHR’s member families to suffer.  They \nreasonably fear race-based violence towards them as a result of the false claims on which the \nProclamation is based.  They also reasonably fear an influx of law enforcement with whom they \nhave not built up the levels of trust that BNHR has worked for years to cultivate in the El Paso \ncommunity. The President's Proclamation will thus put BNHR’s member families at greater risk \nof rights violations. As a result of all of this, they fear increased public safety risks for children \nand for the community, which they must takes steps now to mitigate unless and until the \nPresident’s unlawful action is stopped.       \n105.  For at least these reasons, the Proclamation has caused immediate and concrete \ninjury to El Paso County and to BNHR. That injury would be remedied by a declaration from \nthis Court that the President’s Proclamation is unlawful and by an order from this Court \nenjoining the Proclamation from taking any effect or federal officials from acting upon it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 32 of 39\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Ultra Vires Action in Violation of Federal Funding Statutes, the National Emergencies Act, \n10 U.S.C. § 2808, 10 U.S.C. § 284, and 31 U.S.C. § 9705) \n106.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n107.  Congress has enacted a series of specific statutes that limit the location, type, and \nfunding of additional fencing at the southern border. In particular, Congress enacted and the \nPresident signed into law the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which specifically limited \nthe level and nature of appropriations for border fencing, the location of new fencing, and the \ndesign of new fencing.  The Proclamation and accompanying White House Statement direct \nconstruction of a wall that violates each of these limits on new border fencing appropriations, \nlocations, and design. As such, they are ultra vires. \n108.  The Defendants’ ultra vires invocation of general statutes to override the relevant \nand specific limits in the Consolidated Appropriations Act inflicts ongoing harm upon the \nPlaintiffs. \n109.  The Defendants’ invocation of the NEA to justify spending that Congress refused \nto authorize is also ultra vires.   \n110.  The Defendants’ invocation of 10 U.S.C. § 2808 to undertake military \nconstruction—i.e., a border wall—at the U.S.-Mexico border is ultra vires because it is not a \nconstruction project that supports the use of the armed forces and is it not “military \nconstruction.” \n111.  The White House announced on February 15, 2019, that it would also fund $2.5 \nbillion of additional wall pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 284. But $2.5 billion in funding is not \n“support” under that statute, which permits only support of small-scale construction projects, not \nto exceed $750,000, such as fencing along specific “drug smuggling corridors.” \n32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 33 of 39\n112.  The President also cannot fund $601 million of the border wall from the \nDepartment of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund because 31 U.S.C. § 9705 restricts use of those \nfunds to specified purposes, none of which include construction projects, much less projects for \nwhich there have been appropriations in limited amounts under other statutes. \n113.  The Proclamation is also ultra vires because it exceeds the President’s authority to \ndeclare a national emergency under the NEA.  The NEA provides that “[w]ith respect to Acts of \nCongress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or \nextraordinary power, the President is authorized to declare such national emergency.” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1621(a). An “emergency” must be an unforeseen combination of circumstances that calls for \nimmediate action. The President’s declaration of emergency does not meet this or any other \nreasonable definition. \n114.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to redress unlawful action by the President that \nexceeds his statutory authority. \n115.  Defendants’ ultra vires violation of the NEA and specific and general funding \nstatutes inflicts ongoing harm upon the Plaintiffs. \nCOUNT II \n(Article I, Section 8, Clause 1—Spending Clause) \n116.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n117.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action that \nis ultra vires. \n118.  The Constitution grants to Congress the exclusive power to spend money on \nbehalf of the United States and the exclusive power to enact and pass laws in accordance with \nthe general welfare of the United States.  \n33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 34 of 39\n119.  Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 provides “[t]he Congress shall have Power to lay \nand collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common \nDefence and general Welfare of the United States.” \n120.  President Trump’s Proclamation violates the Spending Clause and is ultra vires \nby misusing the NEA and other statutes to override Congress’s express refusal to pass legislation \nfunding the very physical barrier at the southern border that President Trump now seeks to build. \n121.  Defendants’ violation of the Spending Clause inflicts ongoing harm upon the \nPlaintiffs. \nCOUNT III \n(Article I, Section 9, Clause 7—Appropriations Clause)  \n122.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n123.  Plaintiffs have a right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful official action that \nis ultra vires. \n124.  The Constitution grants to Congress the exclusive power to spend money on \nbehalf of the United States and to designate the purpose for which the money shall be spent. \n125.  Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 provides “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” \n126.  President Trump’s Proclamation violates the Appropriations Clause and is ultra \nvires by misusing the NEA and other statutes to override Congress’s express refusal to pass \nlegislation appropriating funds very physical barrier at the US-Mexico border that President \nTrump now seeks to build. \n127.  Defendants’ violation of the Appropriations Clause inflicts ongoing harm upon \nthe Plaintiffs. \n \n \n \n \n34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 35 of 39\nCOUNT IV \n(Articles I, II, Article III – Separation of Powers) \n128.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n129.  Plaintiffs have a non-statutory right of action to enjoin and declare unlawful \nofficial action that is ultra vires. \n130.  The Spending Clause grants Congress the “Power To lay and collect Taxes . . . to \npay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. \n131.  The Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “No Money \nshall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  \n132.  The Constitution grants the President neither such power, per established \nseparation of powers principles. See, e.g., U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n133.  Defendants have purported to exercise powers that Congress repeatedly and \nspecifically withheld, and in direct transgression of specific limits imposed by validly enacted \nstatutes, thereby violating the constitutional principle of Separation of Powers. \n134.  Defendants’ violation of the Separation of Powers inflicts ongoing harm on the \nPlaintiffs.  \nCOUNT V \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act Through Violations of the Constitution, the \nNEA, 10 U.S.C. § 2808, and Arbitrary and Capricious Action)  \n135.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n136.  The APA requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; “contrary \nto constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C). Defendants have \n35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 36 of 39\nacted contrary to the Spending and Appropriations Clauses of Article I of the United States \nConstitution, the NEA, and the statutes purportedly authorizing action under the Proclamation. \n137.  Further, upon information and belief, in enacting and implementing the \nPresident’s Proclamation, Defendants have acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Among other \narbitrary actions and omissions, Defendants have not explained the rational nexus between \nconstruction of the border wall and any “emergency” conditions that would be remedied \nimmediately. \n138.  Through their actions as described in this Complaint, Defendants have violated \nthe substantive requirements of the APA. Defendants’ violations inflict ongoing harm upon the \nPlaintiffs. \nCOUNT VI \n(The Take Care Clause) \n139.  The foregoing allegations are realleged and incorporated by reference herein. \n140.  The Proclamation violates the President’s constitutional duty to “take Care that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. art. II, § 3, cl. 5.  The Supreme Court has called \nthis duty the President’s “most important constitutional duty.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 577 (1992).   \n141.  This duty of “faithful” execution of the laws imposes on the President a duty to \nact in good faith in his execution of the laws.  That encompasses an obligation to act honestly—\nin good faith—in rendering declarations, determinations, and findings that he may only render \nbecause of a delegation of authority from Congress.    \n142.  The President has not acted in good faith in his declaration that there exists a \nnational emergency of the type described in the NEA.  President Trump has access to \ninformation sources that renders in bad faith his repeated reliance on demonstrably false claims \nto support a declaration of a national emergency and to support other findings or determinations. \n36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00066   Document 1   Filed 02/20/19   Page 37 of 39\n143.  The President has not acted in good faith in rendering his determination that the \npurported national emergency “requires” the use of the military.  President Trump’s public \nstatement that “I didn’t need to” declare a national emergency shows that his purported \ndetermination that the situation at the southern border “requires” use of the armed forces is not \nmade in good faith.  Moreover, by declaring an emergency as an express response to legislation \nenacted by Congress, that specifically limits border fence funding, President Trump has not acted \nin good faith. \n144.  The President’s issuance of the Proclamation in violation of the duty to faithfully \nexecute the laws inflicts ongoing harm on Plaintiffs.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court: \nA.  Declare that the President’s Proclamation of February 15, 2019 is unauthorized by, and \ncontrary to, the Constitution and laws of the United States;  \nB.  Enjoin Defendants from taking any action pursuant to the Proclamation, the NEA, or any \nstatutes cited in the Proclamation or the White House Statement issued February 15, 2019; and \nC.  Award such additional relief as the interests of justice may require. \nDated: February 20, 2019      By: /s/ John C. Padalino                       \nJohn C.
