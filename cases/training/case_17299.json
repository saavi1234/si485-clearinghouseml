    "summary": "<p>A Seattle resident who had been terminated from the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program brought this class action suit on 02/20/2009, alleging that the administration of the Program in Seattle discriminated against residents with disabilities. The named defendants were the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) and the Executive Director of SHA in his official capacity. Colombia Legal Services represented the plaintiff, and the case was assigned to Judge Marsha J. Pechman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.</p><p>The Fourth Amended Complaint alleged that SHA’s Section 8 voucher termination process prior to August 1, 2008 did not meet constitutional standards; SHA discriminated against voucher holders with disabilities by failing to provide them with reasonable accommodations; and SHA discriminated against voucher holders by not permitting them to live with closely related family members. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.), and a collection of state and federal anti-discrimination statutes and their accompanying regulations. They also alleged that the defendants' conduct violated the Fourteenth Amendment's and Washington State Constitution's Due Process Clauses.</p><p>The plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction on March 25, 2010, requesting that her Title 8 voucher be reinstated. On May 13, 2010, after five additional filings from the parties and oral argument, Judge Pechman denied the motion (2010 WL 1945740). She found that it was not clear that the plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits, making preliminary relief inappropriate. </p><p>Over the course of the litigation, Judge Pechman ruled in favor of the plaintiff on three issues. First, on April 22, 2010, she denied defendants' motion to dismiss (2010 WL 1945740). Second, on February 3, 2011, she granted the plaintiff's motion for discovery sanctions (2011 WL 338793). Finally, on April 21, 2011, she granted the plaintiff's motion for a protective order (2011 WL 1561791). She also ruled in favor of the defendants once. The initial complaint had included claims against the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but the court granted summary judgment for the Department on March 29, 2011 (2011 WL 1213168). </p><p>The parties filed a joint motion for a class action settlement on September 8, 2011. The settlement class included all 82 SHA Section 8 voucher holders who had a termination hearing on or after February 20, 2006 and before August 1, 2008, and whose Section 8 vouchers were terminated as a result of the hearing. The settlement had five main terms: </p><p>1) the SHA agreed to make substantive changes and clarifications in its policy regarding individuals with disabilities, </p><p>2) the SHA agreed to amend the list of documents it will accept as proof that a household is a primary residence of a minor, </p><p>3) the SHA agreed to amend its Administrative Plan to provide for discretionary extension of the time individuals may be allowed to remain in a subsidized residence, </p><p>4) addition of requirements that SHA hearing officers include written notice of the availability of judicial review in the termination of Section 8 vouchers, and </p><p>5) the SHA agreed to provide a new termination hearing to each class member who requests one.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to institutional reforms, the settlement awarded $15,000 in relief to named plaintiffs and $180,000 in attorney's fees. </p><p>Judge Pechman issued her final order and judgement granting approval of the class action settlement on January 10, 2012. As part of the settlement, the court dismissed the plaintiff's claims with prejudice while retaining jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement. The Clearinghouse does not know if the court continues to enforce the settlement, but there has been no docket activity since the parties filed a redacted status report on March 11, 2013. </p>",

In \n2  addition, Ms. Wilson seeks to represent a subclass of all disabled people whom the SHA \n3  defendants have terminated from the Section 8 Voucher program in the last six years.  Ms. \n4  Townes seeks to represent a second class of all people whom the SHA defendants have required \n5  or will require to prove that they have legal custody of children living in their homes and all \n6  people who have not been able to add close family members to their households because of \n7  SHA’s policy that bars unmarried, related adults from living together.  The plaintiffs also bring \n8  additional claims against the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development \n9  (HUD) and against Shaun Donovan, HUD Secretary, in his official capacity, pursuant to the \n10  Court’s order granting SHA’s motion to join HUD as a required party pursuant to CR 19(a). \n11    1.2  The defendants, SHA and Thomas Tierney (hereinafter “SHA” or “SHA \n12  defendants”), administer the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program in Seattle Washington, \n13  a federal housing program for extremely low income Seattle residents.  The SHA defendants \n14  have engaged in a pattern and practice of terminating Section 8 Vouchers without providing \n15  Voucher holders with due process of law and without complying with other applicable legal \n16  requirements.  The SHA defendant have failed to provide Section 8 Voucher holders with pre-\n17  termination, informal grievance hearings that meet constitutional, statutory and regulatory \n18  requirements, have intentionally discriminated against Ms. Wilson and other disabled people by \n19  refusing to provide them with reasonable accommodations, have imposed rules and policies that \n20  have a disparate impact upon disabled people, have intentionally discriminated against Ms. \n21  Townes and other voucherholders and public housing tenants who live with children in their \n22  homes or propose to do so, have imposed rules or policies that have a disparate impact upon \n23  families with children, have illegally barred families from living together, and have misled the \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 2  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 3 of 65\n1  plaintiffs and the other members of the plaintiff class regarding their rights to seek and receive \n2  review of the SHA defendants’ decisions to terminate their Section 8 Vouchers.   \n3    1.3  While SHA has its own independent obligations to comply with its constitutional \n4  and legal obligations, to the extent the Court finds that the SHA policies, practices and customs \n5  challenged by plaintiffs’ comply with applicable HUD regulations, those HUD regulations are \n6  unconstitutional.  Under these circumstances, HUD has also violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional \n7  rights to due process of law by promulgating regulations which deprive the plaintiffs’ of a \n8  protected property interest, their Vouchers, without appropriate procedural protections.   \n9    1.4  The plaintiffs ask the Court to certify this matter as a class action lawsuit pursuant \n10  to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) and certify a Voucherholder class and a separate disabled Voucher \n11  holder subclass and a second Assisted Families class as described below.  Ms. Wilson and Ms. \n12  Townes also ask the Court: (a) To declare that the SHA and HUD defendants’ actions have \n13  violated the United States and Washington constitutions, and applicable federal and state laws \n14  and regulations; (b) to enjoin the SHA and HUD defendants from continuing their illegal actions \n15  and to require that the SHA defendants provide informal hearings that comply with applicable \n16  laws to all people terminated from the Section 8 Voucher program within the last six years; (c) to \n17  enjoin SHA from continuing to discriminate against families with children by requiring them to \n18  produce documents of court awarded custody before approving the admission of children to their \n19  households; and (d) to enjoin SHA from refusing to allow unmarried, related adults to live \n20  together.  The plaintiffs also seek an award of monetary damages against the SHA defendants \n21  arising out of the SHA defendants’ unlawful actions and an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees \n22  and costs associated with bringing this action against both the SHA and HUD defendants.     \n23   \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 3  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 4 of 65\n1  II.

FACTS REGARDING SHA’S SECTION 8 VOUCHER PROGRAM \n18  4.1  The Section 8 Voucher program is administered nationally by HUD.   \n19  4.2  HUD contracts with thousands of “public housing authorities” (PHAs) across the \n20  country to run Section 8 Voucher programs in local areas.   \n21    4.3  SHA is the PHA that operates the Section 8 Voucher program in Seattle, \n22  Washington. \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 6  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 7 of 65\n1    4.4  Through its Section 8 Voucher program, SHA pays a share of the rents charged \n2  by private landlords from whom Voucher program participants (hereinafter “Voucher holders” or \n3  “participants”) lease homes. \n4    4.5    SHA receives federal Section 8 funds from the federal government through HUD \n5  from which SHA pays Voucher holders’ private landlords. \n6    4.6  SHA keeps a portion of these federal Section 8 funds for its own purposes as \n7  administrative fees for running the Section 8 Voucher program. \n8    4.7  HUD has issued regulations, policies and procedures related to the Voucher \n9  program, including regulations, policies and procedures related to the grievance process to which \n10  a Voucher holder is entitled prior to termination of that Voucher. \n11    4.8  SHA has issued its own policies and procedures related to the Voucher program \n12  including written policies and procedures related to the Voucher termination grievance process. \n13    4.9  In addition to explicit written, policies and procedures, SHA also has a number of \n14  informal procedures, practices and customs related to its Voucher termination grievance process. \n15    4.10  Individuals and families must meet certain eligibility criteria in order to qualify to \n16  participate in SHA’s Section 8 Voucher program.   \n17    4.11    Most individuals and families who receive Vouchers through SHA earn less than \n18  30% of the area median income when accepted into the program.   \n19    4.12  30% of the median income in Seattle is $25,300 per year for a family of four.   \n20    4.13  Because of their extremely limited incomes, most Section 8 Voucher holders \n21  would be unable to afford to pay rents on the private rental market in Seattle without the federal \n22  Section 8 Voucher rental subsidy. \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 7  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 8 of 65\n1    4.14   Consequently, many Section 8 Voucher holders would be homeless if SHA \n2  terminated their Section 8 Vouchers. \n3    4.15  A Section 8 Voucher holder has a constitutionally protected property interest in \n4  the continued receipt of Section 8 Voucher benefits. \n5    4.16  SHA cannot terminate this constitutionally protected property interest without \n6  providing a Voucher holder pre-termination, procedural due process protections, including \n7  appropriate notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard. \n8    4.17  SHA cannot terminate this constitutionally protected property interest without \n9  having good cause to do so and without proving that such good cause exists. \n10    4.18  SHA cannot interfere with a Voucher holder’s right to seek appropriate, \n11  subsequent review of an adverse informal hearing decision and of SHA’s decision to terminate \n12  this constitutionally protected property interest. \n13    4.19  SHA must provide Voucher holders with accurate and complete written \n14  information regarding their hearing rights or their rights to further review following the informal \n15  hearing while terminating this constitutionally protected property interest.     \n16    4.20  HUD has issued regulations that lay out the permissible bases upon which SHA \n17  may terminate a participant’s Section 8 Voucher.  Those regulations are found at 24 C.F.R. § \n18  982.551-.553.    \n19    4.21  HUD has also issued regulations that lay out some of the steps that the SHA \n20  defendants must follow before they can terminate a participant’s Section 8 Voucher.  Those \n21  regulations are found at 24 C.F.R. § 982.555. \n22 \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 8  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 9 of 65\n1    4.22  SHA has other policies, practices and customs related to the Section 8 Voucher \n2  program and its informal hearing process that are not included or spelled out in its Section 8 \n3  Administrative Plan or in any other written documents. \n4    4.23  Washington state law requires the SHA defendants to operate the Section 8 \n5  Voucher program in compliance with federal statutory and regulatory requirements. See e.g. \n6  RCW 35.82.070(14); 35.82.200. \n7    4.24  Because SHA is a public entity and state actor, it must comply with all procedural \n8  protections required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \n9  States Constitution and to the Due Process Clause of the Washington Constitution before \n10  terminating any participant’s Section 8 Voucher. \n11    4.25  Because HUD is a federal governmental entity, it must provide the plaintiffs with \n12  Due Process of law pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution before the \n13  plaintiffs’ Vouchers may be lawfully terminated. \n14    4.26  The HUD regulations do not explicitly lay out all of the steps and procedural \n15  protections that the SHA defendants must provide before finally terminating a participant’s \n16  Section 8 Voucher. \n17    4.27  Pursuant to the Washington and United States constitutions, federal and state \n18  statutes and federal regulations, prior to terminating a participant’s benefits, the SHA defendants \n19  must provide the participant with an adequate written notice of the basis for the proposed \n20  termination and of the participant’s right to a pre-termination grievance hearing, called an \n21  “informal hearing.” \n22    4.28  The SHA defendants may not terminate a Section 8 Voucher for reasons not \n23  clearly set forth in the written termination notice. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 9  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 10 of 65\n1    4.29  A “hearing officer” presides over the informal hearing.   \n2    4.30  Pursuant to the Washington and United States constitutions, federal and state \n3  statutes and federal regulations, each hearing officer must be impartial.  \n4    4.31  The SHA defendants employ and pay each hearing officer. \n5    4.32  Each hearing officer is either the SHA defendants’ employee or is an independent \n6  contractor with whom the SHA defendants contract to act as a hearing officer. \n7    4.33  If dissatisfied by the hearing officer’s performance, SHA may terminate the \n8  hearing officer’s employment or contract.    \n9    4.34  At all times relevant, each hearing officer was either the SHA defendants’ \n10  employee acting within the scope of his or her employment or was the SHA defendants’ agent \n11  who had the SHA defendants’ apparent and actual authority to act in the manner described \n12  herein. \n13    4.35  Pursuant to the Washington and United States constitutions, federal and state \n14  statutes and federal regulations, the SHA defendants must provide a Voucher holder with an \n15  informal hearing at which the SHA defendants must prove that the proposed termination is “in \n16  accordance with the law, HUD regulations and PHA policies.”  24 C.F.R. § 982.555(a).  \n17    4.36  Pursuant to the Washington and United States constitutions, federal and state \n18  statutes and federal regulations, the SHA defendants must provide a Voucher holder with an \n19  informal hearing at which an impartial hearing officer must determine whether the SHA’s \n20  proposed termination is “in accordance with the law, HUD regulations and PHA policies”, 24 \n21  C.F.R. § 982.555(a), and that the SHA defendants have presented sufficient evidence to meet \n22  their burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 10  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 11 of 65\n1    4.37  If the hearing officer upholds the SHA’s decision to terminate a Voucher \n2  following an informal hearing, the SHA defendants stop making rental payments to the Voucher \n3  holder’s landlord. \n4    4.38  A hearing officer may not uphold a termination based upon reasons not clearly set \n5  forth in the written termination notice. \n6    4.39  A Voucher holder who has her Voucher terminated has the right to seek review of \n7  SHA’s termination decision and of the decision rendered by the hearing officer in state court \n8  pursuant to Washington’s Writ of Review process, set out at RCW 7.16.030-.140.  \n9    4.40  Pursuant to the Washington and United States constitutions, and federal and state \n10  statutes, the SHA defendants must provide each participant with the following procedural \n11  protections as part of the informal hearing process: \n12    (a)  A termination notice that provides accurate and non-misleading information \n13  regarding the Voucher holder’s rights and which clearly sets out the alleged bases to support the \n14  proposed termination;

Those HUD regulations are therefore illegal on their face and as applied under the \n7  circumstances alleged herein.  \n8  4.66  If HUD’s regulations authorize or require the SHA defendants to act illegally as \n9  set out above, then HUD has acted illegally by promulgating regulations that violate applicable \n10  federal anti-discrimination laws.  \n11  4.67  Under these circumstances, HUD has also acted illegally in violation of rights \n12  provided to the plaintiffs and the plaintiff class members under applicable federal anti-\n13  discrimination laws, including the Fair Housing Act of  1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3604; § 504 of the \n14  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \n15  § 1213 by approving SHA’s explicit, written, illegal, and discriminatory policies. \n16  4.68  SHA requires that a voucherholder receive prior permission from SHA before the \n17  voucherholder may add any individual to her household. \n18  4.69  SHA has a policy, custom or practice of requiring any voucherholder who seeks \n19  to add a child to her household to prove that the voucherholder or another existing member of the \n20  household has legal custody of such child. \n21  4.70  SHA has a policy, custom or practice of requiring that voucherholders prove such \n22  legal custody by presenting SHA with legal documents demonstrating that a court has awarded \n23  formal custody to the voucherholder or adult family member. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… -

At this meeting she again informed SHA in person and in writing that her daughter \n14 \nhad gone to live with Mr. Martin. \n15 \n  5.7  At this meeting, SHA personnel told Ms. Townes that they did not believe that \n16 \nMalayshaa had ever lived with Ms. Townes because Ms. Townes had not claimed Malayshaa as \n17 \na dependent for her TANF benefits (which made the amount Ms. Townes received from TANF \n18 \nlower than the amount she would have received if she claimed Malayshaa).   \n19 \n  5.8  SHA personnel stated that Ms. Townes needed to prove that she had “legal \n20 \ncustody” of Malayshaa during the time she had been participating in the SHA Voucher program. \n21 \n  5.9  SHA personnel informed Ms. Townes that if she did not provide this “proof,” she \n22 \nwould be downsized to a 2 bedroom Voucher.   \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 28  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 29 of 65\n1    5.10  On August 31, 2005, Ms. Townes provided SHA with a notarized statement \n2  signed by Mr. Martin that he was returning Malayshaa to Ms. Townes’s care as of August 29, \n3  2005. \n4    5.11  Ms. Townes heard nothing more about this matter until she received a termination \n5  letter dated December 13, 2005 from SHA. \n6    5.12  In its termination letter, SHA alleged that termination was appropriate because \n7  SHA believed that Malayshaa did not actually live with Ms. Townes while she participated in \n8  SHA’s Section 8 Voucher program.  \n9    5.13  In its termination letter, SHA wrote: “Based upon the information received to-\n10  date, SHA continues to believe that your daughter, Malayshaa Townes, has never resided in your \n11  household.” \n12    5.14  SHA refused to accept Ms. Townes’ proof and instead required that she present \n13  them with legal documents demonstrating that a court has granted Ms. Townes’ formal custody \n14  over her daughter Malayshaa Townes. \n15    5.15  SHA terminated Ms. Townes’ voucher because she could not present it with such \n16  proof within the time SHA required. \n17    5.16  Ms. Townes sought and received an informal hearing after receiving this \n18  termination letter. \n19    5.17  Lawrence Weldon, SHA’s hearing officer, conducted the informal hearing. \n20    5.18  At the hearing, SHA presented no direct, credible, probative, non-hearsay \n21  evidence that Malayshaa did not live with Ms. Townes during the Spring and Fall of 2005.   \n22    5.19  Instead, SHA relied upon a printout from the Department of Social and Health \n23  Services indicating that Ms. Townes’s claimed only two dependents for her TANF benefits as its \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 29  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 30 of 65\n1  sole proof that Malayshaa had not lived with Ms. Townes at any time while participating in \n2  SHA’s Voucher program. \n3    5.20  Mr. Weldon made no determination regarding the credibility or probative value of \n4  the hearsay evidence introduced by SHA. \n5    5.21  By contrast, Ms. Townes testified that Malayshaa had lived with her in Seattle \n6  until Malayshaa then went to live with Mr. Martin in June.  Ms. Townes also testified without \n7  contradiction that Malayshaa returned to live with Ms. Townes in August and that Malayshaa \n8  had lived with her since that time. \n9    5.22  Furthermore, Ms. Pamela Gladney, with Seattle King County Public Health, \n10  testified that she had visited Ms. Townes’s home on a number of occasions in 2004 and 2005 and \n11  that Malayshaa had been present in Ms. Townes’s home on each occasion.   \n12    5.23  SHA presented no proof refuting either of these eye witnesses’ testimony.  \n13    5.24  Nonetheless, by written hearing decision, the hearing officer upheld SHA’s \n14  termination of Ms. Townes’s Voucher.  \n15    5.25  The hearing officer did so because he found that Ms. Townes had not complied \n16  with SHA’s policy, custom or practice that required her to present legal documents indicating \n17  that a court has awarded her formal custody of her own daughter. \n18    5.26  He upheld SHA’s termination without finding that, in fact, Malayshaa had not \n19  lived with Ms. Townes during the period in question.   \n20    5.27  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination decision even though Ms. Townes \n21  presented uncontroverted, eye witness evidence from two separate sources that Malayshaa had \n22  lived with her in 2004 and 2005.  Moreover, the hearing officer did not make any finding that \n23  either Ms. Townes’s or Ms. Gladney’s testimony was not credible. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 30  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 31 of 65\n1    5.28  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination decision even though Ms. Townes \n2  presented uncontroverted testimony that she reported to SHA both in writing and by telephone \n3  that Malayshaa had moved to Mr. Martin’s home in June 2005.  \n4    5.29  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination decision even though Ms. Townes \n5  presented uncontroverted testimony that she reported that Malayshaa had moved back in with \n6  Ms. Townes in August 2005. \n7    5.30  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination even though SHA had informed \n8  Ms. Townes that the worst that would happen if she failed to provide proof of legal custody was \n9  that her Voucher would be reduced from a three to a two bedroom Voucher. \n10    5.31  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination decision even though it was clear \n11  from the evidence presented at the informal hearing that SHA should have exercised its \n12  discretion and not terminated Ms. Townes’s Voucher. \n13    5.32  In fact, the hearing officer explicitly found that: “It is clear that the custody of Ms. \n14  Townes’s daughter, Malayshaa, was uncertain from the time of her birth.  It is also reasonable to \n15  assume that the custody issue may have caused some uncertainty regarding Ms. Townes’s \n16  household composition.” \n17    5.33  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination even though it was clear from the \n18  evidence presented that SHA had not met its burden of proof or persuasion. \n19    5.34  The hearing officer upheld SHA’s termination even though the evidence produced \n20  at the hearing provided Ms. Townes with any number of viable defenses, including waiver, \n21  estoppel and arbitrary governmental action. \n22    5.35  The hearing officer’s decision was arbitrary and capricious and unlawful, and the \n23  SHA defendants did nothing to mitigate or overrule it. \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 31  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 32 of 65\n1    5.36  The SHA defendants and their hearing officer failed to properly inform Ms. \n2  Townes of her right to review of the informal hearing decision and how to access such review \n3  when they terminated her from the Section 8 Voucher program. \n4    5.37  In fact, the SHA defendants actually affirmatively misled Ms. Townes regarding \n5  her rights when they informed her in writing in her grievance hearing notice that: “There is no \n6  hearing appeal process available through the Seattle Housing Authority after your hearing has \n7  concluded [sic] Please keep in mind that this is your opportunity to present whatever evidence or \n8  testimony you may have, so please come prepared.” \n9    5.38  In addition, after her informal hearing, Ms. Townes contacted and spoke with an \n10  SHA staff person.  Ms. Townes asked the SHA official what she could do to appeal the adverse \n11  hearing decision.  The SHA official told Ms. Townes that no further review was available or \n12  possible. \n13    5.39  The conduct demonstrated by the hearing officer in Ms. Townes’s case is not an \n14  isolated incident.   \n15    5.40  Until recently, the defendants employed and used Lawrence Weldon as the \n16  hearing officer in the vast majority of informal hearings. \n17    5.41  SHA did not sufficiently train or supervise Mr. Weldon to ensure that he provided \n18  impartial, legally adequate informal hearings and arrived at lawful, supported decisions. \n19    5.42  As a result, many other Section 8 Voucher holders have had their Vouchers \n20  terminated following such constitutionally inadequate hearings overseen by inadequate and non-\n21  impartial hearing officers. \n22 \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… -

FACTS REGARDING THE REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFF  \nMARKELETTA WILSON \n2   \n  6.1  The representative plaintiff, Markeletta Wilson, held a Section 8 Voucher with \n3 \nSHA until the SHA defendants terminated her Voucher by hearing decision dated February 26, \n4 \n2007. \n5 \n  6.2  Ms. Wilson had been a participant in the Voucher program for a number of years \n6 \nprior to her termination.   \n7 \n  6.3  Ms. Wilson used the Section 8 Voucher to subsidize her rent on an apartment that \n8 \nshe and her son, Dewayne Jackson, shared. \n9 \n  6.4  In May 2005, Ms. Wilson filled out a personal declaration form for SHA \n10 \nindicating that she was disabled. \n11 \n6.5  Ms. Wilson suffers from physical disabilities including artery disease and \n12 \nbreathing problems. \n13 \n6.6  Ms. Wilson also suffers from depression.  She has struggled with this mental \n14 \nillness since she was young and was hospitalized for it in the past.  \n15 \n6.7  When Ms. Wilson is depressed, she cries, cannot get out of bed, and struggles to \n16 \nfollow through on tasks.  Her disabilities cause her significant problems with reading and reading \n17 \ncomprehension.    \n18 \n6.8  Ms. Wilson has been treated over the years by a number of mental health \n19 \nspecialists for her depression.  \n20 \n  6.9  Because of her disabilities, Mr. Wilson has found it difficult to hold down gainful \n21 \nemployment in the past or engage in other activities of daily living.  \n22 \n23 \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ FOURTH  \nColumbia Legal Services \nAMENDED COMPLAINT… - 35  101 Yesler Way, #300 \n \nNo. 09-CV-00226-MJP  Seattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386\n               \n \n\n \nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 111   Filed 01/05/11   Page 36 of 65\n1  6.10  Ms. Wilson has received federal and state financial benefits because her \n2  disabilities have rendered her unable to work. \n3  6.11  Ms. Wilson’s depression deepened when her sister-in-law became ill and then \n4  became even more severe following her brother’s death in the Spring of 2005.   \n5  6.12  During this same time period, because of her landlord’s refusal to complete \n6  repairs or pay for landlord-supplied utilities, Ms. Wilson’s living conditions in the apartment she \n7  rented with her Section 8 Voucher deteriorated to the point where her health and safety were in \n8  serious danger.  \n9  6.13  In fact, in December 2006, the City of Seattle condemned the property because of \n10  these hazardous conditions, forcing Ms. Wilson to move from the apartment.   \n11  6.14  Ms. Wilson’s horrid living conditions exacerbated her existing mental and \n12  physical disabilities. \n13    6.15  Ms. Wilson is an individual with a disability or “handicap”; a person living with \n14  one or more physical or mental impairments that substantially limit or have limited at least one \n15  or more major life activities.  \n16    6.16  Ms. Wilson has a record of such physical or mental impairments that substantially \n17  limit one or more major life activities. \n18    6.17  Ms. Wilson is and has been regarded as having such impairments. \n19    6.18  Ms. Wilson is a person with a disability in that she has a sensory, mental, or \n20  physical impairment that: (a) Is medically cognizable or diagnosable;

INTRODUCTION \n6 \n7 \nPlaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, \n8 \n9 \nalleging that Defendants’ practices and procedures violated numerous federal and state statutes \n10 \n11 \nas well as the United States and Washington Constitutions.  The Parties have engaged in \n12 \n13 \nextensive discovery and motions practice.  Currently pending before the Court are cross-motions \n14 \n15 \nfor summary judgment, a motion to certify the class, and a motion for leave to amend the \n16 \n17 \ncomplaint.  Given the risk and cost of continuing the litigation, the Parties engaged in settlement \n18 \n19 \ndiscussions with the Honorable Terrence Carroll (ret.) and, after two days of arms-length \n20 \n21 \nnegotiation, agreed to a settlement.  The Parties have worked diligently to draft the Settlement \n22 \n23 \nAgreement and its exhibits and to develop the content and plan for notice to the Settlement \n24 \n25 \nClass. \n26 \n27 \nII.  BACKGROUND \n28 \n29 \nA.  The Complaint \n30 \n31 \nThe Seattle Housing Authority (“SHA”) administers the Section 8 Voucher Program in \n32 \n33 \nSeattle, a federal program for extremely low-income residents.  Individuals with vouchers find \n34 \n35 \ntheir own housing and pay a percentage of their income for rent.  Section 8 pays the rest of the \n36 \n37 \nrent to the landlord.  SHA has policies and procedures that relate to termination of an \n38 \n39 \nindividual’s Section 8 voucher.  If a voucher holder is accused of noncompliance with the \n40 \n41 \nparticipant obligations or violation of SHA’s rules, the voucher holder is provided with a written \n42 \n43 \ntermination notice and has an opportunity to request an informal hearing in accordance with 24 \n44 \n45 \nC.F.R. § 982.555 (“termination hearing”).  If the voucher holder is not successful at the hearing, \n46 \n47 \nthe voucher is terminated.  The Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that SHA’s Section 8 \n48 \n49 \nvoucher termination process prior to August 1, 2008 did not meet constitutional standards; SHA \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 2 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 3 of 23\n1 \ndiscriminated against disabled voucher holders by failing to provide them with reasonable \n2 \n3 \naccommodations; and SHA discriminated against voucher holders by not permitting them to live \n4 \n5 \nwith closely related family members. \n6 \n7 \n1.    Due Process Claims \n8 \n9 \nPlaintiffs allege that SHA consistently denied due process safeguards during voucher \n10 \n11 \ntermination hearings.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that SHA denied voucher holders their due \n12 \n13 \nprocess rights to have legal arguments and factual evidence considered during termination \n14 \n15 \nhearings and to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that these \n16 \n17 \ndue process violations occurred during a time when SHA hearings were conducted by an \n18 \n19 \nuntrained, inexperienced hearing officer.  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that SHA misled \n20 \n21 \nterminated voucher holders regarding their rights to seek and receive review of SHA’s \n22 \n23 \ntermination decisions.  See, e.g., Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 4.42.  \n24 \n25 \n2.    Disability Claims \n26 \n27 \nPlaintiffs also contend that SHA’s voucher termination policies and practices violated \n28 \n29 \nSHA’s obligation to provide reasonable accommodations under the federal Fair Housing Act and \n30 \n31 \nthe Washington Law Against Discrimination.  Plaintiffs allege that even when notified of the \n32 \n33 \npresence of a disability and the need for an accommodation, SHA regularly failed to take any \n34 \n35 \nsteps to provide such accommodation or engage in an interactive process with the voucher holder \n36 \n37 \nto determine whether an accommodation was required, as mandated by federal and state anti-\n38 \n39 \ndiscrimination laws.  See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 4.42, 4.49-4.64.   \n40 \n41 \n3.    Familial Status Claims \n42 \n43 \nPlaintiffs claim that two of SHA’s policies unlawfully infringe upon voucher holders’ \n44 \n45 \nrights.  First, Plaintiffs allege the policy for adding minors to a voucher uses family status as a \n46 \n47 \nbasis to deny housing, in violation of federal and state anti-discrimination laws.  Second, \n48 \n49 \nPlaintiffs contend that the minor policy and SHA’s no-added-adults policy violate the federal and \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 3 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 4 of 23\n1 \nstate constitutions by interfering with the fundamental right to live with close relatives.  See, e.g., \n2 \n3 \nid. ¶¶ 4.68-4.111.   \n4 \n5 \nNotwithstanding Plaintiffs’ belief in the strength of their claims, Plaintiffs recognize the \n6 \n7 \nuncertainty, risk, expense, and burden of litigation and pursuing this action and have agreed to \n8 \n9 \nthe terms of the Settlement Agreement as set forth in Exhibit 1.  \n10 \n11 \nB.  SHA’s Response to Plaintiffs’ Claims \n12 \n13 \nDefendants have denied and continue to deny any liability for any claim by any plaintiff \n14 \n15 \nor by any putative class which was asserted.  Defendants deny that SHA’s policies and practices \n16 \n17 \nviolate federal or state constitutions or federal or state laws, and deny that SHA breached any \n18 \n19 \ncontractual obligation to the Plaintiffs or putative class members.  Specifically, Defendants deny \n20 \n21 \nthat SHA’s voucher termination hearings have, at any time, denied voucher holders their due \n22 \n23 \nprocess rights.  Defendants deny that SHA’s policies and practices regarding reasonable \n24 \n25 \naccommodations violated the federal Fair Housing Act or the Washington Law Against \n26 \n27 \nDiscrimination.  SHA’s policies and practices provided for consideration of all requests for \n28 \n29 \nreasonable accommodations by any voucher holder and complied with state and federal law.  \n30 \n31 \nDefendants deny that SHA’s policy on adding minor children to existing Section 8 vouchers, or \n32 \n33 \nits policy on adding adults to Section 8 vouchers, violates state or federal anti-discrimination law \n34 \n35 \nor federal or state constitutions.   \n36 \n37 \nNotwithstanding Defendants’ denial of any liability or wrongdoing, Defendants recognize \n38 \n39 \nthe uncertainty, risk, expense, and burden of litigation and defending this action and have agreed \n40 \n41 \nto the terms of the Settlement Agreement as set forth in Exhibit 1.  \n42 \n43 \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Investigation of the Case \n44 \n45 \nPlaintiffs conducted extensive discovery both before filing and during the pendency of \n46 \n47 \nthis case.  Prior to filing suit, Class Counsel filed a public disclosure request with SHA seeking \n48 \n49 \ncopies of all Section 8 termination hearing decisions from 2003 to the present.

Mediation and Settlement \n30 \n31 \nAfter the Parties thoroughly briefed the legal and factual issues in cross-motions for \n32 \n33 \nsummary judgment, the Parties discussed possible settlement, agreed to a mediation and worked \n34 \n35 \ntogether to find a mutually agreeable time and mediator.  Ehman Decl. ¶ 17. \n36 \n37 \nOn June 22, 2011, the Parties met for a formal mediation session with the Honorable \n38 \n39 \nTerrence Carroll, a retired state court judge who has extensive experience as a mediator, \n40 \n41 \nincluding in complex cases.  Ehman Decl. ¶ 18; Straley Decl. ¶ 18.  The Parties submitted \n42 \n43 \nmediation statements to the mediator prior to the mediation.  Id.  The Parties and their counsel \n44 \n45 \nworked diligently through a fourteen-hour day of mediation with Judge Carroll, which was also \n46 \n47 \nattended by the Class Representatives.  Id.  The next day, counsel for both Parties met again for \n48 \n49 \nnearly the entire working day, with Judge Carroll joining them in the afternoon.

These mediation sessions resulted in a written Memorandum of \n2 \n3 \nUnderstanding, which the Parties subsequently worked to memorialize into a complete \n4 \n5 \nSettlement Agreement.  Id. \n6 \n7 \nIII.  THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n8 \n9 \nAs the result of the extensive arms-length negotiation described above, the Parties have \n10 \n11 \nagreed to settle the litigation on the terms set out in the Settlement Agreement.  The Settlement \n12 \n13 \nAgreement includes key changes SHA will make to its policies and procedures as well as \n14 \n15 \nclarifications it will make in its written documentation regarding changes it has already made; \n16 \n17 \nthe provision of new voucher termination hearings for all Class Members upon request; and \n18 \n19 \nmonetary terms including attorneys’ fees and costs and damages to Ms. Wilson. \n20 \n21 \nA.  The Settlement Class \n22 \n23 \nThe Settlement Class is defined as all SHA Section 8 voucher holders who had \n24 \n25 \ntermination hearings on or after February 20, 2006 and before August 1, 2008 and whose Section \n26 \n27 \n8 vouchers were terminated as a result of such hearings.  The Settlement Class consists of 82 \n28 \n29 \nmembers; the identities of Class Members are known and are listed on Exhibit E to the \n30 \n31 \nSettlement Agreement. \n32 \n33 \nB.  Settlement Benefits \n34 \n35 \nThe settlement confers five significant benefits on the Settlement Class and the public. \n36 \n37 \nFirst, SHA agrees to make certain clarifications of and supplements to its Administrative \n38 \n39 \nPlan and Procedures Manual policies and procedures regarding individuals with disabilities and \n40 \n41 \nthose alleging that they have disabilities.  Settlement Agreement ¶ 3.1.   \n42 \n43 \nSecond, SHA agrees to amend its Administrative Plan to list documentation it will \n44 \n45 \naccept, in addition to court orders of custody, as proof that a subsidized household is the primary \n46 \n47 \nresidence of a minor.  Id. ¶ 3.2. \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 6 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 7 of 23\n1 \nThird, SHA agrees to amend its Administrative Plan to reflect that upon request by a \n2 \n3 \nparticipant, SHA may, in its discretion, consider extenuating circumstances to extend the time \n4 \n5 \nperiod that a guest, including a related adult, is allowed to stay in the subsidized residence.  Id. \n6 \n7 \n¶ 3.3. \n8 \n9 \nFourth, SHA agrees to amend its Administrative Plan to require that hearing officer \n10 \n11 \ndecisions upholding termination of Section 8 vouchers include written notice of the availability \n12 \n13 \nof judicial review.  Id. ¶ 3.4. \n14 \n15 \nFifth, SHA agrees to provide a new termination hearing to each Class Member who \n16 \n17 \nrequests one in writing in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  Id. ¶ 3.5. \n18 \n19 \nC.  Attorneys’ Fees and Costs \n20 \n21 \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Class Counsel will file a separate request for \n22 \n23 \napproval from the Court for an award of up to, but no more than, a total of One Hundred Ninety \n24 \n25 \nFive Thousand Dollars for attorneys’ fees and costs including Class Representative incentive \n26 \n27 \npayments, if any, which the Court may, in its discretion, allocate out of this amount.  SHA will \n28 \n29 \npay up to, but no more than a total of One Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand Dollars ($195,000) \n30 \n31 \nfor any such award made by the Court.  SHA does not agree that any amount should be allocated \n32 \n33 \nto the Class Representatives as incentive payments in this case and SHA reserves its right to \n34 \n35 \nobject to and/or to oppose any portion of any motion or request seeking allocation of any amount \n36 \n37 \nto the Class Representatives as incentive payments.  The Parties recognize that allocation of the \n38 \n39 \nsettlement amount among attorneys’ fees and costs, including incentive payments, is \n40 \n41 \ndiscretionary with the Court.   \n42 \n43 \nD.  Release of Claims \n44 \n45 \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiffs will be deemed to have released any and all \n46 \n47 \nclaim, liability, right, demand, suit, matter, obligation, damage, including consequential \n48 \n49 \ndamages, losses or costs, compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, declaratory \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 7 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 8 of 23\n1 \nrelief, attorneys’ fees and costs, action or cause of action of every nature and description \n2 \n3 \nwhatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted, \n4 \n5 \naccrued or which may thereafter accrue, which regard, arise out of, or relate to facts giving rise \n6 \n7 \nto the subject matter of the Action or the Defendants’ defense of the Action.  All other Class \n8 \n9 \nMembers will be deemed to have released any claim, liability, right, demand, suit, matter, \n10 \n11 \nobligation, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, attorneys’ fees and costs, action or cause of action \n12 \n13 \nof every kind and description, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or \n14 \n15 \nunasserted, accrued or which may thereafter accrue, which regard, arise out of, or relate to facts \n16 \n17 \ngiving rise to the subject matter of the Action or the Defendants’ defense of the Action. \n18 \n19 \nE.  Notice \n20 \n21 \nThe Parties have agreed, subject to Court approval, to a notice plan that includes \n22 \n23 \nindividual notice by U.S. Postal Service first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to General \n24 \n25 \nDelivery, Seattle, WA 98101 and also to the last known address for each Class Member.  In \n26 \n27 \naddition, Class Counsel will post the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement and Settlement \n28 \n29 \nAgreement on its website. \n30 \n31 \nThe Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement informs Class Members of the nature of \n32 \n33 \nthe action, the litigation background and terms of the Settlement Agreement, including the \n34 \n35 \ndefinition of the Settlement Class, the relief provided by the Settlement Agreement, Class \n36 \n37 \nCounsel’s request for fees, costs, and incentive payments, and the scope of the release and \n38 \n39 \nbinding nature of the settlement on Class Members.  It also describes the procedure for objecting \n40 \n41 \nto the settlement and states the date and time of the final approval hearing. \n42 \n43 \nThe Settlement Agreement proposes that the notice program set forth above be \n44 \n45 \nestablished and notices be sent within thirty days after the Court enters an order granting \n46 \n47 \npreliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement.  Pursuant to the requirements of the Class \n48 \n49 \nAction Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1715, Defendants shall also serve notice of the Settlement \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 8 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 9 of 23\n1 \nAgreement on the appropriate federal and state officials not later than ten days after the \n2 \n3 \nSettlement Agreement is filed with the Court. \n4 \n5 \nF.  Objections \n6 \n7 \nObjections must be received and filed not later than twenty-one days before the Fairness \n8 \n9 \nHearing.  The written statement must include:  (1) a detailed statement of the Class Member’s \n10 \n11 \nobjection(s), as well as the specific reasons for each objection, including any evidence and legal \n12 \n13 \nauthority the Class Member wishes to bring to the Court’s attention and any evidence the Class \n14 \n15 \nMember wishes to introduce in support of his or her objection(s); (2) the Class Member’s name, \n16 \n17 \naddress, and telephone number; and (3) information demonstrating that the Class Member is \n18 \n19 \nentitled to be included as a member of the Settlement Class.  Class Members or their attorneys \n20 \n21 \nintending to make an appearance at the Fairness Hearing must, not later than twenty-one days \n22 \n23 \nbefore the Fairness Hearing, file and serve a notice of appearance and a notice of their intention \n24 \n25 \nto appear at the hearing. \n26 \n27 \nIV.  ARGUMENT \n28 \n29 \nA.  Preliminary Approval Is Proper \n30 \n31 \n1.  The Standard for Preliminary Approval \n32 \n33 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides that a class action cannot be settled or \n34 \n35 \ncompromised without approval by the court.  Judicial approval is required regardless whether the \n36 \n37 \naction is certified for trial and later settled or is certified for purposes of settlement.  Manual for \n38 \n39 \nComplex Litigation (Fourth) § 21.61 (2004).  The approval process typically involves three steps:  \n40 \n41 \n(1) preliminary approval of the proposed settlement; (2) dissemination of mailed and/or \n42 \n43 \npublished notice of the settlement to all affected class members; and (3) a formal fairness \n44 \n45 \nhearing.  Id. § 21.63.  Ultimately, to approve the proposed settlement, the court must determine \n46 \n47 \nthat it is fair, reasonable, and adequate.  In re Syncor ERISA Litig., 516 F.3d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir. \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 9 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 10 of 23\n1 \n2008); Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. Comm’n of City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 688 F.2d \n2 \n3 \n615, 625 (9th Cir. 1982). \n4 \n5 \nAt the preliminary approval stage, the Court’s evaluation of whether the Settlement \n6 \n7 \nAgreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate is limited.  “Where the proposed settlement appears \n8 \n9 \nto be the product of serious, informed, non-collusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, \n10 \n11 \ndoes not improperly grant preferential treatment to class representatives or segments of the class \n12 \n13 \nand falls within the range of possible approval, preliminary approval is granted.”  In re NASDAQ \n14 \n15 \nMarket-Makers Antitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. 99, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).  See also Young v. Polo \n16 \n17 \nRetail, LLC, No. C-02-4546 VRW, 2006 WL 3050861, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 25, 2006); In re \n18 \n19 \nVitamins Antitrust Litig., Nos.

July 25, 2001). \n22 \n23 \nA presumption of fairness exists if the settlement is reached through arms-length \n24 \n25 \nnegotiation, sufficient investigation has taken place to allow counsel and the court to act \n26 \n27 \nintelligently, and counsel is experienced in similar types of litigation.  Nat’l Rural Telecomm. \n28 \n29 \nCoop.  v. DIRECTV, Inc., 221 F.R.D. 523, 528 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (“A settlement following \n30 \n31 \nsufficient discovery and genuine arms-length negotiation is presumed fair.”); In re Orthopedic \n32 \n33 \nBone Screw Prods. Liab. Litig., 176 F.R.D. 158, 184 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (“Significant weight should \n34 \n35 \nbe attributed to the belief of experienced counsel that settlement is in the best interest of the \n36 \n37 \nclass.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, at this stage, so long as the \n38 \n39 \nsettlement falls into the range of possible approval—giving deference to the result of the Parties’ \n40 \n41 \narms-length negotiation and the judgment of experienced counsel following sufficient \n42 \n43 \ninvestigation—the settlement should be preliminarily approved and a final Fairness Hearing \n44 \n45 \nscheduled. \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 10 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 11 of 23\n2.  The Proposed Settlement Is Fair and Within the Range of Possible Approval \n1 \n2 \na.  The Settlement Is the Result of Serious, Arms-Length, Informed \n3 \nNegotiation \n4 \n5 \nOne indication of whether a settlement is fair and reasonable is whether it is the product \n6 \n7 \nof serious, arms-length negotiation following substantial investigation of the merits of the case.  \n8 \n9 \nNegotiation and investigation minimize any concerns that the Settlement Agreement might be \n10 \n11 \nthe result of collusion among the Parties or their counsel to undermine the interests of the class \n12 \n13 \nfor their own benefit.  Indeed, “[a] presumption of correctness is said to attach to a class \n14 \n15 \nsettlement reached in arms-length negotiations between experienced capable counsel after \n16 \n17 \nmeaningful discovery.”  Hughes v. Microsoft Corp., Nos. C98-1646C & C93-0178C, 2001 WL \n18 \n19 \n34089697, at *7 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 26, 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n20 \n21 \nThe settlement in this case easily meets this standard.  Class Counsel undertook \n22 \n23 \nsignificant factual and legal investigation of the issues prior to filing the case and prior to the \n24 \n25 \nmediation that resulted in the settlement.  Class Counsel sought and reviewed approximately 500 \n26 \n27 \nredacted SHA Section 8 hearing decisions before filing suit.  Ehman Decl. ¶ 7; Straley Decl. ¶ 8.  \n28 \n29 \nPrior to settlement, Class Counsel reviewed thousands of pages of documents obtained from \n30 \n31 \nDefendants through an extensive review of SHA participant files, including termination files and \n32 \n33 \nfiles where participants sought to add minors or related adults to their households.  Ehman Decl. \n34 \n35 \n¶ 12; Straley Decl. ¶ 13.  Class Counsel also reviewed SHA’s administrative plans, procedure \n36 \n37 \nmanuals and relevant electronic case notes and emails.  Ehman Decl. ¶ 13; Straley Decl. ¶ 14.  \n38 \n39 \nFollowing this investigation and review, Class Counsel deposed four SHA staff members, \n40 \n41 \nincluding SHA’s general counsel, as well as a high-ranking HUD official.  Ehman Decl. ¶ 15; \n42 \n43 \nStraley Decl. ¶ 16.  The information obtained in discovery was used to file motions for summary \n44 \n45 \njudgment and class certification.  Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion, including the brief and \n46 \n47 \nsupporting exhibits, ran to approximately 1700 pages.  \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 11 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 12 of 23\n1 \nDefendants also engaged in discovery regarding the Plaintiffs’ claims, issued written \n2 \n3 \ndiscovery, took depositions, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.  Defendants \n4 \n5 \nevaluated Plaintiffs’ claims and filed Defendants’ motion for summary judgment seeking \n6 \n7 \ndismissal of plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety.  Defendants also filed their opposition to class \n8 \n9 \ncertification.  \n10 \n11 \nAdditionally, the Settlement Agreement unquestionably emerged from a formal, arms-\n12 \n13 \nlength negotiation process between the Parties.  Mediation took place over two days with the \n14 \n15 \nassistance of a retired judge experienced in mediating complex civil litigation.  Ehman Decl. \n16 \n17 \n¶¶ 17-19; Straley Decl. ¶¶ 18-19.  Class Counsel is confident, based on experience in litigating \n18 \n19 \ncomplex civil matters, that they have a full understanding of the facts at issue and the strengths \n20 \n21 \nand weaknesses of the allegations in the operative complaint. \n22 \n23 \nb.  The Terms of the Settlement Are Fair and Reasonable \n24 \n25 \nThere can be little doubt that the proposed settlement is “within the range of possible \n26 \n27 \napproval.”  In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. at 102.  The settlement \n28 \n29 \nmandates that Defendants make certain changes to SHA’s Administrative Plan and Procedures \n30 \n31 \nManual to clarify and improve SHA’s procedures regarding individuals with disabilities and \n32 \n33 \nthose alleging that they have disabilities; amend SHA’s Administrative Plan to list \n34 \n35 \ndocumentation it will accept to prove residency of a minor for the purpose of adding minors to \n36 \n37 \nexisting Section 8 vouchers; amend SHA’s Administrative Plan to reflect that upon request by a \n38 \n39 \nparticipant, SHA may, in its discretion, consider extenuating circumstances to extend the time \n40 \n41 \nperiod that a guest, including a related adult, is allowed to stay in the subsidized residence; \n42 \n43 \nprovide at the end of hearing officers’ termination hearing decisions written notice of the \n44 \n45 \nparticipant’s right to judicial review as well as an abbreviated list of legal resources that may be \n46 \n47 \navailable to assist the participant; and provide a new termination hearing to each Class Member \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 12 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 13 of 23\n1 \nwho requests one in writing.  This package of procedural improvements and benefits is \n2 \n3 \nsignificant. \n4 \n5 \nThe settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to this litigation.  First, it provides Class \n6 \n7 \nMembers, upon timely request in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, with a \n8 \n9 \nnew termination hearing with additional procedural safeguards.  Class Members will have the \n10 \n11 \nopportunity to regain their Section 8 voucher, allowing them access to decent and affordable \n12 \n13 \nhousing.  While no result is guaranteed at the new hearing, if a Class Member prevails at her \n14 \n15 \nhearing, meets all Section 8 voucher income and eligibility requirements, passes a background \n16 \n17 \ncheck, and satisfies any outstanding debts to SHA, she will be placed at the top of the Section 8 \n18 \n19 \nwaitlist.2  Class Members who meet these requirements will be able to bypass the lengthy \n20 \n21 \nprocess of reapplying, going through the lottery and then being placed at the bottom of the \n22 \n23 \ncurrent waitlist.  Instead, their vouchers will be restored in the fastest and most practicable way \n24 \n25 \npossible.  \n26 \n27 \nSecond, under the Settlement Agreement, SHA will take certain actions to ensure that \n28 \n29 \ndisabled voucher holders have an opportunity to seek a reasonable accommodation if needed to \n30 \n31 \navoid termination.  SHA will clarify its Administrative Plan to make clear that the independent \n32 \n33 \nhearing officer in a termination hearing will address requests for reasonable accommodation \n34 \n35 \nraised during the hearing.  SHA will also amend its Administrative Plan to reflect its procedure \n36 \n37 \nfor processing pre-hearing accommodation requests.  In addition, SHA will modify the definition \n38 \n39 \nof disability in its Administrative Plan to reflect the current definition of disability under the \n40 \n41 \nAmericans with Disabilities Act and to include temporary disabilities.  SHA will supplement its \n42 \n43 \nProcedures Manual to reflect that its staff members receive training in what constitutes a \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49                                                   \n50 \n2 SHA represents that it is not possible to simply award a voucher to a Settlement Class Member who prevails at a \n51 \nnew voucher termination hearing. \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 13 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 14 of 23\n1 \ndisability and in responding to requests for reasonable accommodation.  And SHA’s informal \n2 \n3 \nprocess of pre-termination conferences will be formalized in the Procedures Manual.  \n4 \n5 \nThird, SHA will amend its Administrative Plan to require consideration, upon request by \n6 \n7 \na participant and in SHA’s discretion, of extenuating circumstances as a basis for extending the \n8 \n9 \ntime period that a guest, including a related adult, is allowed to stay in the subsidized residence. \n10 \n11 \nFourth, SHA will amend its Administrative Plan to (1) clarify that, in order to add a \n12 \n13 \nminor to an existing Section 8 voucher, SHA will not require proof of court-awarded custody of \n14 \n15 \nthe minor but will require, in addition to other eligibility requirements, proof that the subsidized \n16 \n17 \nhousehold is the primary residence of the minor and (2) list the documents it will accept as proof \n18 \n19 \nthat the subsidized household is the primary residence of the minor.  This will allow families to \n20 \n21 \nprove residency of minors without the time and expense of court proceedings.  \n22 \n23 \nFinally, the settlement ensures that all current and future Section 8 participants who lose \n24 \n25 \ntheir termination hearing will receive notice of the availability of judicial review.  SHA will also \n26 \n27 \nprovide information on how to find legal resources that are available to help the participant.  \n28 \n29 \nOf particular relevance to the reasonableness of the relief obtained under the proposed \n30 \n31 \nsettlement is the fact that Defendants have contested and would continue to contest the merits of \n32 \n33 \nClass Members’ claims, as well as the Plaintiffs’ ability to pursue this action on a class-wide \n34 \n35 \nbasis.  Defendants deny that SHA’s policies and practices violated the Washington and United \n36 \n37 \nStates Constitutions or any of the statutes or regulations asserted by Plaintiffs.  Defendants also \n38 \n39 \ndeny that SHA’s actions constituted breach of any contract.  Lastly, Defendants deny that \n40 \n41 \nPlaintiffs’ claims were appropriate for class certification or that Plaintiffs were appropriate class \n42 \n43 \nrepresentatives. \n44 \n45 \nThroughout the course of settlement negotiations, the Parties considered factors such as \n46 \n47 \nthe past and ongoing cost of this contentious litigation, the scope of relief that was being sought \n48 \n49 \nand that might be provided, the cost and benefit of such relief, the risks to each party of class \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 14 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 15 of 23\n1 \ncertification and trying the matter, and the possibility of appeals from the Court’s decision which \n2 \n3 \nwould only add to the expense, delay, and uncertainty of the litigation.  The Parties believe that \n4 \n5 \nthe settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and, given the uncertainties of continued \n6 \n7 \nlitigation, there can be no doubt that this proposed settlement falls well within the range of \n8 \n9 \npossible approval. \n10 \n11 \nB.  The Settlement Class Should Be Provisionally Certified Pursuant to Federal Rule of \n12 \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) For Purposes of Settlement \n13 \n14 \nThe Court should provisionally certify this action as a class action for the purpose of \n15 \n16 \nsettlement pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Provisional certification \n17 \n18 \nis an appropriate device in the settlement of class actions.  See, e.g., Jaffe v. Morgan Stanley & \n19 \n20 \nCo., No. C-06-3903 TEH, 2008 WL 346417, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 7, 2008); In re Portal \n21 \n22 \nSoftware, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. C-03-5138 VRW, 2007 WL 1991529, at *2-3 (N.D. Cal. June 30, \n23 \n24 \n2007).  Although Defendants vigorously disagree that a class could be certified if the litigation \n25 \n26 \nproceeded without settlement, the Parties agree that the class may be certified for settlement \n27 \n28 \npurposes only under Rule 23(b)(2). \n29 \n30 \n1.  Plaintiffs Contend That the Settlement Class Has Numerous Members and \n31 \nIndividual Joinder of All Class Members Would Be Impracticable3 \n32 \n33 \nThe numerosity requirement is presumed to be met when a proposed class exceeds forty \n34 \n35 \nmembers.  See, e.g., Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995); \n36 \n37 \nMcCluskey v. Trustees of Red Dot Corp. Emp. Stock Ownership Plan & Trust, 268 F.R.D. 670, \n38 \n39 \n673-74 (W.D. Wash. 2010) (collecting cases).  In assessing impracticality of joinder where the \n40 \n41 \nnumber of class members is not great, courts consider such factors as the geographical diversity \n42 \n43 \nof class members, the ability of individual claimants to institute separate suits, and whether \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48                                                   \n49 \n3 This joint motion is based in part on Plaintiffs’ factual and legal arguments.  Defendants contest \n50 \nPlaintiffs’ arguments regarding class certification but agree, for settlement purposes only, that certification of a class \n51 \nis appropriate given the risks of proceeding with litigation. \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 15 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 16 of 23\n1 \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is sought.  1 Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class \n2 \n3 \nActions § 3:6 (4th ed. 2011).   \n4 \n5 \nThe Settlement Class that Plaintiffs seek to represent consists of 82 former voucher \n6 \n7 \nholders.  Given the presumption that the numerosity requirement is met for classes exceeding \n8 \n9 \nforty, the requirement has been satisfied.  In addition, the realities facing former voucher holders \n10 \n11 \nmake joinder impracticable.  When their Section 8 vouchers were terminated, the Class Members \n12 \n13 \nwere placed at serious risk of losing stable housing.  Without stable housing and financial means, \n14 \n15 \nit is unlikely that these individuals would institute separate lawsuits.   \n16 \n17 \n2.  Plaintiffs Contend That Questions of Law and Fact Are Common to \n18 \nPlaintiffs and Members of the Settlement Class \n19 \n20 \nNext, Rule 23(a)(2) requires that common questions of law or fact exist among class \n21 \n22 \nmembers.  “Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that class members have suffered \n23 \n24 \nthe same injury.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, __ U.S. __, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. \n25 \n26 \n2d 374 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Courts have certified classes of \n27 \n28 \nvoucher holders in similar circumstances.  See, e.g., Davis v. Mansfield Metro. Hous. Auth., 751 \n29 \n30 \nF.2d 180, 182 n.2 (6th Cir. 1984) (class of voucher holders certified to challenge housing \n31 \n32 \nauthority’s pretermination notices and procedures); McNeill v. New York City Hous. Auth., 719 \n33 \n34 \nF. Supp. 233, 251-53 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (same); Ferguson v. Metro. Dev. & Hous. Agency, 485 F. \n35 \n36 \nSupp. 517, 519 (M.D. Tenn. 1980) (same).  “In a civil rights suit, commonality is generally \n37 \n38 \nsatisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the \n39 \n40 \nputative class members.”  Tarrer v. Pierce Cnty., No. C10-5670 BHS, 2010 WL 5300801, at *2 \n41 \n42 \n(W.D. Wash. Dec. 21, 2010) (citing LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318, 1332 (9th Cir. 1985)).   \n43 \n44 \nHere, Plaintiffs alleged that SHA’s policies and procedures were unlawful in a variety of \n45 \n46 \nways, each of which affected at least one of the Plaintiffs and some or all of the Class Members.  \n47 \n48 \nFor example, Plaintiffs alleged that SHA failed to consider Class Members’ requests for \n49 \n50 \ndisability accommodations during voucher termination hearings; failed to inform Class Members \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 16 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 17 of 23\n1 \nof their right to judicial review of the hearing officer’s decision; failed to properly train the \n2 \n3 \nhearing officer who oversaw the Class Members’ voucher termination hearings; imposed \n4 \n5 \nunlawfully burdensome requirements on Class Members who wished to add a minor to a \n6 \n7 \nvoucher; and imposed unlawfully burdensome requirements on Class Members who wished to \n8 \n9 \nallow a guest, including a related adult, to remain in a subsidized household temporarily.  Each \n10 \n11 \nClass Member shares common legal questions regarding the lawfulness of SHA’s policies and \n12 \n13 \nprocedures.   \n14 \n15 \n3.  Plaintiffs Contend That Their Claims Are Typical of the Claims of the \n16 \nSettlement Class \n17 \n18 \nRule 23(a)(3), which requires that the named plaintiffs be members of the class and \n19 \n20 \npossess claims that are “reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members,” is also \n21 \n22 \ninterpreted permissively.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998).  “The \n23 \n24 \ntest of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is \n25 \n26 \nbased on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members \n27 \n28 \nhave been injured by the same course of conduct.”  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, \n29 \n30 \n508 (9th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n31 \n32 \nHere, Plaintiffs have claims that are typical of the Settlement Class.  Both Ms. Wilson \n33 \n34 \nand Ms. Townes together were subject to the allegedly unlawful hearing procedures described in \n35 \n36 \nthe previous subsection, and the same hearing officer that presided over the hearings for each \n37 \n38 \nClass Member also conducted the named Plaintiffs’ hearings.  Plaintiffs were also subject to the \n39 \n40 \nother allegedly unlawful policies described above.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical.  \n41 \n42 \n4.  Plaintiffs Contend That the Class Representatives and Their Counsel Have \n43 \nFairly and Adequately Protected the Interests of the Class and Will Continue \n44 \nto Do So \n45 \n46 \nFinally, Rule 23(a)(4) and Rule 23(g) together ensure the satisfaction of what courts have \n47 \n48 \nrecognized as a two-part test:  (1) that the named plaintiffs and their counsel do not have \n49 \n50 \nconflicts of interest with the proposed class; and (2) that the named plaintiffs and their counsel \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 17 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 18 of 23\n1 \ncan prosecute the action vigorously through qualified counsel.  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  In \n2 \n3 \nconsidering the adequacy of counsel, the court must consider:  (1) the work counsel has done in \n4 \n5 \ninvestigating the potential claims in the action; (2) counsel’s experience in handling class actions \n6 \n7 \nand the types of claims asserted in the action; (3) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \n8 \n9 \n(4) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A). \n10 \n11 \nPlaintiffs adequately represent the interests of absent class members if they have no conflicts \n12 \n13 \nwith class interests and are willing and able to vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of the \n14 \n15 \nclass.  In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, 462-63 (9th Cir. 2000).   \n16 \n17 \nClass Counsel, Columbia Legal Services (“CLS”), is a nonprofit law firm that has \n18 \n19 \nextensive experience in housing issues as well as complex civil actions, including class actions.  \n20 \n21 \nCLS is also experienced in representing low-income clients.  Ehman Decl. ¶¶ 3-5; Straley Decl. \n22 \n23 \n¶¶ 4-6.  As described in more detail above, Class Counsel has invested significant time, \n24 \n25 \nresources and effort in investigating the claims in this action.  Class Counsel has fairly and \n26 \n27 \nadequately protected the interests of the Settlement Class and will continue to do so if appointed \n28 \n29 \nby the court as Class Counsel. \n30 \n31 \nThe named Plaintiffs do not have conflicts of interest with the proposed Settlement Class.  \n32 \n33 \nThe only claim asserted by one of the Class Representatives that differs from the claims asserted \n34 \n35 \non behalf of the Settlement Class is Ms. Wilson’s claim for monetary damages.4  Monetary \n36 \n37 \ndamages were never sought on behalf of the Settlement Class.  A named representative may seek \n38 \n39 \nremedies that are not sought for the class as a whole.  It is only “[w]hen the interests of the class \n40 \n41 \nrepresentative can be pursued . . . at the expense of the interests of all the class members, and the \n42 \n43 \nresulting conflict cannot be resolved by the creation of subclasses or otherwise abated, [that] the \n44 \n45 \nconflict will render the plaintiff an inadequate representative.”  1 Conte & Newberg, supra, \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49                                                   \n50 \n4 Ms. Townes initially asserted a claim for damages but she sought and the Court granted dismissal of that claim.  \n51 \nSee Dkt. 171. \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 18 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 19 of 23\n1 \n§ 3:26 (footnotes omitted).  Here, monetary damages were never sought on behalf of the \n2 \n3 \nSettlement Class and the damages being awarded to Ms. Wilson through the settlement do not \n4 \n5 \ncause a conflict.  Ms. Wilson and Ms. Townes are adequate representatives. \n6 \n7 \n5.  The Alleged Acts or Omissions of Defendants Apply Generally to the \n8 \nSettlement Class, So That Final Injunctive Relief or Corresponding \n9 \nDeclaratory Relief Is Appropriate Respecting the Settlement Class as a \n10 \nWhole \n11 \n12 \nThe settlement of this action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(2), which permits class \n13 \n14 \ncertification if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \n15 \n16 \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n17 \n18 \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.”   \n19 \n20 \nMs. Wilson and Ms. Townes seek injunctive and declaratory relief requiring SHA to \n21 \n22 \nprovide legally adequate hearings to all people whom it has terminated pursuant to an inadequate \n23 \n24 \nunconstitutional termination hearing process.  \n25 \n26 \nWhere, as here, plaintiffs allege discriminatory and unlawful \n27 \nsystemic or policy-level actions, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) \n28 \nis proper, and in fact this case presents a “prime example[]” of the \n29 \ntype of case for which Rule 23(b)(2) certification is particularly \n30 \nappropriate.  \n31 \n32 \nTaylor v. Hous. Auth. of New Haven, 257 F.R.D. 23, 32 (D. Conn. 2009) (quoting Amchem \n33 \n34 \nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1997)), vacated \n35 \n36 \non other grounds, 267 F.R.D. 36 (D. Conn. 2010) (decertifying class after trial because facts no \n37 \n38 \nlonger supported certification), aff’d sub nom. Taylor ex rel. Wazyluk v. Hous. Auth. of City of \n39 \n40 \nNew Haven, 645 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2011).  Here, Defendants applied the same allegedly deficient \n41 \n42 \npolicies and procedures, to each member of the Settlement Class.  The nature of the allegations at \n43 \n44 \nissue and the nature of the relief sought both support certification under Federal Rule of Civil \n45 \n46 \nProcedure 23(b)(2). \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 19 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 20 of 23\nC.  The Proposed Notice to the Settlement Class of the Settlement Should Be Approved \n1 \n2 \nDue process requires that interested parties be provided with “notice reasonably \n3 \n4 \ncalculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise [them] of the pendency of the action and \n5 \n6 \nafford them an opportunity to present their objections.”  Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust \n7 \n8 \nCo., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950).  The settlement notice must fairly \n9 \n10 \napprise the class members of the terms of the proposed compromise and give class members \n11 \n12 \nsufficient information to decide whether they should accept the benefits offered or object to the \n13 \n14 \nsettlement.  Id.  Additionally, the notice must be designed so as to have a reasonable chance of \n15 \n16 \nreaching a substantial percentage of the class members.  Id. at 318. \n17 \n18 \nHere, the proposed notice and the method of dissemination meet each of these \n19 \n20 \nrequirements.  First, the notice is written in plain language that uses short sentences, everyday \n21 \n22 \nterms and the active voice to help readers find what they need, understand what they find, and \n23 \n24 \neffectively use what they find.  The first page of the notice uses a logical organization and a chart \n25 \n26 \nto help readers understand the settlement terms, determine if they are a Class Member, and \n27 \n28 \nunderstand their options.  The document also contains a table of contents and uses an easy to \n29 \n30 \nunderstand question-and-answer format to apprise Class Members of their rights and the \n31 \n32 \ninformation necessary to determine whether to accept the settlement or object.  \n33 \n34 \nSecond, the settlement provides for several methods to ensure that the notice reaches as \n35 \n36 \nmany Class Members as possible.  The notice will be sent to general delivery and the last known \n37 \n38 \naddress of all Class Members.  Class Counsel will also post the Notice of Proposed Class Action \n39 \n40 \nSettlement and Settlement Agreement on its website.   \n41 \n42 \nThird, the notice provides all the information necessary for Class Members to make \n43 \n44 \ninformed decisions with respect to whether they object to the proposed settlement. \n45 \n46 \nAccordingly, the content and method of dissemination of the proposed notice fully \n47 \n48 \ncomports with the requirements of due process and applicable case law.  As such, the notice \n49 \n50 \n51 \nJOINT MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nAPPROVAL (No. C09-00226-MJP) – 20 \n  \n77771-0001/LEGAL21691128.1\n \n\n  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 211   Filed 09/08/11   Page 21 of 23\n1 \nshould be approved by the Court, and the Court should direct that the notice be distributed as \n2 \n3 \nagreed by the Parties. \n4 \n5 \nD.  The Fairness Hearing and Order of Preliminary Approval \n6 \n7 \nAssuming the Court grants the motion for preliminary approval, the Parties propose the \n8 \n9 \nfollowing sequence of events and deadlines. \n10 \n11   \n12 \n13    Event  Timing \n14 \n15  1.

The defendants \n2  have failed to provide Section 8 Voucher holders with pre-termination informal grievance \n3  hearings that meet constitutional requirements, have intentionally discriminated against the \n4  plaintiff and other disabled people by refusing to provide them with reasonable accommodations, \n5  have imposed rules and policies that have a disparate impact upon disabled people, and have \n6  failed to properly notify the plaintiff and the other members of the plaintiff class of their right to \n7  seek judicial review of the defendants' decisions to terminate their Section 8 Vouchers. \n8  1.3  The plaintiff asks the Court to certify this matter as a class action lawsuit pursuant \n9  to Fed R. Civ. P. 23(b) (2).  Ms. Wilson also asks the Court to enjoin the defendants from \nI 0  continuing their illegal actions and to require that the defendants provide informal hearings that \nII  comply with applicable laws to all people terminated from the Section 8 Voucher program within \n12  the last six years.

PARTIES \n2  Plaintiff And Proposed Class \n3  3.1  Plaintiff, Markeletta Wilson, is a woman currently living in Seattle, Washington. \n4  Ms. Wilson brings this action on her own behalf and as a representative plaintiff of a class of \n5  similarly situated other people described as: \n6  (a)  All people whom the defendants have terminated from the Section 8 Housing \n7  Choice Voucher program within the last six years and all people whom the defendants will \n8  terminate from the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program in the future. \n9  Defendants \n10  3.2  Defendant, Seattle Housing Authority (hereinafter \"SHA\"), is a public housing \n11  authority established pursuant to RCW 35.82 et. seq..  SHA is a \"public body corporate and \n12  politic\" authorized to exercise governmental powers and duties under the laws of the State of \n13  Washington. \n14  3.3  SHA administers and operates the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program \n15  (hereinafter \"Section 8 Voucher program\") pursuant to federal funds provided for that purpose. \n16  SHA's offices are located at 120 6th Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98109. \n17  3.4  Defendant Thomas Tierney is the Executive Director of SHA.  He is responsible \n18  for implementing and administering SHA's programs and policies, including those associated \n19  with the Section 8 Voucher program.  He is named in his official capacity only. \n20  3.5  All of the actions described below taken by the defendant SHA, its directors, \n21  officers, employees or agents constitute state action and were actions taken under color of state \n22  law. \n23 \nCOMPLAINT ... - 3 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yes1er Way, #300 \nSeattle, W A 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 4 of 27\n1  IV.  FACTS AND LAW REGARDING . \nSHA'S SECTION 8 VOUCHER PROGRAM \n2 \n4.1  The Section 8 Voucher program is administered nationally by the United States \n3 \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  HUD contracts with thousands of \n4 \n\"public housing authorities\" (PHAs) across the country to run Section 8 Voucher programs in \n5 \nlocal areas. \n6 \n4.2  SHA is the PHA that operates the Section 8 Voucher program in Seattle, \n7 \nWashington. \n8 \n4.3  Through it's Section 8 Voucher program, SHA pays a share of the rents charged \n9 \nby private landlords from whom Voucher program participants (hereinafter \"Voucher holders\" or \n10 \n\"participants\") lease homes. \n11 \n4.4  SHA receives federal Section 8 funds from the federal government through HUD \n12 \nfrom which SHA pays Voucher holders' private landlords. \n13 \n4.5  SHA keeps a portion of these federal Section 8 funds for its own purposes as \n14 \nadministrative fees for running the Section 8 Voucher program. \n15 \n4.6  Individuals and families must meet certain eligibility criteria in order to qualify to \n16 \nparticipate in SHA's Section 8 Voucher program. \n17 \n4.7  Most individuals and families who receive Vouchers through SHA earn less than \n18 \n30% of the area median income when accepted into the program. \n19 \n4.8  30% of the median income in Seattle is $24,440 for a family of four. \n20 \n4.9  Because of their extremely limited incomes, most Section 8 Voucher holders \n21 \nwould be unable to afford to pay rents on the private market without the federal Section 8 \n22 \nVoucher rental subsidy. \n23 \nCOMPLAINT ... - 4 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yesler Way, #300 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386 \n\n·'  '  Case 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 5 of 27\n1  4.10  Consequently, many Section 8 Voucher holders would be homeless ifSHA \n2  terminated their Section 8 Vouchers. \n3  4.11  Section 8 Voucher holders have a constitutionally protected property interest in \n4  the continued receipt of Section 8 Voucher benefits. \n5  4.12  SHA cannot terminate this constitutionally protected property interest without \n6  providing a Voucher holder pre-termination, procedural due process protections, including \n7  appropriate notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard. \n8  4.13  SHA cannot terminate this constitutionally protected property interest without \n9  having good cause to do so and without proving that such good cause exists. \n10  4.14  SHA cannot terminate this constitutionally protected property interest without \n11  providing written notice to Section 8 Voucher holders following an informal hearing that \n12  explains that the Voucher holder has the right to seek judicial review of SHA' s decision and \n13  explains the process by which the Voucher holder may access such review. \n14  4.15  HUD has issued regulations that lay out the permissible bases upon which SHA \n15  may terminate a participant's Section 8 Voucher.  Those regulations are found at 24 C.P.R.§ \n16  982.551-.553. \n17  4.16  HUD has also issued regulations that lay out some of the steps that the defendants \n18  must follow before they can terminate a participant's Section 8 Voucher.  Those regulations are \n19  found at 24 C.P.R. § 982.555. \n20  4.17  The HUD regulations do not explicitly layout all of the steps and procedural \n21  protections that the defendants must provide before finally terminating a participant's Section 8 \n22  Voucher. \n23 \nCOMPLAINT... - 5 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yesler Way, #300 \nSeattle, WA   98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 6 of 27\n1  4.18  Because SHA is a public entity and state actor, it must comply with all procedural \n2  protections required by the Due Process Clauses of the Washington and United States \n3  constitutions before terminating any participant's Section 8 Voucher. \n4  4.19  Both the Washington and United States constitutions require the defendants to \n5  provide participants with additional procedural protections that are not explicitly included in \n6  HUD regulations. \n7  4.20  Pursuant to HUD regulations and the Washington and United States constitutions, \n8  the defendants must provide the participant with an adequate written notice of the bases for the \n9  proposed termination prior to termination and of the participant's right to a pre-termination \nI 0  grievance hearing, called an \"informal hearing\". \n11  4.21  If a participant requests an informal hearing, HUD regulations and the \n12  Washington and United States constitutions require that that the defendants conduct the informal \n13  hearing in a particular marmer and provide the participant with certain minimal procedural \n14  protections. \n15  4.22  A \"hearing officer\" presides over the informal hearings. \n16  4.23  If the hearing officer upholds the defendants' decision to terminate the Voucher \n17  after an informal hearing, the defendants stop making rental payments to the Voucher holder's \n18  landlord. \n19  4.24  The defendants employ and pay this hearing officer. \n20  4.25  Each hearing officer is either the defendants' employee or is an independent \n21  contractor with whom the defendants contra~t to act as a hearing officer. \n22 \n23 \nCOMPLAINT ... - 6 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yesler Way, #300 \nSeattle, W A 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 7 of 27\n\" \n1  4.26  At all times relevant, each hearing officer was either the defendants' employee \n2  acting within the scope of his or her employment or was the defendants' agent who had the \n3  defendants' apparent and actual authority to act in the manner described herein. \n4  4.27  The defendants have not properly vetted, trained or supervised all of their hearing \n5  officers in order to ensure that all of their hearing officers have the skills, knowledge and training \n6  necessary to properly adjudicate informal hearings and reach appropriate, reasoned and lawful \n7  decisions. \n8  4.28  Pursuant to HUD regulations and the Washington and United States constitutions, \n9  the defendants must provide a Voucher holder with an informal hearing where an impartial \n10  hearing officer considers whether the defendants' decision to terminate the Voucher is \"in \nII  accordance with the law, HUD regulations and PHA policies\".  24 C.F.R. § 982.555(a). \n12  4.29  Pursuant to HUD regulations and the Washington and United States constitutions, \n13  the defendants must provide participants with the following procedural protections as part of its \n14  informal hearing process: \n15  (a)  The opportunity to confront and cross examine adverse witnesses; \n16  (b)  the opportunity to present witnesses and evidence; \n17  (c)  the opportunity to retain and be represented by counsel; \n18  (d)  the opportunity to advance and have the hearing officer fully consider any \n19  relevant factual or legal argument; \n20  (e)  a sufficiently skilled, trained and impartial hearing officer; \n21  (f)  a written decision from the hearing officer that is solely based on the applicable \n22  laws, regulations, rules or policies and the arguments and evidence presented at the hearing, that \n23  includes a clear and correct statement of the evidence presented, the evidence relied upon and the \nCOMPLAINT ... -7 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yes1er Way, #300 \nSeattle, W A 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464-5933  Fax: (206) 328-3386 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 8 of 27\nI  rationale supporting the decision, and one that is not based solely upon uncorroborated hearsay \n2  testimony or evidence;

\n11  (b)  the defendants' policy and practice has been to prohibit hearing officers from \n12  overturning the defendants' termination decisions based upon arguments that: \n13  (I)  The Voucher termination would violate the participant's (or a member of \n14  the participant family's) rights under any law forbidding discrimination on the basis of \n15  membership in a protected class; \n16  (2)  the defendants should not terminate a Voucher because of the existence of \n17  a reasonable accommodation to a person's disability that the defendants have not \n18  provided; \n19  (3)  the termination is barred by an equitable doctrine such as waiver, estoppel, \n20  or laches;

Newly homeless children are uprooted from their familiar surroundings, lose \n5  touch with their friends and classmates, and witness the familial stress that severe economic \n6  turmoil creates. \n7  4.44  Even if the family is able to find the funds to remain in their home, the loss of the \n8  Voucher subsidy means that the family's marginal economic circumstances become even worse. \n9  4.45  The family must cut back in other essential areas in order to fund their newly \n10  increased housing costs. \n11  4.46  The family's credit may suffer as other bills go unpaid in order to make rent at a \n12  greatly increased level. \nv. \n13  FACTS RELATED TO THE REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFF \nMARKELETTA WILSON \n14 \n5.1  The representative plaintiff, Markeletta Wilson, held a Section 8 Voucher with \n15 \nSHA until the defendants terminated her Voucher by hearing decision dated February 26, 2007. \n16 \n5.2 ·  Ms. Wilson had been a participant in the Voucher program for a number of years \n17 \nprior to her termination. \n18 \n· 5.3 ·  Ms. Wilson used the Section 8 Voucher to subsidize her rent on an apartment that \n19 \nshe and her son, Dewayne Jackson, shared. \n20 \n5.4  In May 2005, Ms. Wilson filled out a personal declaration form for SHA \n21 \nindicating that she was disabled. \n22 \n23 \nCOMPLAINT... - 11 \nColumbia Legal Services \n101 Yesler Way, #300 \nSeattle, WA 98104 \nPhone: (206) 464·5933 Fax: (206) 328·3386 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 1   Filed 02/20/09   Page 12 of 27\nI  5.5  Ms. Wilson suffers from physical disabilities including artery disease and \n2  breathing problems \n3  5.6  Ms. Wilson also suffers from depression.  She has struggled with this mental \n4  illness since she was young and was hospitalized for it as a teenager. \n5  5.7  When Ms. Wilson is depressed, she cries, can't get out of bed, and struggles to \n6  follow through on tasks.  Her disabilities cause her significant problems with reading and reading \n7  comprehension. \n8  5.8  Ms. Wilson has been treated over the years by a number of mental health \n9  specialists for her depression. \n10  5.9  Because of her disabilities, Mr. Wilson has found it difficult to hold down gainful \n11  employment in the past or engage in other activities of daily living. \n12  5.10  Ms. Wilson has received federal and state financial benefits because her \n13  disabilities have rendered her unable to work. \n14  5.11  Ms. Wilson's depression deepened when her sister-in-law became ill and then \n15  became even more severe following her brother's death in the Spring of2005. \n16  5.12  During this same time period, because of her landlord's refusal to complete \n17  repairs or pay for landlord-supplied utilities, Ms. Wilson's living conditions in the apartment she \n18  rented with her Section 8 Voucher deteriorated to the point where her health and safety were in \n19  serious danger. \n20  5.13  In fact, in December 2006, the City of Seattle condemned the property because of \n21  these hazardous conditions, forcing Ms. Wilson to move from the apartment. \n22  5.14  Ms. Wilson's horrid living conditions exacerbated her existing mental and \n23  physical disabilities. \nCOMPLAINT ... -

The Settlement Class is sufficiently definite; \n30 \n31 \nb.  The Settlement Class is so numerous that joinder of all members ofthe \n32 \n33 \nSettlement Class is impracticable; \n34 \n35 \nc.

Plaintiffs and Class Counsel have and will fairly and adequately represent \n42 \n43 \nand protect the interests of the Settlement Class; and \n44 \n45 \nf.  The alleged acts or omissions of Defendants which are at issue in this \n46 \n47 \nlitigation apply generally to the Settlement Class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \n48 \n49 \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the Settlement Class as a whole. \n50 \n51 \n[PROPOSED] FINAL ORDER AND JUDGMENT \nGRANTING APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSETTLEMENT (No. C09-00226 MJP)-2 \n77771·0001/LEGAL21690482.1 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 225   Filed 01/10/12   Page 3 of 5\n5.

Class Counsel has provided notice in a manner consistent with the Preliminary \n8 \n9 \nApproval Order and as set forth in the Settlement Agreement.  The notice, as implemented, met \n10 \nII \nthe requirements of due process and was reasonable under the circumstances.  The notice was \n12 \n\\3 \nreasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise Class Members of the pendency of the \n14 \n15 \nAction, the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and their right to appear and/or object to the \n16 \n17 \nsettlement.  Further, the notice was reasonable and constituted due, adequate, and sufficient \n18 \n19 \nnotice to all persons entitled to receive notice.  Defendants notified the appropriate federal and \n20 \n21 \nstate officials pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1715. \n22 \n23 \n7.  The Court has determined that a full opportunity has been given to the members \n24 \n25 \nof the Settlement Class to object to the terms of the settlement or to Class Counsel's request for \n26 \n27 \nattorneys' fees and costs and Class Representative incentive payments, and otherwise participate \n28 \n29  ..k C\\  tl-\nin the Fairness Hearing on  , 20  The Court has considered all submissions and \n30 \n31 \narguments provided by Class Members objecting to the settlement as well as Class Counsel's \n32 \n33 \nresponse to those objections and has determined that none of the objections warrant disapproval \n34 \n35 \nof the Settlement Agreement. \n36 \n37 \n8.  The Court has carefully considered all the papers, evidence, and arguments before \n38 \n39 \nit and has made its independent judgment that:  (I) Plaintiffs and Class Members face significant \n40 \n41 \nrisks if this litigation were to proceed; (2) the possibility of a greater ultimate recovery is \n42 \n43 \nspeculative and any such recovery would only occur after considerable delay; (3) the terms of the \n44 \n45 \nSettlement Agreement provide substantial and meaningful benefits to the Settlement Class; \n46 \n47 \n(4 ) the settlement is the product of meaningful investigation into the facts and circumstances \n48 \n49 \nsurrounding SHA's termination hearing practices and policies for Section 8 voucher holders; \n50 \n51 \n[PROPOSED] FINAL ORDER AND JUDGMENT \nGRANTING APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSETTLEMENT (No. C09-00226 MJP) - 3 \n77771-000 l/LEGAL21690482.1 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00226-MJP   Document 225   Filed 01/10/12   Page 4 of 5\nI \n(5) the settlement negotiations were extensive, arms-length under the direction of the Hon. \n2 \n3 \nTerrence Carroll (ret.), and without any collusion; (6) the reaction by the Settlement Class has \n4 \n5 \nbeen in favor of the settlement; and (7) experienced Class Counsel support the settlement. \n6 \n7 \nAccordingly, having considered the foregoing as well as the small number of objections; the \n8 \n9 \ncosts, risks, and delays of continued litigation versus the benefits provided by the settlement; and \n10 \n11 \nbased on this Court's knowledge of this Action, the Court finds and concludes that the settlement \n12 \n13 \nis in the best interests of the Settlement Class and is fair, reasonable, and adequate as to all Class \n14 \n15 \nMembers.  The Court therefore enters judgment in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. \n16 \n17 \n9.
