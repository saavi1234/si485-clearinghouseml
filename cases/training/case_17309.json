The government requests an emergency temporary stay of the district court's order preliminarily enjoining Presidential Proclamation No. 9945, Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States Health Care System, pending consideration of the motion for a stay pending appeal. The government also seeks a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The plaintiffs oppose both motions. A temporary stay in this context (sometimes referred to as an administrative stay) is only intended to preserve the status quo until the substantive motion for a stay pending appeal can be considered on the merits, and does not constitute in any way a decision as to the merits of the motion for stay pending appeal. Here, the status quo would be disrupted by granting the temporary stay request. Therefore, we deny the request for a temporary stay. The Proclamation has not yet gone into effect. The changes it would make to American immigration policy are major and unprecedented; the harms the government alleges it will suffer pending review of the motion for stay pending appeal are long-term rather than immediate. Our ruling is based solely on the absence of a sufficient exigency to justify changing the status quo, particularly during the few weeks before scheduled oral argument on the merits of the emergency motion; we do not consider the merits of the dispute in any respect. By this order we are expediting briefing and oral argument on the emergency motion and anticipate an expeditious issuance of a decision following argument. Any government reply to plaintiffs' opposition to the motion for stay pending appeal is due December 23, 2019. The parties are directed to appear for oral argument on the motion for stay pending appeal on Thursday, January 9, 2020, at 10:00 am in San Francisco, California. Each side will be allotted 20 minutes of argument time. The parties are encouraged to appear in person if possible. If any party wishes to appear by video, that party must notify Kwame Copeland, 415.355.7888, no later than Friday, January 3, 2020, and must coordinate with Mr. Copeland in making suitable arrangements for an appearance by video. The opening brief and excerpts of record are due January 2, 2020; the answering brief is due January 30, 2020 or 28 days after service of the opening brief, whichever is earlier; and the optional reply brief is due within 21 days after service of the answering brief. This case will be assigned to the next available oral argument panel for a decision on the merits of the appeal. (jtj) (Entered: 12/23/2019)"

Its rights may be vindicated upon completion of this litigation. The alleged monetary harms to third parties upon which the government relies do not constitute irreparable harm. While that sole factor is dispositive, we also conclude that the government did not meet its high burden to satisfy the other Nken factors. It has not demonstrated likelihood of success. Staying the injunction would injure both the plaintiff class and third parties, and the public interest weighs against entering a stay. The preliminary injunction preserves the status quo during the pendency of this appeal. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the scope of the preliminary injunction. For these reasons, we deny the motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. We do not prejudge the consideration of the merits appeal. MOTION DENIED. (jtj) (Entered: 05/04/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>On October 30, 2019, seven individual plaintiffs and Latino Network filed this putative class-action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, challenging President Trump’s October 4, 2019 “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”). The plaintiffs, represented by the Innovation Law Lab, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Justice Action Center, and private counsel, alleged that the Proclamation imposes a new ground of inadmissibility whereby immigrants will be denied visas unless they prove they can get health insurance. The individual plaintiffs are U.S. citizens in the process of sponsoring family members for visas, but face denial under the new Proclamation. The plaintiffs sued President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of State, alleging that the Proclamation is ultra vires and violates the Administrative Procedure Act and Fifth Amendment due process. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Michael H. Simon.</p><p>In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the Proclamation would block nearly two thirds of all prospective legal immigrants from receiving visas to travel to the U.S. Specifically, they claimed the Proclamation would bar qualified immigrant applicants from receiving visas and entering the U.S. unless they can establish, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, that they either will be covered by approved health insurance within 30 days after entry, or are wealthy enough—and/or healthy enough—to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs. The plaintiffs argued that such a policy contravenes well-established immigration and healthcare laws, exceeds the scope of the President’s statutory authority, and violates procedural due process and equal protection. </p><p>On November 1, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. The court heard oral argument on November 2 and granted the plaintiff’s motion, temporarily enjoining the defendants from enforcing the Proclamation for at least 28 days. 2019 WL 5685204.</p><p>On November 8, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, as well as a motion to certify two subclasses: (1) a subclass of U.S. citizens who are petitioners sponsoring a visa for family members; and (2) a subclass of foreign nationals who are visa applicants. On November 11, the plaintiffs also filed a motion to compel the administrative record. On November 15, the court ordered the defendants to produce the record by November 20. 2019 WL 6050111. </p><p>On November 26, 2019, the court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the Proclamation.

The defendants requested an emergency temporary stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction, as well as a stay of the injunction pending appeal. </p><p>On December 20, the Ninth Circuit denied the request for a temporary stay. The Court found that the status quo would be disrupted by granting the temporary stay request because the Proclamation would make major and unprecedented changes to American immigration policy and the harms the government would allegedly suffer absent the stay were long-term rather than immediate. 944 F.3d 1222. </p><p>Back in the district court, the defendants were ordered to supplement the administrative record on February 11, 2020. </p><p>On April 7, 2020, Judge Simon granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. He certified the following two subclasses:</p><p>(1) U.S. Petitioner Subclass</p><p><blockquote>\"Individuals in the United States who currently have or will have an approved or pending petition to the United States government to sponsor a noncitizen family member for an immigrant visa; and whose sponsored family member is subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to a consular officer's satisfaction that he or she 'will be covered by approved health insurance' within 30 days after entry or will be able 'to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs;'\"</blockquote></p><p>(2) Visa Applicant Subclass</p><p><blockquote>\"Individuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for or will soon apply to the United States government for an immigrant visa; (ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted the visa; but (iii) are subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of a consular officer that they 'will be covered by approved health insurance' within 30 days after entry or will be able 'to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.'\"</blockquote></p><p>In his order, Judge Simon explained that the U.S. Petitioner Subclass plaintiffs had standing because they had shown a credible threat or realistic danger of injury from the Proclamation. </p><p>On April 25, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the enforcement of a new Presidential Proclamation that had been issued on April 22, 2020, titled \"Suspension of Entry of Immigrants who Present a Risk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak\" (No. 10014). The plaintiffs requested that the court restrain enforcement of the Proclamation to the extent that it prevents certain underage members of the Visa Applicant Subclass from accessing emergency consular processing services to prevent their aging out of their place in the visa queue (which could prevent them from receiving visas). </p><p>On April 29, Judge Simon issued an opinion and order denying the plaintiffs' motion. He found that the court's existing jurisdiction in this lawsuit focused only on the October 4th Proclamation, and that the new April 22nd Proclamation was completely unrelated. Thus, Judge Simon concluded that there was no basis for invoking the All Writs Act to suspend the new Proclamation. </p><p>On May 4, 2020, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion and order denying the defendants' motion to stay the district court's preliminary injunction pending appeal. The Court found that the government had failed to meet its burden of showing irreparable harm. It also concluded that the government had not sustained its burden of showing that it had a strong likelihood of prevailing against the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. Finally, it held that the nationwide scope of the district court's injunction was appropriate given the nationwide class. 2020 WL 2110978. </p><p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

Late on Friday night, October 4, 2019, President Trump issued a presidential \nproclamation that, effective November 3, 2019, will block nearly two thirds of all prospective legal \nimmigrants, mostly from predominantly nonwhite countries, from receiving visas and coming to \nthe United States.   \n2.  The “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who \nWill Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”) bars qualified \nimmigrant visa applicants from receiving visas and entering the United States unless they can \nestablish, “to the satisfaction of a consular officer,” that they either “will be covered by approved \nhealth insurance” within 30 days after entry or are wealthy enough—and/or healthy enough—“to \npay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”  \n3.  The Proclamation seeks to unilaterally rewrite this country’s immigration laws, \nimposing a new ground of inadmissibility that Congress has expressly rejected, and creating \nrequirements  that  will  be  extremely  difficult,  or  impossible,  for  most  otherwise  qualified \nimmigrant visa applicants to satisfy. In doing so, the Proclamation contravenes well-established \nand duly enacted immigration and healthcare laws, exceeds the scope of the President’s statutory \nauthority, and violates Constitutional separation of powers and equal protection principles.  \n4.  In implementing the Proclamation, the U.S. Department of State has publicly \nannounced on its website that, beginning November 3, 2019, all applicants for immigrant visas \nwho are subject to the Proclamation “must demonstrate to the consular officer at the time of \ninterview” that they will be covered by “approved” health insurance under the Proclamation within \n30 days of entry or have the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs”—\nand that “[i]nability to meet this requirement will result in the denial of the visa application.” \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  1 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 5 of 100\n5.  In addition to imposing new requirements for immigrant visa applicants that are \nunmoored from the existing statutory and regulatory framework, the Proclamation and agency \nimplementation  actions  provide  staggeringly  few  options  to  satisfy  this  barrier.  While  the \nProclamation lists a number of health insurance options that would-be immigrants ostensibly could \nobtain in order to satisfy the new requirement, it in fact provides few or even no options that are \navailable to these individuals in reality. First, most of the “approved health insurance” plans that \nare listed as satisfying the Proclamation’s requirement are not actually legally or practically \navailable to the vast majority of prospective immigrants—like Medicare, which requires a recipient \nto have lived in the United States for five years, or any plan available under the Affordable Care \nAct, with or without financial assistance, because such plans are only available to individuals \nliving in the United States. Second, under the Proclamation, any kind of coverage involving \ncommon federal- or state-provided health insurance benefits, such as premium tax credits under \nthe Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) for plans sold on the individual market or Medicaid coverage \nfor any individual over age 18, does not allow prospective immigrants to surmount this new barrier \nto entry. By imposing these restrictions on “approved” types of health insurance, the Proclamation \nexcludes benefits and assistance that Congress has specifically and explicitly made available by \nstatute to certain immigrants in the United States. Third, a number of the “approved” health \ninsurance options are not available in all states, or, in many cases, allow denials and exclusions \nbased on pre-existing conditions, such that many would-be immigrants would not qualify for or \nhave access to such plans. Fourth, the coverage provided under certain “approved” options is \nlimited and does not provide for “minimum essential coverage” as defined under the ACA. \n6.  The Proclamation is therefore poised to create a new class of otherwise qualified \nimmigrants who are barred from entry on the sole ground of the health insurance requirement, as \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 6 of 100\nwell as a new class of underinsured individuals with non-comprehensive coverage in the United \nStates. These effects frustrate both existing immigration laws and established healthcare laws, and \ncreate further concerns for public health and the healthcare system. Under its terms and agency \nimplementation actions, the Proclamation would ban an immigrant who would receive financial \nassistance under the ACA to purchase comprehensive individual health insurance coverage, but \nwould allow an immigrant who purchased an “approved,” non-comprehensive visitor or short-term \nlimited duration insurance plan, even though the former would be better insured and far less likely \nto  incur  uncompensated  care  costs  than  the  latter.  In  effect,  the  Proclamation  and  its \nimplementation incentivize, if not require, would-be immigrants to purchase non-comprehensive \nplans to satisfy the Proclamation’s health insurance requirement because those plans are in many \ncases the most realistically accessible to immigrants. In doing so, the Proclamation and its \nimplementation undermine not only Congress’s intent, as expressed through the ACA, to provide \na certain minimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants and citizens in the United States, but \nalso the Proclamation’s own stated goal of addressing the burdens of uncompensated care provided \nto uninsured individuals.  \n7.  The Proclamation and its implementation are similar (yet even more egregious) in \neffect to the Administration’s recently promulgated—and currently enjoined by several courts—\n“Public Charge” Rule, which attempts to redefine what it means for an immigrant to be a “public \ncharge” and therefore inadmissible to the United States. Both the Proclamation requirements and \nthe Public Charge Rule provisions are tools that the Trump Administration is seeking to use in \norder to exclude prospective immigrants who have satisfied all statutory requirements under the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”)  to  enter  the  United  States;  both  favor  so-called \n“unsubsidized” ACA health insurance over subsidized; both consider the use of Medicaid to be a \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 7 of 100\nnegative or disqualifying factor for individuals age 18 and over; and both involve some analysis \non the part of a consular officer as to whether an intending immigrant has sufficient financial \nresources to cover “reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The Public Charge rule, while still \nproblematic  and  under  challenge  on  various  grounds  (as  reflected  in  the  pending  lawsuits \nchallenging the rule and the preliminary injunction orders recently issued by several courts), was \nat least promulgated through a notice and comment rulemaking process, as required by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The Proclamation did not go through any such a process and seeks \nto impose the same, or even a heightened, draconian effect on the immigration system through \npresidential fiat and corresponding agency action to carry out the new requirement.  \n8.  Indeed, the Proclamation is unprecedented in its scope and impact, the largest ever \nsuspension on the entry of immigrants of its kind. It will affect mostly immigrants from Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and Asia, by drastically reducing, if not eliminating, the numbers of immigrants \nwho enter the United States with family-sponsored visas, humanitarian visas, or diversity visas. \nWith no termination point or procedure by which a prospective immigrant may seek a waiver of \nthe Proclamation’s suspension on entry, the Proclamation will separate families—especially \nnonwhite families—indefinitely, in contravention of one of the bedrock principles of this country’s \nimmigration system. \n9.  Such  anticipated  effects  of  the  Proclamation  are  striking,  but  perhaps  hardly \nsurprising. Like the Public Charge Rule (and the failed RAISE Act of 2017), the Proclamation \nreflects the President’s often expressed belief that, unlike immigrants who would enter via a \n“merit-based” system, immigrants who currently enter the country through family-based and \ndiversity visas do not contribute to the United States but instead present a threat to the country’s \neconomy and security. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 8 of 100\nhe reportedly asked during a 2018 Oval Office discussion of protections for immigrants from Haiti, \nEl Salvador, and certain African countries. “Why do we need more Haitians?” he asked. During \nthat same discussion, he suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from \ncountries like Norway—which is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  \n10.  The Proclamation is but the latest effort of the Trump Administration to unilaterally \nrewrite Congressionally enacted laws governing who may come to this country as an immigrant. \nIt is also the one of the most drastic. Based on the latest data, up to an estimated 375,000 \nimmigrants are at risk each year of being banned due to a lack of “approved” health insurance \ncoverage, or close to two-thirds of all qualified immigrant visa applicants, many of whom are \npeople  of  color.  This  is  repugnant  not  only  to  our  values,  but  also  our  nation’s  laws  and \nConstitution.  \n11.  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  Proclamation  and  Defendants’  implementation  of  its \nrequirements  under  this  Court’s  inherent  authority  to  review  executive  actions  that  exceed \nstatutory grants of authority, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(D), and the \nequal  protection  guarantee  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court issue appropriate declaratory relief and preliminarily and \npermanently enjoin the Proclamation as a whole. \n   \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 9 of 100\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 over \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. The Court has additional \nremedial authority under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. \n13.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and Local Rule 3.2. Defendants are officers \nor employees of the United States acting in their official capacities, and agencies of the United \nStates. Plaintiff John Doe #1 resides in the Portland Division of this District and Plaintiff Latino \nNetwork is a non-profit organization based in Portland. Moreover, on information and belief, the \nproposed class includes numerous members residing in this District who will be affected by the \nactions of Defendants. No real property is involved in this action. \nPARTIES \nPLAINTIFFS \n14.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 is a United States citizen of Mexican origin who resides in \nBeaverton, Oregon, with his wife, a Mexican citizen, and his fourteen-year-old United States \ncitizen son. John Doe #1, who is not able to work due to a disability, sponsored an immigrant visa \nfor his wife so that she can have legal status to live and work in the United States. Her immigrant \nvisa  consular  interview  is  scheduled  for  November  6,  2019.  Under  the  Proclamation  and \nDefendants’ implementation of its requirements, John Doe #1 and his wife cannot afford or qualify \nfor an “approved” health insurance option for her and fears that they lack sufficient financial \nresources to pay foreseeable medical costs out of pocket.  \n15.  Plaintiff Juan Ramon Morales is a United States citizen originally from Puerto Rico \nwho now resides in Liberty, New York with his wife, Vianca Morales, a Mexican citizen; their \ndaughter; and Ramon’s step-daughter.

He is currently \nin the process of filing all necessary documents so that they can schedule a consular interview, but \nthey do not believe that he will be able to prove that he can obtain available and affordable \n“approved” health insurance within 30 days of entering the U.S. or pay for foreseeable medical \ncosts as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of its provisions. \n19.  Plaintiff Blake Doe is a U.S. citizen living in Corvallis, Oregon, with his wife. He \nhas approved I-130 immigrant petitions for his parents, both Mexican citizens, with whom he had \nlived his entire life in Oregon until going to college at Oregon State University to study civil \nengineering. Blake Doe’s parents are currently waiting to have their consular interview scheduled \nin Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Blake Doe and his parents do not believe that they would be able to \nprove that his parents would be able to obtain available and affordable “approved” health insurance \nwithin 30 days of their entry into the U.S. or to pay foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket as \nrequired under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of its provisions.  \n20.  Plaintiff Brenda Villarruel is a U.S. citizen who currently resides in Chicago, \nIllinois, with her United States citizen son and United States citizen parents. Ms. Villarruel works \npart time as a licensed medical assistant. She does not have medical insurance and receives health \ncare, when necessary, through a clinic that charges based on income. Ms. Villarruel has sponsored \nan immigrant visa for her husband, a Mexican citizen who currently resides in Mexico City, \nMexico, and is awaiting consular processing. Ms. Villarruel and her husband do not have the \nresources to obtain available and affordable “approved” health insurance coverage for him or to \npay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket as required under the Proclamation and \nDefendants’ implementation of its provisions. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 12 of 100\n21.

Late on Friday night, October 4, 2019, President Trump signed the “Presidential \nProclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United \nStates Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”).  A copy of the Proclamation can be viewed at \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 14 of 100\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-suspension-entry-\nimmigrants-will-financially-burden-united-states-healthcare-system/ and is attached as Exhibit 1. \n31.  Beginning  at  12:01  a.m.  eastern  daylight  time  on  November  3,  2019,  the \nProclamation will ban would-be immigrants from receiving visas and entering the United States \nunless they can demonstrate, “to the satisfaction of a consular officer,” that they will be able to \nobtain “approved” health insurance coverage within 30 days after arriving in the United States, or \nare wealthy enough to “pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”  \n32.  The Proclamation, by its own terms, was not issued for national security reasons. \nOstensibly, the Proclamation is meant to “address[] the challenges facing our healthcare system, \nincluding protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care” \ngiven to “people who lack health insurance or the ability to pay for their healthcare.” The \nProclamation notes that hospitals and other health care providers “often administer care to the \nuninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them.” Such uncompensated costs \n“are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher \nfees for medical services.” The Proclamation further states that uninsured individuals “strain \nFederal and State government budgets through their reliance on publicly funded programs, which \nultimately are financed by taxpayers,” and rely on emergency care for non-emergency conditions, \n“causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services.”  \n33.  Given  these  challenges,  the  Proclamation  asserts  that  “the  United  States \nGovernment  is  making  the  problem  worse  by  admitting  thousands  of  aliens  who  have  not \ndemonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs,” and claims that “data show that lawful \nimmigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.” \nAccordingly, the Proclamation declares that “[c]ontinuing to allow entry into the United States of \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 15 of 100\ncertain immigrants who lack health insurance or the demonstrated ability to pay for their healthcare \nwould be detrimental to these interests.” If a prospective immigrant will not “be covered by \napproved health insurance” “within 30 days of the alien’s entry into the United States,” or if the \nimmigrant does not have “the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs,” \nthe immigrant is deemed to be someone who will “financially burden the United States healthcare \nsystem” and whose entry into the United States is therefore “suspended.”  \n34.  Simply put, under the Proclamation, a lack of “approved” insurance, or the inability \nto prove that an intending immigrant can pay for “reasonably foreseeable” medical care, absolutely \nbars the entry of that individual to the United States who meets all qualifications mandated by \nCongress in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n35.  The Proclamation sets out a narrow range of health insurance plans that qualify as \n“approved health insurance.” No “subsidized” health plan offered in the individual market within \na State under the ACA qualifies. Proclamation § 1(b)(ii). Nor does Medicaid qualify as “approved \nhealth insurance” for any individual over 18, Proclamation § 1(c), even though some states have \nchosen to make Medicaid available to certain adults over 18, including certain new and recently \narrived immigrants. “Approved health insurance” under the Proclamation includes only: \n•  employer-sponsored plans (Proclamation § 1(b)(i));  \n•  catastrophic plans (Proclamation § 1(b)(iv));  \n•  certain health plans available to the U.S. military (Proclamation § 1(b)(vi));  \n•  the health plans of family members (Proclamation § 1(b)(v));  \n•  Medicare (Proclamation § 1(b)(viii));  \n•  short-term, limited duration health policies effective for at least 364 days (Proclamation § \n1(b)(iii)); and \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 16 of 100\n•  visitor health insurance plans that provide “adequate coverage for medical care,” also for \nat least 364 days (Proclamation § 1(b)(vii)).  \nAs explained below, the Proclamation’s “approved” health insurance plans are not practically or \nlegally available to most or all prospective immigrants residing outside the country or within their \nfirst 30 days of arrival.  \n36.  A prospective immigrant may also obtain a “health plan that provides adequate \ncoverage for medical care as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his \ndesignee,” but the Proclamation provides no guidance as to how “adequate coverage” is defined. \n(Proclamation § 1(b)(ix)). \n37.  Subject to limited exceptions, the Proclamation applies to nearly all individuals \nseeking to enter the United States with an immigrant visa. Indeed, based on insurance coverage \nalone, most adults who were granted green cards over the last three years would have been banned \nhad the Proclamation been in effect.1 The only exceptions from the Proclamation’s suspension of \nentry cover very small populations, including: \n•  certain  Special  Immigrant  Visa  applicants  specifically  from  Iraq  and  Afghanistan \n(Proclamation § 2(b)(ii));  \n•  green card holders returning to the U.S. on a “Returning Resident” visa after remaining \nabroad for more than one year (Proclamation § 2(b)(v));  \n•  biological and adopted children under 21, but only if those children are not accompanying \na parent who is also immigrating to the United States and is subject to the Proclamation \n(Proclamation § 2(b)(iii), (vi)); and  \n \n1 Nicole Narea, Trump just quietly cut legal immigration by up to 65%, VOX, \nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/10/9/20903541/trump-proclamation-legal-immigration-health-\ninsurance (last visited Oct. 27, 2019).  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 17 of 100\n•  parents of U.S. citizen children over the age of 21 arriving with an IR-5 visa, but only if \nthe parent or the U.S. citizen-child sponsor “demonstrates to the satisfaction of the consular \nofficer that the [parent’s] healthcare will not impose a substantial burden on the United \nStates healthcare system” (Proclamation § 2(b)(iv)).  \nWith respect to this last exception, the Proclamation provides no guidance as to how the parent or \nU.S. citizen-child sponsor must demonstrate, nor how a consular officer should evaluate, whether \nthe parent’s health care will impose a “substantial burden on the United States healthcare system.”  \n38.  Notably, certain types of plans that qualify as “approved” coverage under the \nProclamation provide only very limited benefits and/or allow exclusions based on preexisting \nconditions, such that they may be either unavailable to many individuals or may result in \n“underinsurance”—which has itself been shown to impose a “substantial burden on the United \nStates healthcare system.” Yet, the Proclamation would encourage underinsurance among newly \narrived immigrants. \n39.  The Proclamation also contains exceptions for noncitizens “whose entry would \nfurther important United States law enforcement objectives,” or “whose entry would be in the \nnational interest,” as “determined by the Secretary of State or his designee.” Proclamation § \n2(b)(vii), (viii). Again, however, the Proclamation provides no procedure for would-be immigrants \neither to learn or to demonstrate how they would qualify for such exceptions.  \nB.   Agency Implementation of the Proclamation \n40.  In implementing the Proclamation, the Department of State created a page on its \nwebsite that informs and instructs visa applicants and consular officers of their new obligations \nunder the Proclamation (“Posting”), available at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-\nvisas/immigrate/Presidential-Proclamation-on-Health-Care.html (Exhibit 2). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 18 of 100\n41.  The Posting states definitively that “if you are applying for an immigrant visa” on \nor after November 3, 2019 “you must demonstrate at the time of the interview” that you meet the \nProclamation’s requirements. It also specifies that an “inability” to meet the Proclamation’s \nrequirements at the time of the interview “will result in the denial of the visa application.” The \nPosting then lists the same exceptions that appear in the Proclamation and the same list of approved \nhealth insurances. Under the heading “Requirement at visa interview,” the Posting specifies that \n“[d]uring the visa interview,” applicants will need to demonstrate that they satisfy the requirements \nof the Proclamation. It informs that applicants that consular officers “will review the medical and \nfinancial documentation that is already part of the applicant’s case file and may request additional \ninformation or documentation as needed.” The Posting also includes a link to the Proclamation \nitself.   \n42.  By its terms, the Posting unequivocally makes clear not only that visa applicants \nhave the obligation to satisfy the Proclamation’s requirements or be denied a visa, but also that \nconsular  officers  will  enforce  the  Proclamation,  which  has  significant  legal  and  practical \nconsequences for visa applicants and their families. It did so without satisfying any of the \nrequirements for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) or demonstrating \ngood cause for diverging from standard agency practice. \n43.  Eleventh-hour action by the State Department purports to offer the opportunity for \nnotice and comment for “information collection” related to the Proclamation, but this only \nhighlights the agency’s failure to act according to the requirements of the APA. Just yesterday, on \nOctober 29, 2019, the Department of State issued a “Notice of Information Collection” for \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 19 of 100\n“Emergency Review”2 (the “Emergency Notice”), which was published in the Federal Register \ntoday (October 30, 2019) and purports to announce a “methodology” established by the Secretary \nof State, as authorized by Section 3 of the Proclamation, “to establish standards and procedures \nfor governing such determinations.” 84 Fed. Reg. 58199 (Oct. 30, 2019); see also Advance Print \nEmergency  Notice  (issued  Oct.  29,  2019),  available  at  https://s3.amazonnews.com/public-\ninspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23639. The Emergency Notice states that “to implement [the \nProclamation] when it goes into effect on November 3, 2019,” consular officers “will verbally ask \nimmigrant visa applicants covered by [the Proclamation] whether they will be covered by health \ninsurance in the United States within 30 days of entry to the United States and, if so, for details \nrelating to such insurance.” If the applicant says yes, “consular officers will ask for applicants to \nidentify the specific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and such other information \nrelated to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary.” The Emergency Notice \nfurther adds that visa applicants will not be suspended “if they do not have coverage, but possess \nfinancial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical expenses.” It defines “reasonably \nforeseeable medical expenses” as “those expenses related to existing medical conditions, relating \nto health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.”  \n44.  The Emergency Notice provides a comment period of less than 48 hours, an \nunusually short period of time, stating that “[a]ll public comments must be received by October \n31, 2019.” It notes that the Proclamation “was signed on October 4, 2019, and emergency review \nof this information collection is necessary for the Department to prepare consular officers to \n \n2 60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection: Public Charge Questionnaire, FED. \nREGISTER, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/24/2019-23219/60-day-notice-\nof-proposed-information-collection-public-charge-questionnaire (last visited on Oct. 27, 2019). \nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23639.pdf  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 20 of 100\nimplement [the Proclamation] when it goes into effect on November 3, 2019.”3 The Emergency \nNotice was not, however, implemented in direct response to any particular event impacting foreign \nrelations. \n45.   Taken together, the Emergency Notice and the Posting make clear that, effective \nNovember 3, consular officers are empowered to determine whether prospective immigrants meet \nthe Proclamation’s requirements, resulting in a direct impact on the rights of immigrants and their \nfamilies. These are definitive actions that reflect the consummation of the agency’s decision-\nmaking process and that affect the substantive rights and obligations of regulated individuals.  \n46.  The Posting and the last-minute Emergency Notice confirm press reports that \ngovernment  officials  were  scrambling  earlier  this  month  to  implement  and  enforce  the \nProclamation by its effective date. On information and best belief, these efforts necessarily include \nDOS officials as well as DHHS and DHS officials. For example, as indicated above, the DHHS \nSecretary “or his designee” has authority under the Proclamation to determine whether a “health \nplan . . . provides adequate coverage for medical care” (though provides no guidance as to how \n“adequate coverage” is defined for such purpose). Proclamation § 1(b)(ix). According to one media \nreport published a week after the Proclamation was signed, government health officials “are \n \n3 The late posting of the Emergency Notice and extremely short notice-and-comment period \nstand in stark contrast to a “60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection” in the Federal \nRegister six days prior on October 24, 2019 (the “Notice”). That Notice proposed and solicited \npublic comments on a new written form, DS-5540, that would ostensibly collect information \nintended to assist consular officers “in assessing whether an applicant is likely to become a \npublic charge,” but stated that a consular officer could ask a visa applicant to fill out certain \nquestions on the same form to assess whether the applicant meets the Proclamation’s \nrequirements. See 60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection: Public Charge \nQuestionnaire, FED. REGISTER, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/24/2019-\n23219/60-day-notice-of-proposed-information-collection-public-charge-questionnaire (last \nvisited on Oct. 27, 2019).https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-\n23219.pdf  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 21 of 100\nwrestling with highly technical questions” as they attempt to implement the Proclamation, despite \n“concerns” that its mandate “may be unworkable and even illegal.”4 Indeed, officials “are confused \nabout numerous aspects of the proclamation, such as whether implementing the new health \ninsurance  requirements  would  fall  to  [the  Center  for  Consumer  Information  and  Insurance \nOversight, within the Department of Health and Human Services] or the State Department.”5 None \nof these deliberations or concerns, which have a direct impact on the legal rights of visa applicants, \nhave been presented to the public as part of any administrative process. \n47.  It  is  no  surprise  that  officials  were  at  least  initially  confused  about  how  to \nimplement the Proclamation, given that the Proclamation is inconsistent with existing immigration \nand healthcare laws, contrary to core constitutional principles, and, moreover, is riddled with \nundefined terms and imprecise standards and appears to ignore many of the practical realities of \nboth this country’s immigration and health care systems. \nC.  The Proclamation is Vague, Internally Contradictory, and Inconsistent with \nExisting Law in Ways State Department Action has Not Addressed \n1.  The Proclamation Uses Unclear, Undefined Terms and Standards  \n48.  The Proclamation’s list of “approved health insurance” plans includes several \noptions that are unclear and undefined. “Catastrophic health insurance,” for example, is one \n“approved” option, but the term can be used generically, to refer to certain high-deductible plans, \nor  specifically,  as  defined  by  the  ACA  with  certain  coverage  parameters  and  eligibility \n \n4 Dan Diamond, Health officials: Trump immigration order could be illegal, POLITICO, \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/11/trump-immigrants-health-insurance-illegal-044716 \n(last visited on Oct. 27, 2019). \n5 Id. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 22 of 100\nrequirements. The Proclamation does not specify what it means when it allows “catastrophic health \ninsurance” as “approved health insurance.” \n49.  Likewise, a variety of forms of financial assistance under the ACA are broadly \navailable to individuals seeking health insurance on the ACA Exchanges—indeed, an Exchange \nenrollee may qualify for some level of assistance if she has a household income from 100 to 400 \npercent  of  the  federal  poverty  level  (“FPL”),6  and  lawfully  present  immigrants  qualify  for \nassistance even if their household income is below 100% FPL if they are not otherwise eligible for \nMedicaid. Such financial assistance can take the form of “premium tax credits” offered to eligible \nenrollees, as well as certain cost-sharing reductions tied to specific “silver” plans, for which \neligibility is based on income. The ACA, however, does not define either of these forms of \nfinancial assistance as a “subsidy.” The Proclamation is silent as to which forms of assistance \nwould render a plan “subsidized,” and therefore not “approved,” health insurance. \n50.  In addition, the Proclamation states that “an alien will financially burden the United \nStates healthcare system . . . unless the alien possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs”—but provides no guidance on what might constitute a “reasonably \nforeseeable medical cost.” Nor does the Proclamation indicate how a consular officer with no \nmedical training should evaluate what medical costs may be “reasonably foreseeable” for a specific \nprospective immigrant, or how the consular offer should assess whether that individual has \nsufficient “financial resources” to cover such costs. The State Department’s Emergency Notice, \npublished today in the Federal Register, defines “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses” as \n \n6 In 2019, the income level necessary for a family of four to qualify for financial assistance \nranged from $25,100 at 100% FPL to $100,400 at 400% FPL. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 23 of 100\n“those expenses related to existing medical conditions, relating to health issues existing at the time \nof visa adjudication” but, again, does not clarify how consular officers are to make that assessment. \n51.  Likewise, the Proclamation states that a visitor health insurance plan may qualify \nas an “approved” health plan if it provides “adequate coverage for medical care”—but provides no \nstandards or definitions that would enable either a would-be immigrant or a non-medically trained \nconsular officer to assess what coverage qualifies as “adequate.” Similarly, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services may approve “any other health plan that provides adequate coverage for \nmedical care,” but the Proclamation is devoid of guidance as to how the Secretary should determine \nthat a plan’s coverage is “adequate,” to say nothing of guidance that would enable prospective \nimmigrants to evaluate whether a potential plan not already enumerated in the Proclamation \nprovides sufficiently “adequate” coverage to qualify as “approved.” \n52.  The Proclamation does provide exceptions to the entry suspension for immigrants \n“whose entry would be in the national interest,” as determined by the Secretary of State, or “whose \nentry would further important United States law enforcement objectives,” as determined by the \nSecretary of State based on a recommendation of the Attorney General. But the Proclamation does \nnot explain what such terms as “national interest” or “important United States law enforcement \nobjectives” mean. There is no indication, in either the text of the Proclamation or the Department \nof State website, of how a prospective immigrant may seek such a determination from the Secretary \nof State or demonstrate her qualifications for such a determination. \n53.  When  making  an  exception  for  immigrants  whose  entry  would  further  “law \nenforcement objectives,” moreover, the Proclamation makes no mention of a special visa, the U \nvisa, which exists specifically for victims of certain crimes who are helpful to law enforcement or \ngovernment officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Although the INA \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 24 of 100\nspecifically allows U visa holders to petition to bring certain family members to the United States \non immigrant visas, the Proclamation is silent as to whether such family members are excepted \nfrom the Proclamation, either under the “law enforcement” provision or otherwise. At best, such \nsilence on the topic creates uncertainty for U-derivative immigrant family members; at worst, it \nindicates  that  such  family  members  are  subject  to  the  Proclamation’s  requirements, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the INA expressly provides for the reunification of U visa families. \n2.  Very Few, if Any of the Proclamation’s “Approved Health Plans” Are Available to \nVisa Applicants  \n \n54.  Beyond  the  Proclamation’s  vague  and  ill-defined  terminology,  most  of  the \nProclamation’s “approved” health insurance plans are not practically or legally available to most \nor all prospective immigrants residing outside the country or within their first 30 days of arrival. \n55.  Medicare plans, for example, are an approved type of health insurance under the \nProclamation, Proclamation § 1(b)(viii), but such coverage is unavailable to immigrants unless \nthey are over 65 years old and have been living continuously in the United States for five years.  \n56.  TRICARE plans and other related coverage, “approved” under § 1(b)(iv) of the \nProclamation, are only available to members of the United States military, their spouses, and \nchildren up to 26 years of age.  \n57.  Employer-sponsored plans also constitute “approved plans” under the Proclamation \n§ 1(b)(i), but employers are permitted under federal law to impose a waiting period of up to 90 \ndays before new employees can be covered by employer-sponsored coverage.7 Seventy-one \n \n7 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-7. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 25 of 100\npercent of employers impose a waiting period, with waiting periods on average lasting 1.9 months.8 \nBeyond that, over two-thirds of immigrants are the beneficiaries of family petitions or other non-\nemployment-based visa applications, and therefore are unlikely to have an employer-sponsored \nplan before even arriving in the United States and acquiring valid work authorization.  \n58.  Although a “family member’s plan” is “approved” under the Proclamation, § \n1(b)(v), it is highly unlikely that most immigrants will be able to obtain coverage through a family \nmember unless they are a spouse or a child under 27. All other relations are not usually considered \na “dependent” eligible to be included in a family health insurance plan.9  \n59.  The  Proclamation  states  that  a  “catastrophic  health  plan”  may  constitute  an \napproved plan, Proclamation § 1(b)(iv), but under the ACA, “catastrophic” plans are available only \nto individuals living in the United States, and eligible enrollees must be either under 30 years of \nage or have qualified for a hardship or affordability exemption. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(e).10 \n60.  The list of “approved” health insurance includes “an unsubsidized health plan \noffered  in  the  individual  market  within  a  State,”  Proclamation  §  1(b)(ii),  but  an  intending \nimmigrant would not be able to obtain such coverage from abroad. Like an ACA-compliant \ncatastrophic plan, any other “unsubsidized” health plan offered in an ACA marketplace is only \n \n8 2018 Employer Health Benefits Survey, KAISER FAMILY FUND, (Oct. 3, 2018), \nhttps://www.kff.org/report-section/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey-section-3-employee-\ncoverage-eligibility-and-participation/  \n9 An employer health plan is only a benefit excludable from income tax if it limits eligibility to \nspouses, children who have not yet attained age 27, and tax dependents. 26 U.S.C. § 105(b), 26 \nC.F.R. § 1.106-1(a). Employers are permitted to limit eligibility further, and indeed, coverage of \nfamily members other than children and spouses or domestic partners is very rare. See \nhttps://www.theabdteam.com/blog/eligibility-parents-group-health-plan/  \n10 Are You Eligible to Use the Marketplace?, HEALTHCARE.GOV, \nhttps://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/eligibility/  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 26 of 100\navailable to individuals living in the United States, in the marketplace’s service area. 45 C.F.R. § \n155.305(a)(3)(i).  \n61.  Further logistics could impede the immigrant’s ability to acquire not only an \n“unsubsidized health plan” but also a “catastrophic health plan” (whether through the ACA \nExchanges or outside of them) within 30 days of entering the United States. Under rules governing \nan insurance policy’s effective date, a newly purchased policy becomes effective on the first day \nof the next month after purchase—but only if the policy was purchased before the fifteenth day of \nthe current month.11 Otherwise, the effective date rolls to the first day of the subsequent month. In \nother words, if an immigrant is so fortunate as to enter the United States under the Proclamation, \nbut unluckily arrives on the 20th of the month, her insurance coverage will not take effect until \nwell after 30 days of arriving in the country. The Proclamation is silent on whether such a \npossibility would prevent a prospective immigrant from satisfying the “approved health insurance” \nrequirement to gain entry.  \n62.  When accounting for the fact that Medicare, TRICARE and other military plans, \nemployer-sponsored plans, family members’ plans, and unsubsidized and catastrophic plans \navailable under the ACA are all practically or legally impossible for most prospective immigrants \nto acquire, the two remaining options for “approved health insurance” under the Proclamation are \nvisitor insurance plans or short-term limited duration insurance (“STLDI”) plans, which in either \ncase must last for a minimum of 364 days. But STLDI plans lasting the minimum required 364 \ndays are not available in almost half the states,12 and many disqualify an individual from coverage \n \n11 See 45 C.F.R. § 155.420(b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.104(b)(2).  \n12 Is Short-term Health Insurance Right for You?, HEALTHINSURANCE.ORG, \nhttps://www.healthinsurance.org/short-term-health-insurance/  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 27 of 100\nif that person is not a United States citizen or resident.13 Neither visitor plans nor STLDI plans, \nmoreover, are required to cover individuals with preexisting conditions or pregnant women, and \nmany do not.14 Such plans can also adjust premiums based on an individual’s health history, \ngender, or (outside specified parameters) age and make them prohibitively, and exploitatively, \nexpensive.15 Indeed, many states are concerned that unscrupulous insurance brokers and STLDI \ninsurers provide misleading information about the costs, deductibles, and coverage associated with \nthese plans.16 \n63.  Even assuming prospective immigrants can acquire visitor insurance plans or \nSTLDI plans, it remains unclear that such insurance plans actually further the Proclamation’s goal \nof “addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the \nAmerican taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.” Visitor and STLDI plans are not \nrequired under the ACA to provide “essential health benefits,” such as hospitalization, prescription \ndrugs, emergency services, and maternity and newborn care. Indeed, the fine print of such policies \ncan exclude coverage for prescription drugs, a tonsillectomy, hernia surgery, prenatal care, \ntreatment of pre-existing conditions an individual does not know about, or even “treatment of \ninjury resulting from participation in organized sports,” like care for a concussion a child receives \n \n13 Short Term Health Insurance Eligibility Information for Short Term Health Insurance, or \nSTM, ELIGIBILITY.COM (Updated Jan. 28, 2019), https://eligibility.com/short-term-health-\ninsurance  \n14 Id. \n15 Id.; see also Rachel Schwab, Coming Up Short: The Problem with Counting Short-Term, \nLimited Duration Insurance as Coverage, CHIRBLOG.ORG (June 7, 2019), Id.; see also \nhttp://chirblog.org/coming-short-problem-counting-short-term-limited-duration-insurance-\ncoverage/  \n16 S.

A Pennsylvania man, for example, was hospitalized for an abnormal heartbeat but \nwas denied coverage under his STLDI plan because of a previous doctor visit for high blood \npressure,  which  led  the  insurer  to  claim  his  hospitalization  was  actually  for  a  preexisting \ncondition.18 Similarly, a Washington, D.C. man’s STLDI plan had a stated maximum payout of \n$750,000, but it paid only $11,780 towards a $211,690 hospitalization bill for heart surgery, in \npart due to a denial of coverage based on his father’s medical history.19 In another case, a woman \nfrom  Illinois  went  to  the  hospital  with  heavy  vaginal  bleeding  and  ended  up  needing  a \nhysterectomy and a five-day hospital stay. She was denied coverage under her STLDI plan on the \nground that her menstrual cycle constituted a pre-existing condition.20  \n65.  Indeed, a substantial share of uncompensated care costs are due to underinsured \nindividuals with high deductibles, excluded services, or low annual limits, which are all common \ncharacteristics of visitor and STLDI plans.21 Even the insurers who offer short-term limited \n \n17 https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/key-flaws-of-short-term-health-plans-pose-risks-to-\nconsumers \n18 Sarah Lueck, Key Flaws of Short-Term Health Plans Pose Risks to Consumers, CTR.

The table below summarizes the options for “approved health insurance” under the \nProclamation and the reasons why such plans are not attainable at all, or attainable by an \ninsignificant number of intending immigrants: \n \nApproved Health Insurance  Limitations on Availability  Additional Barriers to \nPlans  Enrollment \nEmployer-sponsored plan  Available only to individuals  Most employers impose a \nwho have an offer of  waiting period before a new \nemployment that includes  employee can be covered by \nemployer-sponsored  employer-sponsored \ninsurance, as well as work  insurance; waiting periods \nauthorization.  last on average for 1.9 \nmonths, or well over 30 days. \nUnsubsidized health plan  Available only to individuals  Newly arrived immigrants \noffered in the individual  living in the United States.  may not be enrolled within 30 \nmarket within a State  days based on their date of \narrival and the effective date \nthat their coverage begins. \nShort-term limited duration  Available only in about half  Usually not available to \nhealth policy effective for a  the States with the 364-day  individuals with pre-existing \nminimum of 364 days  minimum; often not available  conditions. \nto individuals living outside \nthe United States. \n \none-effect-short-term-coverage-ruleRick Pollack, AHA Statement on Final Rule on Short-Term, \nLimited-Duration Health Insurance Plans, AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (Aug. 1, 2018);   \nhttps://www.aha.org/press-releases/2018-08-01-aha-statement-final-rule-short-term-limited-\nduration-health-insurance  \n22 Comment of American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network et al., Apr. 23, 2018, at 3 \n(noting that sellers of short-term limited duration insurance plans “acknowledge that such plans \nare ‘designed solely to provide temporary insurance during unexpected coverage gaps’”) \n(citation omitted).  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 30 of 100\nCatastrophic plan  Available only to individuals  Newly arrived immigrants \nliving in the United States  may not be enrolled within 30 \nwho are either 30 or younger  days based on their date of \nor who have a  arrival and the effective date \nhardship/affordability  that their coverage begins. \nexemption \nFamily member’s plan  Generally available only to   \nspouses and children 26 or \nyounger. \nMedical Plan under 10  Available only to members of   \nU.S.C. § 55, including  the U.S. military, their \nTRICARE  spouses, and children 26 or \nyounger. \nVisitor health insurance plan    Usually not available to \nthat provides adequate  individuals with pre-existing \ncoverage for medical care for  conditions. \na minimum of 364 days \nMedicare  Available only to individuals   \nat least 65 years old who \nhave been living continuously \nin the United States for 5 \nyears. \n \n3.  The Proclamation Is Internally Inconsistent with Its Stated Goals  \n67.  The Proclamation provides no explanation for how incentivizing—if not effectively \nrequiring—immigrants to buy non-comprehensive or STLDI plans, many of which will likely \nleave an immigrant underinsured after she arrives, is likely to shield taxpayers or hospitals from \nsuch uncovered emergency costs, which the Proclamation decries as “driv[ing] hospitals into \ninsolvency” and “saddl[ing] our healthcare system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with \nhigher costs.”  \n68.  Indeed, the Proclamation appears to be even more self-defeating considering its \nexclusion of “subsidized” ACA health insurance from the list of “approved health insurance” plans \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 31 of 100\nthat would enable immigrants to enter the United States. Unlike visitor insurance or short-term \nlimited duration insurance plans, any ACA-marketplace health insurance plan that also offers \nfinancial assistance is a comprehensive plan that covers a wide range of essential health benefits, \nincluding prescription drugs, hospitalization, prenatal and maternity care, and mental health care. \nFinancial assistance to purchase such qualified health plans is available to individuals with \nhousehold incomes of 100 to 400 percent FPL. Indeed, when passing the ACA, Congress extended \nthe same benefits to immigrants on even more permissive terms, explicitly making assistance \navailable to legally present immigrants even with incomes under 100 percent FPL, including newly \narrived immigrants in their first five years in the country, who are otherwise generally excluded \nfrom most other federal means-tested benefits. But, although Congress expressly made such \nbenefits available to newly arrived immigrants—and in fact intended for such immigrants to arrive, \nthrough this country’s legislatively enacted immigration system—the Proclamation operates to ban \nthose immigrants who would benefit from assistance provided under the ACA.  \n69.  Although  an  immigrant  who  receives  financial  assistance  under  the  ACA  to \npurchase  comprehensive  health  insurance  would  be  better  insured  than  an  immigrant  who \npurchases non-comprehensive visitor or STLDI insurance, the Proclamation bars the former and \nallows the latter, in the name of protecting this nation’s health care system from uncompensated \ncosts incurred by uninsured individuals.  \n70.  Viewed as a whole, the Proclamation is far less than the sum of its parts. Its \nstandards  and  terse  language  are  opaque  when  they  are  not  vague  or  ill-defined.  The \nProclamation’s array of various “approved health insurance” options are, for a significant majority \nof intending immigrants, merely a set of legal or practical impossibilities. When taken to their \nlogical consequence, the incentives it creates for prospective immigrants lead to results that almost \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 32 of 100\ncertainly will not further the Proclamation’s goal of reducing the burden of uncompensated care \nfor uninsured individuals. At best, these disparate parts form an internally inconsistent whole; at \nworst, they smack of bad faith. \n71.  Given the draconian sweep of the Proclamation—indeed, by some estimates, it has \nthe potential to reduce legal immigration by nearly two thirds and affect most, if not nearly all, \nfamily-based and diversity immigrants—the structure, text, and import of the Proclamation all \nsuggest that its ostensible purpose of addressing the burden that uninsured individuals place on \nthis country’s health care system is merely a pretext to rework this country’s immigration system \nin the manner that the President sees fit, in contravention of the laws passed by Congress.   \n72.  The Proclamation, moreover, does not operate in a vacuum. It will be enforced in a \nlegal landscape already shaped by numerous Congressional enactments, including the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, the Public Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, the Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram  Reauthorization  Act,  and  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  and  the  regulations  of  the \nAdministration’s recently promulgated “public charge rule,” which establishes new criteria for \ndetermining whether a would-be immigrant may be deemed inadmissible because she is likely to \nbecome a “public charge”. As set out in more detail below, the Proclamation is in tension, if not \ndirect conflict, with each of these statutory and regulatory schemes, and therefore also with \nCongress’s legislative intent.  \n73.  The Proclamation, moreover, is but the latest link in a long chain of statements and \nactions by this President and his Administration expressing antipathy toward all noncitizens, but \nalso specifically toward immigrants seeking to come to the United States—particularly immigrants \nof color, from Central and Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Since the early days of his \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 33 of 100\nAdministration, the President has consistently called for eliminating the two main ways that \nimmigrants from predominantly nonwhite countries receive visas—the family preference system \nand the diversity visa lottery. After a legislative attempt—the RAISE Act—that failed in 2017, \nand an administrative attempt—the public charge rule—that received overwhelmingly negative \npublic comment, and which has since been enjoined, the Proclamation now appears to be an \nattempt by presidential fiat. The laws and the Constitution of this country do not countenance such \nexecutive overreach. \nTHE PROCLAMATION IMPERMISSIBLY RESHAPES THE NATION’S \nCONGRESSIONALLY-ENACTED HEALTH BENEFIT SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRANTS \nBY PRESIDENTIAL FIAT \nA.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) \n74.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) was originally enacted in 1952 and \nhas since been amended significantly multiple times. Although it now represents “a long series of \nlegislative accretions,”23 it nevertheless creates a system by which this country may grant up to \n675,000 permanent immigrant visas each year, as well as an unlimited number of permanent \nimmigrant visas for the admission of U.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children under the age of \n21. In doing so, the INA, 8 U. S. C. § 1101 et seq., expresses and reflects Congress’s intent that \nforeign  nationals  who  meet  certain  qualifications  may  immigrate  to  the  United  States,  in \nfurtherance of the goals of reunifying families, admitting immigrants with skills that are useful to \nthe United States economy, and promoting diversity.24 \n \n23 Adam B. Cox & Christina M. Rodriguez, The President and Immigration Law Redux, 125 \nYALE L.J. 104, 158-59 (2015). \n24 See Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U.S. 647, 664 (1978). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 34 of 100\n75.  A series of related and interacting statutes, including the Public Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), the Children’s Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act (“CHIPRA”), and the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), likewise express and \nreflect Congress’s intent to extend certain health care-related benefits to legal immigrants. Through \nPRWORA, Congress made significant changes to health care eligibility for noncitizens and \nsimultaneously devolved substantial power to the states to allow the states to replace benefits to \nlegal immigrants through Medicaid, and later through the Children’s Health Insurance Programs \n(“CHIP”),  and  to  receive  federal  matching  funds  when  providing  such  coverage.  Through \nCHIPRA, Congress affirmatively provided federal dollars to fund care for newly arrived legal \nimmigrant children and legal immigrant pregnant women during their first five years in this \ncountry. And through the ACA, Congress made financial assistance in the form of premium tax \ncredits available to both United States citizens and legal immigrants to purchase comprehensive \nhealth coverage.  \n76.  The interaction of these statutes reflects Congress’ intent to keep important health \ncare benefits available to both newly arrived immigrants and qualified foreign nationals, especially \nthe spouses, children, and parents of United States citizens, to ensure that such individuals are \nallowed to immigrate to the United States in the first instance to reunite with family, contribute \ntheir skills to the United States economy, be afforded humanitarian protections, and/or promote \ndiversity. \n77.  In rendering inadmissible all immigrants who are unable either to purchase certain \nenumerated kinds of health insurance or pass an opaque wealth test through categorizing such \nindividuals as “detrimental to the United States”—particularly immigrants who would otherwise \nbe eligible to enter the United States and receive health insurance benefits like Medicaid, CHIP, \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 35 of 100\nor  financial  assistance  under  the  ACA—the  Proclamation  expressly  contravenes  Congress’s \nlegislative intent.  \n78.  The  bedrock  pillars  of  U.S.  immigration  law  allow  immigration  for  family \nreunification, for business purposes, for humanitarian considerations, and to promote diversity.  To \nthat end, Congress has set forth a comprehensive system to allow limited “worldwide immigration” \nbased on an allocation of “family-based visas,” “employment-based visas” and “diversity-based” \nvisas. 8 U.S.C. § 1151(a). Section 1151 of the INA sets an annual minimum family-sponsored \npreference  limit  of  226,000;  the  worldwide  level  for  annual  employment-based  preference \nimmigrants is at least 140,000. A maximum of fifty-five thousand visas each year are available \nthrough a diversity visa lottery, open to nationals of countries with historically low rates of \nimmigration to the United States. \n79.  A family member or employer seeking to “sponsor” a noncitizen for an immigrant \nvisa must first file either a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, or Form I-140, Petition for \nAlien Workers, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service on behalf of the \n“beneficiary.” This form establishes the necessary family or employer-employee relationship that \nexists to allow for an immigrant visa. Once the beneficiary of an approved immigrant petition has \nan immigrant visa number that is immediately available, there are two ways to apply for lawful \npermanent resident status (“Green Card”). If the beneficiary is outside of the United States, he or \nshe must apply at a U.S. Department of State consulate abroad for an immigrant visa in order to \ncome to the United States and be admitted as a permanent resident. This pathway is referred to as \nconsular processing. If the beneficiary is already in the United States, she may attempt to apply for \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 36 of 100\npermanent resident status without having to return to her home country to complete processing. \nThis process is called adjustment of status.25 See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). \n80.  Section 1152 of the INA prescribes that the per-country limit for preference \nimmigrants is set at 7% of the total annual family-sponsored and employment-based preference \nlimits, i.e., 25,620. The dependent area limit is set at 2%, or 7,320. This means that no single nation \ncan receive more than 7 percent of the total green cards issued in a year (unless they would \notherwise go unused).  \n81.  Among  family-based  immigrants,  Congress  has  prioritized  the  admission  of \n“immediate relatives,” which is defined as “the children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the \nUnited States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21 years of age.” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1151(b). These familial relations have been carved out of certain exceptions to the various \nnumerical limitations on immigrant visas, and thus visas are always and immediately available for \nthese qualifying family members \n82.  The allocation of immigrant visas subject to the numerical limitations is governed \nby  8  U.S.C.  §  1153.  Subsection  (a)  sets  forth  preference  allocations  for  family-sponsored \nimmigrants; subsection (b) sets forth the preference allocations for employment-based visas. See, \n \n25 If an individual present in the United States does not qualify for adjustment of status, she must \ntravel abroad for a consular interview to obtain her immigrant visa.  Some applicants who have \naccrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence while in the United States, but have no other \nbars to admissibility, may obtain an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility to overcome the unlawful \npresence bars under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B) before they can return. The I-601A waiver process \nallows those individuals who are statutorily eligible for an immigrant visa (immediate relatives, \nfamily-sponsored or employment-based immigrants as well as Diversity Visa selectees) who \nonly need a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence to apply for that waiver in the United \nStates and remain with their family members before they depart for their immigrant visa \ninterview abroad. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 37 of 100\ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)(1) (“Qualified Immigrants who are the unmarried sons and daughters of \ncitizens of the United States shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed 23,400.”). \n83.  Section 1153(e) provides that family-sponsored and employment-based preference \nvisas “shall” be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition on behalf of each has \nbeen filed, that is, according to the “priority date” of the visa petition. \n84.  A family member or employee may not apply for lawful permanent residence \nabroad until a visa is immediately available. The Department of State issues a monthly Visa \nBulletin organized according to country of origin and visa preference category.26  \n85.  If there are sufficient visas available for applicants from a specific country and of \na specific preference category, then the Visa Bulletin lists that combination as “current,” and all \napplicants matching that combination may file an application regardless of their priority date, or \nthe date the visa was received by the agency. If there are insufficient visas available for all known \napplicants of a specific combination, however, the Visa Bulletin lists a cut-off date, and only those \napplicants who have priority dates earlier than the cut-off date may file an application. Sometimes, \na cut-off date may retrogress, meaning that fewer visas are available than previously projected. \nWhen that happens to an applicant whose application is already filed, the applicant is forced to \nwait  until  the  cut-off  date  again  progresses  past  his  priority  date  for  his  application  to  be \nadjudicated.  \n86.  Before the issuance of an immigrant visa, the noncitizen must establish that she is \neligible for admission to the country. Section 1101(a)(13)(A) of Title 8 defines “admission” to \n \n26 See, e.g., Visa Bulletin for November 2019, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2020/visa-bulletin-for-\nnovember-2019.html (last visited Oct. 27, 2019). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 38 of 100\nmean “the lawful entry of a noncitizen into the United States after inspection and authorization by \nan immigration officer.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A).  \n87.  Section 1182 of Title 8, INA § 212, is titled “Inadmissible Aliens” and sets forth \nten classes of noncitizens “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United \nStates.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a) (prescribing the inadmissibility of, inter alia, noncitizens who have a \ncommunicable disease of public health significance, those convicted of two or more criminal \noffenses, those who engaged in terrorist activities).  \n88.  Under  the  system  set  out  in  the  INA,  family-based  petitions  account  for \napproximately 65% of the immigrant visas granted every year. The diversity lottery visa system \naccounts for approximately 4.5%. \n89.  In  addition  to  the  comprehensive  system  for  the  allocation  of  family-based, \nemployment-based, and diversity visas, Congress has authorized multiple special categories for \nimmigrants from abroad based on specific humanitarian considerations. For example, a qualifying \nbattered spouse, child or parent may file an immigrant visa petition under the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA), as amended by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). See generally \n8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1186(c)(4). Among other sympathetic considerations to victims \nof abuse, VAWA created special provisions in United States immigration law to protect victims \nof  abuse  who  are  not  citizens  of  the  United  States. Id. In  cases  of  domestic  violence,  US \nimmigration law allows certain victims of abuse who are not citizens to obtain lawful status \nwithout having to rely on their abuser to petition. Id. Qualifying applicants may apply self-petition \nfor an immigrant visa abroad and subsequently enter the United States as immigrants if the abuser \nis an employee of the U.S. government, the abuser is a member of the uniformed services, or the \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 39 of 100\napplicant  was  subjected  to  battery  or  extreme  cruelty  in  the  United  States. 8  U.S.C.  §§ \n1154(a)(1)(A)(v), (a)(1)(B)(iv). \n90.  In addition, the U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain \ncrimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or \ngovernment officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity; it provides a pathway \nto lawful permanent residence and subsequently citizenship after 3 years of residence in the United \nStates. See generally 8 U.S.C. § 101(a)(15)(U). Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with \nthe passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered \nImmigrant Women Protection Act, Pub. L. 106-386) in October 2000. Under the provisions of this \nstatute, a U nonimmigrant may also petition for certain family members to receive a “derivative U \nvisa.” While many such eligible family members will already have entered the United States with \na derivative U visa before the principal U nonimmigrant receives a green card after three years of \nresidence, those family members who do not may apply for an immigrant visa abroad. See 8 U.S.C. \n§  245(m)(3)  (upon  the  approval  of  an  adjustment  of  status  application  for  a  principal  U \nnonimmigrant, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status or issue an immigrant \nvisa to a spouse, a child, or in the case of an alien child, a parent who did not receive a [derivative \nU visa] under section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii)” of the INA.); 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(g). \n91.  The Proclamation’s suspension of entry does violence to this legislatively enacted \nimmigration scheme that synthesizes considerations of national origin, merit, race, humanitarian, \nand  family-based  preferences—principles  that  have  formed  the  bedrock  of  this  nation’s \nimmigration system for decades—and replaces it with a single inquiry: does the prospective \nimmigrant have a specific kind of health insurance or sufficient financial resources to pay for what \na consular officer considers to be reasonably foreseeable medical costs? The United States \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 40 of 100\nimmigration system has never countenanced anything approaching such a standard for admission, \nwhich  would  disproportionately  affect  immigrants  who  are  from  predominantly  nonwhite \ncountries and either seeking to reunite with family already here in the United States, or fear being \nseparated from family in the United States when they leave for a consular interview. Once \neffective, the Proclamation will ban nearly two thirds of all noncitizens legally permitted under the \nINA to immigrate to the United States, and will separate thousands of families indefinitely. \n92.  In effectively barring most legal and otherwise qualified immigrants from entering \nthe country because they cannot afford health care completely out of pocket, the Proclamation \nthwarts the carefully considered Congressional scheme that provides health care-related benefits \nto new and recently arrived immigrants via a combination of federal and state-elected programs. \nOver the past two decades, Congress—and the States, at Congressional behest—have acted to \nprovide certain benefits specifically to such immigrants. But the Proclamation would ban most \nimmigrants from entering the United States precisely because they would be entitled to such \nbenefits if they came. \nB.

Under  the  Personal  Responsibility  Work  Opportunity  Reconciliation  Act \n(“PRWORA”), passed in 1996, Congress restricted the availability of certain means-tested benefits \nfor newly arrived immigrants, but gave states the ability to fill in this gap by electing to provide \ncoverage to such individuals. Before PRWORA’s enactment, legal immigrants living in the United \nStates were eligible for public benefits on similar terms as citizens. After enactment, however, \nPRWORA  has  generally  barred  all  new  legal  immigrants,  excepting  certain  humanitarian \ncategories, including but not limited to asylees and refugees, from receiving federal means-tested \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 41 of 100\npublic benefits, such as Medicaid, TANF, SNAP, and SSI, for five years after their arrival in the \nUnited States. \n94.  Despite redrawing immigrant eligibility for federal benefits, PRWORA expressly \ndevolved broad new powers to the states, in relevant part authorizing, but not requiring, states to \nuse state-only funds to offer food, cash, and health-related benefit programs as a substitute for lost \nfederal benefits for legal immigrants. A number of states took advantage of this “gap-filling” \nauthority to use state funds to provide TANF, SNAP, SSI, and/or Medicaid to legal immigrants \nsubject to the five-year bar. States were, for example, given the option under PRWORA to use \nstate funds to continue coverage to immigrants under Medicaid during their first five years in the \ncountry. \nC.  The Children’s Health Insurance Plan (“CHIP”) and CHIP Reauthorization Act \n95.  Congress subsequently reinforced PRWORA’s grant of power to the states to \nprovide health care-related benefits to legal immigrants under federal health care programs through \nthe Children’s Health Insurance Plan (“CHIP”). The original State Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram was enacted in 1997 with bi-partisan support to act as a complement to Medicaid, the \nnation’s major health coverage for low-income children, by giving states financial support to \nprovide coverage to uninsured, low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid. The \nprogram was reauthorized on February 4, 2009, through the Children’s Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act (“CHIPRA”), which passed with bi-partisan support and was one of the first \npieces of legislation signed by President Obama. \n96.  The original CHIP expanded health insurance coverage to low-income children \nineligible for Medicaid by providing block grants to states that must be matched with state dollars. \nUnder the law, states could use their federal CHIP funds to finance coverage for children whose \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 42 of 100\nfamily incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid, either by expanding their already existing \nMedicaid programs, creating a separate CHIP program, or a combination of those two approaches. \nIndeed, under the matching rates required under the program, the federal government bears a \nhigher percentage of the overall cost of CHIP than it does under Medicaid. All states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, currently use CHIP funds to expand publicly funded health insurance \ncoverage to uninsured children who are ineligible for Medicaid; most states cover children up to \nor above 200% of the federal poverty level.27 In the same vein as PRWORA, the original CHIP \nalso authorized States to provide coverage to newly arrived legal immigrant children, who were \notherwise ineligible to enroll in either Medicaid or CHIP for their first five years in the country, \nbut States doing so had to fund such coverage with state-only dollars.  \n97.  CHIPRA reauthorized CHIP and provided states with significant new funding, new \nprogrammatic options such as dental coverage, and a range of new incentives to provide Medicaid \nand CHIP coverage to uninsured, low-income children, especially those who may be eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP but who are not enrolled. CHIPRA also established new options and federal \nfunding for states to cover pregnant women, as well as legal immigrant children and legal \nimmigrant pregnant women during their first five years in the country. Thirty-one states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, now cover legal immigrant children, legal immigrant pregnant women, or \n \n27 Medicaid/CHIP Coverage of Lawfully-Residing Immigrant Children and Pregnant Women, \nKAISER FAMILY FUND, https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-chip-\ncoverage-of-lawfully-residing-immigrant-children-and-pregnant-\nwomen/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:\n%22asc%22%7D.

The Affordable Care Act  \n98.  In 2010, Congress passed comprehensive health reform, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct (“HCERA”) (together, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” or “Obamacare”) into law. 124 \nStat. 119. The PPACA contains 10 titles covering over 900 pages, as well as additional provisions \nunder the HCERA. In at least three relevant ways, the ACA was intended to expand access to \nmeaningful  and  affordable  health  insurance  coverage  for  all  U.S.  residents,  including  legal \nimmigrants, at a guaranteed minimum level of coverage.  \n99.  First, to facilitate broad health insurance enrollment nationwide, the ACA required \nthe creation of a marketplace, or exchange, in each state so that residents can shop for insurance. \nThese  marketplaces  took  the  form  of  state-run-exchanges,  a  federally  facilitated  exchange \navailable at the healthcare.gov website, or a hybrid of the two.29 \n \n28 Medicaid and CHIP Coverage of Lawfully Residing Children and Pregnant Women, \nMEDICAID.GOV, https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/outreach-and-enrollment/lawfully-\nresiding/index.html  \n29 As enacted, the ACA required most United States citizens and legal residents to purchase and \nmaintain health insurance or pay a penalty. However, President Trump and a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress eliminated the financial penalty that an individual would incur if she failed \nto maintain health insurance as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (see \nhttps://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 44 of 100\n100.  Second, to ensure a certain standard of coverage, the ACA required health insurers, \nincluding those who participated in the state and federal Exchanges and those selling plans outside \nof it, to provide plans that cover “essential health benefits,” including hospitalization, prescription \ndrugs, mental health services, ambulatory patient services, maternity and newborn care, mental \nhealth  and  substance  use  disorder  services,  preventive  and  wellness  services,  and  pediatric \nservices, including oral and vision care. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(b)(1). All individual market plans, \nincluding ACA-defined and regulated catastrophic health plans, must provide such essential health \nbenefits, must cover preexisting conditions and may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on \ncore coverage.30 Short-term limited duration insurance plans, however, are ACA-exempt and \ncannot be offered or purchased on ACA exchanges. As a result, they are non-comprehensive and \ndo not provide the full range of essential health benefits, can and often do deny coverage based on \npreexisting conditions, and can and often do impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on core \ncoverage. \n101.  Third,  the  ACA  provides  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  income-related, \npremium-based tax credits (“PTCs” or “APTCs”) to individuals with household incomes between \n100 and 400% of the federal poverty line. 26 U.S.C. § 36B. For newly arrived legal immigrants \nwho are subject to PRWORA’s five-year bar on means-tested public benefits, the ACA allows \nPTCs on more permissive terms, also including individuals below 100% of the federal poverty \nline. 26 U.S.C. § 36(b)(c)(1)(B). In 2019, under DHHS Federal Poverty Guidelines, the income \nlevel necessary for a family of four to qualify for financial assistance ranged from $25,100 at 100% \nFPL to $100,400 at 400% FPL.  \n \n30 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-3, 300gg-11. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 45 of 100\n102.  Taken together, these three components of the ACA promote the overarching goals \nof  robust  nationwide  enrollment,  protections  for  consumers  through  coverage  that  is \ncomprehensive  and  does  not  bar  eligibility  based  on  preexisting  conditions,  and  increased \naffordability for health insurance coverage. Robust enrollment in comprehensive coverage plans \npromotes insurance market stability and more affordable premiums across the market, as the robust \nenrollment of healthy individuals allows distributing costs for less healthy individuals across a \nlarger pool of enrollees. More affordable premiums, in turn, spurs more robust enrollment. \n103.  The  ACA’s  structure  and  operation  also  evinces  Congress’s  intent  that  legal \nimmigrants, including newly and recently arrived immigrants, be able to participate fully in the \nACA marketplace to enroll in comprehensive health care and to receive financial assistance if \nnecessary. The benefits available under the ACA, especially when considered in connection with \nthe benefits that the states and federal government have made available to newly and recently \narrived legal immigrants under PRWORA and CHIPRA, make clear that Congress intended for \nlegal immigrants to be able to receive specific health care-related benefits to ensure a minimum \nlevel of health care coverage upon their arrival in the United States. \n104.  The  Proclamation  directly  conflicts  with  this  benefits  scheme,  disqualifying \n“subsidized” health insurance offered on ACA Exchanges as “approved health insurance” that \nwould permit entry to the United States. The effect of the Proclamation is to prevent would-be \nimmigrants, who would otherwise be fully qualified under the INA to come to the United States, \nfrom entering and receiving the benefits Congress expressly intended for them to have.  \n105.  Moreover, as noted above, visitor insurance and STLDI plans are the only two \noptions for “approved health insurance” that are realistically and feasibly available to most \nprospective immigrants outside the United States, especially those who are not entering with an \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 46 of 100\noffer of employment that includes employer-sponsored health insurance. Because such plans are \nless regulated under the ACA than individual market plans, carriers of such plans will no doubt \nrise to meet the new demand the Proclamation will invariably create. But in driving a majority of \nnew immigrants towards these non-comprehensive plans—for a minimum of 364 days, no less, or \ntheir first year in the United States—the Proclamation undermines not only the ACA’s goal of \nproviding a certain minimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants in the United States, but \nalso its own stated goal of addressing the burdens of uncompensated care provided to uninsured \nindividuals.  \nREGULATORY BACKGROUND \n106.  In addition to entering a stage already set by PRWORA, CHIPRA, and the ACA, \nthe Proclamation follows hot on the heels of the Trump Administration’s recently promulgated \n(and recently enjoined) “Public Charge Rule,” which attempts to change what it means to be \ndeemed a “public charge,” one of the ten enumerated grounds of inadmissibility under the INA. \nIgnoring decades of legislation and case law, the new Rule attempts to redefine the term “public \ncharge” and reshape the “totality of circumstances” framework that immigration officials apply to \ndetermine whether a person seeking admission is likely to become a public charge. The new Rule \nwas enjoined from taking effect on October 15, 2019 by numerous courts. Each court found the \nnew definition of “public charge” contrary to Congress’ plain meaning and intent.31  \n \n31 New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security,  No. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD), 2019 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 177323 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019); Make the Rd. N.Y. v. Cuccinelli, 19 Civ. 7993 (GBD), \n2019 U.S. Dist.

Oct. 14, 2019). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  43 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 47 of 100\n107.  Both  the  Proclamation  and  the  new  Rule  effectively  turn  the  question  of \nadmissibility to the United States into a receipt-of-benefits issue. The Rule was promulgated by \nthe Department of Homeland Security via formal notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA; \nthe Proclamation was not.  \nTHE PROCLAMATION, LIKE THE RECENT PUBLIC CHARGE RULE, ATTEMPTS \nTO RADICALLY REWRITE CONGRESS’ CHOICES ON WHICH IMMIGRANTS \nMAY ENTER THE COUNTRY, BASED ON WEALTH CONSIDERATIONS \n108.  The State Department’s actions to implement the Proclamation without satisfying \nthe requirements of notice and comment rulemaking layer one form of lawlessness on another. The \nProclamation, like the recent Public Charge Rule, attempts to radically rewrite Congressional \ndecision about which immigrants may enter the country based on wealth considerations. \n109.  The nation’s immigration laws have long included a prohibition on admitting non-\ncitizens deemed to be a “public charge” on the country. This definition has evolved over time but \nhas never erected the kind of broad entry barrier that the Proclamation permits.  \n110.  In 1882, Congress enacted the country’s first immigration laws, which refused \nforeign nationals permission “to land” in the United States “if on such examination there shall be \nfound among such passengers any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of \nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge.” See An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 \nStat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2 (1882) (“1882 Act”) (emphasis added). \n111.  In 1891, Congress amended the 1882 Act to provide, in part,  \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States . . . : All idiots, insane persons, \npaupers  or  persons  likely  to  become  a  public  charge,  persons \nsuffering  from  a  loathsome  or  a  dangerous  contagious  disease, \npersons who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous \ncrime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polygamists, and \n. . . . \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 48 of 100\nAn Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of Aliens \nUnder Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 (“1891 Act”) §§ 1, 11 \n(1891).  \n112.  Congress subsequently amended immigration laws in 1903, 1907, and 1910 without \nmaterially altering the authorization to refuse entry to a noncitizen deemed a “public charge.”32  \nThe 1910 Act provided, for example: \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States: All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\nminded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who have \nbeen insane within five years previous; persons who have had two \nor more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons \nlikely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons \nafflicted  with  tuberculosis  or  with  a  loathsome  or  dangerous \ncontagious disease; persons not comprehended within any of the \nforegoing excluded classes who are . . . mentally or physically \ndefective, such mental or physical defect being of a nature which \nmay affect the ability of such alien to earn a living; persons who \nhave been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other \ncrime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . \n. . .” \n1910 Act § 2. \n113.  In 1915, The Supreme Court considered a “single question, . . . whether an alien \ncan be declared likely to become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the city of \nhis immediate destination is overstocked.” See Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 9-10 (1915).  \n114.  In answering “no” to the question, the Supreme Court interpreted the term “Persons \nlikely  to  become  a  public  charge”  in  context,  that  is,  as  “mentioned  between  paupers  and \nprofessional beggars, and along with idiots, persons dangerously diseased, persons certified by the \n \n32 An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 32 Stat. 1213, Chap. 1012 \n§ 2 (1903); An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 34 Stat. 898, \nChap. 1134 § 2 (1907); An Act to Amend an Act entitled An Act to Regulate the Immigration of \nAliens Into the United States, 36 Stat. 263, Chap. 128 § 2 (1910). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 49 of 100\nexamining surgeon to have a mental or physical defect of a nature to affect their ability to earn a \nliving,  convicted  felons,  prostitutes  and  so  forth.”  Id.  The  Court  held  that  “[t]he  persons \nenumerated  in  short  are  to  be  excluded  on  the  ground  of  permanent  personal  objections \naccompanying them irrespective of local conditions,” and thus not according to local or temporary \nconditions impacting their self-sufficiency. Id. at 10. \n115.  After Gegiow, federal courts and immigration officials universally understood the \nterm public charge as referring to persons with “a mental or physical defect of a nature to affect \ntheir ability to make a living,” that is, those substantially, if not entirely, dependent on government \nassistance on a long-term basis.33   \n116.  In the century since the Gegiow decision, Congress has made numerous changes to \nimmigration law, most notably the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. An Act to Revise the \nLaws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality; and for Other Purposes, 66 Stat. \n163, 183, Title 2, Chap. 2 (“1952 Act”) § 212 (1952). It has continued to use “public charge” as a \nbasis for denying entry to noncitizens, but it has never offered its own definition of the term. It \nhas, however, rejected attempts to adopt a definition contrary to the understanding developed in \nlegislative history and case law.  \n117.  In  1996,  for  example,  Congress  enacted  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 531, 110 Stat. 3009, 3674-75 \n(1996),  which  amended  the  INA  by  codifying  five  factors  relevant  to  a  public  charge \n \n33 See, e.g., United States ex rel. De Sousa v. Day, 22 F.2d 472, 473-74 (2d Cir. 1927); United \nStates ex rel. La Reddola v. Tod, 299 F. 592, 592-93 (2d Cir. 1924); Howe v. United States ex \nrel.

Dec. 136, 137 \n(B.I.A. 1974). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  46 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 50 of 100\ndetermination. In the course of enacting IIRIRA, members of Congress debated whether to expand \nthe public charge definition to include use of non-cash public benefits such as Medicaid and CHIP. \nSee Immigration Control & Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, H.R. 2202, 104th Cong. § 202 \n(1996) (early House bill that would have defined public charge for purposes of removal to include \nreceipt by a non-citizen of Medicaid, supplemental food assistance, SSI, and other means-tested \npublic benefits). The Senate, however, rejected the effort to include previously unconsidered, non-\ncash public benefits in the public charge test. It also rebuffed the attempt to create a bright-line \nframework of considering whether the immigrant has received public benefits for an aggregate of \ntwelve months as “too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the same public \nassistance that many Americans need to get on their feet.” S. Rep. No. 104-249, at *63−64 (1996) \n(Senator Leahy’s remarks). Accordingly, in its final bill, Congress did not include the receipt of \nMedicaid, CHIP, supplemental food assistance, SSI, and other means-tested public benefits. as \ndeterminative of a public charge.34 See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \n118.  The public charge ground of inadmissibility, as amended in IIRIRA, provides: \n“[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \nthe opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, \nis likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”35 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). When \ndetermining whether an applicant is inadmissible as a public charge, the statute instructs the officer \nto consider “at a minimum” the applicant’s age; health; family status; assets, resources, and \n \n34 Congress rejected a similar attempt to expand the public charge definition in 1994 when \nconsidering the Immigration Stabilization Act, see S. 1923 (103rd), § 501 \n(https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/s1923/text). \n35 Certain groups of noncitizens, such as asylum seekers and refugees, are not subject to \nexclusion based on an assessment that they are likely to become a public charge.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1157 (refugee); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c) (refugee). \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 51 of 100\nfinancial status; and education and skills. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). The officer “may also \nconsider any affidavit of support under section 213A [8 U.S.C. § 1183a] for purposes of exclusion” \non the public charge ground. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). \n119.  In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), a precursor to the US \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and \nfield guidance intended to “summarize longstanding law with respect to public charge and provide \nnew guidance on public charge determinations” following the passage of IIRIRA. 64 Fed. Reg. \n26,689 (May 26, 1999) (the “Field Guidance”). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Inadmissibility \nand Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676 (May 26, 1999) (to be codified \nat 8 C.F.R., pts. 212 & 237) (“1999 Proposed Rule”); Field Guidance on Deportability and \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (Mar. 26, 1999) (\"1999 Field \nGuidance\"). The 1999 Proposed Rule and Field Guidance defined “public charge” to mean “an \nalien  who  is  likely  to  become  primarily  dependent  on  the  Government  for  subsistence  as \ndemonstrated by either (i) The receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance purposes, \nor (ii) Institutionalization for long-term care at Government expense (other than imprisonment for \nconviction of a crime).” 1999 Proposed Rule, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,681; 1999 Field Guidance, 64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,689. The 1999 Rulemaking clarified in particular that the INS had adopted this \ndefinition “based on the plain meaning of the word ‘charge,’ the historical context of public \ndependency when the public immigration provisions were first enacted more than a century ago, \nand the expertise of the benefit-granting agencies that deal with subsistence issues.” 64 Fed. Reg. \nat 28,677. \n120.  The  Field  Guidance  further  directed  service  officers  “to  assess  the  financial \nresponsibility of the alien by examining the ‘totality of the alien's circumstances’ at the time of his \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 52 of 100\nor her application * * * The existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the sole \ncriterion for determining if an alien is likely to become a public charge.” 1999 Field Guidance, 64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,690 (emphasis in original). \n121.  The 1999 Field Guidance, which was made consistent with the Department of \nState’s understanding, reaffirmed that “[i]t has never been Service policy that any receipt of \nservices or benefits paid for in whole or in part from public funds renders an alien a public charge, \nor indicates that the alien is likely to become a public charge. The nature of the public program \nmust be considered. For instance, attending public schools, taking advantage of school lunch or \nother supplemental nutrition programs, or receiving emergency medical care would not make an \nalien inadmissible as a public charge, despite the use of public funds.” 1999 Field Guidance, 64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,692 (citing FAM § 40.41 n.9.1 (1999)). \n122.  The 1999 Field Guidance also emphasized that the purpose in issuing the proposed \nrule and field guidance was intended to end “confusion about the relationship between the receipt \nof public benefits and the concept of ‘public charge’ [that] has deterred eligible aliens and their \nfamilies, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits that \nthey are legally entitled to receive. This reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not \njust on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare.” 1999 Field Guidance, \n64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. \n123.  The  1999  Field  Guidance  specifically  exempted  “Medicaid  and  other  health \ninsurance and health services (including public assistance for immunizations and for testing and \ntreatment of symptoms of communicable diseases; use of health clinics, short-term rehabilitation \nservices, and emergency medical services) other than support for long-term institutional care” from \npublic charge determinations. 1999 Field Guidance, 64 Fed.

Although the 1999 Proposed Rule was never finalized, the 1999 Field Guidance \nhas governed public charge admissibility determinations since that time—nearly two decades.  \n125.  On October 10, 2018, DHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (the “Rule” \nor the “Public Charge Rule”), Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, which rescinded the \n1999 Rulemaking, redefined “public charge,” and amended the totality-of-the-circumstances \nstandard prescribed by the 1999 Field Guidance. 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018) (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248).  \n126.  The proposed rule followed President Trump’s failed attempt to garner broad \ncongressional support for the 2017 the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy \n(RAISE) Act, which would have eliminated the INA’s system of allocating immigration visas \naccording to family, employment, and diversity categories and replacing it with a points-based \n“merit” system “to prioritize immigrants based on the skills they bring to our Nation while \nsafeguarding the jobs of American workers.”36  \n127.  After  a  60-day  notice-and-comment  period,  in  which  it  received  266,077 \ncomments, DHS finalized and issued the Rule on August 14, 2019, notwithstanding the fact that \nthe “vast majority of [comments] . . . opposed the rule.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,304. The Rule was \nscheduled to become effective on October 15, 2019.  \n128.  The Rule redefined a “public charge” to include any noncitizen “who receives one \nor more public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period \n(such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).” 84 Fed. Reg. \n41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a)). Unlike the previous Field Guidance definition of \n \n36 President Donald J. Trump Backs RAISE Act, WHITEHOUSE.GOV (Aug. 2, 2017) \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-backs-raise-act/ \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  50 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 54 of 100\n“public  charge,”  which  focused  specifically  on  the  receipt  of  cash  benefits  or  long-term \ninstitutionalization, the Rule defines “public benefit” as both cash benefits and noncash benefits, \nincluding  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (“TANF”),  Supplemental  Nutrition \nAssistance Program (“SNAP,” also known as “food stamps”), Medicaid, and public housing and \nSection 8 housing assistance. Id.; see also 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b).  \n129.  The Rule also significantly altered the totality-of-the-circumstances framework, \nassigning different weights to certain factors labeled as positive, negative, heavily positive, and \nheavily negative, which a DHS officer must weigh “individually and cumulatively.” 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,397; see also id. at 41,502-04.  \n130.  A prospective immigrant is given heavy negative weight if, for example, she has a \nmedical condition requiring “extensive medical treatment” and is “uninsured and has neither the \nprospect of obtaining private health insurance, nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs related to such medical condition.” 84 Fed. Reg. 41,504; see also 8 \nC.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(i), (iii). A prospective immigrant would receive heavy positive weight for \n“an annual income . . . of at least 250 percent of the [Federal Poverty Guidelines] for the alien’s \nhousehold size” or for “private health insurance that is not subsidized under the Affordable Care \nAct.” See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)(ii), (iii). The consular officer must also consider, among other \nthings,  the  immigrant’s  age;  household  income;  household  size;  credit  score;  education; \noccupational skills, certifications, or licenses; and English fluency. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b).  \n131.  As Trump Administration officials have acknowledged, the cumulative effect of \nthese changes would substantially burden immigrants with disabilities and lower incomes—and in \nparticular, non-white immigrants who are not from Europe—to demonstrate their admissibility. \nWhen Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of USCIS, was asked whether the proposed Rule conflicted \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 55 of 100\nwith the New Colossus poem by Emma Lazarus inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty, he \namended the poem as follows: “Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two \nfeet, and who will not become a public charge.” 37 Shortly thereafter, he clarified his understanding \nthat New Colossus “was referring to people coming from Europe.”38  \n132.  Expert analysis confirmed that the Rule “could shift legal immigration away from \nLatin America and towards Europe” due to its emphasis on income.39 The Migration Policy \nInstitute, for example, examined immigrants who had received legal permanent residence within \nthe last five years to explore the potential scope of the Rule’s impact. MPI analysts found that 69% \nof immigrants who had received legal permanent residence within the last five years had at least \none negative factor under the Rule, and that the Rule would have “a disproportionate effect on \nwomen,  children,  and  the  elderly.”40  In  particular,  among  “recently  arrived  legally  present \nnoncitizens[,] 71 percent of Mexicans and Central Americans, 69 percent of Africans, and 52 \npercent of Asian immigrants would fail to meet the threshold” of incomes or financial assets above \n250% of the federal poverty line, a heavily weighted factor under the Rule.41 In short, “the impact \n \n37 Jacey Fortin, ‘Huddled Masses’ in Statue of Liberty Poem Are European, Trump Official Says, \nNY TIMES (Aug. 14, 2019) https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/cuccinelli-statue-liberty-\npoem.html  \n38 Id. \n39 Randy Capps et al., Gauging the Impact of DHS’ Proposed Public-Charge Rule on U.S. \nImmigration, MIGRATION POLICY INST.

The anticipated effects of the Proclamation are similar to those of the now-enjoined \nRule. This can hardly be surprising, given that both share significant similarities: Both favor \n“unsubsidized” ACA coverage over subsidized; the use of Medicaid is a negative or disqualifying \nfactor for adults 18 and over; and both involve some analysis on the part of a consular officer as \nto  whether  an  intending  immigrant  has  sufficient  financial  resources  to  cover  “reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs.”  \n135.  How the Rule and the Proclamation achieve these effects, however, is where the \ntwo differ. When promulgating the Rule, the Trump Administration made at least some attempt to \ncomply with the strictures of the Administrative Procedure Act—just as Senators Tom Cotton and \nDavid Perdue, two allies of the President in the Senate, attempted to comply with the legislative \nprocesses of Congress when sponsoring the RAISE Act. The Proclamation, by contrast, is an \nimproper attempt to legislate by presidential fiat, followed by invalid agency action to implement \nthose improper orders.

The Proclamation Does Not Pass Muster Under Section 212(f) or Rational Basis \nReview  \n \n136.  The Proclamation purports to be grounded in the President’s authority under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(f), which allows the President to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of \naliens” whenever the President “finds that the entry” of such “aliens into the United States would \nbe detrimental to the interests of the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). But in suspending the \nentry of potentially two thirds of all legal immigrants to the United States, the Proclamation \nrepresents an unprecedented abuse of the §1182(f) power. Although the Supreme Court found that \nthe Muslim Ban represented a permissible exercise of the President’s broad authority to impose \nentry restrictions under § 1182(f) based on national security considerations, the Proclamation \nstrains even the generous analysis of Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018).  \n137.  Indeed, the Supreme Court’s decision in Hawaii is bound up in the circumstances \nof the proclamation at issue in that case, “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for \nDetecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats.” \nThe  Court  took  pains  to  note,  for  example,  that  the  Muslim  Ban  “supports  Congress’s \nindividualized approach for determining inadmissibility” because it was intended to “promote[] \nthe effectiveness of the [consular officer] vetting process by helping to ensure the availability” of \n“sufficient (and sufficiently reliable) information” to assess a visa applicant’s admissibility. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2411. It also observed that previous suspensions under § 1182(f) often \ninvolved foreign policy judgments: Some such suspensions “broadly suspended entry on the basis \nof nationality due to ongoing diplomatic disputes;” others “were directed at subsets of aliens from \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 59 of 100\nthe countries at issue;” but as a general rule, the Court found that previous Presidents “repeatedly \nsuspended entry” under § 1182(f) “to retaliate for conduct by their governments that conflicted \nwith foreign policy interests.” Id. at 2413. \n138.  Within this context, the Court found that the President had satisfied the “sole \nrequisite set forth in § 1182(f)”—i.e., that the President “find that the entry of covered aliens would \nbe detrimental to the interests of the United States.”8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). As the Court observed, the \nPresident had ordered DHS and other agencies “to conduct a comprehensive evaluation,” then \n“set[] forth extensive findings” justifying why “it was in the national interest to restrict entry of \naliens who could not be vetted with adequate information—both to protect national security and \npublic safety, and to induce improvement by their home countries.” The Court also highlighted \nlanguage  in  the  Muslim  Ban  noting  that  the  Administration  had  “crafted  country-specific \nrestrictions that would be most likely to encourage cooperation given each country’s distinct \ncircumstances, while securing the Nation until such time as improvements occur.” Indeed, the \nCourt found that “[t]he 12-page Muslim Ban—which thoroughly describes the process, agency \nevaluations,  and  recommendations  underlying  the  President’s  chosen  restrictions—is  more \ndetailed than any prior order a President has issued under § 1182(f).” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409.  \n139.  Given these findings, especially within a national security setting, the Court found \nthat the Muslim Ban “is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority under the INA.” Id. at \n2415. \n140.  The Court also noted, however, that it “has engaged in a circumscribed inquiry \nwhen the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.” Id. at 2419. \nThe limits on such an inquiry, pursued under Kleindienst v. Mandel, have “particular force in \nadmission and immigration cases that overlap with the area of national security” for two reasons: \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 60 of 100\nFirst, judicial inquiry into national security concerns potentially “intrud[es] on the President’s \nconstitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs,” raising separation of powers concerns. \nId. at 2398. Second, the courts are not well positioned “when it comes to collecting evidence and \ndrawing inferences on questions of national security.” Id. \n141.  Thus, when evaluating the Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to the Ban, the Court \narticulated a standard of review that “considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the \nGovernment’s stated objective.” Id. at 2420.  \n142.  Although the Supreme Court found that the Muslim Ban ultimately met this \nstandard, it was careful to note that its analysis was grounded in the national security context. It \nwas this context that allowed the Court to find that “the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding \nin national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility,” Id. at 2421, despite \nacknowledging “a series of statements by the President and his advisers casting doubt on the \nofficial objective of the Proclamation,” Id. at 2417. In so finding, the Court gave express deference \nto “the Executive’s evaluation of the underlying facts . . .particularly in the context of litigation \ninvolving ‘sensitive and weighty interests of national security and foreign affairs.’” Id. at 2422. \n143.  In addition, the Court credited three specific features of the Ban and its predecessors \nthat “support the Government’s claim of a legitimate national security interest.” Id. at 2402. \n144.  First, three Muslim-majority countries had already been removed from the list of \nbanned countries, and the Proclamation stated that for countries remaining on the list, the tailored \nentry suspensions would “remain in force only so long as necessary to address” the security \nconcerns posed by each country. Id. at 2410. \n145.  Second, the Ban “includes significant exceptions for various categories of foreign \nnationals,” permitting “nationals from nearly every covered country to travel to the United States \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 61 of 100\non a variety of nonimmigrant visas,” which make up the majority of visas issued to nationals from \nthe banned countries. Id. at 2422. \n146.  Third, “the Proclamation creates a waiver program open to all covered foreign \nnationals  seeking  entry  as  immigrants  or  nonimmigrants,”  and  “directs  DHS  and  the  State \nDepartment to issue guidance elaborating upon the circumstances that would justify a waiver.” Id. \nat 2422-23. The Court found this program, which identifies specific eligibility criteria, to be similar \nto humanitarian exceptions set forth in a similar country-specific suspension imposed by President \nCarter during the Iran hostage crisis.  \n147.  Given  these  considerations,  the  Court  held  that  the  plaintiffs  had  failed  to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims because “the \nGovernment has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis \nreview,” and remanded the case to the lower courts for further proceedings. Id. at 2423. \n148.  The Supreme Court found that § 1182(f) “grants the President broad discretion to \nsuspend the entry of aliens into the United States.” Id. at 2408. But such authority is not limitless. \nIf the Proclamation is allowed to ban two thirds of immigrants whom Congress has expressly \npermitted to seek and receive immigrant visas based on wealth or self-sufficiency, such a reading \nof § 1182(f) would provide the President with unfettered discretion to rewrite the INA as he sees \nfit. Such a reading cannot muster under even the most generous reading of Hawaii.  \n149.  As an initial matter, unlike the Muslim Ban, the Proclamation does nothing to \n“support[] Congress’s individualized approach for determining admissibility” under the INA. \nThere is nothing in the text of the Proclamation indicating that one of its purposes is to “improve \nthe screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with” the visa-issuance process. 82 \nFed. Reg. 45162 (Sept. 27, 2017). To the contrary, the Proclamation expressly has nothing to do \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  58 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 62 of 100\nwith national security, bearing a “HEALTHCARE” label on the White House website.49 By its \nterms, the Proclamation’s purpose is to protect the country’s health care system and taxpayers \n“from the burdens of uncompensated care” by suspending the “entry into the United States of \ncertain  immigrants  who  lack  health  insurance  or  the  demonstrated  ability  to  pay  for  their \nhealthcare.”  Thus,  instead  of  a  relatively  targeted,  country-specific  approach  intended  to \n“encourage foreign governments to improve their . . . practices” in vetting and information sharing, \nthe Proclamation sweeps far more broadly and indiscriminately, affecting hundreds of thousands \nof immigrants solely on the basis of their ability to afford health insurance. 82 Fed. Reg. 45,162.  \n150.  Second, the Proclamation does not even attempt to set forth factual findings \njustifying its sweeping ban on nearly two thirds of all prospective immigrants seeking to enter the \nUnited States. Unlike the Muslim Ban, the Proclamation is not grounded in any comparable multi-\nagency, comprehensive evaluation that led to “extensive findings” set forth in the Proclamation, \njustifying why it is in the national interest to restrict the entry of aliens through country-specific \nrestrictions  crafted  to  “encourage  cooperation  given  each  country’s  distinct  circumstances.” \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (citation and internal quotations omitted).  \n151.  Instead, in a short preamble that ostensibly justifies the details of the suspension \nthat follows, the Proclamation merely claims that uninsured individuals burden the country’s \nhealth care system for two main reasons: because “[h]ealthcare providers and taxpayers bear \nsubstantial costs in paying for medical expenses incurred by people who lack health insurance;” \nand because “uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of \n \n49 Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially \nBurden the United States Healthcare System, WHITEHOUSE.GOV (Oct. 4, 2019) \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-suspension-entry-\nimmigrants-will-financially-burden-united-states-healthcare-system/  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  59 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 63 of 100\nnon-emergency conditions,” which burdens taxpayers, “who reimburse hospitals for a portion of \ntheir uncompensated emergency care costs.” 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. According to an unsupported \nassertion  in  the  preamble,  “[i]n  total,  uncompensated  care  costs  –  the  overall  measure  of \nunreimbursed services that hospitals give their patients – have exceeded $35 billion in each of the \nlast 10 years.” Id. The Proclamation then asserts that “data show that lawful immigrants are about \nthree times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.” Id. The Proclamation \ndoes not provide or cite to any support for these claims.  \n152.  It is these unsupported assertions alone that purport to justify the Proclamation’s \nindiscriminate ban on hundreds of thousands of prospective immigrants across the globe. \n153.  The lack of factual support for the Proclamation’s entry suspension is evident. \nWhile claiming that “lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States \ncitizens to lack health insurance,” the Proclamation ignores the fact that United States citizens \nactually account for 75% of the total 27.4 million uninsured in this country, or 20.55 million \nuninsured individuals.50 In comparison, according to figures provided by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation for 2017, uninsured immigrants represent only 11% of uninsured in this country, or 3 \nmillion uninsured individuals. \n154.  In attaching a dollar amount to the “uncompensated care costs”—in excess of “$35 \nbillion in each of the last 10 years,” or “$7 million on average for each hospital in the United \nStates”—the Proclamation provides no evidentiary support for these figures. Nor does it set forth \nany factual findings identifying what percentage of this total overall figure is attributable to the \n75% of uninsured United States citizens versus the 11% uninsured immigrants in this country, \n \n50 President Trump’s Proclamation Suspending Entry for Immigrants without Health Coverage, \nKAISER FAMILY FUND (Oct. 10, 2019) https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-\nsheet/president-trumps-proclamation-suspending-entry-for-immigrants-without-health-coverage/  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  60 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 64 of 100\nsuch that the continued entry of such uninsured immigrants to the United States “would be \ndetrimental” to the interests of “protecting both [our health care system] and the American taxpayer \nfrom the burdens of uncompensated care.” 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. \n155.  The Proclamation, moreover, sets forth no factual findings explaining how the \nconditions of its suspension further the stated goal of reducing the burden of uninsured health care \ncosts. This is in stark contrast to the Muslim Ban, which articulated country-specific deficiencies \nin vetting and information-sharing; justifications for the suspension of specific visas from specific \ncountries; and express instructions to the Secretary of State to engage in diplomatic efforts with \nthese countries to improve the identified deficiencies, using the suspension of specific visas from \nthose countries “to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign \nterrorists.” 82. Fed. Reg. 13,213. The Proclamation, by contrast, imposes a far broader suspension, \nbarring all immigrants worldwide except for the limited few who can arrange for certain types of \nUnited States-based health insurance or demonstrate an unspecified level of wealth at their visa \ninterview. There are no factual findings explaining how, for example, the entry of an immigrant \nwho would be fully insured with comprehensive coverage under the ACA after arrival—albeit with \nfinancial assistance—would be detrimental to the Proclamation’s express purpose of reducing the \nfinancial  burden  imposed  by  uninsured  individuals.  There  are  likewise  no  factual  findings \nexplaining how the entry of an immigrant who would be underinsured or effectively uninsured \nwith visitor insurance or a short-term limited duration insurance plan would further this purpose. \n156.  Third, in infringing the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, the Proclamation’s policy \nof suspending entry for all new immigrants unless they can afford only certain types of health \ninsurance,  or  demonstrate  an  unspecified  level  of  wealth,  is  not  plausibly  related  to  the \nGovernment’s  stated  objective  of  “addressing  the  challenges  facing  our  healthcare  system, \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  61 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 65 of 100\nincluding protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.” \n84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. \n157.  As noted above, the Proclamation’s broad suspension on entry, combined with its \nlimited array of “approved health insurance” options, effectively incentivizes—if not requires—\nmost prospective immigrants to purchase non-comprehensive visitor insurance or short-term \nlimited duration insurance to satisfy the Proclamation’s requirements. This is because the vast \nmajority  of  immigrants  entering  the  United  States  have  historically  been  family-based  visa \napplicants, who would not have access to “approved” employer-based insurance before entering \nthe United States and obtaining work authorization. Many of the other “approved health insurance” \nplans under the Proclamation (i.e., Medicare, TRICARE, family members’ plans, and catastrophic \nand “unsubsidized” ACA plans) are not practically or legally available to most prospective \nimmigrants  outside  of  the  country.  Even  for  employment-based  visa  applicants,  employer-\nsponsored insurance is far from guaranteed, as the vast majority of employers impose a waiting \nperiod before employees can be participate in employer-sponsored coverage, with waiting periods \nlasting 1.9 months on average.51 Visitors insurance and STLDI plans are, as a practical matter, the \nonly options realistically available to most would-be immigrants, and those will generally not be \navailable to cover preexisting conditions.  \n158.   These options, however, provide extremely limited coverage and would likely \nleave individuals underinsured or uninsured for common needs such as prescription drugs, to say \n \n51 2018 Employer Health Benefits Survey, KAISER FAMILY FUND (Oct. 3, 2018) \nhttps://www.kff.org/report-section/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey-section-3-employee-\ncoverage-eligibility-and-participation/  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  62 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 66 of 100\nnothing of hospitalization or emergency care.52 The Proclamation, moreover, requires prospective \nimmigrants to purchase such coverage for the maximum time period allowed, 364 days.53 Once \nthat 364-day period expires, the immigrant would not be able to switch immediately to a regular, \ncomprehensive plan, regardless of whether she wanted to and had the resources to do so, with or \nwithout financial assistance: instead, the immigrant would be required to wait until the next regular \nopen enrollment period (November 1 through December 15 each year) to change coverage. \nAllowing and in fact encouraging the entry of immigrants covered by visitor and STLDI plans, \nand requiring that coverage for their first year in a new country or likely longer, contravenes the \nProclamation’s goal of reducing uncompensated costs associated with uninsured health care. \n159.  In fact, although the Proclamation highlights the $35 billion in uncompensated care \ncosts incurred by this nation’s hospitals, the American Hospital Association (“AHA”) criticized \nSTLDI plans earlier this year when the Trump Administration proposed a new rule to make STLDI \nplans more available and longer in duration. The AHA warned that STLDI products “could end up \ncosting a patient far more by covering fewer benefits and ensuring fewer critical protections, like \ncovering pre-existing conditions,” such that patients “could find themselves responsible for their \nentire medical bill without any help from their ‘health plan.’”54 Accordingly, “[f]or providers, \n[STLDI] products will lead to increased bad debt, with underinsured patients unable to afford the \n \n52 Karen Pollitz et al., Understanding Short-Term Limited Duration Health Insurance, KAISER \nFAMILY FUND (Apr. 23, 2018) https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/understanding-\nshort-term-limited-duration-health-insurance/; \nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/short-term-health-plan-gaps-and-limits-leave-\npeople-risk  \n53 As noted above, see FN 51, STLDI plans lasting 364 days are only available in about half the \nstates. \n54 https://www.aha.org/press-releases/2018-08-01-aha-statement-final-rule-short-term-limited-\nduration-health-insurance  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  63 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 67 of 100\ncare they need but that is not covered,” and “[i]ncreased bad debt will further strain hospitals’ and \nhealth systems’ ability to provide a full range of services to their patients and communities, \nincluding the most vulnerable.”55 Other commenters to the final rule warned increasing the \navailability of STLDI plans that “are not qualifying health plans mandated to cover the essential \nbenefits  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act”  could  “lead  to  an  increased  reliance  on  emergency \ndepartments as consumers delay or do not seek primary care.”56 If President Trump sincerely \nwished  to  address  the  problem  of  uncompensated  care  costs  borne  by  hospitals,  especially \n“uncompensated emergency care costs” incurred by emergency rooms, driving new immigrants \ntowards STLDI and similar non-comprehensive plans like visitor insurance is not a reasonable \nsolution. \n160.  The Proclamation likewise fails to address why the Trump Administration, after \nlaboring for a year to repeal the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act and celebrating \nthat repeal of the penalty associated with that statutory mandate for almost two years since, has \nnow identified the “burdens of uncompensated care” for uninsured individuals as a problem that \nmust be alleviated by imposing the individual mandate (and a stark penalty of inadmissibility into \nthe  country  for  failure  to  comply)  specifically  and  solely  on  newly  arriving  immigrants—\nnotwithstanding the fact that only 11% of uninsured individuals in this country are immigrants, \nwhile 75% of uninsured individuals are citizens. \n \n55 Id. \n56 Rick Pollack, AHA Statement on Final Rule on Short-Term, Limited-Duration Health \nInsurance Plans, AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (Aug. 1, 2018) https://www.aha.org/press-\nreleases/2018-08-01-aha-statement-final-rule-short-term-limited-duration-health-insurance  \nhttps://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/increase-uncompensated-hospital-care-could-be-\none-effect-short-term-coverage-rule  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  64 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 68 of 100\n161.  Although the President’s authority to suspend entry under § 1182(f) may be broad, \nit is not absolute—especially not when the exercise of that authority does not comply with either \nthe text of the statutory provision and is patently unrelated in any rational fashion to its stated \nobjective.  \nB.  The Proclamation Does Not Pass Muster Under Equal Protection \n162.  The President’s § 1182(f) powers, moreover, do not give him license to run \nroughshod over the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. From the time he announced his \ncandidacy through his entire tenure in the White House, President Trump has openly expressed \nantipathy toward not only all noncitizens, but also specifically toward immigrants seeking to come \nto the United States—particularly immigrants of color, including those from countries such as \nMexico, Haiti, and Nigeria, and regions such as Central and Latin America, Africa, and the Middle \nEast. The Proclamation is but the latest in an iterative string of attempts to deny immigrant visas \nto foreign nationals on the basis of their national origin or race—a motivation President Trump \nhas expressed since he was a candidate.  \n163.  Indeed, in the same speech in which he announced his presidential bid, then-\ncandidate Trump declared: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re \nnot sending you. They’re not sending you.” Rather, he warned his audience, “They’re sending \npeople that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing \ndrugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” And, he added, “They’re not sending us the right \npeople. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  65 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 69 of 100\nand it’s coming probably—probably—from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have \nno protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening.”57 \n164.  Notwithstanding immediate public backlash to his remarks equating all Mexicans \nwith “rapists,” then-candidate Trump doubled down shortly thereafter in an interview on CNN. \nWhen asked about the North American Free Trade Agreement, then-candidate Trump pivoted to \nthe topic of immigration and volunteered: “I love the Mexican people. I do business with the \nMexican people, but you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they’re \nbad. They’re really bad.” He further clarified: “But you have people coming in and I’m not just \nsaying Mexicans, I’m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and \nthey’re coming into this country.”58 \n165.  The themes that then-candidate Trump presented in these early statements of his \ncandidacy have recurred in his public remarks about immigrants ever since. He has repeatedly and \nconsistently associated immigrants with crime and a lack of national security.59 He has repeatedly \nand consistently presented immigrants as not only undesirable to this country,60 but also different \n \n57 Full text: Donald Trump Announces a Presidential Bid, WASH.

Indeed,  in  speeches,  remarks  to  the  press,  and  tweets,  President  Trump  has \nconsistently  attacked  the  two  primary  ways  that  noncitizens  from  predominantly  nonwhite \ncountries receive immigrant visas: the family preference system, which allows United States \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor close family members for immigrant visas; and \nthe diversity visa lottery, which was originally established in 1990 to diversify the country’s \nimmigrant population by selecting immigrants from countries with historically low rates of \nimmigration to the United States.

The truth remains that individuals must apply for the diversity visa lottery and \npossess  either  a  high  school  education  or  demonstrate  two  years  of  work  experience  in  a \nsufficiently skilled occupation.

While  criticizing  family-based  preferences  and  the  diversity  visa  lottery  as \n“outdated programs that hurt our national and economic security,”81 President Trump has also \nconsistently advocated for a new, “merit-based” system. Such a system “admits people who are \nskilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our \ncountry”82—in contrast with family-based and diversity immigrants, who are “mostly low-wage \nand low skilled,” and who “come into our country and immediately go onto welfare and stay there \nfor the rest of their lives.”83 President Trump has constantly portrayed merit-based immigrants as \npeople who “have skills, who can support themselves financially, and contribute to our economy,” \nand who will come to the country to “work hard.”84  \n173.

That President Trump divides immigrants into these two categories—undesirable \nfamily-based and diversity immigrants from predominantly non-white countries on the one hand, \nand employment- or “merit-” based immigrants who are either European or at least willing to \n“work hard” on the other—is no surprise in the context of other statements he has made evincing \nracial and nation-based animus grounded in ugly stereotypes.  \n175.  During a White House briefing on how many immigrants had received visas to \nenter in 2017, for example, Trump reportedly grumbled that Haitians “all have AIDS” and that \nafter seeing the United States, Nigerians would never “go back to their huts” in Africa once he \nheard how many immigrants from each country had been admitted.87 At a similar briefing on \nprotections for Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries in 2018, President Trump is said to have \nasked, “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” He then suggested \n \n85 Table 10.

Taken in aggregate, President Trump’s public statements have repeatedly and \nconsistently evinced an animus towards nonwhite immigrants. And since entering the White \nHouse,  President  Trump  has  tried  various  ways  to  effectuate  his  desire  to  limit  nonwhite \nimmigration by limiting family-based and diversity visa immigration. \n177.

You can’t just come in like in \npast weeks, years, and decades you come in, immediately start picking up welfare.”93 In mid-2017, \nthe RAISE Act failed in the Senate without a vote. \n178.  Around the same time that the Senate passed on voting on the RAISE Act, USCIS \nintroduced the new Public Charge rule, another attempt by the Trump Administration to curtail the \nimmigration of nonwhite individuals entering the country through family-based preferences or the \ndiversity visa. Echoing the point system of the RAISE Act, the Public Charge rule places varying \npositive or negative weights on certain factors that are then assessed in determining whether an \napplicant should be deemed inadmissible on public charge grounds. Under one of the heavily \nweighted positive factors—having income or financial assets over 250% of the federal poverty \nline—“71% of Mexicans and Central Americans, 69% of Africans, and 52% of Asian immigrants \nwould fail to meet the threshold.” Accordingly, like the RAISE Act, the Public Charge rule “would \n \n91 Julia Gelatt, The RAISE Act: Dramatic Change to Family Immigration, Less So for the \nEmployment-Based System, MIGRATION POLICY INST.

The Proclamation follows in the footsteps of the failed RAISE Act and the enjoined \nPublic Charge rule. Like the RAISE Act and the Public Charge rule, the Proclamation has the \npotential to drastically cut family-based immigration. Unlike its predecessors, however, the \nProclamation  is  promulgated  by  presidential  fiat,  and  thus  untethered  to  the  legislative  or \nadministrative rulemaking processes. But although the RAISE Act, the Public Charge rule, and the \nProclamation each takes a different form and function, the intended result of each is the same: to \nreduce immigration from predominantly nonwhite countries. \nTHE PROCLAMATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION HARM PLAINTIFFS \n180.  The Proclamation will go into effect at 12:01 am, Eastern daylight time, on Sunday, \nNovember 3, 2019, and all publicly available information reflects that the State Department has \nbeen taking, and will take, definitive and concrete action to implement and enforce it. The press, \nfor example, has reported that “[m]ore than two dozen health officials are wrestling with highly \ntechnical questions, like which health plans would comply with the new requirements,” and that \nsome are “confused about numerous aspects of the proclamation.”95 Information made publicly \navailable on the State Department’s website, moreover, expressly instructs would-be immigrants \nthat “[i]f [they] are applying for an immigrant visa, including a diversity visa, on or after November \n \n94 Jeanne Batalova et al., Through the Back Door: Remaking the Immigration System via the \nExpected “Public Charge” Rule, MIGRATION POLICY INST.

When implemented and enforced, the Proclamation will cause Plaintiffs [and their \nmembers and clients] substantial, concrete, and particularized injury. The entry suspension of the \nProclamation is indefinite; the Proclamation provides no waiver from its suspension; and the \nProclamation provides no way to appeal the denial of a visa due to the Proclamation’s de facto \nwealth test. As a result, the Proclamation will permanently separate close family members and \ninflict irreparable harm.  \n182.  John Doe #1, a U.S. citizen, can no longer work due to a disability. He has applied \nfor wife, a Mexican citizen with an approved I-601A waiver, to obtain legal status so that she can \nlive and work here in the United States, supporting both him and his fourteen-year-old United \nStates citizen son. But he fears that his wife will not be able to show that she meets the \nProclamation’s health insurance and financial resources requirements at her consular interview. \n \n96 Presidential Proclamation on Health Care, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/Presidential-Proclamation-on-\nHealth-Care.html  \n97 Id. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  76 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 80 of 100\n183.  John Doe #1 has not worked since May 2018 and had heart surgery in July 2018. \nHe currently has a pacemaker. Around April 2019, he received his Social Security Disability \ndetermination and since he stopped working, Social Security Disability benefits have been his only \nincome source. Both he and his son have health insurance through the Oregon Health Plan, \nOregon’s Medicaid program, but, because he can no longer work, he cannot obtain insurance \nthrough an employer or afford private health insurance.  \n184.  Money is tight in John Doe #1’s family. After receiving approval for his wife’s \nfamily-based  visa  petition  and  her  I-601A  provisional  unlawful  presence,  completing  her \napplication  for  an  immigrant  visa,  submitting  documents  to  the  National  Visa  Center,  and \nscheduling a consulate interview for Wednesday, November 6, 2019 in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, \nMexico, John Doe #1 thought that his wife would finally become a legal resident and would be \nable to work. He thought his family would finally be able to breathe a financial sigh of relief after \nenduring a significant medical hardship, as well as anxiety about her legal status.  \n185.  But then they received news of the Proclamation. John Doe #1 does not believe that \nhis wife will be eligible to receive a visa now; she does not have health insurance and they do not \nhave sufficient financial resources, especially after his disability, to afford health insurance for her \nor pay her foreseeable health insurance costs. \n186.  The Proclamation will be destructive to John Doe #1’s family in many ways. He \ncannot imagine living apart from his wife. He and their son depend on her. Their son suffers from \nhealth complications and is currently in the hospital. Given his own health issues, John Doe #1 \ncannot care for his son by himself; he needs his wife. If granted a visa, she could work to support \nthe family financially since John Doe #1 cannot work himself. Due to the significant medical issues \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  77 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 81 of 100\nfacing John Doe #1 and his son, he does not know what he would do if his wife goes to her \nNovember 6th interview and her visa is denied.  \n187.  Juan Ramon Morales, a U.S. citizen, would be able to enroll his wife, Vianca \nMorales, as a dependent in his employer’s health insurance plan, but the Proclamation makes both \nthis and the prospect of acquiring an immigrant visa for her his impossible.  \n188.  Mr. Morales’s employer told him that they could not add his wife as a dependent \non his health insurance plan unless she obtained a Social Security Number; once she does so, she \ncan be added. But she cannot do so until she receives legal status in the United States, and the \nProclamation requires that she show proof, which she cannot obtain, that she would be enrolled in \nhealth insurance within 30 days of her admission into the United States. Through his research, Mr. \nMorales learned that Social Security Numbers and “Green Cards” are typically not mailed quickly \nenough to arrive within 30 days after admission to the U.S. is granted. Thus, even though Mr. \nMorales would be able to enroll his wife in health insurance were she to receive permanent \nresidence, the Proclamation’s stringent requirements make it impossible. \n189.  Nor could the Morales family afford to purchase health insurance for Ms. Morales \nor her foreseeable medical expenses. Ms. Morales, who has lived in the U.S. since 2006, is \ndiagnosed with leukemia and has had emergency brain surgery. She also is epileptic and suffers \nfrom seizures. To manage these, she pays for prescription medicine out of pocket. Mr. Morales \nlikewise currently has significant medical costs; he carries significant debt due to back surgery he \nhad. Mr. Morales’ daughter, a U.S. citizen, and his step-daughter, a legal permanent resident, both \nhave subsidized health insurance that costs approximately $30 per month. Mr. Morales has \nresearched health insurance options to cover his wife, but has not found any available plans that \nhe could afford.  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  78 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 82 of 100\n190.  When Mr. Morales first learned about the Proclamation, he felt tremendous anxiety \nand despair. Mr. Morales and his family had already gone through a long and laborious journey to \nget to where they are today in the immigrant visa process: they had their I-130 petition approved \nin July 2017; Ms. Morales filed a provisional unlawful presence waiver application in May 2018 \nbased on the extreme hardship Mr. Morales would suffer if she could not be able to obtain \npermanent residence in the U.S, and the application was approved in April 2019; Ms. Morales had \ncompleted all of the other required steps of the Consular Process; and now the family was waiting \nfor her interview to be scheduled in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. If his wife is denied permanent \nresidency, Mr. Morales and his children will suffer extreme psychological, emotional, financial, \nand physical hardship. It was while waiting for this interview that the Morales family first heard \nabout the Proclamation. Given the strict 30 day timeline, Ms. Morales’ health conditions, and Mr. \nMorales’ limited financial resources, Mr. Morales does not believe that Ms. Morales will have \nhealth insurance, that she will be able to prove that she will be able to obtain health insurance 30 \ndays after her admittance into the U.S., or that she will be able to afford foreseeable medical costs \nat the time of her visa interview. \n191.  As part of Ms. Morales’ waiver application, Vianca demonstrated that Mr. Morales \nwould suffer extreme hardship if Ms. Morales’ unlawful presence was not forgiven, including \nextreme psychological, emotional, financial, and physical hardship. If she is denied an immigrant \nvisa, Mr. Morales would be separated from the love of his life and would have to raise his daughters \nalone. The thought that Ms. Morales may be denied her immigrant visa—and thus indefinitely \nseparated from him—has caused Mr. Morales significant stress.  \n192.  As a single mother of two children and a victim of domestic abuse, Jane Doe #2, a \nU.S. citizen who was naturalized in 2018, has faced many obstacles in the United States. Yet, she \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  79 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 83 of 100\nhas seen the beauty and opportunities that this country has to offer. The United States has given \nher a sense of hope and happiness for the future: even though she is not where she would like to \nbe, she feels like she is getting there. She now wishes to bring her parents to the United States to \nbe with her and their grandchildren, but fears she will not be able to do so if the Proclamation is in \neffect.  \n193.  Her experiences as a victim of domestic abuse, a single mother, and an immigrant \nto the United States have often made Jane Doe #2 feel very alone. She particularly misses her \nparents. She has been living apart from her 59-year old parents, who live in Nicaragua, for 13 \nyears. This separation has been exceptionally painful. She can only communicate with her parents \ntwice a week, at most, because they live in a remote location. It has been extremely stressful and \ndistressing to Jane Doe #2 to have experienced domestic violence without being able to turn to her \nparents for help. And the fact that they have not been able to witness the beautiful moments—like \nthe birth of her children—breaks her heart. Not only has she been separated from her parents, but \nher children have never met their grandparents. Jane Doe #2 sponsored two immigrant visas for \nher parents to reunite with them in the United States to change that.  \n194.  On or around December 19, 2018, Jane Doe #2 applied for her parents to come to \nthe United States. The visa petitions were approved on or around July 9, 2019. Her parents have \nreceived the requisite letters from the National Visa Centers to proceed with the Consular Process. \nHer family is currently collecting information and documents to submit the DS-260 and immigrant \ndocuments. They were waiting for their interview when they heard news of the Proclamation.  \n195.  When she heard about the Proclamation, Jane Doe #2 felt crushed. She cannot \nexplain the feeling of going through so many awful moments in her life and finally obtaining some \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  80 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 84 of 100\nhope of a light at the end of the tunnel by the possibility of reuniting with her family, only to have \nthat hope ripped away from her by the Proclamation. \n196.  Currently, Jane Doe #2’s parents do not have health insurance. They go to clinics \nin Nicaragua for their medical needs. As a single mother of two, Jane Doe #2’s financial resources \nare limited. She has searched for an available health insurance option for them that she could \nafford, but has not been successful and does not believe an “approved” and available insurance \noption is affordable. \n197.  Jane Doe #3, a U.S. citizen, can no longer work due to a disability, which also \nmakes it difficult for her to keep up with household tasks. After being separated from her husband \nfor almost two years, she hopes that having her husband, a German citizen, with her in the U.S. \nwill make things better. Living apart has been miserable for Jane Doe #3. Although they talk often, \nshe rarely gets to see her husband, and she needs to incur debt whenever she goes to visit him in \nGermany. Having her husband in the U.S. would help in almost every way. But she now believes \nthat her husband will not be able to meet the new requirements that the Proclamation created.  \n198.  Jane Doe #3 met her husband in Los Angeles in 2006, and they were married in \nFebruary 2018. After getting married, they decided to settle in the U.S. instead of Germany because \nof Jane Doe #3’s desire to stay close to her family. She lives nearby her immediate family, and is \nespecially thankful to be able to leave near her grandmother, who is a Holocaust survivor. \nAccordingly, she filed an immigrant visa petition for her husband in July 2018, and he returned to \nGermany so that he would not overstay his visitor visa. The I-130 petition was approved in April \n2019, and since then, they have been gathering documents required for consular processing and \nlooking forward to the time when they can be reunited.  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  81 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 85 of 100\n199.  The Proclamation has forced them to put their plans for a future together on hold. \nJane Doe #3 does not know how her husband will be able to prove at a consular interview that he \nwill have approved health insurance within 30 days of entering the United States. Jane Doe #3 is \ncurrently enrolled in California’s Medicaid program and she cannot add her husband to this \ncoverage.  \n200.  While her husband likely has good employment prospects in Los Angeles—he is \nan architect who currently teaches architectural theory and design and he speaks both English and \nGerman fluently—it is extremely difficult for him to secure employment without knowing when \nhe will enter the United States. Even if he were to be able to obtain insurance through an employer, \nhe would almost certainly not be able to secure such employment at the time of his consular \ninterview. Furthermore, his current German health insurance will not cover him when he moves \nto the United States. In the past, when he has visited Jane Doe #3, he purchased traveler’s \ninsurance, but it is his understanding that he would also not be eligible to receive such insurance \nif he moves permanently to the U.S. Doe’s husband has multiple sclerosis, and his treatments are \nexpensive. She believes that she and her husband do not have the financial resources to afford \nhealth insurance for him or to pay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket. \n201.  Iris Angelina Castro, a U.S. citizen, is currently pregnant with her second child \nand separated from her husband, Hermogenes Castro Molina, a national and resident of the \nDominican Republic. She wishes to reunite with her husband in the United States because when \nher first son became very ill, she was forced to quit her job to take care of him, and she is now \nunemployed with no income source. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  82 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 86 of 100\n202.  Ms. Castro was previously employed as a teacher, but she has since lost all her \nbenefits when she stopped working to stay at home with her first son. Having Mr. Molina here in \nthe United States will help their whole family; he can work while she cares for the children.  \n203.  Ms. Castro filed an immigrant petition for her husband on November 14, 2018, \nwhich was approved on May 30, 2019. They have since been filing all the required documents so \nthat they can schedule a consular interview.  \n204.  News of the Proclamation devastated Ms. Castro. Because she is unemployed, she \ndoes not believe that they have sufficient financial resources to prove that Mr. Castro would be \nable to obtain health insurance within 30 days of his entry into the U.S. or pay for foreseeable \nmedical costs. She has already been living apart from her husband for almost a year and that \nseparation has been exceptionally painful. Furthermore, she is pregnant with their first child \ntogether. It is painful for her to think that her daughter’s father will not be here for her birth and \nthat she will have to raise her daughter without her father. Without him and his potential financial \nsupport, she believes that she will be forced to use public benefits for survival. \n205.  Blake Doe, a U.S. citizen and senior college student at Oregon State University, \nlived with his parents, Mexican citizens, in Oregon from the time he was born until he went to \ncollege. His parents are amazing people, and he aspires to live up to the values of compassion, \nhard work, and responsibility that they have always tried to instill in him. Due to their sacrifices, \nBlake Doe will be the first person in his family to graduate from college in June 2020. He has \napproved I-130 petitions for his parents, but they are afraid that if they leave the country for their \nconsular interview, they will be banned from coming back under the Proclamation. \n206.  Blake Doe is seeking to permanently unify his family in Oregon because it is where \nhe has lived his whole life. He sponsored immigrant visas for his parents on or around April 17, \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  83 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 87 of 100\n2017, and on or around January 17, 2018, their I-I30 petitions were approved. On June 11, 2019, \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined that members of his \nfamily would suffer an extreme hardship if his parents’ visas were denied, and accordingly, \napproved an extreme hardship waiver so that his parents could complete the immigration process. \nHis parents are currently waiting to have an interview scheduled at the Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, \nMexico.  \n207.  Blake  Doe’s  mother’s  health  has  declined  recently.  She  has  two  painful \nconditions—rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. She currently pays for medical care out \nof pocket; her treatment is necessary to allow her to live without pain. She has tried to obtain health \ninsurance but has been told she is ineligible due to her immigration status. Blake Doe’s father has \ntried to obtain health insurance for her but has not been successful. Through research, Blake Doe \nhas found that it would be very expensive for him to obtain health insurance for his mother and \nfather. \n208.  As a full-time college student, Blake Doe has no income and has about $20,000 \nworth of student loan debt. He cannot afford health insurance for his parents. Therefore, Blake \nDoe does not believe that he has sufficient financial resources to prove that his parents would be \nable to obtain approved health insurance within 30 days of their admittance into the U.S. or pay \nfor foreseeable medical costs. \n209.  Given that the Proclamation has no waiver or termination date, Blake Doe is \nresigned to the fact that his parents will not be able to complete the immigration process. He \nbelieves that they will continue to live in fear and that he will continue to live in fear every day of \npermanent separation from his parents. This fear is causing him feelings of depression and makes \nhim constantly worried. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  84 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 88 of 100\n210.  Brenda Villarruel, a U.S. citizen, and her minor son, who is a United States \ncitizen, have been separated from her husband and the child’s stepfather, Gabino Soriano \nCastellanos, for almost two years. She now fears that the Proclamation will make that separation \npermanent. \n211.  Ms. Villarruel is employed as a licensed medical assistant but does not have health \ninsurance through her work and pays out of pocket for medical services when necessary. Ms. \nVillarruel has sponsored her husband, who currently resides in Mexico City, Mexico, for an \nimmigrant visa and, after receiving an approved waiver, has been scheduled for his final immigrant \ninterview on November 5, 2019.  \n212.  Ms. Villarruel needs her husband, Mr. Castellanos, in the United States so that he \ncan rejoin their thriving tattoo business and continue to be the father and caretaker of their son, \nwho has battled depression due to the separation from the only father he has ever known. News of \nthe Proclamation has devastated the entire family. Ms. Villarruel, having researched the costs of \napproved insurance, does not believe that the family has sufficient financial resources to prove that \nshe and Mr. Castellanos would be able to obtain approved health insurance to comply with the \nPresident’s Proclamation within 30 days of Mr. Castellanos admittance into the U.S. or pay for \nforeseeable medical costs.  \n213.  This is a time when Ms. Villarruel and Mr. Castellanos should be building their \nthriving tattoo business and raising their son. Instead, they live in fear of living apart from each \nother indefinitely and being financially wiped-out due to the family separation. \n214.  Latino Network functions as an “immigration services navigator” to educate \nclients and connect them with legal-services providers who can assist with obtaining immigrant \nvisas for family members, and provides information to low- and moderate-income immigrant \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  85 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 89 of 100\nfamilies about options for health-care benefits. The Proclamation has and will continue to \nseverely restrict and frustrate Latino Network’s ability to fulfill its objectives of counseling and \nreferring low- and moderate-income immigrants to services that will enable them to obtain \nadequate health-care benefits.  \n215.  The Proclamation has forced and will continue to force Latino Network to divert \nsignificant resources: to identify viable health-care options for members who need to comply \nwith the Proclamation; to retrain Latino Network staff members, who had been previously \ntrained to help members find free, low-cost, or subsidized health-care plans, and who must now \nlearn to help members navigate the Proclamation’s terms; and to develop and publish \ninformation materials to inform our community. Latino Network’s need to devote resources to \nrespond to the Proclamation and mitigate its effects on the Portland Latino community \nnecessarily limit the resources available to carry out its core services and programs, and frustrate \nits ability to carry out its organizational purpose. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n216.  Individual Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), on behalf of themselves and all other persons for whom \nDefendants’ implementation of the Proclamation interferes with family reunification or the \nprocessing of their visa petitions in a manner consistent with applicable law. The individual \nplaintiffs seek certification of a class (the “Plaintiff Class”) consisting of:  \na.  Individuals in the United States who currently have an approved or pending petition \nto the United States government to sponsor a noncitizen family member for an \nimmigrant visa, or who will soon file such a petition; and whose sponsored family \nmember is subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to a consular \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  86 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 90 of 100\nofficer’s satisfaction that he or she “will be covered by approved health insurance” \nwithin 30 days after entry or will be able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts.” (“U.S. Petitioner Subclass”) \nb.  Individuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for or will soon apply \nto the United States government for an immigrant visa; (ii) are otherwise eligible \nto be granted the visa; but (iii) are subject to the Proclamation and unable to \ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of a consular officer that they “will be covered by \napproved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be able “to pay for \nreasonably foreseeable medical costs.” (“Visa Applicant Subclass”) \n217.  This action meets all of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites for maintaining a class action. \n218.  The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable, satisfying Rule \n23(a)(1). Analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, based on data from the Census Bureau’s \n2014-16 American Community Survey (“ACS”), indicates that roughly 375,000 immigrants, \nmainly family-based immigrants, would be affected by the Proclamation each year. In addition, \nthe class action is the only appropriate procedural avenue for the protections of the class members’ \nconstitutional rights and rights under the APA. \n219.  The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law, including \nwhether the Defendants’ Proclamation and its implementation exceeds the statutory authority \nprovided Defendants by the Immigration and Nationality Act; violates Plaintiff Class members’ \nrights under the APA; and violates Plaintiff Class members’ rights under the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n220.  The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of fact, including, \nbut not limited to: \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  87 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 91 of 100\na.  whether the Proclamation and Defendants’ actions taken to implement it were \nmotivated by racial animus, sought to reduce immigration by people of color, or \nwere otherwise based on the race, ethnicity, and/or national origin of the individuals \naffected; \nb.  whether Defendants fail to address the Proclamation’s discriminatory impact; \nc.  whether, in issuing and implementing the Proclamation, Defendants relied on \nfactors Congress did not intend for it to consider; \nd.  whether,  in  issuing  and  implementing  the  Proclamation,  Defendants  failed  to \nconsider important aspects of the problem it is addressing; \ne.  whether, in issuing and implementing the Proclamation, Defendants explained its \ndecision counter to the evidence before it; \nf.  whether Defendants quantified or considered harms that would result from the \nProclamation and its implementation; \ng.  whether Defendants failed to follow required procedures, including notice and \nopportunity  for  public  comment,  before  issuing  and  implementing  the \nProclamation; \nh.  whether the Proclamation’s requirements are, in practice, irrational, vague and \nunworkable, rendering impossible the uniform application of the laws or review of \ndecisions for consistency with facts and evidence; \ni.  whether the Proclamation is being or will be enforced so as either to prevent class \nmembers from reuniting here in the United States, or to force their separation when \na noncitizen family member must leave the country for a consular interview. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  88 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 92 of 100\nj.  whether class members have suffered harm as a result of the Proclamation and \nDefendants’ actions taken to implement it. \n221.  Because the claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law and \nfact, they will not require individualized determinations of the circumstances to any plaintiff, and \nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2). \n222.  The claims or defenses of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the members of the Plaintiff Class, satisfying Rule 23(a)(3). Like other members of the class, \nthe Plaintiffs have been harmed, among other things, by Defendants’ failure to lawfully abide by \nstatutory limitations on their actions. They have further been harmed by Defendants’ failure to \nproceed through proper notice-and-comment and other required procedures when issuing and \nimplementing its Proclamation, thereby leading to arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful action that \nfails to account for important aspects of the supposed problems it is addressing. They have further \nbeen harmed by Defendants’ failure adequately to explain its decision to issue the Proclamation \nor describe its implementation in a manner that it may reasonably be followed by those it affects. \nThey have been harmed by Defendants’ premising the Proclamation and its implementation on \nracial animus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. Each of \nthese actions, independently and collectively, have caused harm to Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff \nClass members. \n223.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff \nClass, satisfying Rule 23(a)(4). The named Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed class \nmembers fairly and adequately, and have no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic \nto the interests of the Plaintiff Class. The attorneys representing the named Plaintiffs include \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  89 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 93 of 100\nexperienced civil rights and immigration attorneys who are considered able practitioners in \nfederal constitutional litigation. These attorneys should be appointed as class counsel.  \n224.  The members of the proposed class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ \nrecords. \n225.  Through implementation and enforcement of the Proclamation at the center of the \nPlaintiff Class’s allegations, Defendants have acted, have threatened to act, and will act on \ngrounds  generally  applicable  to  the  Plaintiff  Class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole. The Plaintiff Class may therefore by properly \ncertified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  \n226.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Plaintiff Class would \ncreate  the  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  and  would  establish  incompatible \nstandards of conduct for individual members of the Plaintiff Class. The Plaintiff Class may \ntherefore by properly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1). \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act)  \n(On behalf of All Plaintiffs, including the Class) \n227.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n228.  The Proclamation will go into effect on November, 3, 2019. Defendants have stated \nthat they will begin implementing the Proclamation on this date in the manner described on the \nState Department’s website. \n229.  Defendants have taken actions to implement the Proclamation, including informing \nvisa applicants and consular officials of new requirements effective November 3, 2019, that will \nresult in a direct impact on the rights of qualified prospective immigrants and constitute final \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  90 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 94 of 100\nagency action(s) within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. See Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154 (1997). \n230.  Defendants’ actions constitute violations of the APA in at least the following \nrespects: \na.  Defendants failed to reasonably justify their departure from settled practice. \nb.  Defendants failed to address conflicts with other laws and legislative intent, \nincluding but not limited to the specific scheme Congress mandated in the INA \nthrough provisions such within 8 U.S.C. § 1151; 8 U.S.C. § 1153; 8 U.S.C § \n1182; 8 U.S.C § 1182; 8 U.S.C § 1154; 8 USC § 1186; 8 U.S.C. § 245, and \nnumerous health care laws, such as the ACA, PRWORA, CHIP and CHIPRA, and \nnumerous regulations duly promulgated under these and other laws. \nc.  Defendants implemented the Proclamation in a manner that is not “consistent with \napplicable law” for reasons including that their actions replaced a statutory \ntotality of the circumstances test for public charge with a new test that is vague, \narbitrary, and unsupported by the evidence. \nd.  Defendants’ implementation of the Proclamation is pretextual because Defendants \nseek to reduce immigration by people of color. \ne.  Defendants fail to address the Proclamation’s discriminatory impact. \nf.  Defendants did not quantify or consider harms that will result. \ng.  Defendants states requirements that are irrational, vague and unworkable, \nrendering impossible the uniform application of the laws or review of decisions \nfor consistency with facts and evidence. \nh.  Defendants acted in excess of statutory authority. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  91 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 95 of 100\ni.  Defendants’ actions exceed the delegation of statutory authority to the President \nin U.S.C. § 1182(f) for reasons including that Congress did not delegate \nunfettered discretion to indefinitely rewrite the immigration or health care laws, \nallow for suspensions that are unconstitutional and/or unsupported by adequate \nfindings, create permanent and specific classes of inadmissibility, or eliminate the \nopportunity for visa applicants’ opportunity to show that they are unlikely to \nbecome a “public charge” by the terms Congressional mandated. \nj.  Defendants’ actions implement the Proclamation in a manner that is not consistent \nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) for reasons including that it replaces Congress’ \nspecific scheme for assessing who may become a “public charge,” and when \nadmission may be authorized for those who cannot show they are unlikely to \nbecome a public charge. \nk.  Defendants violate their own rules and regulations and binding norms to the \nprejudice of others. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. \n260 (1954). \nl.  Defendants failed to follow required procedures including notice and opportunity \nfor public comment, particularly with respect to the Posting and Emergency \nNotice. \n231.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are based on legal error; fail to \nconsider all relevant factors; and lack a rational explanation, and are therefore arbitrary and \ncapricious and an abuse of discretion, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  92 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 96 of 100\n232.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are contrary to constitutional \nrights, discriminating on the basis of national origin and race, thereby violating the equal \nprotection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n233.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are ultra vires and in excess of \nany authority granted by the Proclamation, regulation, or statute, and not otherwise in accordance \nwith law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n234.   Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation affect Plaintiffs’ substantive \nrights and were made without observance of procedure required by law in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n235.  Defendants’ action are without good cause. \n236.  Defendants’ violation of the APA causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n237.  Plaintiffs have no adequate alternative to immediate review under the APA. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Equal Protection) \n(On behalf of Resident Plaintiffs/U.S. Petitioners Subclass) \n238.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n239.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment states that no person will “be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n240.  The  Fifth  Amendment  prohibits  Defendants  from  intentionally  discriminating \nagainst Plaintiffs and Class Members based on race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. \n241.  The Proclamation and Defendants’ actions taken to implement the Proclamation \nare unconstitutional because they burden a fundamental right of Plaintiffs and Class Members \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  93 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 97 of 100\nand were motivated by intentional discrimination and/or animus based on race, ethnicity, and/or \nnational origin. \n242.  The Proclamation furthers no legitimate purpose, let alone a compelling one. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Ultra Vires) \n(On behalf of All Plaintiffs, including the Class) \n243.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein.  \n244.  The Proclamation is illegal and is therefore ultra vires. \n245.  Courts “ordinarily presume that Congress intends the executive to obey its statutory \ncommands and, accordingly, that it expects the courts to grant relief when an executive agency \nviolates such a command.” Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 681 \n(1986). \n246.  The President’s attempt to indefinitely ban certain immigrants based on the inability \nto obtain specific types of health insurance or pay for medical care, and to create a new ground \nof inadmissibility that Congress has previously considered and chosen not to include in the INA, \nexceeds Congress’s delegated power to the President's power to suspend the entry of noncitizens \nand issue reasonable rules for the entry of noncitizens. \n247.  The President’s attempt to ban certain immigrants based on the inability to obtain \nspecific types of health insurance or pay for medical care violates constitutional separation of \npowers  principles  because  it  contravenes  Congress’s  expressed  intent  to  provide  a  certain \nminimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants and citizens in the United States and to extend \ncertain health care-related benefits to legal immigrants. \n   \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  94 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 98 of 100\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Procedural Due Process) \n(On behalf of Resident Plaintiffs/U.S. Petitioners Subclass) \n248.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n249.  The  Proclamation  state  that  an  individual  seeking  an  immigrant  visa  must \ndemonstrate, “to a consular officer’s satisfaction,” that she either “will be covered by approved \nhealth insurance” within 30 days of her entry to the United States, or “possesses the financial \nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The Emergency Notice and Posting \npublished by the Department of States confirm that consular officers will be questioning visa \napplicants  and  asking  for  medical  and  financial  documentation.  The  Emergency  Notice, \nfurthermore, specifies that “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses” are “those expenses related \nto existing medical conditions, relating to health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.” \n250.  A prospective immigrant’s entry to the United States therefore depends on a \ndetermination made by a consular officer with no medical training to accurately assess existing \nmedical conditions and health issues existing at the time of the visa adjudication.   \n251.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \nthat “[n]o person . . . shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n252.  Congress has created statutory rights related to the petitioning for and issuance of \nvisas and other immigration benefits.  \n253.  Federal agencies have created regulatory rights related to the petitioning for and \nissuance of visas and other immigration benefits. \n254.  Individuals must be given due process prior to the deprivation of these statutory \nand regulatory rights. \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  95 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 99 of 100\n255.  Additionally,  United  States  citizens  and  lawful  permanent  residents  have \nconstitutionally protected liberty interests in family reunification. Individuals must be given due \nprocess prior to any deprivation of these liberty interests. \n256.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, deprive individuals, including Plaintiffs and \ntheir members or clients, of the aforementioned statutory and regulatory rights, and liberty \ninterests, without due process. \n257.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, thus violate the procedural due process \nguarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \nA.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their officials, agents, \nemployees, assigns, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them from \nimplementing or enforcing any part of the Proclamation; \nB.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that the Proclamation is, in its entirety, \nunlawful and invalid; \nC.  An order awarding Plaintiffs costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses \npursuant to any applicable law; \nD.  Such other relief as this Court deems equitable, just and proper. \n   \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  96 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 100    Filed 11/27/19    Page 100 of 100\nDATED this 27th day of November, 2019. \n \n  INNOVATION LAW LAB \n \n/s/ Nadia Dahab                                   \nKaren C.

Of Attorneys for \nDefendants. \n \nMichael H. Simon, District Judge. \n \nIn this lawsuit, Plaintiffs challenge the issuance and implementation of the Presidential \nProclamation issued on October 4, 2019, which requires certain immigrants to show proof of \nhealth insurance or sufficient financial resources to pay for the costs of anticipated health care \nbefore they may qualify for immigrant visas (the “October 4th Proclamation”). The Court \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 2 of 9\n \ngranted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, enjoining enforcement of the October 4th \nProclamation. The Court also granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, certifying two \nnationwide subclasses: (1) United States citizens filing certain petitions sponsoring immigrant \nvisa applicants (“U.S. Petitioner Subclass”); and (2) certain immigrant visa applicants (“Visa \nApplicant Subclass”). Now before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining \norder (“TRO”) relating to a different Presidential Proclamation.  \nPlaintiffs ask the Court partially to enjoin enforcement of Presidential Proclamation \nNo. 10014, issued on April 22, 2020, titled “Suspension of Entry of Immigrants who Present a \nRisk to the United States Labor Market During the Economic Recovery Following the 2019 \nNovel Coronavirus Outbreak” (the “April 22nd Proclamation”). Plaintiffs request that the Court \ntemporarily enjoin enforcement of the April 22nd Proclamation against members of the Visa \nApplicant Subclass who are the children1 of Lawful Permanent Residents, are under age 21, and \nwill “age out” of their visa preference category2 (by turning 21 years old) in the very near future.  \nPlaintiffs request a TRO under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).3 “[T]he All Writs \nAct authorizes employment of extraordinary writs, [however,] it confines the authority to the \nissuance of process ‘in aid of’ the issuing court’s jurisdiction.” Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 \nU.S. 529, 534 (1999) (quoting § 1651(a)). Plaintiffs argue that the April 22nd Proclamation \n                                                 \n1 The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, as amended (“INA”),  defines a “child” \nas an unmarried person under the age of 21 who meets other criteria involving birth, adoption, or \nstep-parent/child relationships. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1). \n2 The unmarried children of Lawful Permanent Residents are in the preference category \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)(2)(A), commonly known as F2A. \n3 The All Writs Act provides: “[A]ll courts established by Act of Congress may issue all \nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages \nand principles of law.” \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 3 of 9\n \ninterferes with the Court’s jurisdiction over the claims of these children. For the reasons \ndiscussed below, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion. \nThe claims in this lawsuit include the allegations that the issuance and implementation of \nthe October 4th Proclamation violates the constitutional and statutory rights of the Visa \nApplicant Subclass members by requiring them to show proof of health insurance or sufficient \nfunds to pay reasonably anticipated health care costs. Plaintiffs argue that the April 22nd \nProclamation may prevent certain Visa Applicant Subclass members from receiving visas or may \nextinguish the special preference they received in immigration processing by being under the age \nof 21 and in preference category F2A. If children age out of preference category F2A, under the \nChild Status Protection Act (“CSPA”), they will automatically convert to preference category \nF2B. 8 U.S.C. § 1153(h)(3). Although they will retain their visa application priority date after \npreference category conversion, depending on their country of origin, these children may have to \nwait years, and for children from some countries with significant backlogs, up to 65 years, for \ntheir immigrant visas to be processed and issued. Thus, argue Plaintiffs, because these children \neffectively may not have their visa applications processed as result of the April 22nd \nProclamation, they are essentially no longer class members and will not receive the benefit of the \nCourt’s class certification order, preliminary injunction order precluding enforcement of the \nOctober 4th Proclamation, or any future order of the Court relating to the October 4th \nProclamation. Plaintiffs therefore conclude that the April 22nd Proclamation, by effectively \nprecluding or substantially delaying the processing of the children’s immigrant visas, interferes \nwith the Court’s jurisdiction and, thus, is addressable under the All Writs Act. \nUnder Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the All Writs Act, any action that may stop or \nsignificantly delay the processing of class member’s immigrant visas would interfere with the \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 4 of 9\n \nCourt’s jurisdiction. Plaintiffs contend that there need not be any nexus between the purportedly \ninterfering action and the First Amended Class Action Complaint for the All Writs Act to apply. \nThus, under Plaintiffs’ construction of the All Writs Act, simply because the Court issued \npreliminary injunction and class certification orders relating to one discrete aspect of \nimmigration law, it has authority under the All Writs Act to stop enforcement of every \nimmigration executive order or other action that serves to stop or delay the processing of class \nmembers’ immigrant visa applications. The Court rejects this broad interpretation of the All \nWrits Act.  \nThe All Writs Act is an “extraordinary remedy,” and it does not “enlarge” a court’s \njurisdiction. Clinton, 526 U.S. at 534-35. Under the All Writs Act, a court may only issue writs \n“necessary or appropriate in aid of” its existing jurisdiction. See id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1651(a)); see also Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092, 1099 (11th Cir. 2004) \n(“The Act does not create any substantive federal jurisdiction. Instead, it is a codification of the \nfederal courts’ traditional, inherent power to protect the jurisdiction they already have, derived \nfrom some other source.” (citation omitted)). Thus, the Court’s existing jurisdiction in this \nlawsuit, focused on the October 4th Proclamation, is the only basis for invoking the All Writs \nAct. The April 22nd Proclamation is completely unrelated to the October 4th Proclamation. \nSimply because the April 22nd Proclamation may preclude or delay the processing of immigrant \nvisa applications is too attenuated from the allegations in the First Amended Class Action \nComplaint to support an extraordinary writ under the All Writs Act. See Las Americas Immigrant \nAdvocacy Ctr. v. Trump, 2020 WL 1671584, at *2 (D. Or. Apr. 2, 2020) (“However, the relief \nsought in Plaintiffs’ motion is too attenuated from the claims alleged in the Complaint to sustain \nPlaintiffs’ burden under the All Writs Act.”). There must be some connection between the \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 5 of 9\n \nunderlying claims and the newly-challenged conduct for that conduct sufficiently to interfere \nwith the Court’s jurisdiction to support an extraordinary writ under the All Writs Act. Otherwise, \nthe Court’s jurisdiction would expand to any conduct that could cause significant delay in, or \neven the cessation of, the processing of class members’ immigrant visas. \nPlaintiffs’ interpretation of the All Writs Act also would lead to untenable results. For \nexample, if the President received reliable intelligence that an immigrant from a certain country \nwas planning to bring a dirty bomb into the United States and the President issued an executive \norder temporarily stopping the processing of all immigrant visa applicants from that country, \nsuch an executive order might prevent potential Visa Applicant Subclass members from that \ncountry from receiving the benefit of the Court’s orders. Children in preference category F2A \nmight also face the same aging-out problem during the duration of that hypothetical executive \norder. Under Plaintiffs’ argument, the Court nevertheless could issue an injunction under the All \nWrits Act, enjoining that hypothetical executive order. There could be many other examples of \nan executive order affecting immigration based on national security or other concerns that would \nstop, delay, or limit the number of immigrant visa applicants for reasons that have nothing to do \nwith health care insurance or the ability to show funds to pay for reasonably anticipated health \ncare costs. Just because the Court issued orders based on a complaint relating to the processing \nof immigrant visa applications, that does not mean that the Court has the authority under the All \nWrits Act to stop enforcement of every immigration-related executive order (or other action) that \nmight affect members of the certified class. \nMoreover, the All Writs Act “invests a court with a power essentially equitable and, as \nsuch, not generally available to provide alternatives to other, adequate remedies at law.” \nClinton, 526 U.S. at 537; see also Klay, 376 F.3d at 1100. This includes motions under Rule 65 \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 6 of 9\n \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, \n1229 (11th Cir. 2005) (noting “that where the relief sought is in essence a preliminary injunction, \nthe All Writs Act is not available because other, adequate remedies at law exist, namely Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65, which provides for temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions”). \nPlaintiffs’ All Writs Act challenge to the April 22nd Proclamation should be brought as a \nseparate challenge specific to that proclamation, seeking a preliminary injunction or TRO under \nRule 65, if appropriate. \nPlaintiffs rely upon Al Otro Lado v. Wolf (“Al Otro I”), 952 F.3d 999 (9th Cir. 2020), to \nsupport their argument that an injunction under the All Writs Act is necessary and appropriate in \nthis case. In Al Otro, the plaintiffs were asylum-seekers who primarily challenged “metering” \npolicies and practices at ports of entry on the southern border. Id. at 1003. The Department of \nHomeland Security (“DHS”) then issued a new rule, the “transit rule” or “Asylum Ban,” which \nchanged how asylum seekers would be processed. Id. at 1005. The district court provisionally \ngranted class certification for a subset of plaintiffs, those who were subject to the “metering” \npolicy and because of that may also be subject to the transit rule and potentially barred from \nseeking asylum Id. at 1002. The district court issued a preliminary injunction and, alternatively, \nan injunction under the All Writs Act barring enforcement of the new transit rule against this \nclass of plaintiffs. Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. McAleenan (“Al Otro II”), 423 F. Supp. 3d 848, 868-69 \n(S.D. Cal. 2019). The Ninth Circuit declined to stay the district court’s order pending \ninterlocutory appeal. Al Otro I, 952 F.3d at 1016. In that context, in a footnote the Ninth Circuit \naccepted the district court’s authority to issue a preliminary injunction and an injunction under \nthe All Writs Act under the circumstances presented (when a different rule was being challenged \nthan the conduct specifically challenged in the underlying complaint). Id. at 1006 n.6.  \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 7 of 9\n \nIn that case, the district court found that the requested injunction against the transit rule \nhad a sufficient nexus to the plaintiffs’ claims in the underlying complaint relating to the \nmetering policy, and thus a preliminary injunction was permissible. Al Otro II, 423 F. Supp. 3d \nat 868 (“Indeed, Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the Asylum Ban and Plaintiffs’ underlying claims in \ntheir [Second Amended Complaint] are so intertwined that denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction could effectively eviscerate the asylum claims Plaintiffs seek to preserve \nin their underlying suit.”). The district court emphasized the general asylum allegations in the \ncomplaint, including the allegation that Customs and Border Patrol were engaged in an unlawful \nand widespread pattern and practice of denying asylum seekers access to the asylum process, that \nthe defendants were imposing unreasonable delays before granting access to the asylum process, \nand that the defendants were outright denying access to the asylum process. Id. The district court \nnoted that the pending motion for preliminary injunction sought to preserve the plaintiff class \nmembers’ access to the asylum process, which the court found related to the claims in the \ncomplaint. Id. Regarding the request for an injunction under the All Writs Act, the district court \nnoted that its jurisdiction arose “from the statutory and constitutional questions over Defendants’ \nissuance of policies and practices barring access to the asylum process.” Id. at 869. The court \nthen found that application of the transit rule “affects this Court’s jurisdiction because it would \neffectively moot Plaintiffs’ request for relief in the underlying action by extinguishing their \nasylum claims. Should the Asylum Ban [transit rule] be applied to Plaintiffs, these individuals’ \nasylum claims would be foreclosed, as would any claim and request for relief regarding their \nright to access the asylum process.” Id.  \nThe Ninth Circuit, in addressing the dissent’s concern regarding the district court’s \nauthority to issue an injunction under the All Writs Act against a rule that was not challenged in \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 8 of 9\n \nthe underlying complaint, cited to the dissent’s discussion about the district court’s finding of a \nconnection between the transit rule and the allegations in the complaint. Al Otro I, 952 F.3d \nat 1006 n.6. The Ninth Circuit stated that discussion “acknowledges the answer” to the district \ncourt’s authority to issue an injunction under the All Writs Act. Id. This supports this Court’s \nfinding that there needs to be some connection between later-challenged conduct and the claims \nin an underlying complaint to support an injunction under the All Writs Act. \nFurther, the facts in Al Otro are distinguishable in a critical way. The underlying \ncomplaint in that case alleged conduct that encompassed, or at least had a close nexus to, the \nconduct challenged in the second motion for preliminary injunction. The later-challenged action \ninvolved similar conduct that would moot the underlying similar claims. The underlying claims \nand later-challenged conduct were intertwined, unlike Plaintiffs’ pending claims relating to the \nOctober 4th Proclamation and later-challenged conduct relating to F2A Visa Applicant Subclass \nmembers and the April 22nd Proclamation. Additionally, for purposes of the All Writs Act \ninjunction, the district court specifically noted that its jurisdiction arose from claims relating to \nquestions about general policies and practices barring access to the asylum process. Here, the \nCourt’s jurisdiction arises from questions relating to specific issues concerning the October 4th \nProclamation, not questions about general policies and practices barring immigrant visa \nprocessing.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that their First Amended Class Action Complaint makes similar \nallegations as those made in Al Otro. The Court disagrees. The allegations cited by Plaintiffs in \nsupport of this argument are not allegations relating to any general policy or procedure relating \nto visa processing, but are specific to the October 4th Proclamation and its effects. Nor are there \nany allegations in the First Amended Class Action Complaint that relate to family preference \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 143    Filed 04/29/20    Page 9 of 9\n \ncategories, aging out, or anything related to the pending motion. This is fatal to Plaintiffs’ \nargument on this point. \nThe Court recognizes the potential seriousness of the repercussions of a preference \ncategory F2A child being automatically converted to a preference category F2B upon his or her \nturning 21, as calculated under the CSPA. Based on the information provided by Plaintiffs, there \nare sufficiently available visas in category F2A, but, depending on the country of origin, \nimmigrant visa applicant wait times can be more than 65 years for applicants in category F2B. \n“In the end, [however], we are a nation of laws, and if we are to continue to be so, the pre-\nexisting and well-established federal law governing injunctions . . . must be applied to [this] \ncase.” Schiavo, 403 F.3d at 1229 (denying an All Writs Act injunction). If visa limits or wait \ntimes for preference category F2B are unreasonably constricted, that is a matter for Congress to \nfix, not the courts. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (ECF 135) is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this 29th day of April, 2020. \n              /s/ Michael H.

      "text": "JOHN DOE #1; et al., Plaintiffs-Appellees, \nv. \nDONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United \nStates; et al., Defendants-Appellants. \nNo. 19-36020. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. \nFiled December 20, 2019. \nAppeal from the D.C. No. 3:19-cv-01743-SI, District of Oregon, Portland. \nBefore: THOMAS, Chief Judge, BERZON and BRESS, Circuit Judges. \nORDER \nThe government requests an emergency temporary stay of the district court's order \npreliminarily enjoining Presidential Proclamation No. 9945, Suspension of Entry of \nImmigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States Health Care System, pending \nconsideration of the motion for a stay pending appeal. The government also seeks a stay of \nthe preliminary injunction pending appeal. The plaintiffs oppose both motions. \nA temporary stay in this context (sometimes referred to as an administrative stay) is only \nintended to preserve the status quo until the substantive motion for a stay pending appeal \ncan be considered on the merits, and does not constitute in any way a decision as to the \nmerits of the motion for stay pending appeal. \nHere, the status quo would be disrupted by granting the temporary stay request. Therefore, \nwe deny the request for a temporary stay. The Proclamation has not yet gone into effect. \nThe changes it would make to American immigration policy are major and unprecedented; \nthe harms the government alleges it will suffer pending review of the motion for stay \npending appeal are long-term rather than immediate. Our ruling is based solely on the \nabsence of a sufficient exigency to justify changing the status quo, particularly during the \nfew weeks before scheduled oral argument on the merits of the emergency motion; we do \nnot consider the merits of the dispute in any respect. By this order we are expediting \nbriefing and oral argument on the emergency motion and anticipate an expeditious issuance \nof a decision following argument. \nAny government reply to plaintiffs' opposition to the motion for stay pending appeal is due \nDecember 23, 2019. \nThe parties are directed to appear for oral argument on the motion for stay pending appeal \non Thursday, January 9, 2020, at 10:00 am in San Francisco, California. Each side will be \nallotted 20 minutes of argument time. The parties are encouraged to appear in person if \npossible. If any party wishes to appear by video, that party must notify Kwame Copeland, \n\n415.355.7888, no later than Friday, January 3, 2020, and must coordinate with Mr. \nCopeland in making suitable arrangements for an appearance by video. \nThe opening brief and excerpts of record are due January 2, 2020; the answering brief is \ndue January 30, 2020 or 28 days after service of the opening brief, whichever is earlier; and \nthe optional reply brief is due within 21 days after service of the answering brief. This case \nwill be assigned to the next available oral argument panel for a decision on the merits of the \nappeal. \nBRESS], Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nBefore it could take effect, a district court in Oregon enjoined a Presidential Proclamation \nthat placed a suspension and certain limitations on the entry of immigrants whom the \nPresident has determined will burden the American healthcare system. The district court \nrefused to stay its nationwide injunction, and the government has now sought a stay of the \ndistrict court's order pending appeal, as well as a temporary stay pending this Court's ruling \non the underlying stay motion. Only the latter request is before us now. I would grant the \ntemporary stay and so respectfully dissent from its denial. \nWhatever one's views on the Presidential Proclamation as a matter of policy, the district \ncourt's decision is clearly wrong as a matter of law. In the supposed name of the separation \nof powers, the district court struck down part of a longstanding congressional statute, \ninvalidated a presidential proclamation, and purported to grant worldwide relief to persons \nnot before the court. And it did so based on the nondelegation doctrine—among the most \nbrittle limbs in American constitutional law—and a reading of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) that the \nSupreme Court expressly rejected in Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018). The district \ncourt's extraordinary injunction ignores governing precedent, invents unjustified restrictions \non the political branches, and inserts the courts into the President's well-established \nconstitutional and statutory prerogative to place limits on persons entering this country. The \nProclamation concerns matters of great consequence and is understandably important to \nmany people, but the law prevented the district court from doing what it did here. \nToday's order is not a ruling on the government's underlying motion for a stay pending \nappeal, which I hope will ultimately be granted. But given the clear error below and \nirreparable resulting harms, a temporary stay is warranted. See 9th Cir. R. 27-3. We have \ngranted such stays before, including in another case today. E.g., Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. \nWolf, No. 19-56417 (9th Cir. Dec. 20, 2019); East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, No. 19-\n16487 (9th Cir. Sept. 10, 2019), ECF No. 45; Innovation Law Lab v. Nielsen, No. 19-15716 \n(9th Cir. Apr. 12, 2019), ECF No. 6. We should have issued a temporary stay here as well. I \ntherefore respectfully dissent. \nI \nThis case arises from Presidential Proclamation No. 9945, entitled Suspension of Entry of \nImmigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System, in Order To \nProtect the Availability of Healthcare Benefits for Americans. Pres. Proc. No. 9945, 84 Fed. \nReg. 53,991 (2019). Citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) and his authority under the Constitution, the \nPresident suspended and limited the entry of certain immigrants who cannot show that, \n\nwithin 30 days of arriving in the United States, they \"will be covered by approved health \ninsurance\" or \"possess[] the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts.\" Id. at 53,992. \nThe Proclamation references data \"show[ing] that lawful immigrants are about three times \nmore likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.\" Id. at 53,991. And it finds \nthat healthcare providers and taxpayers bear a \"substantial\" burden on behalf of those \"who \nlack health insurance or the ability to pay,\" so that \"[c]ontinuing to allow entry into the United \nStates of certain immigrants who lack health insurance or the demonstrated ability to pay for \ntheir healthcare would be detrimental\" to the national interest. Id. The President also noted \nother financial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose, including reliance \non publicly funded benefit programs and overreliance on emergency room care, which in \nturn results in \"delays for those who truly need emergency services.\" Id. \nTo remedy these problems, the Proclamation requires visa applicants to show that they will \nhave healthcare coverage that would satisfy the Proclamation or show they are otherwise \nable to afford reasonably foreseeable medical expenses. Id. at 53,992. Under the \nProclamation, an immigrant must \"establish that he or she meets its requirements, to the \nsatisfaction of a consular officer, before the adjudication and issuance of an immigrant \nvisa.\" Id. at 53,993. It also provides that the \"[t]he Secretary of State may establish \nstandards and procedures governing such determinations.\" Id. By its terms, the \nProclamation does not apply to immigrants who have already entered the United States \npursuant to a visa or those \"entering the United States through means other than immigrant \nvisas.\" Id. at 53,992-93. The Proclamation thus does not apply to \"lawful permanent \nresidents.\" Id. at 53,993. It also makes clear that \"nothing in this proclamation shall be \nconstrued to affect any individual's eligibility for asylum, refugee status, withholding of \nremoval, or protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment.\" Id. \nThe Proclamation requires the preparation of an inter-agency report \"within 180 days of [its] \neffective date\"—and each year thereafter—on \"the continued necessity of and any \nadjustments that may be warranted to the suspension and limitation on entry\" \nimposed. Id. In the event \"circumstances no longer warrant the continued effectiveness of \nthe suspension and limitation on entry,\" the President is to be \"immediately\" advised. Id. \nThe Proclamation was set to take effect on November 3, 2019, id. at 53,994, but two days \nbefore, plaintiffs—a Multnomah County, Oregon advocacy organization and several United \nStates citizens with family members who will allegedly be seeking immigrant visas—\nrequested and received a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the \nProclamation nationwide. On November 26, 2019, the district court granted plaintiffs' \nrequest for a nationwide preliminary injunction. Doe #1 v. Trump, 2019 WL 6324560 (D. Or. \nNov. 26, 2019). \nThe district court held that the statutory basis for the Proclamation—8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)—\nwas an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it \"provides no guidance \nwhatsoever for the exercise of discretion by the President.\" Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560 at \n*10. The district court also held that the Proclamation was \"unconstitutional under \nseparation of powers,\" because it \"contravenes\" the public charge provisions of the \n\nImmigration and Nationality Act. Id. at *12, 15-16. The district court declined to stay its order \npending appeal. The government filed an emergency motion with this Court, seeking an \nimmediate temporary stay of the district court's injunction and a stay pending appeal by \nDecember 27, 2019. \nII \nThis Court has the power to issue temporary stays pending appeal in cases of immediate \nirreparable harm. See 9th Cir. R. 27-3. These are sometimes called administrative stays or \nemergency stays. The name is less important than the standards that govern the request. \nThe backdrop for the government's motion for a temporary stay is necessarily the ultimate \nrelief it is requesting, which is a complete stay pending appeal. That request is governed by \nthe following factors: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether \nissuance of the stay will substantially injur[e] the other parties interested in the proceeding; \nand (4) where the public interest lies. \nCity and Cty. of S.F. v. USCIS, 2019 WL 6726131, at *10 (9th Cir. Dec. 5, 2019) \n(quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433-34 (2009)). As we have explained, \"`[l]ikelihood \nof success on the merits is the most important factor.'\" East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \nBarr, 934 F.3d 1026, 1028 n.3 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 575 \n(9th Cir. 2018)). \nThe Court appears to suggest, without citation, that when it comes to a request for a \ntemporary stay, the merits are not to be considered. But the instant request for a temporary \nstay is part of the request for a stay pending appeal, and the Court cites no authority for why \nthe usual stay factors—including likelihood of success on the merits—would not apply. In \nthis case, moreover, the government filed its emergency motion and motion for stay \npending appeal on December 4, 2019, and the plaintiffs have filed oppositions to both \nmotions. We have had more than enough time to consider the merits, and under the \ncircumstances, not considering the likelihood of success has the undesired effect of \nallowing a demonstrably incorrect injunction to remain in place without justification. \nBecause the only question currently before us is whether to grant a temporary stay, my \nanalysis here is necessarily abbreviated. But it does not take much to show that the district \ncourt's order is clearly wrong and produces irreparable harm every day it persists. \nA \nSection 1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides: \nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the \nUnited States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by \nproclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all \n\naliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of \naliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). As the Supreme Court explained in Trump v. Hawaii, this provision \n\"exudes deference to the President in every clause\" and \"grants the President sweeping \nauthority to decide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, and for how \nlong.\" 138 S. Ct. at 2408, 2413. In combination with the President's own inherent \nconstitutional authority in this space, Proclamation No. 9945 was plainly authorized under § \n1182(f). \nThe district court nevertheless concluded that § 1182(f) was unconstitutional under the \nnondelegation doctrine because \"[t]here is no `intelligible principle' provided as to what it \nmeans to be `detrimental,' what the `interests' of the United States are, what degree of \nfinding is required, or what degree of detriment is required.\" Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560, at \n*10. That holding is unprecedented. \nThe nondelegation doctrine is one of the most infrequently applied doctrines in \nconstitutional law. Just last Term, the Supreme Court reiterated that \"[w]e have almost \nnever felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy \njudgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.\" Gundy v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019) (quotations omitted). That reticence explains why \n\"only twice in this country's history (and that in a single year) ha[s] [the Supreme Court] \nfound a delegation excessive.\" Id. In the context of immigration—in which the President's \nauthority is based on both statutory and constitutional powers—it cannot be that this case \nnow presents just the third instance in our Nation's history in which the nondelegation \ndoctrine should apply. \nSection 1182(f), which was enacted in 1952, has for decades been the noted source of \nstatutory authority for presidential proclamations involving immigration \nmatters. See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409-10, 2412. The sudden discovery that this \nlongstanding statute is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power would therefore \nbe surprising, to say the least. But it is of course no such thing. Less than two years ago, \nand in the course of upholding a presidential proclamation issued pursuant to § 1182(f), the \nSupreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii held that § 1182(f) was a \"comprehensive delegation\" of \nauthority to the President, explaining that \"the language of § 1182(f) is clear.\" Id. at 2408, \n2410. That is the opposite of an unconstitutional delegation lacking any intelligible principle, \nas the district court erroneously held. \nThe district court's analysis also proceeded from the mistaken assumption that that the \nPresident's authority in this area is entirely delegated. It is not. In United States ex rel. \nKnauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950), the Supreme Court rejected a nondelegation \nchallenge to a precursor to § 1182(f). In so doing, it held that \"[t]here is no question of \ninappropriate delegation of legislative power involved here,\" because \"[t]he exclusion of \naliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty\" and \"[t]he right to do so stems not alone from \nlegislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the \nnation.\" Id. at 542; see also Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2418. All of this explains why \"the strict \nlimitation upon congressional delegations of power to the President over internal affairs \ndoes not apply with respect to delegations of power in external affairs.\" Youngstown Sheet \n\n& Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 636 n.2 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). The district \ncourt's novel decision ignores this well-settled law and fails to accord the political branches \nthe deference they are understandably due in this area. \nThe district court's separation of powers analysis fares no better. The district court also \nenjoined the Proclamation as \"unconstitutional under separation of powers,\" on the theory \nthat the Proclamation contravenes the public charge provision of the INA, Doe #1, 2019 WL \n6324560, at *12-16, which renders inadmissible an immigrant who \"is likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). In making that public charge \ndetermination, the INA lists a series of non-exhaustive factors to be considered \"at a \nminimum,\" including \"assets, resources, and financial status.\" Id. § 1182(a)(4)(B). In the \ndistrict court's view, the Proclamation is inconsistent with the \"totality of the circumstances\" \napproach in § 1182(a)(4)(B) because \"it makes ability to pay for anticipated care . . . [the] \nsingle, dispositive factor.\" Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560, at *14. \nOnce again, the district court seriously erred in failing to follow Supreme Court precedent. \nIn Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court rejected the very sort of argument that the district \ncourt accepted here. There, the plaintiffs claimed that a different presidential proclamation \nsupplanted the INA because Congress had already legislated in the area that the \nproclamation covered. 138 S. Ct. at 2410-12. The Supreme Court disagreed because § \n1182(f) \"vests authority in the President to impose additional limitations on entry beyond the \ngrounds for exclusion set forth in the INA.\" Id. at 2412 (emphasis added). Indeed, the \nSupreme Court viewed it as \"unsurprising\" that \"§ 1182(f) vests the President with `ample \npower' to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the \nINA.\" Id. at 2408 (quoting Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 187 (1993)) \n(emphasis added). \nThat is all the President did here, and there is thus no basis for the district court's \ndetermination that the Proclamation is somehow \"executive lawmaking in a manner that \nCongress expressly rejected in the public charge provision.\" Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560, at \n*14. As we recently explained in granting a stay pending appeal of a different challenge to \nExecutive action, the \"public charge\" provision recites \"factors [that] are to be considered `at \na minimum,'\" but \"[o]ther factors may be considered as well, giving officials considerable \ndiscretion in their decisions.\" City and Cty. of S.F., 2019 WL 6726131, at *13; see also \nid. (\"Congress set out five factors to be taken into account by immigration officials, but \nexpressly did not limit the discretion of officials to those factors.\"). \nThe district court nonetheless found it relevant that, in its view, the Proclamation \"is unlikely \nto make any meaningful difference to address the problem\" of our country's overburdened \nhealthcare system, and that the Proclamation's \"implementation will not result in a reduction \nto the problem that would then, in turn, result in the restriction no longer being \nnecessary.\" Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560, at *15. Reasoning such as this improperly \nsupplanted the district court's view for that of the President, to whom the Constitution and \nCongress through § 1182(f) have accorded great discretion. See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409. \nB \n\nThe government will also suffer immediate irreparable harm in the absence of a temporary \nstay. The district court's order blocks the President from carrying out responsibilities that \nCongress entrusted to him under § 1182(f), in an area in which the President has his own \npowers under the Constitution. In the President's judgment, immigrants \"who have not \ndemonstrated any ability to pay for their\" medical care impose substantial burdens on the \nAmerican healthcare system, requiring the immediate suspension and limitations that the \nProclamation sets forth. Pres. Proc. No. 9945, 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,991. The Proclamation \ndoes not apply once an immigrant has been admitted to the United States, id. at 53,992-93; \nEmergency Mot. at 19, so the government can never recover health care costs incurred by \nindividuals admitted during the period that the district court's injunction remains in place. \n\"[S]uch harm is irreparable here because\" the government \"will not be able to recover \nmonetary damages.\" Azar, 911 F.3d at 581. Nor can the government avoid other associated \nharms that the Proclamation identifies, such as disruption in the provision of emergency \nservices. \nIn addition, plaintiffs' claim that the Proclamation will affect substantial numbers of \nimmigrants \"seems to prove [the government's] point\" on immediate irreparable harm. City \nand Cty. of S.F., 2019 WL 6726131, at *24. In seeking a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs \nrepresented that the Proclamation would \"affect[] an estimated two-thirds of all legal \nimmigrants, or 375,000 people\" and that its impact would be \"immediate.\" Mot. For Prelim. \nInj. at 2, 40, Doe #1 v. Trump, Case No. 3:19-cv-01743-SB (D. Or.), ECF No. 46. As we \nhave recognized, assertions like this are \"double-edged,\" because if the Proclamation would \nprevent the admission of many immigrants unable to pay for their own medical costs, \"the \nharm cited by [the government] is not only irreparable, but significant.\" City and Cty. of \nS.F., 2019 WL 6726131, at *24. \nThat immediate harm is only magnified by the extraordinary scope of the district court's \ninjunction, which short-circuits the procedures for class certification by giving thousands of \npersons not before the court the relief that the class certification process is designed to \nevaluate. We have cautioned against the use of nationwide injunctions like the one that the \ndistrict court issued here. See East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 934 F.3d at \n1030 (citing Azar, 911 F.3d at 583). We have also made clear that nationwide injunctions \nmust be \"necessary to remedy a plaintiff's harm.\" Id. at 1029. The district court did not \nundertake this analysis, holding that mere \"alleged classwide harm\" could justify a universal \ninjunction. Doe #1, 2019 WL 6324560, at *21. That too was error and would justify \nnationwide injunctions in every putative class action, contrary to law. See East Bay \nSanctuary Covenant, 934 F.3d at 1029; Azar, 911 F.3d at 582. \nIt is no answer that an administrative stay would upset the status quo. In the case of stay \nrequests, \"[m]aintaining the status quo is not a talisman.\" Golden Gate Rest. Ass'n v. City \nand Cty. of S.F., 512 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 2008). And as we have explained, \"the \nSupreme Court . . . did not include preservation of the status quo among the factors \nregulating the issuance of a stay.\" Id. (quotations omitted). Moreover, while the plaintiffs \nassume that the status quo is a world without the Presidential Proclamation, for the reasons \nexplained above, the actual status quo is a legal environment in which the President \npossesses \"sweeping proclamation power in § 1182(f),\" Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at \n2408 (quotations omitted), and in which Proclamation No. 9945 is therefore authorized. As a \nresult, \"granting a stay in this case would, in a real sense, preserve rather than change the \n\nstatus quo\" because \"[i]n the absence of the district court injunction,\" the Proclamation that \nwas scheduled to take effect on November 3, 2019 \"would now be part of the status \nquo.\" Golden Gate Rest. Ass'n, 512 F.3d at 1116. Plaintiffs' argument therefore has it \nbackwards: \"[a] stay simply suspend[s] judicial alteration of the status quo,\" while the \ninjunctive relief granted below constitutes \"judicial intervention\" upending it. Nken, 556 U.S. \nat 429 (quotations omitted). \nWhile the Court notes that \"[t]he Proclamation has not yet gone into effect,\" that is only \nbecause the district court enjoined it. It should not be that a district court order enjoining a \nlawful presidential proclamation is immune from a stay simply because it blocked the \nProclamation before it could take effect. And I do not think that a district court order that \nunduly constrains the powers of the people's elected representatives without basis in law \nshould govern for any longer than it already has. \nI respectfully dissent. \n ",

Simon, District Judge. \n \nOn October 4, 2019, the President of the United States issued Proclamation No. 9945, \ntitled “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will \nFinancially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”). The question \npresented in this case is not whether it is good public policy to require applicants for immigrant \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 2 of 48\n \nvisas to show proof of health insurance before they may enter the United States legally, as the \nPresident directed in the Proclamation. Under our constitutional system of separation of powers, \nthat is a question for the elected branches of government. Instead, the principal question before \nthe Court is whether the Constitution assigns to Congress or to the President the responsibility \nfor deciding that policy question. Under Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution, \nclause 3 gives Congress the power to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations” and clause 4 \nstates that Congress shall establish a “uniform Rule of Naturalization.” Under Article II of the \nConstitution, section 1, clause 1 provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a \nPresident of the United States,” and section 3 directs that the President “shall take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.” \nAt various times in our nation’s history, Congress established a uniform rule of \nnaturalization. Most recently, Congress did so in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 \n(“INA”), as amended. In that law, including later amendments, Congress comprehensively \nestablished the immigration policy of the United States. Last year, in the case of Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), the Supreme Court confirmed that although Congress may \ndelegate certain powers to the Executive Branch, the President may not execute those powers in \na way that “expressly override[s] particular provisions” of the INA. Id. at 2411. For the reasons \nexplained in the following pages, the President’s Proclamation requiring legal immigrants to \nshow proof of health insurance before being issued a visa by the State Department is inconsistent \nwith the INA. In addition, and independently, the Proclamation was not issued under any \nproperly delegated authority. It is, therefore, the duty of the Court in this case to preliminarily \nenjoin enforcement of that Proclamation. \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 3 of 48\n \nSTANDARDS \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Defense Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show \nthat: (1) he or she is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) he or she is likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in his or her favor; and \n(4) that an injunction is in the public interest. Id. at 20 (rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s earlier rule \nthat the mere “possibility” of irreparable harm, as opposed to its likelihood, was sufficient, in \nsome circumstances, to justify a preliminary injunction). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, however, did not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s \nalternative “serious questions” test. All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131-32 \n(9th Cir. 2011). Under this test, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship balance \nthat tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other \ntwo elements of the Winter test are also met.” Id. at 1132. Thus, a preliminary injunction may be \ngranted “if there is a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff; there are serious questions going \nto the merits; the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the plaintiff; and the injunction is \nin the public interest.” M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 725 (9th Cir. 2012). \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \nA.  The Immigration and Nationality Act  \nCongress has legislated immigration since 1882. See An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 \nStat. 214 (1882). Since then, Congress amended the immigration laws several times, until \npassing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. This statute was significantly revised by \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the early version of the current INA. Aspects of \nthis law has been amended many times through the passage of other laws, but most significantly \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 4 of 48\n \nthrough direct amendments in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Immigration \nAct of 1990, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. \nCongress adopted an immigrant visa system to further four principal goals: reunifying \nfamilies, admitting immigrants with skills that are useful to the United States economy, \nprotecting refugees and others in need of humanitarian resettlement, and promoting diversity. \nCongress gave priority, however, to family reunification when it established the current \nimmigration system. The allocation of visas reflects this goal. The INA authorizes an unlimited \nnumber of permanent visas to “immediate relatives,” who are defined as “the children, spouses, \nand parents of a citizen of the United States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens \nshall be at least 21 years of age.” 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b). These visas are granted regardless of \ncountry of national origin, even though other visa categories have caps based on country of \nnational origin and total number of allocated visas. Other family-based preference categories, \nsuch as those for adult children, siblings, and relatives of Legal Permanent Residents, are capped \nat 480,000 per year (with a statutory minimum of 226,000), as compared to 140,000 maximum \nannual employment immigrant visas and 55,000 maximum annual diversity immigrant visas. 8 \nU.S.C. § 1151(c)-(e). Family-based petitions account for 65 percent of immigrant visas granted \neach year. \nThe first step in both the family-based and employment visa application process is for a \nrelative or employer in the United States to file a sponsorship petition on behalf of the \nprospective immigrant. After the sponsorship petition is approved, the prospective immigrant \napplies for a visa and submits supporting documentation. When the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) deems the application complete, the immigrant visa applicant is \ninterviewed. Applicants who are outside the United States must interview at a United States \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 5 of 48\n \nconsulate abroad. For applicants who are inside the United States, some may be eligible to apply \nfor immigrant visas domestically, without having to travel to a consulate, but others must leave \nthe country to appear for a consular interview abroad. Individuals in this latter category include \nnoncitizens who have accrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence in the United States but \nhave obtained an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility to excuse the unlawful presence bar under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B). See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e). To obtain an I-601A waiver, applicants must \nshow that refusal of admission of the immigrant applicant and would cause “extreme hardship” \nto eligible family members. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3)(vi) (incorporating the “extreme hardship” \nstandard of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)). Diversity visas are available through a lottery to \nindividuals from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States; the \nlottery winners self-petition and apply to a consulate for their visa. \nAt the interview, the consular officer determines whether the immigrant visa applicant is \neligible for admission to the United States. In the INA, Congress established ten categories of \n“Inadmissible Aliens” who are “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the \nUnited States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). If the visa applicant falls into one of these categories, his or \nher application will be denied. Most relevant to the pending lawsuit is the “public charge” \ncategory: “Any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a \nvisa . . . is likely to become a public charge is inadmissible.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \nCongress’s 1996 amendment to the INA clarified how consular officers should make the public \ncharge determination.  \nAn early proposed House bill in the 1996 amendment required a visa applicant to \ndemonstrate to a consular officer based on “age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial \nstatus, education, skills, or a combination thereof, or an affidavit of support” that the visa \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 6 of 48\n \napplicant would not become a public charge. H.R. Rep. 104-469, 89 (1996). This proposed bill \nalso defined “public charge” to include an immigrant who received any of six categories of non-\ncash public benefits, including Medicaid, for an aggregate of 12 months within seven years from \nthe date of entry. Id. at 90. An early proposed Senate bill designated an immigrant as a public \ncharge based on receipt of any means-tested cash or non-cash public benefits for an aggregate \nof 12 months during the immigrant’s first five years in the United States. See S. Rep. 104-249, \n48 (1996). Congress ultimately, however, rejected receipt of non-cash benefits as determinative, \nand instead outlined five relevant factors that must be considered. At a minimum, the INA now \nrequires consideration of the applicant’s (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, \nresources, and financial status, and (5) education and skills. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). The \nconsular officer also may consider any affidavit of support filed with the application. Id. \n§ (a)(4)(B)(ii). In addition, after listing specific categories of inadmissibility, Congress provided \nthat the President may, upon finding that the entry of any aliens or class of aliens into the United \nStates “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” by proclamation suspend the \nentry of any class of aliens as immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any additional \nrestrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Id. § 1182(f). \nIf the consular officer denies the applicant’s immigrant visa at the interview, the applicant \nmust navigate the complex reconsideration process while remaining outside the United States. \nWhen an application is denied, I-601A waivers are automatically revoked. Applicants for whom \nfamily separation was found by USCIS to create an extreme hardship will be separated. They \ncannot return to the United States until they either obtain reconsideration of their visa denial, or \nobtain a new provisional waiver. \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 7 of 48\n \nB.  Statutes Governing Healthcare for Immigrants in the United States \nOther statutes besides the INA also apply to legal immigrants, including those affected by \nthe Proclamation. These laws include the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of \n1996 (“PRWORA”), the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 \n(“CHIPRA”), and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”). Both \nPRWORA and CHIPRA contemplate that states would use funds to provide benefits to newly \narrived legal immigrants. PRWORA limits the availability of means-tested federal benefits to \nlegal newly arrived immigrants, but authorizes states to use state funds to offer means-tested \nstate benefits. CHIPRA is more explicit, providing states with federal funding to provide medical \ncoverage to newly arrived legal immigrant children. The ACA is also explicit in its support of \nlegal immigrants, affirmatively allowing newly arrived legal immigrants to use premium tax \ncredits to buy insurance offered on local, state-based markets (or “exchanges”). Indeed, premium \ntax credits are more broadly available to legal immigrants than they are to United States citizens. \nAll plans on the exchanges must cover certain “essential health benefits.”  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Proclamation \n1.  Overview of the Proclamation \nOn October 4, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued the Proclamation. It barred \notherwise qualified legal immigrants, visa applicants primarily seeking reunification with family \nmembers, from entering the United States unless they can show the consular officer that they will \nnot financially burden the United States healthcare system. President Trump directed that the \nProclamation become effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on November 3, 2019. On \nNovember 2, 2019, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), temporarily \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 8 of 48\n \nenjoining Defendants from taking any action to implement or enforce the Proclamation through \nNovember 30, 2019, and setting a preliminary injunction hearing for November 22, 2019.  \nThe Proclamation estimated “uncompensated [health] care costs” at more than $35 billion \nin each of the last 10 years. The Proclamation measured these costs as “unreimbursed services \nthat hospitals give their patients.” The Proclamation does not explain the source of this figure or \nhow it was calculated. For example, it is not clear whether the underlying “unreimbursed \nservices” costs are the amount billed by hospitals—which is often substantially higher than the \ncost actually paid by insurance companies or patients who individually pay their bills—or a \n“market” figure such as an average “allowed amount” that insurance plans would have paid for \nsuch care. It is also not clear whether all of these “unreimbursed services” are for uninsured \npersons or whether they also include amounts not paid from insured persons who are unable to \npay co-insurance amounts, co-pays, or deductibles.  \nThe Proclamation links the burden of “uncompensated care costs” to legal immigrants \nwith a single unsourced sentence: “data show that lawful immigrants are about three times more \nlikely than US citizens to lack health insurance.” Based on this, the President concluded that \nallowing certain otherwise qualified legal immigrants into the United States would “saddle” the \nU.S. healthcare system and the American taxpayer with increases costs. Under the Proclamation, \na visa applicant intending lawfully to immigrate to the United States will presumptively \nfinancially burden the healthcare system and American taxpayers unless the applicant “will be \ncovered by approved health insurance . . . within 30 days of the [applicant’s] entry into the \nUnited States,” or “unless the [applicant] possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable healthcare costs.” \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 9 of 48\n \nThe Proclamation does not discuss any data or provide any estimate regarding how much \nof the estimated $35 billion in “uncompensated costs” actually stems from recent uninsured legal \nimmigrants or how often recent uninsured legal immigrants use the nation’s healthcare system. \nOn the other hand, Plaintiffs provide the opinion of an expert, Dr. Leighton Ku, a Professor of \nHealth Policy and Management and Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the \nMilken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University in Washington, DC., \nwith more than 25 years of experience as a health policy researcher. ECF 54. Dr. Ku opines that \nrecent uninsured immigrants use less than one-tenth of one percent (0.06 percent) of total \nAmerican medical resources and only 0.08 percent of emergency room services. Id. at 10. If only \nlegal uninsured immigrants were considered (the group included in the Proclamation), the \nnumbers would be even lower. Id.1 \n2.  Types of Approved Health Insurance and Barriers to Access \nThe Proclamation lists eight types of approved health insurance: (1) employer-sponsored \nplans; (2) “unsubsidized” ACA market plans on state exchanges; (3) Short Term Limited \nDuration Insurance (“STLDI”) plans effective for at least 364 days; (4) catastrophic plans; \n(5) family member plans; (6) TRICARE and the like; (7) visitor health plans effective for at \nleast 364 days; and (8) Medicare. The Proclamation does not clarify what is meant by \n“unsubsidized” ACA market plans, but the Court assumes that it refers to plans purchased \nwithout the assistance of premium tax credits. \nMany of these approved plans are legally or practically unavailable to intending, or \nprospective, immigrants. Employer-sponsored plans are often not an option for family-based visa \n                                                 \n1 Amici cite to an American Medical Association letter stating that immigrants’ overall \nhealthcare expenditures are generally one-half to two-thirds those of U.S. born individuals, \nacross all age groups. ECF 88 at 20. \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 10 of 48\n \napplicants, who are unlikely to have a job offer waiting before arriving in the United States. \nFamily-based visa applicants have difficulty applying for jobs before entry because when they \nmight receive approval to enter the United States is unknown and approval may take years. Even \nthose fortunate enough to have secured employment may fall short. Most employers impose a \nwaiting period before coverage begins, and the average waiting period is longer than the \nProclamation’s 30-day coverage deadline. Market-rate ACA plans can be prohibitively \nexpensive and have high deductibles. The Proclamation does not explain why “unsubsidized” \nACA plans are allowed yet “subsidized” ACA plans are not.  \nSTLDI plans are banned or restricted in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New \nYork, and Rhode Island. Twenty states have contract term limitations making STLDI plans \nineligible under the Proclamation. Nineteen states limit the contract term to 11 months or less \nand Maine requires that the insurance contract end on December 31st, making it highly unlikely \nthe contract term will last for 364 days. STLDI plans also do not cover essential health benefits \nand are thus unavailable on exchanges. Unlike exchange plans, STDLI plans can deny coverage \nbased on preexisting conditions and impose dollar caps on core coverage.  \nThere are additional barriers to the other “approved” plans. Family-member plans are \nonly available to applicants younger than 27 years old. Visitor’s insurance plans are designed for \nshort-term visits, have caps on individual coverage and lifetime benefits, and often exclude \npreexisting conditions, mental health conditions, and maternity care. Such plans often result in \nsignificant uncompensated care. People who receive insurance through state Medicaid programs \nmay not be able to add their family members to their plan. Catastrophic plans are only available \nto people who are already legally present. Even then, only people under 30 (or who obtain a \nspecial hardship exemption) are eligible to enroll. TRICARE is available only to members of the \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 11 of 48\n \nUnited States military and their close relatives. Medicare is perhaps the least feasible option—\nonly intending immigrants older than 65 who have already been living continuously in the \nUnited States for five years may enroll.  \nB.  The Named Plaintiffs in this Putative Class Action \n1.  Latino Action Network \nLatino Action Network (“Latino Network”) is an organization that provides programs \naimed at educating and empowering Multnomah County Latinos. The Proclamation has already \nsignificantly affected Latino Network’s ability to accomplish its mission.  \nLatino Network employs an “Immigration Navigator,” who helps clients move through \nthe complicated immigrant visa process. After the President issued the Proclamation, the \nworkload of Latino Network’s Immigration Navigator dramatically increased. Normally, the \nImmigration Navigator connects families with low-cost legal services and develops educational \nworkshops on immigration legal services. He has put these duties on hold since the Proclamation \nwas issued and has had to postpone individual intake interviews and cancel workshops to serve \nessentially as a consultant on how the Proclamation will affect worried families. The \nProclamation’s burden falls upon other Latino Network employees as well. The Executive \nDirector had to reassign the Early Childhood Director to coordinate Latino Network’s response \nto the Proclamation. As a result, Latino Network’s childhood development programs are \nessentially on hold. \nLatino Network’s Executive Director estimates that responding to the Proclamation will \nconsume up to 15 percent of paid staff members’ weekly time. Training staff and conducting the \nnecessary research will cost Latino Network almost $14,000—money not in their budget. The \ntime and money that Latino Network employees spend responding to the Proclamation is time \nand money they are unable to spend fulfilling their core mission. \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 12 of 48\n \n2.  Individual Named Plaintiffs \nThe individual named plaintiffs submitted declarations describing their personal \ncircumstances, health, and financial situation and explaining why they and their relatives would \nnot be able to comply with the requirements of the Proclamation. These plaintiffs are United \nStates citizens who are sponsoring immediate family members for immigrant visas. They seek \nonly legally to reunite with their family members.  \nPlaintiff John Doe #1 is a U.S. citizen who lives in Oregon with his U.S. citizen son and \nnoncitizen wife. He and his son have coverage through the Oregon Health Plan, Oregon’s \nMedicaid program. He sponsored an immigrant visa for his wife, a national of Mexico. Her \napplication was approved in July 2017. She also received an I-601A conditional waiver. John \nDoe #1 is no longer able to work due to a disability. He had heart surgery in 2018 and is \nreceiving social security disability benefits. The family expects that after his wife receives lawful \nimmigrant status, she will work and help financially support the family. Additionally, given the \nhealth problems of John Doe #1 and his son, his wife currently takes care of both of them. If her \nI-601A visa is revoked, it will result in extreme difficulty for the family. She had a consulate \ninterview scheduled for November 6, 2019, in Mexico, but on November 1, 2019, she requested \nthe interview be postponed because of the Proclamation and her fear that her immigrant visa \nwould be denied and her waiver would be revoked. John Doe #1 and his wife have reviewed the \nProclamation’s acceptable insurance plans, and they are either unavailable to them or \nunaffordable. \nPlaintiff Juan Ramon Morales is a U.S. citizen who lives in New York with his U.S. \ncitizen daughter, lawful permanent resident step-daughter, and noncitizen wife. He sponsored an \nimmigrant visa for his wife, a national of Mexico. Her application was approved in July 2017. \nShe also received an I-601A waiver in April 2019. He and his wife are both currently employed. \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 13 of 48\n \nHe and his children all have health insurance coverage. His children are covered by subsidized \nplans and he is covered by a catastrophic plan through his employer. His wife’s employer does \nnot provide health insurance. Mr. Morales is not able to add his wife to his plan until she has a \nsocial security number. Thus, after she has received her immigrant visa, she can be added, but \nuntil then she cannot be added to his plan. He has asked his employer for documentation to this \neffect, but there is nothing that guarantees that she will have coverage within 30 days of her \neligibility to be added to his employer-sponsored plan. Mr. Morales has reviewed the other \noptions allowable through the Proclamation and they are either unavailable to his wife or \nunaffordable. His wife had emergency brain surgery in 2010 and suffers from seizures and \nheadaches. Her preexisting conditions make other available insurance and her reasonably \nanticipated medical expenses cost prohibitive. \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #2 is a United States citizen who lives in California and is a single \nmother to her two U.S. citizen children. She is insured through Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid \nprogram. She sponsored immigrant visas for her parents, who currently reside in Nicaragua. \nTheir petitions were approved in July 2019. They are collecting the necessary information for the \nvisa application process. Jane Doe #2 has reviewed the Proclamation and the available medical \noptions and does not believe that she and her parents can afford any of the options. Her parents \ndo not currently have health insurance.  \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a United States citizen who lives in California. Her husband is an \narchitect who teaches architectural theory and design and is a German national, living in \nGermany. She and her husband have been apart for more than two years. Her sponsorship \npetition for her husband was approved earlier this year. Jane Doe #3 has a disability, is unable to \nwork, and has health insurance through Medi-Cal. Because it is unknown when her husband may \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 14 of 48\n \nbe permitted entry into the United States, he is unable to apply for jobs before entry. His \nemployment prospects are good and part of the benefit of having him living in this country is his \nexpected financial support as well as family reunification and emotional, psychological, and \nphysical support. He is unable, however, to show that he will be employed and have health \ninsurance within 30 days of entry. He also has multiple sclerosis, which requires expensive \ntreatments. They do not have the resources to show that they can pay cash for his reasonably \nanticipated medical expenses or to purchase “acceptable” insurance given his preexisting \nconditions, because it is unknown exactly when he will be employed. Thus, he is likely to be \ndenied entry as a result of the Proclamation.  \nPlaintiff Iris Angelina Castro is a U.S. Citizen living in Massachusetts with her U.S. \ncitizen son. She recently had to leave her job as a teacher when her son became sick. She \ncurrently has MassHealth insurance, Massachusetts’s Medicaid. She sponsored an immigrant \nvisa for her husband, who currently lives in and is a national of the Dominican Republic. His \nvisa application was approved in May 2019. Ms. Castro anticipates that her husband will have all \nnecessary paperwork submitted by mid-November, and notes that the consulate in the Dominican \nRepublic generally is quick to schedule an interview after all paperwork has been submitted. \nWithout her job, she does not believe she and her husband can show the necessary financial \nresources to pay for health care costs and without her health insurance benefits her Medicaid \nplan is not an approved plan. She contacted insurance companies when she learned of the \nProclamation, but the price quotes were more than she could afford, and were plans that provided \nincomplete coverage. She currently is pregnant and desires to have her husband living with her to \nhelp emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 15 of 48\n \nPlaintiff Blake Doe attends Oregon State University as a senior, studying civil \nengineering. His wife works full time. His noncitizen parents also live in Oregon, but are \nnationals of Mexico. He sponsored his parent’s family visa petition in 2017, and the State \nDepartment approved that petition in January 2018. On June 11, 2019, USCIS granted Blake \nDoe’s parents an I-601A provisional unlawful status waiver. Blake has reviewed the approved \nhealth insurance options, and he and his parents cannot afford any of them. His mother has health \nconditions and he does not believe that his parents will be able to show that they have the \nresources to pay for reasonably anticipated medical costs, despite the fact that his father is \nemployed. His father’s employer does not provide medical insurance. \nPlaintiff Brenda Villarruel is a U.S. citizen living in Illinois with her U.S. citizen son and \nparents and noncitizen husband. She sponsored an immigrant visa for her husband, who is a \nnational of and currently lives in Mexico. His application was approved in September 2016. \nMs. Villarruel works part-time as a medical assistant and part-time at her husband’s tattoo shop, \nin his absence. Her husband is a professional tattoo artist who used to live with her in Chicago \nbut has been in Mexico since March 2018. He has more than 100 customers awaiting his return \nto have him place their tattoos. Ms. Villarruel’s husband had his consular interview scheduled for \nNovember 5, 2019, but after learning of the Proclamation and researching the acceptable \ninsurance plans, they requested that the interview be postponed. They did not believe that they \ncould meet the terms of the Proclamation because the acceptable plans are either not available or \nunaffordable. \nANALYSIS \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nAt the preliminary injunction stage, Plaintiffs carry the burden for the same elements that \nthey must prove at trial, and Defendants carry the burden for the elements and affirmative \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 16 of 48\n \ndefenses that they must prove at trial. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente UNIAO do \nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006) (“The point remains that the burdens at the preliminary \ninjunction stage track the burdens at trial.”). Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on the \nmerits in proving their challenges to the Proclamation and to agency action implementing and \nincorporating the Proclamation. \nThe President issued the Proclamation under authority delegated to him by Congress in 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1182(f) and 1185(a).2 Plaintiffs argue that if the President’s delegated authority is as \nbroad as Defendants’ assert, it violates the nondelegation doctrine. Plaintiffs also argue that the \nProclamation is unconstitutional because it violates the fundamental principle of separation of \npowers. Plaintiffs further argue that the Proclamation violates their due process rights under the \nFifth Amendment. Plaintiffs also challenge agency action implementing the Proclamation as \nviolating the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  \nDefendants respond that Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the Proclamation are judicially not \nreviewable, and even if they were, Plaintiffs would not be able to succeed on their challenges to \nthe Proclamation. Defendants argue that the President exercised properly-delegated and \ninherently broad authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) to issue the Proclamation, that the \nProclamation does not contravene any provision of the INA but instead properly supplements \nthat statute, and that the Proclamation does not violate Plaintiffs’ due process rights because it \nwas issued based on a facially legitimate and bona fide reason. Defendants further contend that \n                                                 \n2 Although Defendants note that the President issued the Proclamation under authority \ndelegated by Congress in both 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) and 1185(a), Defendants do not assert any \nseparate arguments under § 1185(a) and instead focus their arguments on the President’s \nauthority under § 1182(f). The Court, therefore, will focus its analysis on § 1182(f). See Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2407 n.1 (2018) (noting that the two provisions substantially overlap \nand that the Supreme Court need not resolve the relationship between the two provisions). \nPAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 17 of 48\n \nthe agencies’ actions are not final and reviewable, and even if they were, they do not violate the \nAPA. The Court begins by evaluating the likelihood of success of Plaintiffs’ claims challenging \nthe Proclamation. \n1.  Justiciability \nDefendants cite to Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977), for their argument that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims challenging the Proclamation are not judicially reviewable. Fiallo involved a challenge to \ncertain provisions of the INA. Id. at 788. The Supreme Court noted that “it is important to \nunderscore the limited scope of judicial inquiry into immigration legislation.” Id. at 792. \n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court continued, discussing earlier cases that had noted that the \ntypes of decisions involved in immigration cases “are frequently of a character more appropriate \nto either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary” and that those types of cases \n“dictate a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the \narea of immigration and naturalization.” Id. at 796 (quotation marks omitted). The court in \nFiallo, however, expressly rejected the government’s argument that the plaintiff’s challenges to \nthe INA were not reviewable, noting that “[o]ur cases reflect acceptance of a limited judicial \nresponsibility under the Constitution even with respect to the power of Congress to regulate the \nadmission and exclusion of aliens.” Id. at 793 n.5.  \nFiallo, therefore, does not support Defendants’ contention that a Presidential \nproclamation involving immigration is not reviewable by a court when it is alleged to be \nunconstitutional or to contravene the INA, among other federal statutes. Despite emphasizing the \ncomplete legislative power of Congress in the field of immigration, the Supreme Court in Fiallo \nnevertheless reviewed the challenge on the merits. Id. at 797-99. Moreover, the Supreme Court \nhas reviewed on the merits challenges to Presidential proclamations involving immigration, \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 18 of 48\n \nincluding proclamations under § 1182(f). See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) \n(“Hawaii”); Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 188 (1993). \nDefendants argue, however, that the permissible review is only for constitutional \nchallenges and that any non-constitutional claims are unreviewable. Defendants contend that \nPlaintiffs’ separation of powers claim is merely a statutory claim—a claim that the Proclamation \ncontravenes the INA and other statutes—and is not a constitutional claim. The Supreme Court \naddressed a similar argument in Hawaii. 138 S.Ct. at 2407. In that case, the court noted that in \nSale it had reviewed such a challenge on the merits over the government’s justiciability argument \nand that there is no provision of the INA that strips the court of its jurisdiction over such claims, \nconcluding that it could therefore “assume without deciding that plaintiffs’ statutory claims are \nreviewable, notwithstanding consular nonreviewability or any other statutory nonreviewability \nissue.” Id.  \nAdditionally, the Ninth Circuit has expressly addressed and rejected this argument. \nHawaii v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741, 768 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Hawaii II”), rev’d on other grounds and \nremanded, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1162-63 (9th \nCir.), reconsideration en banc denied, 853 F.3d 933 (9th Cir. 2017), reconsideration en banc \ndenied, 858 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2017), and cert. denied sub nom. Golden v. Washington, 138 S. \nCt. 448, 199 L. Ed. 2d 331 (2017). The Ninth Circuit noted that when a plaintiff challenges a \nPresident’s promulgation of sweeping immigration policy, “[c]ourts can and do review both \nconstitutional and statutory ‘challenges to the substance and implementation of immigration \npolicy.’” Hawaii II, 859 F.3d at 768 (quoting Washington, 847 F.3d at 1163). The Ninth Circuit \nfurther explained: \nThis case is justiciable because Plaintiffs seek judicial review of \nEO2, contending that EO2 exceeds the statutory authority \nPAGE 18 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 19 of 48\n \ndelegated by Congress and constitutional boundaries. “This is a \nfamiliar judicial exercise.” Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, \n566 U.S. 189, 196 (2012). We reject the Government’s argument \nthat the Order is not subject to judicial review. Although “[t]he \nExecutive has broad discretion over the admission and exclusion of \naliens, [ ] that discretion is not boundless. It extends only as far as \nthe statutory authority conferred by Congress and may not \ntransgress constitutional limitations. It is the duty of the courts, in \ncases properly before them, to say where those statutory and \nconstitutional boundaries lie.” Abourezk v. Reagan, 785 F.2d 1043, \n1061 (D.C. Cir. 1986), aff’d, 484 U.S. 1 (1987). \nWhatever deference we accord to the President’s immigration and \nnational security policy judgments does not preclude us from \nreviewing the policy at all. See Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, \n70 (1981) (“[D]eference does not mean abdication.”); Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 34 (2010) (“Our \nprecedents, old and new, make clear that concerns of national \nsecurity and foreign relations do not warrant abdication of the \njudicial role.”). \nId. at 768-69. \nPlaintiffs also dispute Defendants’ characterization of Plaintiffs’ separation of powers \nchallenge as non-constitutional and merely statutory. The Ninth Circuit’s holding that both \nstatutory and constitutional challenges to executive orders regarding immigration issues are \nreviewable by a court, however, has not been disturbed by the Supreme Court and remains \nbinding on this Court. Moreover, the Court sees no reason to forego review on the merits when \nthe Supreme Court has twice engaged in such review. Accordingly, regardless of how Plaintiffs’ \nseparation of powers claim is characterized, it is judicially reviewable. \n2.  Nondelegation Doctrine \nCongress “may not transfer to another branch ‘powers which are strictly and exclusively \nlegislative.’” Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (quoting Wayman v. \nSouthard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 42-43 (1825)). Congress may, however, “obtain the assistance \nof its coordinate Branches” and may “confer substantial discretion” on the Executive branch. Id. \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 20 of 48\n \n(alteration and quotation marks omitted). Thus, “a statutory delegation is constitutional as long \nas Congress ‘lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body \nauthorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.’” Id. (alterations in \noriginal) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989)). “The constitutional \nquestion is whether Congress has supplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of \ndiscretion.” Id. “In determining what [Congress] may do in seeking assistance from another \nbranch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and \nthe inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordination.” J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928). “[T]he degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies \naccording to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.” Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAssociations, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001).3 \n“Policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are peculiarly \nconcerned with the political conduct of government. . . . that the formulation of these policies is \nentrusted exclusively to Congress has become about as firmly imbedded in the legislative and \njudicial tissues of our body politic as any aspect of our government.” Galvan v. Press, 347 \nU.S. 522, 531 (1954). The Supreme Court “has repeatedly emphasized that over no conceivable \nsubject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over the admission of \naliens.” Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792 (quotation marks omitted). Congress established in § 1182(a) \n“classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission.” Specific subsections bar immigrants based \non numerous specific grounds, including health-related grounds, criminal-related grounds, \nwhether the visa applicant would cause “potentially serious adverse foreign policy \n                                                 \n3 Concerns with broad delegations of unconstrained discretion are applicable to the \nPresident. See, e.g., Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 414-15 (1935). \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 21 of 48\n \nconsequences,” participation in acts of genocide or torture, membership in a totalitarian political \nparty, or whether the visa applicant would become a “public charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).  \nCongress delegated authority to the President to make additional limitations or to suspend \nentry of aliens. The delegation of authority in § 1182(f) provides, in relevant part: \nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any \nclass of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the \ninterests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for \nsuch period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all \naliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or \nimpose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be \nappropriate. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) (emphasis added). \nOn its face, this provision provides no guidance whatsoever for the exercise of discretion \nby the President. The only limit to the President’s discretion is the requirement to make the \nfinding that entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” There is no \n“intelligible principle” provided as to what it means to be “detrimental,” what the “interests” of \nthe United States are, what degree of finding is required, or what degree of detriment is required. \nThis is the type of unrestrained delegation of legislative power that the Supreme Court has \ninvalidated. See, e.g., Whitman, 531 U.S. at 474 (noting that statutes have been stricken under the \nnondelegation doctrine when they have “provided literally no guidance for the exercise of \ndiscretion” or they have “conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no \nmore precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring ‘fair competition’”). It is “a \nstandard so indefinite as to confer an unlimited power.” Fed. Radio Comm’n v. Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co. (Station WIBO), 289 U.S. 266, 285 (1933). \nDefendants argue that this delegation of authority does not present nondelegation \nconcerns because the Supreme Court has already addressed the issue in United States ex rel. \nKnauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950). In Shaughnessy, the Supreme Court evaluated the \nPAGE 21 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 22 of 48\n \nlawfulness of the delegation of authority to the President in a precursor statute to the INA. This \nprecursor statute, however, delegated to the President authority as follows: \nWhen the United States is at war or during the existence of the \nnational emergency proclaimed by the President on May 27, 1941, \nor as to aliens whenever there exists a state of war between, or \namong, two or more states, and the President shall find that the \ninterests of the United States require that restrictions and \nprohibitions in addition to those provided otherwise than by this \nAct be imposed upon the departure of persons from and their entry \ninto the United States, and shall make public proclamation thereof, \nit shall, until otherwise ordered by the President or Congress, be \nunlawful . . . . \n338 U.S. at 540 n.1. \nIn evaluating this delegation of authority, which was applicable only in times of war or \nthe 1941 national emergency, the Supreme Court stated that excluding aliens was not only a \nlegislative function but also “inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the \nnation.” Id. at 542. The Supreme Court thus concluded:  \nthe decision to admit or to exclude an alien may be lawfully placed \nwith the President . . . . Normally Congress supplies the conditions \nof the privilege of entry into the United States. But because the \npower of exclusion of aliens is also inherent in the executive \ndepartment of the sovereign, Congress may in broad terms \nauthorize the executive to exercise the power, e.g., as was done \nhere, for the best interests of the country during a time of national \nemergency. \nId. at 543 (emphasis added). \nThe Supreme Court mentioned the President’s authority under § 1182(f) in Sale. In that \ncase, however, the Supreme Court did not address the specific issue of nondelegation. Further, \nthat case involved the Haitian immigrant crisis that arose after a military coup in 1991 deposed \nthat country’s first democratically-elected President, Jean Bertrand Aristide. 509 U.S. at 162. \nThe number of immigrants from Haiti rose dramatically and could not safely be processed on \nU.S. Coast Guard cutters as they had been for the previous decade, or in Guantanamo. Id. at 163. \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 23 of 48\n \nThe immigrants were attempting to arrive in unseaworthy vessels and many drowned. Id. \nAllowing screening of the immigrants for refugee status on U.S. soil would defeat the attempt to \ncontrol illegal immigration, impede diplomatic efforts to restore the democratic government \nHaiti, and posed a life-threatening danger to the immigrants attempting to arrive in dangerous \ncraft. Id. at 164. Refusing to screen the immigrants at all would deny them potential refuge at a \npolitically tumultuous time. Id.  \nUltimately, President George H.W. Bush ordered the Coast Guard to “intercept vessels \nillegally transporting passengers from Haiti to the United States and to return those passengers to \nHaiti without first determining whether they may qualify as refugees.” Id. at 158. The Supreme \nCourt held that “neither § 243(h) [of the INA] nor Article 33 of the United Nations Protocol \nRelating to the Status of Refugees applies to action taken by the Coast Guard on the high seas.” \nId. at 159 (footnote omitted). In so holding, the Supreme Court noted that under § 1182(f) the \nPresident had “ample power to establish a naval blockade that would simply deny illegal Haitian \nmigrants the ability to disembark on our shores” and that whether the President’s chosen method \nof dealing with this immigrant emergency “poses a greater risk of harm to Haitians who might \notherwise face a long and dangerous return voyage is irrelevant to the scope of his authority to \ntake action that neither the Convention nor the statute clearly prohibits.” Id. at 187-88. The \nSupreme Court then noted that Congressional statutes generally do not have extraterritorial \napplication unless such intent is clearly manifested and this presumption is particularly \napplicable when “construing treaty and statutory provisions that may involve foreign and \nmilitary affairs for which the President has unique responsibility.” Id. at 188. Notably, Sale did \nnot turn on the question of the President’s power under § 1182(f), because the question presented \nPAGE 23 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 24 of 48\n \nin Sale related to § 1253(d) of the INA. The Supreme Court’s discussion of § 1182(f), therefore, \nwas dicta.  \nThe Supreme Court directly analyzed the President’s authority under § 1182(f) in \nHawaii. Again, however, the Supreme Court did not specifically address the nondelegation \ndoctrine. The Supreme Court noted the “comprehensive delegation” of authority in § 1182(f) and \nthat § 1182(f) “exudes deference” to the President. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408. That case \ninvolved the President’s proclamation resulting in the “travel” or “Muslim” ban. That \nproclamation “sought to improve vetting procedures by identifying ongoing deficiencies in the \ninformation needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries present ‘public safety \nthreats’” and “placed entry restrictions on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for \nmanaging and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed inadequate.” Id. \nat 2404. It “reflect[ed] the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet \nofficials and their agencies.” Id. at 2421. In discussing the sufficiency of the President’s findings \nunder § 1182(f), the Supreme Court quoted Sale regarding the deference given to a President in \nhis “chosen method” for dealing with foreign relations problems and stated that “when the \nPresident adopts ‘a preventive measure . . . in the context of international affairs and national \nsecurity,’ he is ‘not required to conclusively link all of the pieces in the puzzle before [courts] \ngrant weight to [his] empirical conclusions.” Id. at 2409 (quoting Holder v. Humanitarian Law \nProject, 561 U.S. 1, 35 (2010)). \nIn evaluating the nondelegation issues raised by § 1182(f), the Court considers what these \nthree cases addressing the authority granted to the President in § 1182(f) and a similar earlier \nprovision instruct. Knauff does not support the conclusion that the current version of § 1182(f) \ndoes not present any nondelegation issues. Knauff involved a much narrower delegation of \nPAGE 24 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 25 of 48\n \nauthority, only in time of war or national emergency. The discussion in Knauff regarding \nimmigration involving both executive and legislative power, although not limited to times of war \nor national emergency, was focused on the President’s authority to govern “foreign affairs.” The \nproclamation in Knauff was also issued during a time of war, when the President’s authority is at \nits zenith. Sale involved several issues relating to foreign affairs in an emergency and \nextraterritorial context. These included the diplomatic concerns in trying to restore a democratic \ngovernment in Haiti and concerns regarding the lives of tens of thousands of Haitians, most of \nwhom were not going to qualify for refugee status, who were risking their lives attempting to \ntravel by boat to the United States in dangerous crafts. This was a political and humanitarian \nemergency occurring beyond the borders of the United States. Hawaii also involved important \nissues of national security and foreign affairs. The proclamation at issue was an attempt to \nenhance detection of “terrorists” and other similar “public safety threats.” 138 S. Ct. at 2404-05. \nIt also involved activities occurring beyond the borders of the United States, because it dealt with \nvetting processes taking place in foreign countries. \nThe Court extrapolates from these cases that when Congress delegates authority to the \nPresident in the immigration context and that authority involves foreign relations or national \nsecurity, especially in an emergency or extraterritorial context, then the nondelegation concerns \nare lessened because the President has his own inherent powers under Article I. That appears to \nbe the intent of Congress in enacting the broad authority of § 1182(f). It also appears to be how \n§ 1182(f) has been previously exercised, until now.4 The Proclamation, however, uses § 1182(f) \nto engage in domestic policymaking, without addressing any foreign relations or national \n                                                 \n4 Based on the proclamations discussed by the parties. The Court did not conduct an \nindependent review of all proclamations issued under § 1182(f) or earlier, similar provisions. \nPAGE 25 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 26 of 48\n \nsecurity issue or emergency. In this wholly domestic context, the delegation by Congress is \nwithout any intelligible principle and thus fails under the nondelegation doctrine. \nDefendants argue that because immigrants come from foreign countries, anything to do \nwith immigration is inherently “foreign relations.” The Court, however, does not accept such a \nbroad construction. As the text of Article I and more than two centuries of legislative practice \nand judicial precedent make clear, the Constitution vests Congress, not the President, with the \npower to set immigration policy. If the fact that immigrants come from other countries inherently \nmade their admission foreign relations subject to the President’s Article II power, then all of this \nlaw would be superfluous. \n3.  Separation of Powers \nEven if the Proclamation is not an unconstitutional exercise of domestic lawmaking \nauthority under the nondelegation doctrine, it would still be unconstitutional under separation of \npowers. Plaintiffs contend that the Proclamation is an unconstitutional attempt to rewrite a key \nprovision of the INA through “executive fiat.” Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on \ntheir claims that the President’s exercise of his discretion in issuing the Proclamation violates the \nConstitution’s bedrock principle of separation of powers because the Proclamation contravenes \nor overrides specific provisions of the INA. \nDefendants respond that this claim is not a constitutional claim, but a statutory claim that \nthe Proclamation was issued outside the President’s authority delegated by Congress in § 1182(f) \nof the INA. Whether the claim is evaluated as a statutory claim or a constitutional separation of \npowers claim, the result is the same. The Supreme Court has stated that when the President \nexercises his authority under § 1182(f), the Court “may assume that § 1182(f) does not allow the \nPresident to expressly override particular provisions of the INA.” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2411. \nPAGE 26 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 27 of 48\n \nThus, if the Proclamation contravenes a provision of the INA, it is both a statutory violation and \na constitutional violation of separation of powers. \nThe constitutional principle of separation of powers embodies “the central judgment of \nthe Framers of the Constitution that, within our political scheme, the separation of governmental \npowers into three coordinate Branches is essential to the preservation of liberty.” Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 380 (1989). Separation-of-powers concerns are primarily aimed at \npreventing aggrandizement by one branch encroaching into the sphere of authority of another. Id. \nat 382 (“It is this concern of encroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our separation-\nof-powers jurisprudence[.]”); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 122 (1976) (per curiam) (“The \nFramers regarded the checks and balances that they had built into the tripartite Federal \nGovernment as a self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one \nbranch at the expense of the other.”). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has “not hesitated to strike \ndown provisions of law that either accrete to a single Branch powers more appropriately diffused \namong separate Branches or that undermine the authority and independence of one or another \ncoordinate Branch.” Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 382. \n“The Constitution and its history evidence the ‘unmistakable expression of a \ndetermination that legislation by the national Congress be a step-by-step, deliberate and \ndeliberative process.’” City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1232 (9th \nCir. 2018) (quoting I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983)). Thus, “[t]he power to enact \nstatutes may only ‘be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \nconsidered, procedure.’” Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 439-40 (1998) (quoting \nChadha, 462 U.S. at 951). Further, “[t]here is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the \nPresident to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton, 524 U.S. at 438. \nPAGE 27 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 28 of 48\n \nThe President issued the Proclamation purportedly based on authority granted to him by \nCongress in § 1182(f) of the INA. The President may not, however, exercise his discretion \ngranted under § 1182(f) to “override” a provision of the INA. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2411. Thus, \nthe primary question is whether the Proclamation overrides, contravenes, or is otherwise \nincompatible with any provision of the INA. As explained by Justice Jackson in his concurrence \nin Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer: \nWhen the President takes measures incompatible with the \nexpressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest \nebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers \nminus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. \nCourts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case \nonly by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject. \nPresidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive \nmust be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the \nequilibrium established by our constitutional system. \n343 U.S. 579, 637-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); see also Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. \nKerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2083 (2015) (“In considering claims of Presidential power this Court \nrefers to Justice Jackson’s familiar tripartite framework from Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. \nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (concurring opinion).”). \nPlaintiffs assert that the Proclamation conflicts with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), the “public \ncharge” provision of the INA. Plaintiffs argue that the Proclamation impermissibly establishes \nhealthcare insurance as the sole factor determining inadmissibility based on creating a “financial \nburden” to the United States, even though the public charge provision directly legislates \ninadmissibility based on the concern of creating a financial burden on the United States. The \npublic charge provision enumerates a list of factors that must be considered “at a minimum” in \nevaluating whether a visa applicant will become a public charge, including: age; health; family \nstatus; assets, resources, and financial status; and education and skills, and the consular officer \nPAGE 28 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 29 of 48\n \nalso may consider whether an affidavit of support was filed. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i)-(ii). \nThese factors were expressly added to the INA by Congress in 1996.  \nBefore the 1996 legislation was passed, some legislators proposed having public charge \ninadmissibility tied to the receipt of certain non-cash public benefits, but that effort failed. These \nnon-cash benefits included Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families with \nDependent Children, supplemental nutrition assistance, and other means-tested public assistance. \nSee H.R. Rep. 104-469, 89. In 2013, the U.S. Senate voted down two proposed amendments to \nthe public charge provision. One would have expanded the criteria for public charge to include \nthe requirement that visa applicants show that they were not likely to receive benefits under \nMedicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. See S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013); see \nalso City and Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immig. Svcs. (“USCIS”), --- F. Supp. \n3d ---, 2019 WL 5100718, at * 25 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2019). The second would have expanded \nthe definition of “public charge” to ensure that persons who received non-cash health benefits \ncould not become permanent legal residents and that visa applicants who would be likely to \nreceive such benefits in the future would be denied entry. See S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 63 (2013); \nsee also USCIS, 2019 WL 5100718, at *26.  \nThe public charge provision as amended in 1996 mandates that the consular officer or the \nAttorney General “shall at a minimum consider” all of the enumerated factors. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). This codified the longstanding practice of evaluating the “totality of the \ncircumstances” of the applicant. USCIS, 2019 WL 5100718, at *21, 25. That subsection ensures \nthat no one single factor is dispositive.  \nDefendants argue that the Proclamation does not contravene or supplant the public charge \nprovision, but instead merely supplements it. Defendants argue that the focus of the \nPAGE 29 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 30 of 48\n \nProclamation is not on whether on an applicant will become a public charge, but on fixing the \nburden to the healthcare infrastructure and taxpayers. Defendants note that a visa applicant now \nmust meet the requirements of both the public charge provision of the INA and the Proclamation. \nDefendants’ arguments are not persuasive.  \nThe Proclamation discusses the burden on the national healthcare infrastructure and its \neffect on American taxpayers. The Proclamation supplants § 1182(a)(4)(B), however, because it \nis designed to stop immigrants from being a burden on taxpayers by using public resources such \nas Medicaid, subsidized ACA plans, and free emergency room and medical services. This is the \npurview of the public charge provision. Additionally, the primary concern of the Proclamation is \nthe burden on taxpayers and not the burden on private industry. The Proclamation states: \n“Immigrants who enter this country should not further saddle our healthcare system, and \nsubsequently American taxpayers, with higher costs.” This also is the purview of the public \ncharge provision.  \nThe Proclamation does not create an additional factor, health insurance, to be considered \nin the totality of the circumstances that Congress has mandated be considered in evaluating \nwhether a visa applicant will create an undue burden on the resources of the United States. \nInstead, it makes the ability to pay for anticipated care needs a single, dispositive factor, first by \nrequiring an assessment of the applicant’s available health insurance, a new factor, and then by \nrequiring an assessment only of the applicant’s health and financial resources, which are two of \nmany factors that Congress has mandated must all be considered.  \nMoreover, the Proclamation is executive lawmaking in a manner that Congress expressly \nrejected in the public charge provision. The Proclamation excludes in its permissible insurance \nplans mean-tested health benefits such as Medicaid and subsidized plans under the ACA, \nPAGE 30 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 31 of 48\n \nnotwithstanding the fact that Congress has repeatedly refused to include Medicaid and other \nmean-tested non-cash public benefits in the public charge inadmissibility standards. See \nYoungstown, 343 U.S. at 588 (“[T]he President’s order does not direct that a congressional \npolicy be executed in a manner prescribed by Congress—it directs that a presidential policy be \nexecuted in a manner prescribed by the President.”); cf. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2411 (finding that \nthe travel ban executive order “supports Congress’s individualized approach for determining \nadmissibility”). The Proclamation does not, therefore, support the INA’s approach for \ndetermining admissibility but instead essentially amends or supplants the INA in a manner \nsimilar to which Congress has previously refused, contravening Congress’s will.  \nThe Proclamation also purports to “impose on the entry of aliens [a] restriction[]” the \nPresident deems necessary under § 1182(f). In effect, however, it actually bars entry from an \nentire class of immigrants—those who cannot afford health insurance or afford to pay for \nreasonably necessary medical costs. There are two problems with this restriction. \nThe first problem is that this bar to entry is not a “suspension” as is authorized by \n§ 1182(f), but is indefinite. The President expressly cites the reason for the suspension as the \nwidespread problem of “uncompensated costs” in the nationwide healthcare system. There is no \nreasonable interpretation of the Proclamation showing that this intractable problem is going to \nend any time soon, particularly when the only evidence in the record supports that recent \nimmigrant use of medical services is less than one-tenth of one percent. The Proclamation, \ntherefore, is unlikely to make any meaningful difference to address the problem and its \nimplementation will not result in a reduction to the problem that would then, in turn, result in the \nrestriction no longer being necessary. Moreover, the President provides no guidance in the \nProclamation for determining under what circumstances the necessity for the Proclamation \nPAGE 31 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 32 of 48\n \nwould be over. This is unlike the travel ban Proclamation, which involved specific deficiencies \nin a handful of country’s vetting systems that triggered that proclamation—if those deficiencies \nall were cured, that proclamation would no longer be needed. See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2410 \n(“[T]he Proclamation makes clear that its ‘conditional restrictions’ will remain in force only so \nlong as necessary to ‘address’ the identified ‘inadequacies and risks’ within the covered \nnations.”). The restrictions to entry were directly connected to the problem that triggered that \nproclamation and there were identifiable solutions that would result in the revocation of the \nsuspension to entry. Here, the identified “inadequacies and risks” are a massive, estimated $35 \nbillion-per-year domestic systemic health care problem. That is the “triggering condition.” The \nSupreme Court held in Hawaii that a proclamation may be a proper “suspension” of entry so \nlong as in the proclamation the President “may link the duration of those restrictions, implicitly \nor explicitly, to the resolution of the triggering condition.” Id. at 2410. The Proclamation, \nhowever, contains no guidance for how this domestic problem of $35 billion in “uncompensated \ncosts” can or will be solved any time in the foreseeable future. Thus, despite the fact that the \nPresident instructs in the Proclamation for a report on the “continued necessity” of the \n“suspension and limitation” contained in the Proclamation within 180 days and then annually \nthereafter, that instruction may not reasonably be interpreted as providing any possible \nforeseeable end date. Therefore, the Proclamation may not reasonably be interpreted as imposing \nmerely “conditional restrictions.” It may only reasonably be interpreted as a categorical \nexclusion for any affected immigrant who cannot afford health insurance or reasonably \nanticipated medical costs. Such an indefinite bar to entry is not within the President’s authority \nunder § 1182(f). See Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409-10. \nPAGE 32 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 33 of 48\n \nThe second problem is that this bar to entry is reinstating a bar that Congress expressly \neliminated from the INA—the bar to “paupers.” In the 1891 amendment to the immigration law, \nCongress provided that: “That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission \ninto the United States . . . : All idiots, insane persons, paupers or persons likely to become a \npublic charge . . . .” An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the \nImportation of Aliens Under Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 \n§ 1 (1891). “Paupers” continued to be included in the classes of aliens that were excluded for \ndecades. Congress, however, expressly removed, among others, “paupers” from the categories of \naliens excluded from § 1182 in the 1990 amendments to the INA. See Immigration Act of 1990, \n104 Stat. 4978, Title 6 § 601 (1990).5 The President simply does not have the constitutional \nauthority to amend a statute. Clinton, 524 U.S. at 438. \nThe Proclamation also contravenes and overrides § 1182(a)(4)(E).6 Congress exempted \nfrom the public charge financial burden restriction certain victims of violent crime or domestic \nviolence and their family members. The Proclamation does not provide the same broad \nexemption. Defendants argue that very few applicants will actually fall within the exemption of § \n1182(a)(4)(E) and be effected by the Proclamation, but nonetheless at least some will.7 The \n                                                 \n5 Whether the United States should categorically exclude “paupers” from entry as \nimmigrants is a policy decision that Congress may make in its law-making capacity, using its \n“step-by-step, deliberate and deliberative process,” Chadha, 462 U.S. at 959, and its “single, \nfinely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure.” Clinton, 524 U.S. at 439-40 (quotation \nmarks omitted). Such decisions are not for the President to make in his law-executing capacity, \nparticularly when Congress has already explicitly rejected that categorical exclusion. \n6 The Court expresses no opinion at this stage of the litigation about whether the \nProclamation also contravenes or overrides various healthcare laws and other immigration laws \nand provisions, as argued by Plaintiffs. \n7 Defendants also argue that no named Plaintiffs falls within the category of persons \naffected by this subsection, but Plaintiffs are seeking in this putative class action a uniform \ninjunctive remedy that would apply to all putative class members, and are not requesting any \nPAGE 33 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 34 of 48\n \nProclamation stands in direct contravention to a statute passed by Congress after Congress’s \n“exhaustively considered,” Clinton, 524 U.S. at 439-40, and “deliberate and deliberative \nprocess.” Chadha, 462 U.S. at 959. \nThe Proclamation is anticipated to affect approximately 60 percent of all immigrant visa \napplicants. The President offers no national security or foreign relations justification for this \nsweeping change in immigration law. Instead, the President attempts to justify the Proclamation \nbased on an asserted burden to the United States healthcare system and federal taxpayers. \nWhether a visa applicant is a burden on the resources of the United States and, thus, taxpayers, \nhowever, is precisely the sphere governed by § 1182(a)(4).  \nFurther, the Proclamation is, significantly, unlike the executive order at issue in Hawaii. \nIn that case, the executive order was challenged as being inconsistent with a completely different \nprovision of the INA, § 1152(a)(1)(A), and the Supreme Court found that the two provisions \n“operate in different spheres.” 138 S. Ct. at 2414. The Proclamation, however, contravenes two \nprovisions of § 1182(a)(4), which operate in the same sphere as § 1182(f). Indeed, it has been \nnoted that “[t]he President’s sweeping proclamation power thus provides a safeguard against the \ndanger posed by any particular case of class of cases that is not covered by one of the categories \nin section 1182(a).” Abourezk v. Reagan, 785 F.2d 1043, 1049 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1986 (Ginsburg, J.) \n(emphasis added).  \nThe Court finds that § 1182(a)(4) and 1182(f) are in the same sphere. Congress has \nalready spoken in § 1182(a)(4) on the issue of limiting immigrant admissibility based on the \npotential financial burden on the resources of the United States, and the Proclamation \n                                                 \nspecific relief under the Violence Against Women Act or § 1182(a)(4)(E). At this stage of the \nlitigation, the Court is treating Plaintiffs as adequate class representatives for all putative class \nmembers. See Section D, infra. \nPAGE 34 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 35 of 48\n \ncontravenes and overrides Congress’s explicitly stated direction and will. As previously stated, \nthe President may not take action to “enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” Clinton, 524 U.S. \nat 438. Plaintiffs, therefore, have shown a likelihood of success on the merits on their claim that \nthe Proclamation violates the Constitution’s principle of separation of powers and is outside the \nscope of the President’s authority granted in § 1182(f). Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs \nhave shown a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim (as well as serious questions going \nto the merits) and their argument that the Proclamation violates the nondelegation doctrine, the \nCourt does not at this time reach Plaintiffs’ due process challenge to the Proclamation or \nchallenges to agency action under the APA. \nB.  Likelihood of Irreparable Harm \n“A plaintiff seeking preliminary relief must ‘demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely \nin the absence of an injunction.’” California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 22). “A threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant \npreliminary injunctive relief if the plaintiff ‘is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision \non the merits can be rendered.’” Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, 1023 (9th \nCir. 2016) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs will not suffer irreparable harm because their family \nmembers’ visas will only be “delayed.” The Ninth Circuit already has rejected a very similar \nargument. See Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 699 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Hawaii III”), rev’d on other \ngrounds and remanded, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) (holding that the immigrant family member \nplaintiffs’ claims of “prolonged separation from family members” constituted “indefinite delay” \nsufficient to satisfy irreparable harm to support preliminary injunction); Washington, 847 F.3d \nat 1169 (identifying “separated families” as among the substantial and irreparable harms); cf. \nMoore v. City of E. Cleveland, Ohio, 431 U.S. 494, 503-04 (1977) (explaining that “the \nPAGE 35 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 36 of 48\n \nConstitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is \ndeeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition”). \nRejection of Defendants’ argument is particularly appropriate in this case. At least two \nnamed Plaintiffs had interviews scheduled that were postponed due to the Proclamation. It is \nlikely that those interviews will be rescheduled before a decision on the merits. Those Plaintiffs \nare not likely to meet the requirements of the Proclamation, and there is no indication that they \nwill otherwise fail any of the requirements of § 1182(a). One of those Plaintiffs risks having his \nwife’s I601-A waiver automatically revoked if she is denied a visa at the interview. She will be \nunable to return to the United States and live with him and their son. She takes care of both of \nthem, who suffer from health problems. Other Plaintiffs also have I601-A waivers for their \nsponsored family members, who risk being forced to leave the United States for an indefinite \nperiod of time. These are immigrant applicants for whom it has already been determined it would \nbe an “extreme hardship” on family members for them to be separated.  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs can avoid harm simply by purchasing insurance. \nPlaintiffs, however, have stated that they cannot afford the plans that are available to them. \nDefendants also argue that an applicant who is “healthy” can easily meet the Proclamation’s \nrequirements because there will not be an “reasonably necessary medical expenses.” Many \nPlaintiffs, however, describe existing health problems that will result in reasonably medical \nexpenses. The Court finds that the individual Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood that they will \nsuffer sufficiently immediate irreparable harm. It is also likely that putative class members will \nsuffer similar irreparable harm. \nAdditionally, Defendants do not address the irreparable harm claimed by Plaintiff Latino \nNetwork. Latino Network has had to divert significant resources to deal with the Proclamation \nPAGE 36 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 37 of 48\n \neven before it went into effect, preventing Latino Network from engaging in its core mission. \nLatino Network would have to continue to divert resources and abandon a significant portion of \nits core mission if the Proclamation were allowed to go into effect. This qualifies as sufficient \nirreparable harm. See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1116 (N.D. \nCal. 2018) (“Given the injuries described above, the Organizations ‘have established a likelihood \nof irreparable harm’ based on their showing of serious ‘ongoing harms to their organizational \nmissions,’ including diversion of resources and the non-speculative loss of substantial funding \nfrom other sources.” (citation omitted)). \nC.  Balancing the Equities and Public Interest \nIn weighing equities, a court “must balance the competing claims of injury and must \nconsider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.” \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 24 (citation omitted). When the government is the defendant, generally the \nbalancing of the equities and the public interest factors merge. See, e.g., League of Wilderness \nDefs./Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014). \nWhen determining the public interest, a court “primarily addresses impact on non-parties rather \nthan parties.” Id. (quoting Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court, 303 F.3d 959, 947 (9th Cir. \n2002). When the alleged action by the government violates federal law, the public interest factor \ngenerally weighs in favor of the plaintiff. See Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1029; see also Inland \nEmpire-Immigrant Youth Collective v. Nielsen, 2018 WL 1061408, at *21 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, \n2018) (“In addition, the Court again notes the public interest that exists in ensuring that the \ngovernment complies with its obligations under the law and follows its own procedures.” \n(quotation marks omitted)); Coyotl v. Kelly, 261 F. Supp. 3d 1328, 1344 (N.D. Ga. 2017) (“[T]he \npublic has an interest in government agencies being required to comply with their own written \nguidelines instead of engaging in arbitrary decision making.”).  \nPAGE 37 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 38 of 48\n \nTwenty-one states,8 the District of Columbia, and the City of New York City \n(collectively “Government Amici”) filed an amici brief outlining their interests and the \nsignificant harm these states and other governmental entities will suffer if the Proclamation is \nallowed to go into effect. They explain that immigrants “are vital to the economic, civic, and \nsocial fabric of our states and city.” They describe how family reunification benefits the \neconomic, social, and psychological well-being of the affected individuals, while family \nseparation results in myriad harms, including mental and behavioral health issues, lower \nacademic achievement among children, toxic stress, cognitive impairment, and symptoms of \npost-traumatic stress disorder. They quote the 1981 Select Commission on Immigration and \nRefugee Policy, a congressionally-appointed commission tasked with studying immigration \npolicy, describing the necessity of family reunification: \n[R]eunification . . . serves the national interest not only through the \nhumaneness of the policy itself, but also through the promotion of \nthe public order and well being of the nation. Psychologically and \nsocially, the reunion of family members with their close relatives \npromotes the health and welfare of the United States. \nECF 88 at 13. \nGovernment Amici also describe how immigrants benefit economies. They note that \nimmigrants have “enriched our country’s social and cultural life, injecting new ideas into our \nintellectual fabric, offering path-breaking contributions in science, technology, and other fields, \nand ultimately making our diverse communities engines of innovation and more desirable places \nto live.” They explain that because the Proclamation will dramatically decrease the number of \nlawful immigrants, it will “cause substantial economic harm to Amici, including by diminishing \n                                                 \n8 The states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North \nCarolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. \nPAGE 38 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 39 of 48\n \nrevenue collection, dampening small business creation, and reducing employment in key sectors \nof the economy.”  \nGovernment Amici detail that immigrants pay nationally more than $405.4 billion in \ntaxes, and immigrant-owned companies employ more than 7.9 million workers.

These households exercised more than $240 billion in spending power \nin California, $8.9 billion in spending power in Minnesota, and $7.4 billion in spending power in \nOregon. With respect to New York City, immigrants contributed $195 billion, or 22 percent, to \nthe gross domestic product of 2017. Immigrants own 52 percent of businesses in New York City, \ncreating jobs and providing essential goods and services. \nGovernment Amici further detail the harm to certain employment sectors, which are \ndisproportionately filled with immigrants. For example, in California, more than two-thirds of \nthe jobs in agricultural sectors, 45.6 percent of manufacturing positions, 43 percent of the \nconstruction workers, and 41 percent of workers in computer and mathematical sciences are \nfilled by immigrants. In Oregon 39.5 percent of workers in the farming, fishing and forestry \nsector, nearly 20 percent of the workers in manufacturing positions, and 18.4 percent of \naccommodation and food service workers are filled by immigrants. \nFinally, Government Amici explain how the Proclamation likely will harm their interests \nwith respect to the state-based health insurance marketplace. The ACA authorized the creation of \nexchanges presenting affordable insurance coverage choices for consumers in order to “increase \nthe number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.” \nPAGE 39 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 40 of 48\n \nNat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012). The ACA provides premium \ntax credits for purchasing insurance on the exchange to help offset the cost. 26 U.S.C. § 36B. \nCongress extended those tax credits to any taxpayer who “is an alien lawfully present in the \nUnited States . . .” Id. at § 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii). The Proclamation only allows “unsubsidized” ACA \nplans, which although undefined, appears to mean plans that do not utilize the tax credit.  \nGovernment Amici describe how the fact that legal immigrants will be unable to obtain \ncomprehensive plans under the ACA, and will instead be forced to buy unregulated plans such as \nSTLDI and some of the other “approved” plans will result in the immigrants being left \nunderinsured. This underinsurance will, in turn, burden local and state governments because \nunderinsured persons are at higher risk of uncompensated cost than if they were permitted to \npurchase a comprehensive subsidized plan under the ACA. For example, Government Amici \ndiscuss how STLDI plans typically exclude coverage of preexisting conditions or charge \nexorbitant premiums to cover those conditions, and that one recent study shows that 43 percent \nof such plans did not cover mental health services, 62 percent did not cover substance abuse \ntreatment, 71 percent did not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and 100 percent did not cover \nmaternity care.  \nLegal immigrants also may be subject to deceptive marketing and fraudulent insurance \nproducts in response to the Proclamation, which will result in Government Amici having an \nincreased regulatory burden to increase oversight to protect consumers. The proliferation of non-\nACA compliant plans may make it difficult or impossible for states to regulate such plans, \nincreasing harm to consumers and the insurance market and resulting in greater uncompensated \ncare and costs. \nPAGE 40 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 41 of 48\n \nNine nonprofit organizations9 (collectively, “Nonprofit Amici”) also filed an amici brief \nin support of the Court issuing a preliminary injunction. They describe the effect the issuance of \nthe Proclamation has had on their ability to provide their services, and how if the Proclamation \nwere to go into effect it would further erode their ability to provide services. For example, \nVirginia Garcia Memorial Health Center provides health care services for Washington and \nYamhill County, with a focus on seasonal and migrant workers. They have already seen patients \nrefusing to obtain care out of fear of the changing rules and requirements for immigrant status, \nincluding a pregnant woman declining maternity care.  \nNonprofit Amici describe the fear and anxiety they encounter in the immigrant \ncommunities they serve, the increasing family separation they have witnessed in the past few \nyears, and how it effects their constituents and services. This includes immigrants refusing \nservices and the Nonprofit Amici having to work harder to provide services that previously were \nwelcomed, even services as important as food benefits. \nDefendants’ only argument with respect to the balance of the equities and the public \ninterest is that the $35 billion problem of uncompensated health care costs is a serious national \nproblem and thus the Proclamation should be allowed to go into effect. Defendants, however, \nprovide no evidence that the Proclamation will have any effect in reducing the asserted $35 \nbillion in uncompensated costs. The Proclamation did not make such a finding. The \nProclamation merely noted that legal immigrants are more likely to be uninsured than U.S. \ncitizens, but that statistic says nothing about whether and in what amount recent legal immigrants \n                                                 \n9 The nonprofit organizations are Adelante Mujeres, Catholic Charities Immigration \nLegal Services, Causa, Centro Latino Americano, El Programa Hispano Católico, The Immigrant \nand Refugee Community Organization, Oregon Interfaith Movement for Immigrant Justice, \nVirginia Garcia Memorial Health Center, and VIVA Inclusive Migrant Network. \nPAGE 41 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 42 of 48\n \nuse national health care resources, or whether they make any meaningful contribution to the $35 \nbillion in uncompensated costs. There is no evidence in the record that immediate \nimplementation of the Proclamation is necessary to help the “national interest” of reducing \nuncompensated healthcare costs. On the other hand, there is significant evidence that allowing \nthe Proclamation to go into immediate effect will have an irreparably harmful effect on \nPlaintiffs, putative class members, state and local governments, and amici. Weighing all the \ninterests, the balance of the equities and the public interest tips sharply in favor of Plaintiffs, and \nsupports preserving the status quo until the Court renders its decision on the merits. \nD.  Conclusion \nAll four Winter factors weigh in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs \nhave met their burden to demonstrate a need for preliminary injunctive relief until the Court \ndecides the merits of this case. \nE.  Scope of Injunctive Relief \nPlaintiffs have moved for certification of a nationwide class, consisting of two subclasses, \nas follows: \nU.S. Petitioner Subclass \nIndividuals in the United States who currently have an approved or \npending petition to the United States government to sponsor a \nnoncitizen family member for an immigrant visa, or who will soon \nfile such a petition; and whose sponsored family member is subject \nto the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to a consular \nofficer’s satisfaction that he or she “will be covered by approved \nhealth insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be able “to pay \nfor reasonably foreseeable medical costs”; and \nVisa Applicant Subclass \nIndividuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for or \nwill soon apply to the United States government for an immigrant \nvisa; (ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted the visa; but (iii) are \nsubject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to the \nPAGE 42 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 43 of 48\n \nsatisfaction of a consular officer that they “will be covered by \napproved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be \nable “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” \nThe motion for class certification has not yet been fully briefed, had a hearing, or been \nresolved. Defendants argue that they should be permitted additional time to engage in some \ndiscovery relating to the named Plaintiffs, and assert that they did not have sufficient time to \nprepare their brief in response to the motion for class certification. Plaintiffs seek to include \nadditional plaintiffs in the motion for class certification, and have not yet been able to move to \namend their complaint to add those plaintiffs given the expedited process for the preliminary \ninjunction. Thus, items remain outstanding with respect to class certification. \nDefendants argue that the if the Court finds that a preliminary injunction is appropriate at \nthis time, the Court should only enter an injunction with respect to the specific named Plaintiffs \nand not a “nationwide” or “universal” injunction because the Court has not yet certified this \nlawsuit as a nationwide class action. This argument is not persuasive considering the conduct and \nharm alleged in this case. \n“[T]he scope of [a] remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the . . . violation.” \nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 270 (1977). “[T]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the \nextent of the violation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.” Califano \nv. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979). “An injunction may extend ‘benefit or protection’ to \nnonparties ‘if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are \nentitled.’” E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 779 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting \nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 1987)). Although in 2018 and 2019 the Ninth \nCircuit has remanded some cases for specific findings relating to the scope of an injunction, that \ncourt has also reaffirmed that “[i]n immigration matters, we have consistently recognized the \nauthority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a universal basis.” Id. (citing Regents of \nPAGE 43 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 44 of 48\n \nthe Univ. of Cal. v.

Ct. 2779 \n(2019); Hawaii III, 878 F.3d at 701; Washington, 847 F.3d at 1166-67). \nAdditionally, when a plaintiff requests preliminary injunctive relief before class \ncertification has been decided, a court may consider the harm to the putative class and grant \nclasswide appropriate preliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo, particularly when, \nas in this case, there is alleged classwide harm and conduct aimed at a class of persons. See J.L. \nv. Cissna, 341 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1070 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (granting a classwide injunction when \n“preliminary injunctive relief is necessary to preserve the status quo and to prevent irreparable \nharm for all Plaintiffs and the putative class”); Chhoeun v. Marin, 306 F. Supp. 3d 1147, 1164 \n(C.D. Cal. 2018) (granting a classwide injunction before certification when “an injunction is \nnecessary to forestall harm to putative class members that is likely to transpire before the parties \ncan litigate a motion for class certification”); see also Just Film, Inc. v. Merch. Servs., Inc., 474 \nF. App’x 493, 495 (9th Cir. 2012) (affirming the scope of a class-wide preliminary injunction \nthat was “tailored to maintain the status quo where class certification is pending and a class-wide \ninjunction is necessary to remedy the alleged class-wide harm”).10 “This relief may be narrowed \n                                                 \n10 District courts outside the Ninth Circuit have similarly reached this same conclusion. \nSee Abdi v. Duke, 280 F. Supp. 3d 373, 400 (W.D. N.Y. 2017) (“Under appropriate circumstances, a \ncourt may grant preliminary injunctive relief in favor of putative class members before class \ncertification, and correspondingly, assess the harm to putative class members when considering the \npreliminary injunction motion.”); Hamama v. Adducci, 261 F. Supp. 3d 820, 840 n.13 (E.D. \nMich. 2017) (issuing a classwide preliminary injunction and stating: “The Court notes that its \nissuance of a preliminary injunction comes prior to a decision on class certification. However, the \nSixth Circuit has held that ‘there is nothing improper about a preliminary injunction preceding a \nruling on class certification.’” (quoting Gooch v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of America, 672 F.3d 402, \n433 (6th Cir. 2012))); Planned Parenthod of Kansas v. Mosier, Medicare & Medicaid P 305668, \n2016 WL 3597457, at *26 (D. Kan. July 5, 2016) (“[C]ase law supports this Court’s authority to \nissue classwide injunctive relief based on its general equity powers before deciding a class \ncertification motion.”); Rodriguez v. Providence Cmty. Corrections, Inc., 155 F. Supp. 3d 758, 767 \n(M.D. Tenn. 2015) (“[A] district court may, in its discretion, award appropriate classwide injunctive \nPAGE 44 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 45 of 48\n \nin the event Plaintiffs are unable to justify certification of a class.” Cissna, 341 F. Supp. 3d \nat 1070; see also Just Film, 474 F. App’x at 495 (noting that a court should “review the \ncontinued existence and the scope of the preliminary injunction, if and when a class is \ncertified”). \nProviding such preliminary classwide relief does not first require that the Court engage in \nsome version of an analysis under Rule 23 of the Federal Civil Rules of Civil Procedure, as \nargued by Defendants. As the authorities cited above show, the important question for imposing \nclasswide relief is whether it is necessary to prevent classwide harm for alleged classwide \nconduct. Here, the Proclamation is directed against a class of persons and would cause the same \nalleged harm to the entire putative class—being forced to meet the dispositive requirement of \npurchasing health insurance or showing sufficient financial resources or face an inadmissibility \ndetermination. Having putative class members suffer this alleged irreparable harm merely \nbecause the preliminary injunction had to be litigated in an expedited fashion before class \ncertification could be fully litigated is contrary to the purposes behind class actions and \npreliminary injunctive relief to preserve the status quo. Thus, classwide relief at this stage is \nappropriate. \n                                                 \nrelief prior to a formal ruling on the class certification issue based upon either a conditional \ncertification of the class or its general equity powers.” (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas v. \nJohnston, 557 F. Supp. 879, 917 (W.D. Tex. 1983))); Lee v. Orr, 2013 WL 6490577, *2 (N.D. \nIll. 2013) (“The court may conditionally certify the class or otherwise order a broad preliminary \ninjunction, without a formal class ruling, under its general equity powers. The lack of formal class \ncertification does not create an obstacle to classwide preliminary injunctive relief when activities of \nthe defendant are directed generally against a class of persons.” (quoting Illinois League of Advocates \nfor the Developmentally, Disabled v. Illinois Dept. of Human Services, 2013 WL 3287145, *3 (N.D. \nIll. 2013))); N.Y. State Nat. Org. For Women v. Terry, 697 F. Supp. 1324, 1336 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) \n(holding that “the Court acted in the only reasonable manner it could under the circumstances, ruling \non the continuation of [the] temporary restraining order and leaving the question of class certification \nfor another day”). \nPAGE 45 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 46 of 48\n \nThe record evidence sufficiently shows the significant harm the Proclamation would \ncause to 21 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City, and the putative class members \nthat reside in these locations. The record also sufficiently shows the harm to the named Plaintiffs, \ntheir families, and additional persons who are members of the putative class (and willing to serve \nas additional class representatives).  \nThe record further shows irreparable harm to Plaintiff Latino Network, which an \ninjunction limited to only the individual Plaintiffs would not redress. There also currently are not \nany other pending lawsuits addressing the Proclamation, eliminating the concern some \ncommentators and court opinions have expressed that a “universal” injunction “would \nunnecessarily ‘stymie novel legal challenges and robust debate’ arising in different judicial \ndistricts.” E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 934 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting \nTrump, 897 F.3d at 1243-44). An injunction only affecting, for example, named Plaintiffs and \nimmigrants intending to come to Oregon or sponsored by someone in Oregon (to address the \nharm to Plaintiff Latino Network), or some other subset of persons, also would create significant \nadministrative difficulties. See, e.g., E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 391 F. Supp. 3d 974, \n985 (N.D. Cal. 2019). It would lead to uneven enforcement. It may also lead to unintended \nconsequences for the State of Oregon. This is unlike the more narrowly-crafted injunctions that \ninvolved a specific border crossing entry point, which could more easily be geographically \nsegregated.  \nA comprehensive injunction precluding enforcement of the Proclamation, thus, is \nnecessary to provide Plaintiffs and putative class members with relief at this stage of the \nlitigation and to preserve the status quo. The Court may revisit such relief after Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor class certification has been decided. \nPAGE 46 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 47 of 48\n \nF.  Stay \nDefendants request that if the Court were to issue an injunction, the Court stay the \ninjunction pending interlocutory appeal. The Court denies Defendants’ request for a stay of the \ninjunction. The Proclamation does not involve an issue of national security, sensitive diplomatic \nrelations, or even general foreign relations. The Proclamation also does not contain any specific \nfindings supporting the conclusion that its implementation will have any effect on the problem \nthat it is purporting to address, the claimed $35 billion in domestic uncompensated health care \ncosts, and certainly not during the time needed for appellate review. The irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs and the putative class, however, is immediate and significant. Accordingly, a stay is not \nappropriate.  \nG. Bond \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure directs that “[t]he court may issue a \npreliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an \namount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party \nfound to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). Federal courts, \nhowever, have discretion as to the amount of security and may even dispense with the security \nrequirement altogether. See Johnson v. Couturier, 572 F.3d 1067, 1086 (9th Cir. 2009) \n(“‘Rule 65(c) invests the district court with discretion as to the amount of security required, if \nany.’” (quoting Jorgensen v. Cassiday, 320 F.3d 906, 919 (9th Cir. 2003))); Save Our Sonoran, \nInc. v. Flowers, 408 F.3d 1113, 1126 (9th Cir. 2005) (“‘The district court has discretion to \ndispense with the security requirement, or to request mere nominal security, where requiring \nsecurity would effectively deny access to judicial review.’” (quoting Cal. ex rel. Van De Kamp v. \nTahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 766 F.2d 1319, 1325 (9th Cir. 1985))). The Court has considered \nPAGE 47 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 95    Filed 11/26/19    Page 48 of 48\n \nthe relative hardships and the likelihood of success on the merits and concludes that to require \nany security in this case would be unjust. Thus, the Court waives the requirement of a bond. \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (ECF 46) is GRANTED. Until the Court \nresolves this case on the merits or orders otherwise, or until such time as the parties agree in \nwriting to amend, supersede, or terminate this Preliminary Injunction, IT IS ORDERED that \nDefendants are enjoined from taking any action to implement or enforce Presidential \nProclamation No. 9945, “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants \nWho Will Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System.” \nDATED this 26th day of November, 2019. \n              /s/ Michael H.

Late on Friday night, October 4, 2019, President Trump issued a presidential \nproclamation that, effective November 3, 2019, will block nearly two thirds of all prospective legal \nimmigrants, mostly from predominantly nonwhite countries, from receiving visas and coming to \nthe United States.   \n2.  The “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who \nWill Financially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”) bars qualified \nimmigrant visa applicants from receiving visas and entering the United States unless they can \nestablish, “to the satisfaction of a consular officer,” that they either “will be covered by approved \nhealth insurance” within 30 days after entry or are wealthy enough—and/or healthy enough—“to \npay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”  \n3.  The Proclamation seeks to unilaterally rewrite this country’s immigration laws, \nimposing a new ground of inadmissibility that Congress has expressly rejected, and creating \nrequirements  that  will  be  extremely  difficult,  or  impossible,  for  most  otherwise  qualified \nimmigrant visa applicants to satisfy. In doing so, the Proclamation contravenes well-established \nand duly enacted immigration and healthcare laws, exceeds the scope of the President’s statutory \nauthority, and violates Constitutional separation of powers and equal protection principles.  \n4.  In implementing the Proclamation, the U.S. Department of State has publicly \nannounced on its website that, beginning November 3, 2019, all applicants for immigrant visas \nwho are subject to the Proclamation “must demonstrate to the consular officer at the time of \ninterview” that they will be covered by “approved” health insurance under the Proclamation within \n30 days of entry or have the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs”—\nand that “[i]nability to meet this requirement will result in the denial of the visa application.” \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  1 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 5 of 100\n5.  In addition to imposing new requirements for immigrant visa applicants that are \nunmoored from the existing statutory and regulatory framework, the Proclamation and agency \nimplementation  actions  provide  staggeringly  few  options  to  satisfy  this  barrier.  While  the \nProclamation lists a number of health insurance options that would-be immigrants ostensibly could \nobtain in order to satisfy the new requirement, it in fact provides few or even no options that are \navailable to these individuals in reality. First, most of the “approved health insurance” plans that \nare listed as satisfying the Proclamation’s requirement are not actually legally or practically \navailable to the vast majority of prospective immigrants—like Medicare, which requires a recipient \nto have lived in the United States for five years, or any plan available under the Affordable Care \nAct, with or without financial assistance, because such plans are only available to individuals \nliving in the United States. Second, under the Proclamation, any kind of coverage involving \ncommon federal- or state-provided health insurance benefits, such as premium tax credits under \nthe Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) for plans sold on the individual market or Medicaid coverage \nfor any individual over age 18, does not allow prospective immigrants to surmount this new barrier \nto entry. By imposing these restrictions on “approved” types of health insurance, the Proclamation \nexcludes benefits and assistance that Congress has specifically and explicitly made available by \nstatute to certain immigrants in the United States. Third, a number of the “approved” health \ninsurance options are not available in all states, or, in many cases, allow denials and exclusions \nbased on pre-existing conditions, such that many would-be immigrants would not qualify for or \nhave access to such plans. Fourth, the coverage provided under certain “approved” options is \nlimited and does not provide for “minimum essential coverage” as defined under the ACA. \n6.  The Proclamation is therefore poised to create a new class of otherwise qualified \nimmigrants who are barred from entry on the sole ground of the health insurance requirement, as \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 6 of 100\nwell as a new class of underinsured individuals with non-comprehensive coverage in the United \nStates. These effects frustrate both existing immigration laws and established healthcare laws, and \ncreate further concerns for public health and the healthcare system. Under its terms and agency \nimplementation actions, the Proclamation would ban an immigrant who would receive financial \nassistance under the ACA to purchase comprehensive individual health insurance coverage, but \nwould allow an immigrant who purchased an “approved,” non-comprehensive visitor or short-term \nlimited duration insurance plan, even though the former would be better insured and far less likely \nto  incur  uncompensated  care  costs  than  the  latter.  In  effect,  the  Proclamation  and  its \nimplementation incentivize, if not require, would-be immigrants to purchase non-comprehensive \nplans to satisfy the Proclamation’s health insurance requirement because those plans are in many \ncases the most realistically accessible to immigrants. In doing so, the Proclamation and its \nimplementation undermine not only Congress’s intent, as expressed through the ACA, to provide \na certain minimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants and citizens in the United States, but \nalso the Proclamation’s own stated goal of addressing the burdens of uncompensated care provided \nto uninsured individuals.  \n7.  The Proclamation and its implementation are similar (yet even more egregious) in \neffect to the Administration’s recently promulgated—and currently enjoined by several courts—\n“Public Charge” Rule, which attempts to redefine what it means for an immigrant to be a “public \ncharge” and therefore inadmissible to the United States. Both the Proclamation requirements and \nthe Public Charge Rule provisions are tools that the Trump Administration is seeking to use in \norder to exclude prospective immigrants who have satisfied all statutory requirements under the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”)  to  enter  the  United  States;  both  favor  so-called \n“unsubsidized” ACA health insurance over subsidized; both consider the use of Medicaid to be a \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 7 of 100\nnegative or disqualifying factor for individuals age 18 and over; and both involve some analysis \non the part of a consular officer as to whether an intending immigrant has sufficient financial \nresources to cover “reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The Public Charge rule, while still \nproblematic  and  under  challenge  on  various  grounds  (as  reflected  in  the  pending  lawsuits \nchallenging the rule and the preliminary injunction orders recently issued by several courts), was \nat least promulgated through a notice and comment rulemaking process, as required by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. The Proclamation did not go through any such a process and seeks \nto impose the same, or even a heightened, draconian effect on the immigration system through \npresidential fiat and corresponding agency action to carry out the new requirement.  \n8.  Indeed, the Proclamation is unprecedented in its scope and impact, the largest ever \nsuspension on the entry of immigrants of its kind. It will affect mostly immigrants from Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and Asia, by drastically reducing, if not eliminating, the numbers of immigrants \nwho enter the United States with family-sponsored visas, humanitarian visas, or diversity visas. \nWith no termination point or procedure by which a prospective immigrant may seek a waiver of \nthe Proclamation’s suspension on entry, the Proclamation will separate families—especially \nnonwhite families—indefinitely, in contravention of one of the bedrock principles of this country’s \nimmigration system. \n9.  Such  anticipated  effects  of  the  Proclamation  are  striking,  but  perhaps  hardly \nsurprising. Like the Public Charge Rule (and the failed RAISE Act of 2017), the Proclamation \nreflects the President’s often expressed belief that, unlike immigrants who would enter via a \n“merit-based” system, immigrants who currently enter the country through family-based and \ndiversity visas do not contribute to the United States but instead present a threat to the country’s \neconomy and security. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 8 of 100\nhe reportedly asked during a 2018 Oval Office discussion of protections for immigrants from Haiti, \nEl Salvador, and certain African countries. “Why do we need more Haitians?” he asked. During \nthat same discussion, he suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from \ncountries like Norway—which is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  \n10.  The Proclamation is but the latest effort of the Trump Administration to unilaterally \nrewrite Congressionally enacted laws governing who may come to this country as an immigrant. \nIt is also the one of the most drastic. Based on the latest data, up to an estimated 375,000 \nimmigrants are at risk each year of being banned due to a lack of “approved” health insurance \ncoverage, or close to two-thirds of all qualified immigrant visa applicants, many of whom are \npeople  of  color.  This  is  repugnant  not  only  to  our  values,  but  also  our  nation’s  laws  and \nConstitution.  \n11.  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  Proclamation  and  Defendants’  implementation  of  its \nrequirements  under  this  Court’s  inherent  authority  to  review  executive  actions  that  exceed \nstatutory grants of authority, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(D), and the \nequal  protection  guarantee  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment.  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the Court issue appropriate declaratory relief and preliminarily and \npermanently enjoin the Proclamation as a whole. \n   \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 9 of 100\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 over \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. The Court has additional \nremedial authority under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02. \n13.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and Local Rule 3.2. Defendants are officers \nor employees of the United States acting in their official capacities, and agencies of the United \nStates. Plaintiff John Doe #1 resides in the Portland Division of this District and Plaintiff Latino \nNetwork is a non-profit organization based in Portland. Moreover, on information and belief, the \nproposed class includes numerous members residing in this District who will be affected by the \nactions of Defendants. No real property is involved in this action. \nPARTIES \nPLAINTIFFS \n14.  Plaintiff John Doe #1 is a United States citizen of Mexican origin who resides in \nBeaverton, Oregon, with his wife, a Mexican citizen, and his fourteen-year-old United States \ncitizen son. John Doe #1, who is not able to work due to a disability, sponsored an immigrant visa \nfor his wife so that she can have legal status to live and work in the United States. Her immigrant \nvisa  consular  interview  is  scheduled  for  November  6,  2019.  Under  the  Proclamation  and \nDefendants’ implementation of its requirements, John Doe #1 and his wife cannot afford or qualify \nfor an “approved” health insurance option for her and fears that they lack sufficient financial \nresources to pay foreseeable medical costs out of pocket.  \n15.  Plaintiff Juan Ramon Morales is a United States citizen originally from Puerto Rico \nwho now resides in Liberty, New York with his wife, Vianca Morales, a Mexican citizen; their \ndaughter; and Ramon’s step-daughter. Mr. Morales has sponsored his wife for an immigrant visa \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 10 of 100\nand she is waiting to schedule her consular interview, but he is not able to add his wife to his \nemployer-sponsored health insurance or obtain another “approved” health insurance plan under \nthe Proclamation due to cost. \n16.  Jane Doe #2 is a United States citizen of Nicaraguan origin and a single mother of \ntwo children who resides in Rancho Cucamonga, California. She has an approved I-130 petition \nfor her parents, who are living in Nicaragua and waiting to schedule their consular interview. She \nhas been unable to find available and affordable health insurance for her parents that complies with \nthe Proclamation, and it is unlikely that they will be able to show the ability to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of \nits provisions. \n17.  Plaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a U.S. citizen who currently resides in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia. She is unable to work due to a disability and has insurance through Medi-Cal, \nCalifornia’s Medicaid program. Jane Doe #3 has an approved I-130 petition for her husband, a \nGerman  citizen  who  currently  resides  in  Berlin,  Germany  and  is  an  architect  who  teaches \narchitectural theory and design. Although he is gathering documents for consular processing, Jane \nDoe #3 does not believe that her husband will be able to prove at a consular interview that he \nwould be covered by approved health insurance within 30 days of his entry into the United States \nbecause they do not believe that they have the financial resources to afford “approved” health \ninsurance as defined in the Proclamation or to pay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket \nas required by the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of it.  \n18.  Plaintiff Iris Angelina Castro is a United States citizen who lives in Springfield, \nMassachusetts with her son, who is a U.S. citizen. She recently became unemployed and currently \nhas state health insurance. She has an approved I-130 visa petition for her husband, Hermogenes \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 11 of 100\nCastro Molina, a Dominican citizen, so that they can reunite in the United States. He is currently \nin the process of filing all necessary documents so that they can schedule a consular interview, but \nthey do not believe that he will be able to prove that he can obtain available and affordable \n“approved” health insurance within 30 days of entering the U.S. or pay for foreseeable medical \ncosts as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of its provisions. \n19.  Plaintiff Blake Doe is a U.S. citizen living in Corvallis, Oregon, with his wife. He \nhas approved I-130 immigrant petitions for his parents, both Mexican citizens, with whom he had \nlived his entire life in Oregon until going to college at Oregon State University to study civil \nengineering. Blake Doe’s parents are currently waiting to have their consular interview scheduled \nin Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Blake Doe and his parents do not believe that they would be able to \nprove that his parents would be able to obtain available and affordable “approved” health insurance \nwithin 30 days of their entry into the U.S. or to pay foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket as \nrequired under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of its provisions.  \n20.  Plaintiff Brenda Villarruel is a U.S. citizen who currently resides in Chicago, \nIllinois, with her United States citizen son and United States citizen parents.  Ms. Villarruel works \npart time as a licensed medical assistant.  She does not have medical insurance and receives health \ncare, when necessary, through a clinic that charges based on income.  Ms. Villarruel has sponsored \nan immigrant visa for her husband, a Mexican citizen who currently resides in Mexico City, \nMexico, and is awaiting consular processing.  Ms. Villarruel and her husband do not have the \nresources to obtain available and affordable “approved” health insurance coverage for him or to \npay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket as required under the Proclamation and \nDefendants’ implementation of its provisions. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 12 of 100\n21.  Plaintiff Latino Network is a non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon. \nLatino Network’s organization mission is to educate and empower Multnomah County Latinos to \nachieve physical and mental health, safe housing, sustainable financial stability, and social \nsupport. Latino Network does so by offering a variety of programs and services, including early \nchildhood services, community-based programs, school-based programs, arts and culture \nprograms for youth, health and wellness programs, and civic leadership programs. The \nimpending effective date of the Proclamation has forced Latino Network to divert resources from \nits core activities to address the Proclamation’s fallout within the community the organization \nserves.   \nDEFENDANTS \n22.

Late on Friday night, October 4, 2019, President Trump signed the “Presidential \nProclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United \nStates Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”).  A copy of the Proclamation can be viewed at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-suspension-entry-\nimmigrants-will-financially-burden-united-states-healthcare-system/ and is attached as Exhibit 1. \n30.  Beginning  at  12:01  a.m.  eastern  daylight  time  on  November  3,  2019,  the \nProclamation will ban would-be immigrants from receiving visas and entering the United States \nunless they can demonstrate, “to the satisfaction of a consular officer,” that they will be able to \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 14 of 100\nobtain “approved” health insurance coverage within 30 days after arriving in the United States, or \nare wealthy enough to “pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”  \n31.  The Proclamation, by its own terms, was not issued for national security reasons. \nOstensibly, the Proclamation is meant to “address[] the challenges facing our healthcare system, \nincluding protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care” \ngiven to “people who lack health insurance or the ability to pay for their healthcare.” The \nProclamation notes that hospitals and other health care providers “often administer care to the \nuninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them.” Such uncompensated costs \n“are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher \nfees for medical services.” The Proclamation further states that uninsured individuals “strain \nFederal and State government budgets through their reliance on publicly funded programs, which \nultimately are financed by taxpayers,” and rely on emergency care for non-emergency conditions, \n“causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services.”  \n32.  Given  these  challenges,  the  Proclamation  asserts  that  “the  United  States \nGovernment  is  making  the  problem  worse  by  admitting  thousands  of  aliens  who  have  not \ndemonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs,” and claims that “data show that lawful \nimmigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.” \nAccordingly, the Proclamation declares that “[c]ontinuing to allow entry into the United States of \ncertain immigrants who lack health insurance or the demonstrated ability to pay for their healthcare \nwould be detrimental to these interests.” If a prospective immigrant will not “be covered by \napproved health insurance” “within 30 days of the alien’s entry into the United States,” or if the \nimmigrant does not have “the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs,” \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 15 of 100\nthe immigrant is deemed to be someone who will “financially burden the United States healthcare \nsystem” and whose entry into the United States is therefore “suspended.”  \n33.  Simply put, under the Proclamation, a lack of “approved” insurance, or the inability \nto prove that an intending immigrant can pay for “reasonably foreseeable” medical care, absolutely \nbars the entry of that individual to the United States who meets all qualifications mandated by \nCongress in the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n34.  The Proclamation sets out a narrow range of health insurance plans that qualify as \n“approved health insurance.” No “subsidized” health plan offered in the individual market within \na State under the ACA qualifies. Proclamation § 1(b)(ii). Nor does Medicaid qualify as “approved \nhealth insurance” for any individual over 18, Proclamation § 1(c), even though some states have \nchosen to make Medicaid available to certain adults over 18, including certain new and recently \narrived immigrants. “Approved health insurance” under the Proclamation includes only: \n•  employer-sponsored plans (Proclamation § 1(b)(i));  \n•  catastrophic plans (Proclamation § 1(b)(iv));  \n•  certain health plans available to the U.S. military (Proclamation § 1(b)(vi));  \n•  the health plans of family members (Proclamation § 1(b)(v));  \n•  Medicare (Proclamation § 1(b)(viii));  \n•  short-term, limited duration health policies effective for at least 364 days (Proclamation § \n1(b)(iii)); and \n•  visitor health insurance plans that provide “adequate coverage for medical care,” also for \nat least 364 days (Proclamation § 1(b)(vii)).  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 16 of 100\nAs explained below, the Proclamation’s “approved” health insurance plans are not practically or \nlegally available to most or all prospective immigrants residing outside the country or within their \nfirst 30 days of arrival.  \n35.  A prospective immigrant may also obtain a “health plan that provides adequate \ncoverage for medical care as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his \ndesignee,” but the Proclamation provides no guidance as to how “adequate coverage” is defined. \n(Proclamation § 1(b)(ix)). \n36.  Subject to limited exceptions, the Proclamation applies to nearly all individuals \nseeking to enter the United States with an immigrant visa. Indeed, based on insurance coverage \nalone, most adults who were granted green cards over the last three years would have been banned \nhad the Proclamation been in effect.1 The only exceptions from the Proclamation’s suspension of \nentry cover very small populations, including: \n•  certain  Special  Immigrant  Visa  applicants  specifically  from  Iraq  and  Afghanistan \n(Proclamation § 2(b)(ii));  \n•  green card holders returning to the U.S. on a “Returning Resident” visa after remaining \nabroad for more than one year (Proclamation § 2(b)(v));  \n•  biological and adopted children under 21, but only if those children are not accompanying \na parent who is also immigrating to the United States and is subject to the Proclamation \n(Proclamation § 2(b)(iii), (vi)); and  \n•  parents of U.S. citizen children over the age of 21 arriving with an IR-5 visa, but only if \nthe parent or the U.S. citizen-child sponsor “demonstrates to the satisfaction of the consular \n \n1 Nicole Narea, Trump just quietly cut legal immigration by up to 65%, VOX, \nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/10/9/20903541/trump-proclamation-legal-immigration-health-insurance (last \nvisited Oct. 27, 2019).  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 17 of 100\nofficer that the [parent’s] healthcare will not impose a substantial burden on the United \nStates healthcare system” (Proclamation § 2(b)(iv)).  \nWith respect to this last exception, the Proclamation provides no guidance as to how the parent or \nU.S. citizen-child sponsor must demonstrate, nor how a consular officer should evaluate, whether \nthe parent’s health care will impose a “substantial burden on the United States healthcare system.”  \n37.  Notably, certain types of plans that qualify as “approved” coverage under the \nProclamation provide only very limited benefits and/or allow exclusions based on preexisting \nconditions, such that they may be either unavailable to many individuals or may result in \n“underinsurance”—which has itself been shown to impose a “substantial burden on the United \nStates healthcare system.” Yet, the Proclamation would encourage underinsurance among newly \narrived immigrants. \n38.  The Proclamation also contains exceptions for noncitizens “whose entry would \nfurther important United States law enforcement objectives,” or “whose entry would be in the \nnational interest,” as “determined by the Secretary of State or his designee.” Proclamation § \n2(b)(vii), (viii). Again, however, the Proclamation provides no procedure for would-be immigrants \neither to learn or to demonstrate how they would qualify for such exceptions.  \nB.   Agency Implementation of the Proclamation \n39.  In implementing the Proclamation, the Department of State created a page on its \nwebsite that informs and instructs visa applicants and consular officers of their new obligations \nunder the Proclamation (“Posting”), available at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-\nvisas/immigrate/Presidential-Proclamation-on-Health-Care.html (Exhibit 2). \n40.  The Posting states definitively that “if you are applying for an immigrant visa” on \nor after November 3, 2019 “you must demonstrate at the time of the interview” that you meet the \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 18 of 100\nProclamation’s requirements. It also specifies that an “inability” to meet the Proclamation’s \nrequirements at the time of the interview “will result in the denial of the visa application.” The \nPosting then lists the same exceptions that appear in the Proclamation and the same list of approved \nhealth insurances. Under the heading “Requirement at visa interview,” the Posting specifies that \n“[d]uring the visa interview,” applicants will need to demonstrate that they satisfy the requirements \nof the Proclamation. It informs that applicants that consular officers “will review the medical and \nfinancial documentation that is already part of the applicant’s case file and may request additional \ninformation or documentation as needed.” The Posting also includes a link to the Proclamation \nitself.   \n41.  By its terms, the Posting unequivocally makes clear not only that visa applicants \nhave the obligation to satisfy the Proclamation’s requirements or be denied a visa, but also that \nconsular  officers  will  enforce  the  Proclamation,  which  has  significant  legal  and  practical \nconsequences for visa applicants and their families. It did so without satisfying any of the \nrequirements for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) or demonstrating \ngood cause for diverging from standard agency practice. \n42.  Eleventh-hour action by the State Department purports to offer the opportunity for \nnotice and comment for “information collection” related to the Proclamation, but this only \nhighlights the agency’s failure to act according to the requirements of the APA. Just yesterday, on \nOctober 29, 2019, the Department of State issued a “Notice of Information Collection” for \n“Emergency Review”2 (the “Emergency Notice”), which was published in the Federal Register \n \n2 60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection: Public Charge Questionnaire, FED. \nREGISTER, https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/24/2019-23219/60-day-notice-\nof-proposed-information-collection-public-charge-questionnaire (last visited on Oct. 27, 2019). \nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23639.pdf  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 19 of 100\ntoday (October 30, 2019) and purports to announce a “methodology” established by the Secretary \nof State, as authorized by Section 3 of the Proclamation, “to establish standards and procedures \nfor governing such determinations.” 84 Fed. Reg. 58199 (Oct. 30, 2019); see also Advance Print \nEmergency  Notice  (issued  Oct.  29,  2019),  available  at  https://s3.amazonnews.com/public-\ninspection.federalregister.gov/2019-23639. The Emergency Notice states that “to implement [the \nProclamation] when it goes into effect on November 3, 2019,” consular officers “will verbally ask \nimmigrant visa applicants covered by [the Proclamation] whether they will be covered by health \ninsurance in the United States within 30 days of entry to the United States and, if so, for details \nrelating to such insurance.” If the applicant says yes, “consular officers will ask for applicants to \nidentify the specific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and such other information \nrelated to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary.” The Emergency Notice \nfurther adds that visa applicants will not be suspended “if they do not have coverage, but possess \nfinancial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical expenses.” It defines “reasonably \nforeseeable medical expenses” as “those expenses related to existing medical conditions, relating \nto health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.”  \n43.  The Emergency Notice provides a comment period of less than 48 hours, an \nunusually short period of time, stating that “[a]ll public comments must be received by October \n31, 2019.” It notes that the Proclamation “was signed on October 4, 2019, and emergency review \nof this information collection is necessary for the Department to prepare consular officers to \nimplement [the Proclamation] when it goes into effect on November 3, 2019.”3 The Emergency \n \n3 The late posting of the Emergency Notice and extremely short notice-and-comment period \nstand in stark contrast to a “60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection” in the Federal \nRegister six days prior on October 24, 2019 (the “Notice”). That Notice proposed and solicited \npublic comments on a new written form, DS-5540, that would ostensibly collect information \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 20 of 100\nNotice was not, however, implemented in direct response to any particular event impacting foreign \nrelations. \n44.   Taken together, the Emergency Notice and the Posting make clear that, effective \nNovember 3, consular officers are empowered to determine whether prospective immigrants meet \nthe Proclamation’s requirements, resulting in a direct impact on the rights of immigrants and their \nfamilies. These are definitive actions that reflect the consummation of the agency’s decision-\nmaking process and that affect the substantive rights and obligations of regulated individuals.  \n45.  The Posting and the last-minute Emergency Notice confirm press reports that \ngovernment  officials  were  scrambling  earlier  this  month  to  implement  and  enforce  the \nProclamation by its effective date. On information and best belief, these efforts necessarily include \nDOS officials as well as DHHS and DHS officials. For example, as indicated above, the DHHS \nSecretary “or his designee” has authority under the Proclamation to determine whether a “health \nplan . . . provides adequate coverage for medical care” (though provides no guidance as to how \n“adequate coverage” is defined for such purpose). Proclamation § 1(b)(ix). According to one media \nreport published a week after the Proclamation was signed, government health officials “are \nwrestling with highly technical questions” as they attempt to implement the Proclamation, despite \n \nintended to assist consular officers “in assessing whether an applicant is likely to become a \npublic charge,” but stated that a consular officer could ask a visa applicant to fill out certain \nquestions on the same form to assess whether the applicant meets the Proclamation’s \nrequirements.

It  is  no  surprise  that  officials  were  at  least  initially  confused  about  how  to \nimplement the Proclamation, given that the Proclamation is inconsistent with existing immigration \nand healthcare laws, contrary to core constitutional principles, and, moreover, is riddled with \nundefined terms and imprecise standards and appears to ignore many of the practical realities of \nboth this country’s immigration and health care systems. \nC.  The Proclamation is Vague, Internally Contradictory, and Inconsistent with \nExisting Law in Ways State Department Action has Not Addressed \n1.  The Proclamation Uses Unclear, Undefined Terms and Standards  \n47.  The Proclamation’s list of “approved health insurance” plans includes several \noptions that are unclear and undefined. “Catastrophic health insurance,” for example, is one \n“approved” option, but the term can be used generically, to refer to certain high-deductible plans, \nor  specifically,  as  defined  by  the  ACA  with  certain  coverage  parameters  and  eligibility \nrequirements. The Proclamation does not specify what it means when it allows “catastrophic health \ninsurance” as “approved health insurance.” \n \n4 Dan Diamond, Health officials: Trump immigration order could be illegal, POLITICO, \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/11/trump-immigrants-health-insurance-illegal-044716 (last visited on \nOct. 27, 2019). \n5 Id. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 22 of 100\n48.  Likewise, a variety of forms of financial assistance under the ACA are broadly \navailable to individuals seeking health insurance on the ACA Exchanges—indeed, an Exchange \nenrollee may qualify for some level of assistance if she has a household income from 100 to 400 \npercent  of  the  federal  poverty  level  (“FPL”),6  and  lawfully  present  immigrants  qualify  for \nassistance even if their household income is below 100% FPL if they are not otherwise eligible for \nMedicaid. Such financial assistance can take the form of “premium tax credits” offered to eligible \nenrollees, as well as certain cost-sharing reductions tied to specific “silver” plans, for which \neligibility is based on income. The ACA, however, does not define either of these forms of \nfinancial assistance as a “subsidy.” The Proclamation is silent as to which forms of assistance \nwould render a plan “subsidized,” and therefore not “approved,” health insurance. \n49.  In addition, the Proclamation states that “an alien will financially burden the United \nStates healthcare system . . . unless the alien possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs”—but provides no guidance on what might constitute a “reasonably \nforeseeable medical cost.” Nor does the Proclamation indicate how a consular officer with no \nmedical training should evaluate what medical costs may be “reasonably foreseeable” for a specific \nprospective immigrant, or how the consular offer should assess whether that individual has \nsufficient “financial resources” to cover such costs. The State Department’s Emergency Notice, \npublished today in the Federal Register, defines “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses” as \n“those expenses related to existing medical conditions, relating to health issues existing at the time \nof visa adjudication” but, again, does not clarify how consular officers are to make that assessment. \n \n6 In 2019, the income level necessary for a family of four to qualify for financial assistance \nranged from $25,100 at 100% FPL to $100,400 at 400% FPL. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 23 of 100\n50.  Likewise, the Proclamation states that a visitor health insurance plan may qualify \nas an “approved” health plan if it provides “adequate coverage for medical care”—but provides no \nstandards or definitions that would enable either a would-be immigrant or a non-medically trained \nconsular officer to assess what coverage qualifies as “adequate.” Similarly, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services may approve “any other health plan that provides adequate coverage for \nmedical care,” but the Proclamation is devoid of guidance as to how the Secretary should determine \nthat a plan’s coverage is “adequate,” to say nothing of guidance that would enable prospective \nimmigrants to evaluate whether a potential plan not already enumerated in the Proclamation \nprovides sufficiently “adequate” coverage to qualify as “approved.” \n51.  The Proclamation does provide exceptions to the entry suspension for immigrants \n“whose entry would be in the national interest,” as determined by the Secretary of State, or “whose \nentry would further important United States law enforcement objectives,” as determined by the \nSecretary of State based on a recommendation of the Attorney General. But the Proclamation does \nnot explain what such terms as “national interest” or “important United States law enforcement \nobjectives” mean. There is no indication, in either the text of the Proclamation or the Department \nof State website, of how a prospective immigrant may seek such a determination from the Secretary \nof State or demonstrate her qualifications for such a determination. \n52.  When  making  an  exception  for  immigrants  whose  entry  would  further  “law \nenforcement objectives,” moreover, the Proclamation makes no mention of a special visa, the U \nvisa, which exists specifically for victims of certain crimes who are helpful to law enforcement or \ngovernment officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Although the INA \nspecifically allows U visa holders to petition to bring certain family members to the United States \non immigrant visas, the Proclamation is silent as to whether such family members are excepted \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 24 of 100\nfrom the Proclamation, either under the “law enforcement” provision or otherwise. At best, such \nsilence on the topic creates uncertainty for U-derivative immigrant family members; at worst, it \nindicates  that  such  family  members  are  subject  to  the  Proclamation’s  requirements, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the INA expressly provides for the reunification of U visa families. \n2.  Very Few, if Any of the Proclamation’s “Approved Health Plans” Are Available to \nVisa Applicants  \n \n53.  Beyond  the  Proclamation’s  vague  and  ill-defined  terminology,  most  of  the \nProclamation’s “approved” health insurance plans are not practically or legally available to most \nor all prospective immigrants residing outside the country or within their first 30 days of arrival. \n54.  Medicare plans, for example, are an approved type of health insurance under the \nProclamation, Proclamation § 1(b)(viii), but such coverage is unavailable to immigrants unless \nthey are over 65 years old and have been living continuously in the United States for five years.  \n55.  TRICARE plans and other related coverage, “approved” under § 1(b)(iv) of the \nProclamation, are only available to members of the United States military, their spouses, and \nchildren up to 26 years of age.  \n56.  Employer-sponsored plans also constitute “approved plans” under the Proclamation \n§ 1(b)(i), but employers are permitted under federal law to impose a waiting period of up to 90 \ndays before new employees can be covered by employer-sponsored coverage.7 Seventy-one \npercent of employers impose a waiting period, with waiting periods on average lasting 1.9 months.8 \nBeyond that, over two-thirds of immigrants are the beneficiaries of family petitions or other non-\n \n7 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-7. \n8 2018 Employer Health Benefits Survey, KAISER FAMILY FUND, (Oct. 3, 2018), \nhttps://www.kff.org/report-section/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey-section-3-employee-\ncoverage-eligibility-and-participation/  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 25 of 100\nemployment-based visa applications, and therefore are unlikely to have an employer-sponsored \nplan before even arriving in the United States and acquiring valid work authorization.  \n57.  Although a “family member’s plan” is “approved” under the Proclamation, § \n1(b)(v), it is highly unlikely that most immigrants will be able to obtain coverage through a family \nmember unless they are a spouse or a child under 27. All other relations are not usually considered \na “dependent” eligible to be included in a family health insurance plan.9  \n58.  The  Proclamation  states  that  a  “catastrophic  health  plan”  may  constitute  an \napproved plan, Proclamation § 1(b)(iv), but under the ACA, “catastrophic” plans are available only \nto individuals living in the United States, and eligible enrollees must be either under 30 years of \nage or have qualified for a hardship or affordability exemption. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(e).10 \n59.  The list of “approved” health insurance includes “an unsubsidized health plan \noffered  in  the  individual  market  within  a  State,”  Proclamation  §  1(b)(ii),  but  an  intending \nimmigrant would not be able to obtain such coverage from abroad. Like an ACA-compliant \ncatastrophic plan, any other “unsubsidized” health plan offered in an ACA marketplace is only \navailable to individuals living in the United States, in the marketplace’s service area. 45 C.F.R. § \n155.305(a)(3)(i).  \n60.  Further logistics could impede the immigrant’s ability to acquire not only an \n“unsubsidized health plan” but also a “catastrophic health plan” (whether through the ACA \n \n9 An employer health plan is only a benefit excludable from income tax if it limits eligibility to \nspouses, children who have not yet attained age 27, and tax dependents. 26 U.S.C. § 105(b), 26 \nC.F.R. § 1.106-1(a). Employers are permitted to limit eligibility further, and indeed, coverage of \nfamily members other than children and spouses or domestic partners is very rare.

Under rules governing \nan insurance policy’s effective date, a newly purchased policy becomes effective on the first day \nof the next month after purchase—but only if the policy was purchased before the fifteenth day of \nthe current month.11 Otherwise, the effective date rolls to the first day of the subsequent month. In \nother words, if an immigrant is so fortunate as to enter the United States under the Proclamation, \nbut unluckily arrives on the 20th of the month, her insurance coverage will not take effect until \nwell after 30 days of arriving in the country. The Proclamation is silent on whether such a \npossibility would prevent a prospective immigrant from satisfying the “approved health insurance” \nrequirement to gain entry.  \n61.  When accounting for the fact that Medicare, TRICARE and other military plans, \nemployer-sponsored plans, family members’ plans, and unsubsidized and catastrophic plans \navailable under the ACA are all practically or legally impossible for most prospective immigrants \nto acquire, the two remaining options for “approved health insurance” under the Proclamation are \nvisitor insurance plans or short-term limited duration insurance (“STLDI”) plans, which in either \ncase must last for a minimum of 364 days. But STLDI plans lasting the minimum required 364 \ndays are not available in almost half the states,12 and many disqualify an individual from coverage \nif that person is not a United States citizen or resident.13 Neither visitor plans nor STLDI plans, \nmoreover, are required to cover individuals with preexisting conditions or pregnant women, and \n \n11 See 45 C.F.R. § 155.420(b)(1); 45 C.F.R. § 147.104(b)(2).  \n12 Is Short-term Health Insurance Right for You?, HEALTHINSURANCE.ORG, \nhttps://www.healthinsurance.org/short-term-health-insurance/  \n13 Short Term Health Insurance Eligibility Information for Short Term Health Insurance, or \nSTM, ELIGIBILITY.COM (Updated Jan. 28, 2019), https://eligibility.com/short-term-health-\ninsurance  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 27 of 100\nmany do not.14 Such plans can also adjust premiums based on an individual’s health history, \ngender, or (outside specified parameters) age and make them prohibitively, and exploitatively, \nexpensive.15 Indeed, many states are concerned that unscrupulous insurance brokers and STLDI \ninsurers provide misleading information about the costs, deductibles, and coverage associated with \nthese plans.16 \n62.  Even assuming prospective immigrants can acquire visitor insurance plans or \nSTLDI plans, it remains unclear that such insurance plans actually further the Proclamation’s goal \nof “addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the \nAmerican taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.” Visitor and STLDI plans are not \nrequired under the ACA to provide “essential health benefits,” such as hospitalization, prescription \ndrugs, emergency services, and maternity and newborn care. Indeed, the fine print of such policies \ncan exclude coverage for prescription drugs, a tonsillectomy, hernia surgery, prenatal care, \ntreatment of pre-existing conditions an individual does not know about, or even “treatment of \ninjury resulting from participation in organized sports,” like care for a concussion a child receives \nduring  soccer.17  As  a  result,  the  coverage  provided  by  such  plans  can  leave  an  individual \n \n14 Id. \n15 Id.; see also Rachel Schwab, Coming Up Short: The Problem with Counting Short-Term, \nLimited Duration Insurance as Coverage, CHIRBLOG.ORG (June 7, 2019), Id.; see also \nhttp://chirblog.org/coming-short-problem-counting-short-term-limited-duration-insurance-\ncoverage/  \n16 S.

She was denied coverage under her STLDI plan on the \nground that her menstrual cycle constituted a pre-existing condition.20  \n64.

The Proclamation Is Internally Inconsistent with Its Stated Goals  \n66.  The Proclamation provides no explanation for how incentivizing—if not effectively \nrequiring—immigrants to buy non-comprehensive or STLDI plans, many of which will likely \nleave an immigrant underinsured after she arrives, is likely to shield taxpayers or hospitals from \nsuch uncovered emergency costs, which the Proclamation decries as “driv[ing] hospitals into \ninsolvency” and “saddl[ing] our healthcare system, and subsequently American taxpayers, with \nhigher costs.”  \n67.  Indeed, the Proclamation appears to be even more self-defeating considering its \nexclusion of “subsidized” ACA health insurance from the list of “approved health insurance” plans \nthat would enable immigrants to enter the United States. Unlike visitor insurance or short-term \nlimited duration insurance plans, any ACA-marketplace health insurance plan that also offers \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 31 of 100\nfinancial assistance is a comprehensive plan that covers a wide range of essential health benefits, \nincluding prescription drugs, hospitalization, prenatal and maternity care, and mental health care. \nFinancial assistance to purchase such qualified health plans is available to individuals with \nhousehold incomes of 100 to 400 percent FPL. Indeed, when passing the ACA, Congress extended \nthe same benefits to immigrants on even more permissive terms, explicitly making assistance \navailable to legally present immigrants even with incomes under 100 percent FPL, including newly \narrived immigrants in their first five years in the country, who are otherwise generally excluded \nfrom most other federal means-tested benefits. But, although Congress expressly made such \nbenefits available to newly arrived immigrants—and in fact intended for such immigrants to arrive, \nthrough this country’s legislatively enacted immigration system—the Proclamation operates to ban \nthose immigrants who would benefit from assistance provided under the ACA.  \n68.  Although  an  immigrant  who  receives  financial  assistance  under  the  ACA  to \npurchase  comprehensive  health  insurance  would  be  better  insured  than  an  immigrant  who \npurchases non-comprehensive visitor or STLDI insurance, the Proclamation bars the former and \nallows the latter, in the name of protecting this nation’s health care system from uncompensated \ncosts incurred by uninsured individuals.  \n69.  Viewed as a whole, the Proclamation is far less than the sum of its parts. Its \nstandards  and  terse  language  are  opaque  when  they  are  not  vague  or  ill-defined.  The \nProclamation’s array of various “approved health insurance” options are, for a significant majority \nof intending immigrants, merely a set of legal or practical impossibilities. When taken to their \nlogical consequence, the incentives it creates for prospective immigrants lead to results that almost \ncertainly will not further the Proclamation’s goal of reducing the burden of uncompensated care \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 32 of 100\nfor uninsured individuals. At best, these disparate parts form an internally inconsistent whole; at \nworst, they smack of bad faith. \n70.  Given the draconian sweep of the Proclamation—indeed, by some estimates, it has \nthe potential to reduce legal immigration by nearly two thirds and affect most, if not nearly all, \nfamily-based and diversity immigrants—the structure, text, and import of the Proclamation all \nsuggest that its ostensible purpose of addressing the burden that uninsured individuals place on \nthis country’s health care system is merely a pretext to rework this country’s immigration system \nin the manner that the President sees fit, in contravention of the laws passed by Congress.   \n71.  The Proclamation, moreover, does not operate in a vacuum. It will be enforced in a \nlegal landscape already shaped by numerous Congressional enactments, including the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, the Public Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, the Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram  Reauthorization  Act,  and  the  Affordable  Care  Act;  and  the  regulations  of  the \nAdministration’s recently promulgated “public charge rule,” which establishes new criteria for \ndetermining whether a would-be immigrant may be deemed inadmissible because she is likely to \nbecome a “public charge”.  As set out in more detail below, the Proclamation is in tension, if not \ndirect conflict, with each of these statutory and regulatory schemes, and therefore also with \nCongress’s legislative intent.  \n72.  The Proclamation, moreover, is but the latest link in a long chain of statements and \nactions by this President and his Administration expressing antipathy toward all noncitizens, but \nalso specifically toward immigrants seeking to come to the United States—particularly immigrants \nof color, from Central and Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Since the early days of his \nAdministration, the President has consistently called for eliminating the two main ways that \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 33 of 100\nimmigrants from predominantly nonwhite countries receive visas—the family preference system \nand the diversity visa lottery. After a legislative attempt—the RAISE Act—that failed in 2017, \nand an administrative attempt—the public charge rule—that received overwhelmingly negative \npublic comment, and which has since been enjoined, the Proclamation now appears to be an \nattempt by presidential fiat. The laws and the Constitution of this country do not countenance such \nexecutive overreach. \nTHE PROCLAMATION IMPERMISSIBLY RESHAPES THE NATION’S \nCONGRESSIONALLY-ENACTED HEALTH BENEFIT SYSTEM FOR IMMIGRANTS \nBY PRESIDENTIAL FIAT \nA.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) \n73.  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) was originally enacted in 1952 and \nhas since been amended significantly multiple times. Although it now represents “a long series of \nlegislative accretions,”23 it nevertheless creates a system by which this country may grant up to \n675,000 permanent immigrant visas each year, as well as an unlimited number of permanent \nimmigrant visas for the admission of U.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children under the age of \n21. In doing so, the INA, 8 U. S. C. § 1101 et seq., expresses and reflects Congress’s intent that \nforeign  nationals  who  meet  certain  qualifications  may  immigrate  to  the  United  States,  in \nfurtherance of the goals of reunifying families, admitting immigrants with skills that are useful to \nthe United States economy, and promoting diversity.24 \n74.  A series of related and interacting statutes, including the Public Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), the Children’s Health Insurance Program \n \n23 Adam B. Cox & Christina M. Rodriguez, The President and Immigration Law Redux, 125 \nYALE L.J. 104, 158-59 (2015). \n24 See Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U.S. 647, 664 (1978). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 34 of 100\nReauthorization Act (“CHIPRA”), and the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), likewise express and \nreflect Congress’s intent to extend certain health care-related benefits to legal immigrants. Through \nPRWORA, Congress made significant changes to health care eligibility for noncitizens and \nsimultaneously devolved substantial power to the states to allow the states to replace benefits to \nlegal immigrants through Medicaid, and later through the Children’s Health Insurance Programs \n(“CHIP”),  and  to  receive  federal  matching  funds  when  providing  such  coverage.  Through \nCHIPRA, Congress affirmatively provided federal dollars to fund care for newly arrived legal \nimmigrant children and legal immigrant pregnant women during their first five years in this \ncountry. And through the ACA, Congress made financial assistance in the form of premium tax \ncredits available to both United States citizens and legal immigrants to purchase comprehensive \nhealth coverage.  \n75.  The interaction of these statutes reflects Congress’ intent to keep important health \ncare benefits available to both newly arrived immigrants and qualified foreign nationals, especially \nthe spouses, children, and parents of United States citizens, to ensure that such individuals are \nallowed to immigrate to the United States in the first instance to reunite with family, contribute \ntheir skills to the United States economy, be afforded humanitarian protections, and/or promote \ndiversity. \n76.  In rendering inadmissible all immigrants who are unable either to purchase certain \nenumerated kinds of health insurance or pass an opaque wealth test through categorizing such \nindividuals as “detrimental to the United States”—particularly immigrants who would otherwise \nbe eligible to enter the United States and receive health insurance benefits like Medicaid, CHIP, \nor  financial  assistance  under  the  ACA—the  Proclamation  expressly  contravenes  Congress’s \nlegislative intent.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 35 of 100\n77.  The  bedrock  pillars  of  U.S.  immigration  law  allow  immigration  for  family \nreunification, for business purposes, for humanitarian considerations, and to promote diversity.  To \nthat end, Congress has set forth a comprehensive system to allow limited “worldwide immigration” \nbased on an allocation of “family-based visas,” “employment-based visas” and “diversity-based” \nvisas. 8 U.S.C. § 1151(a). Section 1151 of the INA sets an annual minimum family-sponsored \npreference  limit  of  226,000;  the  worldwide  level  for  annual  employment-based  preference \nimmigrants is at least 140,000. A maximum of fifty-five thousand visas each year are available \nthrough a diversity visa lottery, open to nationals of countries with historically low rates of \nimmigration to the United States. \n78.  A family member or employer seeking to “sponsor” a noncitizen for an immigrant \nvisa must first file either a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, or Form I-140, Petition for \nAlien Workers, with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service on behalf of the \n“beneficiary.” This form establishes the necessary family or employer-employee relationship that \nexists to allow for an immigrant visa. Once the beneficiary of an approved immigrant petition has \nan immigrant visa number that is immediately available, there are two ways to apply for lawful \npermanent resident status (“Green Card”). If the beneficiary is outside of the United States, he or \nshe must apply at a U.S. Department of State consulate abroad for an immigrant visa in order to \ncome to the United States and be admitted as a permanent resident. This pathway is referred to as \nconsular processing. If the beneficiary is already in the United States, she may attempt to apply for \npermanent resident status without having to return to her home country to complete processing.  \nThis process is called adjustment of status.25 See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). \n \n25 If an individual present in the United States does not qualify for adjustment of status, she must \ntravel abroad for a consular interview to obtain her immigrant visa.  Some applicants who have \naccrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence while in the United States, but have no other \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 36 of 100\n79.  Section 1152 of the INA prescribes that the per-country limit for preference \nimmigrants is set at 7% of the total annual family-sponsored and employment-based preference \nlimits, i.e., 25,620.  The dependent area limit is set at 2%, or 7,320.  This means that no single \nnation can receive more than 7 percent of the total green cards issued in a year (unless they would \notherwise go unused).   \n80.  Among  family-based  immigrants,  Congress  has  prioritized  the  admission  of \n“immediate relatives,” which is defined as “the children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the \nUnited States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21 years of age.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1151(b). These familial relations have been carved out of certain exceptions to the various \nnumerical limitations on immigrant visas, and thus visas are always and immediately available for \nthese qualifying family members \n81.  The allocation of immigrant visas subject to the numerical limitations is governed \nby  8  U.S.C.  §  1153.  Subsection  (a)  sets  forth  preference  allocations  for  family-sponsored \nimmigrants; subsection (b) sets forth the preference allocations for employment-based visas.  See, \ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)(1) (“Qualified Immigrants who are the unmarried sons and daughters of \ncitizens of the United States shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed 23,400.”). \n82.  Section 1153(e) provides that family-sponsored and employment-based preference \nvisas “shall” be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition on behalf of each has \nbeen filed, that is, according to the “priority date” of the visa petition. \n \nbars to admissibility, may obtain an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility to overcome the unlawful \npresence bars under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B) before they can return. The I-601A waiver process \nallows those individuals who are statutorily eligible for an immigrant visa (immediate relatives, \nfamily-sponsored or employment-based immigrants as well as Diversity Visa selectees) who \nonly need a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence to apply for that waiver in the United \nStates and remain with their family members before they depart for their immigrant visa \ninterview abroad. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e). \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 37 of 100\n83.  A family member or employee may not apply for lawful permanent residence \nabroad until a visa is immediately available. The Department of State issues a monthly Visa \nBulletin organized according to country of origin and visa preference category.26   \n84.  If there are sufficient visas available for applicants from a specific country and of \na specific preference category, then the Visa Bulletin lists that combination as “current,” and all \napplicants matching that combination may file an application regardless of their priority date, or \nthe date the visa was received by the agency.  If there are insufficient visas available for all known \napplicants of a specific combination, however, the Visa Bulletin lists a cut-off date, and only those \napplicants who have priority dates earlier than the cut-off date may file an application.  Sometimes, \na cut-off date may retrogress, meaning that fewer visas are available than previously projected. \nWhen that happens to an applicant whose application is already filed, the applicant is forced to \nwait  until  the  cut-off  date  again  progresses  past  his  priority  date  for  his  application  to  be \nadjudicated.   \n85.  Before the issuance of an immigrant visa, the noncitizen must establish that she is \neligible for admission to the country. Section 1101(a)(13)(A) of Title 8 defines “admission” to \nmean “the lawful entry of a noncitizen into the United States after inspection and authorization by \nan immigration officer.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A).   \n86.  Section 1182 of Title 8, INA § 212, is titled “Inadmissible Aliens” and sets forth \nten classes of noncitizens “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United \nStates.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a) (prescribing the inadmissibility of, inter alia, noncitizens who have a \n \n26 See, e.g., Visa Bulletin for November 2019, TRAVEL.STATE.GOV, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2020/visa-bulletin-for-\nnovember-2019.html (last visited Oct. 27, 2019). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 38 of 100\ncommunicable disease of public health significance, those convicted of two or more criminal \noffenses, those who engaged in terrorist activities).  \n87.  Under  the  system  set  out  in  the  INA,  family-based  petitions  account  for \napproximately 65% of the immigrant visas granted every year. The diversity lottery visa system \naccounts for approximately 4.5%. \n88.  In  addition  to  the  comprehensive  system  for  the  allocation  of  family-based, \nemployment-based, and diversity visas, Congress has authorized multiple special categories for \nimmigrants from abroad based on specific humanitarian considerations.  For example, a qualifying \nbattered spouse, child or parent may file an immigrant visa petition under the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA), as amended by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).  See generally \n8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1186(c)(4). Among other sympathetic considerations to victims \nof abuse, VAWA created special provisions in United States immigration law to protect victims \nof  abuse  who  are  not  citizens  of  the  United  States. Id. In  cases  of  domestic  violence,  US \nimmigration law allows certain victims of abuse who are not citizens to obtain lawful status \nwithout having to rely on their abuser to petition. Id. Qualifying applicants may apply self-petition \nfor an immigrant visa abroad and subsequently enter the United States as immigrants if the abuser \nis an employee of the U.S. government, the abuser is a member of the uniformed services, or the \napplicant  was  subjected  to  battery  or  extreme  cruelty  in  the  United  States. 8  U.S.C.  §§ \n1154(a)(1)(A)(v), (a)(1)(B)(iv). \n89.  In addition, the U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain \ncrimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or \ngovernment officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity; it provides a pathway \nto lawful permanent residence and subsequently citizenship after 3 years of residence in the United \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 39 of 100\nStates. See generally 8 U.S.C. § 101(a)(15)(U). Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with \nthe passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered \nImmigrant Women Protection Act, Pub. L. 106-386) in October 2000. Under the provisions of this \nstatute, a U nonimmigrant may also petition for certain family members to receive a “derivative U \nvisa.” While many such eligible family members will already have entered the United States with \na derivative U visa before the principal U nonimmigrant receives a green card after three years of \nresidence, those family members who do not may apply for an immigrant visa abroad.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 245(m)(3) (upon the approval of an adjustment of status application for a principal U \nnonimmigrant, “the Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status or issue an immigrant \nvisa to a spouse, a child, or in the case of an alien child, a parent who did not receive a [derivative \nU visa] under section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii)” of the INA.); 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(g). \n90.  The Proclamation’s suspension of entry does violence to this legislatively enacted \nimmigration scheme that synthesizes considerations of national origin, merit, race, humanitarian, \nand  family-based  preferences—principles  that  have  formed  the  bedrock  of  this  nation’s \nimmigration system for decades—and replaces it with a single inquiry: does the prospective \nimmigrant have a specific kind of health insurance or sufficient financial resources to pay for what \na consular officer considers to be reasonably foreseeable medical costs? The United States \nimmigration system has never countenanced anything approaching such a standard for admission, \nwhich  would  disproportionately  affect  immigrants  who  are  from  predominantly  nonwhite \ncountries and either seeking to reunite with family already here in the United States, or fear being \nseparated from family in the United States when they leave for a consular interview. Once \neffective, the Proclamation will ban nearly two thirds of all noncitizens legally permitted under the \nINA to immigrate to the United States, and will separate thousands of families indefinitely. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 40 of 100\n91.  In effectively barring most legal and otherwise qualified immigrants from entering \nthe country because they cannot afford health care completely out of pocket, the Proclamation \nthwarts the carefully considered Congressional scheme that provides health care-related benefits \nto new and recently arrived immigrants via a combination of federal and state-elected programs. \nOver the past two decades, Congress—and the States, at Congressional behest—have acted to \nprovide certain benefits specifically to such immigrants. But the Proclamation would ban most \nimmigrants from entering the United States precisely because they would be entitled to such \nbenefits if they came. \nB.  The Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 \n92.  Under  the  Personal  Responsibility  Work  Opportunity  Reconciliation  Act \n(“PRWORA”), passed in 1996, Congress restricted the availability of certain means-tested benefits \nfor newly arrived immigrants, but gave states the ability to fill in this gap by electing to provide \ncoverage to such individuals. Before PRWORA’s enactment, legal immigrants living in the United \nStates were eligible for public benefits on similar terms as citizens. After enactment, however, \nPRWORA  has  generally  barred  all  new  legal  immigrants,  excepting  certain  humanitarian \ncategories, including but not limited to asylees and refugees, from receiving federal means-tested \npublic benefits, such as Medicaid, TANF, SNAP, and SSI, for five years after their arrival in the \nUnited States. \n93.  Despite redrawing immigrant eligibility for federal benefits, PRWORA expressly \ndevolved broad new powers to the states, in relevant part authorizing, but not requiring, states to \nuse state-only funds to offer food, cash, and health-related benefit programs as a substitute for lost \nfederal benefits for legal immigrants. A number of states took advantage of this “gap-filling” \nauthority to use state funds to provide TANF, SNAP, SSI, and/or Medicaid to legal immigrants \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 41 of 100\nsubject to the five-year bar. States were, for example, given the option under PRWORA to use \nstate funds to continue coverage to immigrants under Medicaid during their first five years in the \ncountry. \nC.  The Children’s Health Insurance Plan (“CHIP”) and CHIP Reauthorization Act \n94.  Congress subsequently reinforced PRWORA’s grant of power to the states to \nprovide health care-related benefits to legal immigrants under federal health care programs through \nthe Children’s Health Insurance Plan (“CHIP”). The original State Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram was enacted in 1997 with bi-partisan support to act as a complement to Medicaid, the \nnation’s major health coverage for low-income children, by giving states financial support to \nprovide coverage to uninsured, low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid. The \nprogram was reauthorized on February 4, 2009, through the Children’s Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act (“CHIPRA”), which passed with bi-partisan support and was one of the first \npieces of legislation signed by President Obama. \n95.  The original CHIP expanded health insurance coverage to low-income children \nineligible for Medicaid by providing block grants to states that must be matched with state dollars. \nUnder the law, states could use their federal CHIP funds to finance coverage for children whose \nfamily incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid, either by expanding their already existing \nMedicaid programs, creating a separate CHIP program, or a combination of those two approaches. \nIndeed, under the matching rates required under the program, the federal government bears a \nhigher percentage of the overall cost of CHIP than it does under Medicaid. All states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, currently use CHIP funds to expand publicly funded health insurance \ncoverage to uninsured children who are ineligible for Medicaid; most states cover children up to \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 42 of 100\nor above 200% of the federal poverty level.27 In the same vein as PRWORA, the original CHIP \nalso authorized States to provide coverage to newly arrived legal immigrant children, who were \notherwise ineligible to enroll in either Medicaid or CHIP for their first five years in the country, \nbut States doing so had to fund such coverage with state-only dollars.  \n96.  CHIPRA reauthorized CHIP and provided states with significant new funding, new \nprogrammatic options such as dental coverage, and a range of new incentives to provide Medicaid \nand CHIP coverage to uninsured, low-income children, especially those who may be eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP but who are not enrolled. CHIPRA also established new options and federal \nfunding for states to cover pregnant women, as well as legal immigrant children and legal \nimmigrant pregnant women during their first five years in the country. Thirty-one states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, now cover legal immigrant children, legal immigrant pregnant women, or \nboth under CHIPRA.28 Under the Proclamation, however, Medicaid is expressly excluded from \nthe “approved” types of health insurance coverage for all individuals over the age of 18, even \nthough CHIPRA expressly extends CHIP coverage eligibility to children up to age 19, and \nMedicaid eligibility to individuals up to age 21 and to pregnant women, including immigrants \nlawfully residing in the United States within their first five years of having legal status. \n \n27 Medicaid/CHIP Coverage of Lawfully-Residing Immigrant Children and Pregnant Women, \nKAISER FAMILY FUND, https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-chip-\ncoverage-of-lawfully-residing-immigrant-children-and-pregnant-\nwomen/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:\n%22asc%22%7D.

The Affordable Care Act  \n97.  In 2010, Congress passed comprehensive health reform, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \nAct (“HCERA”) (together, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA,” or “Obamacare”) into law. 124 \nStat. 119. The PPACA contains 10 titles covering over 900 pages, as well as additional provisions \nunder the HCERA. In at least three relevant ways, the ACA was intended to expand access to \nmeaningful  and  affordable  health  insurance  coverage  for  all  U.S.  residents,  including  legal \nimmigrants, at a guaranteed minimum level of coverage.  \n98.  First, to facilitate broad health insurance enrollment nationwide, the ACA required \nthe creation of a marketplace, or exchange, in each state so that residents can shop for insurance. \nThese  marketplaces  took  the  form  of  state-run-exchanges,  a  federally  facilitated  exchange \navailable at the healthcare.gov website, or a hybrid of the two.29 \n99.  Second, to ensure a certain standard of coverage, the ACA required health insurers, \nincluding those who participated in the state and federal Exchanges and those selling plans outside \nof it, to provide plans that cover “essential health benefits,” including hospitalization, prescription \ndrugs, mental health services, ambulatory patient services, maternity and newborn care, mental \nhealth  and  substance  use  disorder  services,  preventive  and  wellness  services,  and  pediatric \nservices, including oral and vision care. 42 U.S.C. § 18022(b)(1). All individual market plans, \nincluding ACA-defined and regulated catastrophic health plans, must provide such essential health \n \n29 As enacted, the ACA required most United States citizens and legal residents to purchase and \nmaintain health insurance or pay a penalty. However, President Trump and a Republican-\ncontrolled Congress eliminated the financial penalty that an individual would incur if she failed \nto maintain health insurance as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (see \nhttps://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1/BILLS-115hr1enr.pdf). \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 44 of 100\nbenefits, must cover preexisting conditions and may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on \ncore coverage.30 Short-term limited duration insurance plans, however, are ACA-exempt and \ncannot be offered or purchased on ACA exchanges. As a result, they are non-comprehensive and \ndo not provide the full range of essential health benefits, can and often do deny coverage based on \npreexisting conditions, and can and often do impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on core \ncoverage. \n100.  Third,  the  ACA  provides  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  income-related, \npremium-based tax credits (“PTCs” or “APTCs”) to individuals with household incomes between \n100 and 400% of the federal poverty line. 26 U.S.C. § 36B. For newly arrived legal immigrants \nwho are subject to PRWORA’s five-year bar on means-tested public benefits, the ACA allows \nPTCs on more permissive terms, also including individuals below 100% of the federal poverty \nline. 26 U.S.C. § 36(b)(c)(1)(B). In 2019, under DHHS Federal Poverty Guidelines, the income \nlevel necessary for a family of four to qualify for financial assistance ranged from $25,100 at 100% \nFPL to $100,400 at 400% FPL.   \n101.  Taken together, these three components of the ACA promote the overarching goals \nof  robust  nationwide  enrollment,  protections  for  consumers  through  coverage  that  is \ncomprehensive  and  does  not  bar  eligibility  based  on  preexisting  conditions,  and  increased \naffordability for health insurance coverage. Robust enrollment in comprehensive coverage plans \npromotes insurance market stability and more affordable premiums across the market, as the robust \nenrollment of healthy individuals allows distributing costs for less healthy individuals across a \nlarger pool of enrollees. More affordable premiums, in turn, spurs more robust enrollment. \n \n30 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-3, 300gg-11. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 45 of 100\n102.  The  ACA’s  structure  and  operation  also  evinces  Congress’s  intent  that  legal \nimmigrants, including newly and recently arrived immigrants, be able to participate fully in the \nACA marketplace to enroll in comprehensive health care and to receive financial assistance if \nnecessary. The benefits available under the ACA, especially when considered in connection with \nthe benefits that the states and federal government have made available to newly and recently \narrived legal immigrants under PRWORA and CHIPRA, make clear that Congress intended for \nlegal immigrants to be able to receive specific health care-related benefits to ensure a minimum \nlevel of health care coverage upon their arrival in the United States. \n103.  The  Proclamation  directly  conflicts  with  this  benefits  scheme,  disqualifying \n“subsidized” health insurance offered on ACA Exchanges as “approved health insurance” that \nwould permit entry to the United States. The effect of the Proclamation is to prevent would-be \nimmigrants, who would otherwise be fully qualified under the INA to come to the United States, \nfrom entering and receiving the benefits Congress expressly intended for them to have.  \n104.  Moreover, as noted above, visitor insurance and STLDI plans are the only two \noptions for “approved health insurance” that are realistically and feasibly available to most \nprospective immigrants outside the United States, especially those who are not entering with an \noffer of employment that includes employer-sponsored health insurance. Because such plans are \nless regulated under the ACA than individual market plans, carriers of such plans will no doubt \nrise to meet the new demand the Proclamation will invariably create. But in driving a majority of \nnew immigrants towards these non-comprehensive plans—for a minimum of 364 days, no less, or \ntheir first year in the United States—the Proclamation undermines not only the ACA’s goal of \nproviding a certain minimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants in the United States, but \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 46 of 100\nalso its own stated goal of addressing the burdens of uncompensated care provided to uninsured \nindividuals.  \nREGULATORY BACKGROUND \n105.  In addition to entering a stage already set by PRWORA, CHIPRA, and the ACA, \nthe Proclamation follows hot on the heels of the Trump Administration’s recently promulgated \n(and recently enjoined) “Public Charge Rule,” which attempts to change what it means to be \ndeemed a “public charge,” one of the ten enumerated grounds of inadmissibility under the INA. \nIgnoring decades of legislation and case law, the new Rule attempts to redefine the term “public \ncharge” and reshape the “totality of circumstances” framework that immigration officials apply to \ndetermine whether a person seeking admission is likely to become a public charge. The new Rule \nwas enjoined from taking effect on October 15, 2019 by numerous courts.  Each court found the \nnew definition of “public charge” contrary to Congress’ plain meaning and intent.31   \n106.  Both  the  Proclamation  and  the  new  Rule  effectively  turn  the  question  of \nadmissibility to the United States into a receipt-of-benefits issue. The Rule was promulgated by \nthe Department of Homeland Security via formal notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA; \nthe Proclamation was not.   \n \n31 New York v.

The State Department’s actions to implement the Proclamation without satisfying \nthe requirements of notice and comment rulemaking layer one form of lawlessness on another.  \nThe Proclamation, like the recent Public Charge Rule, attempts to radically rewrite Congressional \ndecision about which immigrants may enter the country based on wealth considerations. \n108.    The nation’s immigration laws have long included a prohibition on admitting non-\ncitizens deemed to be a “public charge” on the country.  This definition has evolved over time but \nhas never erected the kind of broad entry barrier that the Proclamation permits.   \n109.  In 1882, Congress enacted the country’s first immigration laws, which refused \nforeign nationals permission “to land” in the United States “if on such examination there shall be \nfound among such passengers any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of \nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge.”  See An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 \nStat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2 (1882) (“1882 Act”) (emphasis added). \n110.  In 1891, Congress amended the 1882 Act to provide, in part,  \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States . . . : All idiots, insane persons, \npaupers  or  persons  likely  to  become  a  public  charge,  persons \nsuffering  from  a  loathsome  or  a  dangerous  contagious  disease, \npersons who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous \ncrime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polygamists, and \n. . . . \nAn Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of Aliens \nUnder Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 (“1891 Act”) §§ 1, 11 \n(1891).  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 48 of 100\n111.  Congress subsequently amended immigration laws in 1903, 1907, and 1910 without \nmaterially altering the authorization to refuse entry to a noncitizen deemed a “public charge.”32    \nThe 1910 Act provided, for example: \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States: All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\nminded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who have \nbeen insane within five years previous; persons who have had two \nor more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons \nlikely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons \nafflicted  with  tuberculosis  or  with  a  loathsome  or  dangerous \ncontagious disease; persons not comprehended within any of the \nforegoing excluded classes who are . . . mentally or physically \ndefective, such mental or physical defect being of a nature which \nmay affect the ability of such alien to earn a living; persons who \nhave been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other \ncrime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . \n. . .” \n1910 Act § 2. \n112.  In 1915, The Supreme Court considered a “single question, . . . whether an alien \ncan be declared likely to become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the city of \nhis immediate destination is overstocked.” See Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 9-10 (1915).   \n113.  In answering “no” to the question, the Supreme Court interpreted the term  “Persons \nlikely  to  become  a  public  charge”  in  context,  that  is,  as  “mentioned  between  paupers  and \nprofessional beggars, and along with idiots, persons dangerously diseased, persons certified by the \nexamining surgeon to have a mental or physical defect of a nature to affect their ability to earn a \nliving, convicted felons, prostitutes and so forth.”  Id.  The Court held that “[t]he persons \nenumerated  in  short  are  to  be  excluded  on  the  ground  of  permanent  personal  objections \n \n32 An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 32 Stat. 1213, Chap. 1012 \n§ 2 (1903); An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 34 Stat. 898, \nChap. 1134 § 2 (1907); An Act to Amend an Act entitled An Act to Regulate the Immigration of \nAliens Into the United States, 36 Stat. 263, Chap. 128 § 2 (1910). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 49 of 100\naccompanying them irrespective of local conditions,” and thus not according to local or temporary \nconditions impacting their self-sufficiency.  Id. at 10. \n114.  After Gegiow, federal courts and immigration officials universally understood the \nterm public charge as referring to persons with “a mental or physical defect of a nature to affect \ntheir ability to make a living,” that is, those substantially, if not entirely, dependent on government \nassistance on a long-term basis.33     \n115.  In the century since the Gegiow decision, Congress has made numerous changes to \nimmigration law, most notably the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.  An Act to Revise the \nLaws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality; and for Other Purposes, 66 Stat. \n163, 183, Title 2, Chap. 2 (“1952 Act”) § 212 (1952).  It has continued to use “public charge” as a \nbasis for denying entry to noncitizens, but it has never offered its own definition of the term. It \nhas, however, rejected attempts to adopt a definition contrary to the understanding developed in \nlegislative history and case law.  \n116.  In  1996,  for  example,  Congress  enacted  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 531, 110 Stat. 3009, 3674-75 \n(1996),  which  amended  the  INA  by  codifying  five  factors  relevant  to  a  public  charge \ndetermination.  In the course of enacting IIRIRA, members of Congress debated whether to expand \nthe public charge definition to include use of non-cash public benefits such as Medicaid and CHIP.  \nSee Immigration Control & Financial Responsibility Act of 1996, H.R. 2202, 104th Cong. § 202 \n \n33 See, e.g., United States ex rel.

The Senate, however, rejected the effort to include previously unconsidered, non-\ncash public benefits in the public charge test. It also rebuffed the attempt to create a bright-line \nframework of considering whether the immigrant has received public benefits for an aggregate of \ntwelve months as “too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the same public \nassistance that many Americans need to get on their feet.”  S. Rep. No. 104-249, at *63−64 (1996) \n(Senator Leahy’s remarks).  Accordingly, in its final bill, Congress did not include the receipt of \nMedicaid, CHIP, supplemental food assistance, SSI, and other means-tested public benefits. as \ndeterminative of a public charge.34  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \n117.  The public charge ground of inadmissibility, as amended in IIRIRA, provides: \n“[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \nthe opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission or adjustment of status, \nis likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible.”35 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  When \ndetermining whether an applicant is inadmissible as a public charge, the statute instructs the officer \nto consider “at a minimum” the applicant’s age; health; family status; assets, resources, and \nfinancial status; and education and skills. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The officer “may also \nconsider any affidavit of support under section 213A [8 U.S.C. § 1183a] for purposes of exclusion” \non the public charge ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). \n \n34 Congress rejected a similar attempt to expand the public charge definition in 1994 when \nconsidering the Immigration Stabilization Act, see S. 1923 (103rd), § 501 \n(https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/s1923/text). \n35 Certain groups of noncitizens, such as asylum seekers and refugees, are not subject to \nexclusion based on an assessment that they are likely to become a public charge.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1157 (refugee); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c) (refugee). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 51 of 100\n118.  In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), a precursor to the US \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and \nfield guidance intended to “summarize longstanding law with respect to public charge and provide \nnew guidance on public charge determinations” following the passage of IIRIRA. 64 Fed. Reg. \n26,689 (May 26, 1999) (the “Field Guidance”). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Inadmissibility \nand Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,676 (May 26, 1999) (to be codified \nat 8 C.F.R., pts. 212 & 237) (“1999 Proposed Rule”); Field Guidance on Deportability and \nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (Mar. 26, 1999) (\"1999 Field \nGuidance\").  The 1999 Proposed Rule and Field Guidance defined “public charge” to mean “an \nalien  who  is  likely  to  become  primarily  dependent  on  the  Government  for  subsistence  as \ndemonstrated by either (i) The receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance purposes, \nor (ii) Institutionalization for long-term care at Government expense (other than imprisonment for \nconviction of a crime).”  1999 Proposed Rule, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,681; 1999 Field Guidance, 64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,689.  The 1999 Rulemaking clarified in particular that the INS had adopted this \ndefinition “based on the plain meaning of the word ‘charge,’ the historical context of public \ndependency when the public immigration provisions were first enacted more than a century ago, \nand the expertise of the benefit-granting agencies that deal with subsistence issues.” 64 Fed. Reg. \nat 28,677. \n119.  The  Field  Guidance  further  directed  service  officers  “to  assess  the  financial \nresponsibility of the alien by examining the ‘totality of the alien's circumstances’ at the time of his \nor her application * * * The existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the sole \ncriterion for determining if an alien is likely to become a public charge.”  1999 Field Guidance, \n64 Fed. Reg. at 28,690 (emphasis in original). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 52 of 100\n120.  The 1999 Field Guidance, which was made consistent with the Department of \nState’s understanding, reaffirmed that “[i]t has never been Service policy that any receipt of \nservices or benefits paid for in whole or in part from public funds renders an alien a public charge, \nor indicates that the alien is likely to become a public charge. The nature of the public program \nmust be considered.  For instance, attending public schools, taking advantage of school lunch or \nother supplemental nutrition programs, or receiving emergency medical care would not make an \nalien inadmissible as a public charge, despite the use of public funds.”  1999 Field Guidance, 64 \nFed. Reg. at 28,692 (citing FAM § 40.41 n.9.1 (1999)). \n121.  The 1999 Field Guidance also emphasized that the purpose in issuing the proposed \nrule and field guidance was intended to end “confusion about the relationship between the receipt \nof public benefits and the concept of ‘public charge’ [that] has deterred eligible aliens and their \nfamilies, including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits that \nthey are legally entitled to receive. This reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not \njust on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare.”  1999 Field Guidance, \n64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692. \n122.  The  1999  Field  Guidance  specifically  exempted  “Medicaid  and  other  health \ninsurance and health services (including public assistance for immunizations and for testing and \ntreatment of symptoms of communicable diseases; use of health clinics, short-term rehabilitation \nservices, and emergency medical services) other than support for long-term institutional care” from \npublic charge determinations. 1999 Field Guidance, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,693. \n123.  Although the 1999 Proposed Rule was never finalized, the 1999 Field Guidance \nhas governed public charge admissibility determinations since that time—nearly two decades.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  49 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 53 of 100\n124.  On October 10, 2018, DHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (the “Rule” \nor the “Public Charge Rule”), Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, which rescinded the \n1999 Rulemaking, redefined “public charge,” and amended the totality-of-the-circumstances \nstandard prescribed by the 1999 Field Guidance. 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018) (to be \ncodified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245 and 248).   \n125.  The proposed rule followed President Trump’s failed attempt to garner broad \ncongressional support for the 2017 the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy \n(RAISE) Act, which would have eliminated the INA’s system of allocating immigration visas \naccording to family, employment, and diversity categories and replacing it with a points-based \n“merit” system “to prioritize immigrants based on the skills they bring to our Nation while \nsafeguarding the jobs of American workers.”36   \n126.  After  a  60-day  notice-and-comment  period,  in  which  it  received  266,077 \ncomments, DHS finalized and issued the Rule on August 14, 2019, notwithstanding the fact that \nthe “vast majority of [comments] . . . opposed the rule.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,304. The Rule was \nscheduled to become effective on October 15, 2019.  \n127.  The Rule redefined a “public charge” to include any noncitizen  “who receives one \nor more public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36 month period \n(such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).” 84 Fed. Reg. \n41,501 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(a)).  Unlike the previous Field Guidance definition of \n“public  charge,”  which  focused  specifically  on  the  receipt  of  cash  benefits  or  long-term \ninstitutionalization, the Rule defines “public benefit” as both cash benefits and noncash benefits, \n \n36 President Donald J.

Id.; see also 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(b).  \n128.  The Rule also significantly altered the totality-of-the-circumstances framework, \nassigning different weights to certain factors labeled as positive, negative, heavily positive, and \nheavily negative, which a DHS officer must weigh “individually and cumulatively.” 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 41,397; see also id. at 41,502-04.   \n129.  A prospective immigrant is given heavy negative weight if, for example, she has a \nmedical condition requiring “extensive medical treatment” and is “uninsured and has neither the \nprospect of obtaining private health insurance, nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs related to such medical condition.” 84 Fed. Reg. 41,504; see also 8 \nC.F.R. § 212.22(c)(1)(i), (iii).  A prospective immigrant would receive heavy positive weight for \n“an annual income . . . of at least 250 percent of the [Federal Poverty Guidelines] for the alien’s \nhousehold size” or for “private health insurance that is not subsidized under the Affordable Care \nAct.” See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)(ii), (iii). The consular officer must also consider, among other \nthings,  the  immigrant’s  age;  household  income;  household  size;  credit  score;  education; \noccupational skills, certifications, or licenses; and English fluency. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b).  \n130.  As Trump Administration officials have acknowledged, the cumulative effect of \nthese changes would substantially burden immigrants with disabilities and lower incomes—and in \nparticular, non-white immigrants who are not from Europe—to demonstrate their admissibility. \nWhen Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of USCIS, was asked whether the proposed Rule conflicted \nwith the New Colossus poem by Emma Lazarus inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty, he \namended the poem as follows: “Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 55 of 100\nfeet, and who will not become a public charge.” 37 Shortly thereafter, he clarified his understanding \nthat New Colossus “was referring to people coming from Europe.”38  \n131.  Expert analysis confirmed that the Rule “could shift legal immigration away from \nLatin America and towards Europe” due to its emphasis on income.39 The Migration Policy \nInstitute, for example, examined immigrants who had received legal permanent residence within \nthe last five years to explore the potential scope of the Rule’s impact. MPI analysts found that 69% \nof immigrants who had received legal permanent residence within the last five years had at least \none negative factor under the Rule, and that the Rule would have “a disproportionate effect on \nwomen,  children,  and  the  elderly.”40  In  particular,  among  “recently  arrived  legally  present \nnoncitizens[,] 71 percent of Mexicans and Central Americans, 69 percent of Africans, and 52 \npercent of Asian immigrants would fail to meet the threshold” of incomes or financial assets above \n250% of the federal poverty line, a heavily weighted factor under the Rule.41 In short, “the impact \n \n37 Jacey Fortin, ‘Huddled Masses’ in Statue of Liberty Poem Are European, Trump Official Says, \nNY TIMES (Aug. 14, 2019) https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/cuccinelli-statue-liberty-\npoem.html  \n38 Id. \n39 Randy Capps et al., Gauging the Impact of DHS’ Proposed Public-Charge Rule on U.S. \nImmigration, MIGRATION POLICY INST.

The anticipated effects of the Proclamation are similar to those of the now-enjoined \nRule. This can hardly be surprising, given that both share significant similarities: Both favor \n“unsubsidized” ACA coverage over subsidized; the use of Medicaid is a negative or disqualifying \nfactor for adults 18 and over; and both involve some analysis on the part of a consular officer as \nto  whether  an  intending  immigrant  has  sufficient  financial  resources  to  cover  “reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs.”  \n134.  How the Rule and the Proclamation achieve these effects, however, is where the \ntwo differ. When promulgating the Rule, the Trump Administration made at least some attempt to \ncomply with the strictures of the Administrative Procedure Act—just as Senators Tom Cotton and \nDavid Perdue, two allies of the President in the Senate, attempted to comply with the legislative \nprocesses of Congress when sponsoring the RAISE Act. The Proclamation, by contrast, is an \nimproper attempt to legislate by presidential fiat, followed by invalid agency action to implement \nthose improper orders. Here, with a single sweep of the President’s pen, the Proclamation attempts \nto  overwrite  and  overturn  more  than  a  century  of  Congressional  intent  to  admit  qualified \nnoncitizens as immigrants, regardless of wealth, health, race, or national origin.   \n \n47 Michael D. Shear et al., Trump’s Policy Could Alter the Face of the American Immigrant, NY \nTIMES (Aug. 14, 2019) https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/us/immigration-public-charge-\nwelfare.html  \n48 Id. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  54 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 58 of 100\nTHE PROCLAMATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION ARE UNLAWFUL \nA.  The Proclamation Does Not Pass Muster Under Section 212(f) or Rational Basis \nReview  \n \n135.  The Proclamation purports to be grounded in the President’s authority under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(f), which allows the President to “suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of \naliens” whenever the President “finds that the entry” of such “aliens into the United States would \nbe detrimental to the interests of the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). But in suspending the \nentry of potentially two thirds of all legal immigrants to the United States, the Proclamation \nrepresents an unprecedented abuse of the §1182(f) power.  Although the Supreme Court found that \nthe Muslim Ban represented a permissible exercise of the President’s broad authority to impose \nentry restrictions under § 1182(f) based on national security considerations, the Proclamation \nstrains even the generous analysis of Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392  (2018).  \n136.  Indeed, the Supreme Court’s decision in Hawaii is bound up in the circumstances \nof the proclamation at issue in that case, “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for \nDetecting Attempted Entry Into the United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats.” \nThe  Court  took  pains  to  note,  for  example,  that  the  Muslim  Ban  “supports  Congress’s \nindividualized approach for determining inadmissibility” because it was intended to “promote[] \nthe effectiveness of the [consular officer] vetting process by helping to ensure the availability” of \n“sufficient (and sufficiently reliable) information” to assess a visa applicant’s admissibility. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2411. It also observed that previous suspensions under § 1182(f) often \ninvolved foreign policy judgments: Some such suspensions “broadly suspended entry on the basis \nof nationality due to ongoing diplomatic disputes;” others “were directed at subsets of aliens from \nthe countries at issue;” but as a general rule, the Court found that previous Presidents “repeatedly \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 59 of 100\nsuspended entry” under § 1182(f) “to retaliate for conduct by their governments that conflicted \nwith foreign policy interests.” Id. at 2413. \n137.  Within this context, the Court found that the President had satisfied the “sole \nrequisite set forth in § 1182(f)”—i.e., that the President “find that the entry of covered aliens would \nbe detrimental to the interests of the United States.”8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  As the Court observed, \nthe President had ordered DHS and other agencies “to conduct a comprehensive evaluation,” then \n“set[] forth extensive findings” justifying why “it was in the national interest to restrict entry of \naliens who could not be vetted with adequate information—both to protect national security and \npublic safety, and to induce improvement by their home countries.” The Court also highlighted \nlanguage  in  the  Muslim  Ban  noting  that  the  Administration  had  “crafted  country-specific \nrestrictions that would be most likely to encourage cooperation given each country’s distinct \ncircumstances, while securing the Nation until such time as improvements occur.”  Indeed, the \nCourt found that “[t]he 12-page Muslim Ban—which thoroughly describes the process, agency \nevaluations,  and  recommendations  underlying  the  President’s  chosen  restrictions—is  more \ndetailed than any prior order a President has issued under § 1182(f).”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409.   \n138.  Given these findings, especially within a national security setting, the Court found \nthat the Muslim Ban “is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority under the INA.”  Id. at \n2415. \n139.  The Court also noted, however, that it “has engaged in a circumscribed inquiry \nwhen the denial of a visa allegedly burdens the constitutional rights of a U.S. citizen.”  Id. at 2419. \nThe limits on such an inquiry, pursued under Kleindienst v. Mandel, have “particular force in \nadmission and immigration cases that overlap with the area of national security” for two reasons: \nFirst, judicial inquiry into national security concerns potentially “intrud[es] on the President’s \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 60 of 100\nconstitutional responsibilities in the area of foreign affairs,” raising separation of powers concerns. \nId. at 2398. Second, the courts are not well positioned “when it comes to collecting evidence and \ndrawing inferences on questions of national security.” Id. \n140.  Thus, when evaluating the Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to the Ban, the Court \narticulated a standard of review that “considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the \nGovernment’s stated objective.” Id. at 2420.  \n141.  Although the Supreme Court found that the Muslim Ban ultimately met this \nstandard, it was careful to note that its analysis was grounded in the national security context. It \nwas this context that allowed the Court to find that “the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding \nin national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility,” Id. at 2421, despite \nacknowledging “a series of statements by the President and his advisers casting doubt on the \nofficial objective of the Proclamation,” Id. at 2417. In so finding, the Court gave express deference \nto “the Executive’s evaluation of the underlying facts . . .particularly in the context of litigation \ninvolving ‘sensitive and weighty interests of national security and foreign affairs.’”  Id. at 2422. \n142.  In addition, the Court credited three specific features of the Ban and its predecessors \nthat “support the Government’s claim of a legitimate national security interest.” Id. at 2402. \n143.  First, three Muslim-majority countries had already been removed from the list of \nbanned countries, and the Proclamation stated that for countries remaining on the list, the tailored \nentry suspensions would “remain in force only so long as necessary to address” the security \nconcerns posed by each country. Id. at 2410. \n144.  Second, the Ban “includes significant exceptions for various categories of foreign \nnationals,” permitting “nationals from nearly every covered country to travel to the United States \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 61 of 100\non a variety of nonimmigrant visas,” which make up the majority of visas issued to nationals from \nthe banned countries. Id. at 2422. \n145.  Third, “the Proclamation creates a waiver program open to all covered foreign \nnationals  seeking  entry  as  immigrants  or  nonimmigrants,”  and  “directs  DHS  and  the  State \nDepartment to issue guidance elaborating upon the circumstances that would justify a waiver.” Id. \nat 2422-23.  The Court found this program, which identifies specific eligibility criteria, to be \nsimilar to humanitarian exceptions set forth in a similar country-specific suspension imposed by \nPresident Carter during the Iran hostage crisis.  \n146.  Given  these  considerations,  the  Court  held  that  the  plaintiffs  had  failed  to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claims because “the \nGovernment has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis \nreview,” and remanded the case to the lower courts for further proceedings. Id. at 2423. \n147.  The Supreme Court found that § 1182(f) “grants the President broad discretion to \nsuspend the entry of aliens into the United States.” Id. at 2408.  But such authority is not limitless.  \nIf the Proclamation is allowed to ban two thirds of immigrants whom Congress has expressly \npermitted to seek and receive immigrant visas based on wealth or self-sufficiency, such a reading \nof § 1182(f) would provide the President with unfettered discretion to rewrite the INA as he sees \nfit. Such a reading cannot muster under even the most generous reading of Hawaii.  \n148.  As an initial matter, unlike the Muslim Ban, the Proclamation does nothing to \n“support[] Congress’s individualized approach for determining admissibility” under the INA. \nThere is nothing in the text of the Proclamation indicating that one of its purposes is to “improve \nthe screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with” the visa-issuance process. 82 \nFed. Reg. 45162 (Sept. 27, 2017). To the contrary, the Proclamation expressly has nothing to do \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  58 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 62 of 100\nwith national security, bearing a “HEALTHCARE” label on the White House website.49 By its \nterms, the Proclamation’s purpose is to protect the country’s health care system and taxpayers \n“from the burdens of uncompensated care” by suspending the “entry into the United States of \ncertain  immigrants  who  lack  health  insurance  or  the  demonstrated  ability  to  pay  for  their \nhealthcare.”  Thus,  instead  of  a  relatively  targeted,  country-specific  approach  intended  to \n“encourage foreign governments to improve their . . . practices” in vetting and information sharing, \nthe Proclamation sweeps far more broadly and indiscriminately, affecting hundreds of thousands \nof immigrants solely on the basis of their ability to afford health insurance. 82 Fed. Reg. 45,162.  \n149.  Second, the Proclamation does not even attempt to set forth factual findings \njustifying its sweeping ban on nearly two thirds of all prospective immigrants seeking to enter the \nUnited States. Unlike the Muslim Ban, the Proclamation is not grounded in any comparable multi-\nagency, comprehensive evaluation that led to “extensive findings” set forth in the Proclamation, \njustifying why it is in the national interest to restrict the entry of aliens through country-specific \nrestrictions  crafted  to  “encourage  cooperation  given  each  country’s  distinct  circumstances.” \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (citation and internal quotations omitted).  \n150.  Instead, in a short preamble that ostensibly justifies the details of the suspension \nthat follows, the Proclamation merely claims that uninsured individuals burden the country’s \nhealth care system for two main reasons: because “[h]ealthcare providers and taxpayers bear \nsubstantial costs in paying for medical expenses incurred by people who lack health insurance;” \nand because “uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of \n \n49 Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially \nBurden the United States Healthcare System, WHITEHOUSE.GOV (Oct. 4, 2019) \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-suspension-entry-\nimmigrants-will-financially-burden-united-states-healthcare-system/  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  59 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 63 of 100\nnon-emergency conditions,” which burdens taxpayers, “who reimburse hospitals for a portion of \ntheir uncompensated emergency care costs.” 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991.  According to an unsupported \nassertion  in  the  preamble,  “[i]n  total,  uncompensated  care  costs  –  the  overall  measure  of \nunreimbursed services that hospitals give their patients – have exceeded $35 billion in each of the \nlast 10 years.” Id. The Proclamation then asserts that “data show that lawful immigrants are about \nthree times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.”  Id.  The Proclamation \ndoes not provide or cite to any support for these claims.  \n151.  It is these unsupported assertions alone that purport to justify the Proclamation’s \nindiscriminate ban on hundreds of thousands of prospective immigrants across the globe. \n152.  The lack of factual support for the Proclamation’s entry suspension is evident. \nWhile claiming that “lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States \ncitizens to lack health insurance,” the Proclamation ignores the fact that United States citizens \nactually account for 75% of the total 27.4 million uninsured in this country, or 20.55 million \nuninsured individuals.50 In comparison, according to figures provided by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation for 2017, uninsured immigrants represent only 11% of uninsured in this country, or 3 \nmillion uninsured individuals. \n153.  In attaching a dollar amount to the “uncompensated care costs”—in excess of “$35 \nbillion in each of the last 10 years,” or “$7 million on average for each hospital in the United \nStates”—the Proclamation provides no evidentiary support for these figures. Nor does it set forth \nany factual findings identifying what percentage of this total overall figure is attributable to the \n75% of uninsured United States citizens versus the 11% uninsured immigrants in this country, \n \n50 President Trump’s Proclamation Suspending Entry for Immigrants without Health Coverage, \nKAISER FAMILY FUND (Oct. 10, 2019) https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/fact-\nsheet/president-trumps-proclamation-suspending-entry-for-immigrants-without-health-coverage/  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  60 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 64 of 100\nsuch that the continued entry of such uninsured immigrants to the United States “would be \ndetrimental” to the interests of “protecting both [our health care system] and the American taxpayer \nfrom the burdens of uncompensated care.”  84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. \n154.  The Proclamation, moreover, sets forth no factual findings explaining how the \nconditions of its suspension further the stated goal of reducing the burden of uninsured health care \ncosts. This is in stark contrast to the Muslim Ban, which articulated country-specific deficiencies \nin vetting and information-sharing; justifications for the suspension of specific visas from specific \ncountries; and express instructions to the Secretary of State to engage in diplomatic efforts with \nthese countries to improve the identified deficiencies, using the suspension of specific visas from \nthose countries “to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign \nterrorists.” 82. Fed. Reg. 13,213. The Proclamation, by contrast, imposes a far broader suspension, \nbarring all immigrants worldwide except for the limited few who can arrange for certain types of \nUnited States-based health insurance or demonstrate an unspecified level of wealth at their visa \ninterview. There are no factual findings explaining how, for example, the entry of an immigrant \nwho would be fully insured with comprehensive coverage under the ACA after arrival—albeit with \nfinancial assistance—would be detrimental to the Proclamation’s express purpose of reducing the \nfinancial  burden  imposed  by  uninsured  individuals.  There  are  likewise  no  factual  findings \nexplaining how the entry of an immigrant who would be underinsured or effectively uninsured \nwith visitor insurance or a short-term limited duration insurance plan would further this purpose. \n155.  Third, in infringing the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, the Proclamation’s policy \nof suspending entry for all new immigrants unless they can afford only certain types of health \ninsurance,  or  demonstrate  an  unspecified  level  of  wealth,  is  not  plausibly  related  to  the \nGovernment’s  stated  objective  of  “addressing  the  challenges  facing  our  healthcare  system, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  61 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 65 of 100\nincluding protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.”  \n84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. \n156.  As noted above, the Proclamation’s broad suspension on entry, combined with its \nlimited array of “approved health insurance” options, effectively incentivizes—if not requires—\nmost prospective immigrants to purchase non-comprehensive visitor insurance or short-term \nlimited duration insurance to satisfy the Proclamation’s requirements. This is because the vast \nmajority  of  immigrants  entering  the  United  States  have  historically  been  family-based  visa \napplicants, who would not have access to “approved” employer-based insurance before entering \nthe United States and obtaining work authorization. Many of the other “approved health insurance” \nplans under the Proclamation (i.e., Medicare, TRICARE, family members’ plans, and catastrophic \nand “unsubsidized” ACA plans) are not practically or legally available to most prospective \nimmigrants  outside  of  the  country.  Even  for  employment-based  visa  applicants,  employer-\nsponsored insurance is far from guaranteed, as the vast majority of employers impose a waiting \nperiod before employees can be participate in employer-sponsored coverage, with waiting periods \nlasting 1.9 months on average.51 Visitors insurance and STLDI plans are, as a practical matter, the \nonly options realistically available to most would-be immigrants, and those will generally not be \navailable to cover preexisting conditions.  \n157.   These options, however, provide extremely limited coverage and would likely \nleave individuals underinsured or uninsured for common needs such as prescription drugs, to say \n \n51 2018 Employer Health Benefits Survey, KAISER FAMILY FUND (Oct. 3, 2018) \nhttps://www.kff.org/report-section/2018-employer-health-benefits-survey-section-3-employee-\ncoverage-eligibility-and-participation/  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  62 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 66 of 100\nnothing of hospitalization or emergency care.52 The Proclamation, moreover, requires prospective \nimmigrants to purchase such coverage for the maximum time period allowed, 364 days.53 Once \nthat 364-day period expires, the immigrant would not be able to switch immediately to a regular, \ncomprehensive plan, regardless of whether she wanted to and had the resources to do so, with or \nwithout financial assistance: instead, the immigrant would be required to wait until the next regular \nopen enrollment period (November 1 through December 15 each year) to change coverage. \nAllowing and in fact encouraging the entry of immigrants covered by visitor and STLDI plans, \nand requiring that coverage for their first year in a new country or likely longer, contravenes the \nProclamation’s goal of reducing uncompensated costs associated with uninsured health care. \n158.  In fact, although the Proclamation highlights the $35 billion in uncompensated care \ncosts incurred by this nation’s hospitals, the American Hospital Association (“AHA”) criticized \nSTLDI plans earlier this year when the Trump Administration proposed a new rule to make STLDI \nplans more available and longer in duration. The AHA warned that STLDI products “could end up \ncosting a patient far more by covering fewer benefits and ensuring fewer critical protections, like \ncovering pre-existing conditions,” such that patients “could find themselves responsible for their \nentire medical bill without any help from their ‘health plan.’”54 Accordingly, “[f]or providers, \n \n52 Karen Pollitz et al., Understanding Short-Term Limited Duration Health Insurance, KAISER \nFAMILY FUND (Apr. 23, 2018) https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/understanding-\nshort-term-limited-duration-health-insurance/; \nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/short-term-health-plan-gaps-and-limits-leave-\npeople-risk  \n53 As noted above, see FN 51, STLDI plans lasting 364 days are only available in about half the \nstates. \n54 https://www.aha.org/press-releases/2018-08-01-aha-statement-final-rule-short-term-limited-\nduration-health-insurance  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  63 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 67 of 100\n[STLDI] products will lead to increased bad debt, with underinsured patients unable to afford the \ncare they need but that is not covered,” and “[i]ncreased bad debt will further strain hospitals’ and \nhealth systems’ ability to provide a full range of services to their patients and communities, \nincluding the most vulnerable.”55 Other commenters to the final rule warned increasing the \navailability of STLDI plans that “are not qualifying health plans mandated to cover the essential \nbenefits  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act”  could  “lead  to  an  increased  reliance  on  emergency \ndepartments as consumers delay or do not seek primary care.”56 If President Trump sincerely \nwished  to  address  the  problem  of  uncompensated  care  costs  borne  by  hospitals,  especially \n“uncompensated emergency care costs” incurred by emergency rooms, driving new immigrants \ntowards STLDI and similar non-comprehensive plans like visitor insurance is not a reasonable \nsolution. \n159.  The Proclamation likewise fails to address why the Trump Administration, after \nlaboring for a year to repeal the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act and celebrating \nthat repeal of the penalty associated with that statutory mandate for almost two years since, has \nnow identified the “burdens of uncompensated care” for uninsured individuals as a problem that \nmust be alleviated by imposing the individual mandate (and a stark penalty of inadmissibility into \nthe  country  for  failure  to  comply)  specifically  and  solely  on  newly  arriving  immigrants—\nnotwithstanding the fact that only 11% of uninsured individuals in this country are immigrants, \nwhile 75% of uninsured individuals are citizens. \n \n55 Id. \n56 Rick Pollack, AHA Statement on Final Rule on Short-Term, Limited-Duration Health \nInsurance Plans, AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (Aug. 1, 2018) https://www.aha.org/press-\nreleases/2018-08-01-aha-statement-final-rule-short-term-limited-duration-health-insurance  \nhttps://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/increase-uncompensated-hospital-care-could-be-\none-effect-short-term-coverage-rule  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  64 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 68 of 100\n160.  Although the President’s authority to suspend entry under § 1182(f) may be broad, \nit is not absolute—especially not when the exercise of that authority does not comply with either \nthe text of the statutory provision and is patently unrelated in any rational fashion to its stated \nobjective.  \nB.  The Proclamation Does Not Pass Muster Under Equal Protection \n161.  The President’s § 1182(f) powers, moreover, do not give him license to run \nroughshod over the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. From the time he announced his \ncandidacy through his entire tenure in the White House, President Trump has openly expressed \nantipathy toward not only all noncitizens, but also specifically toward immigrants seeking to come \nto the United States—particularly immigrants of color, including those from countries such as \nMexico, Haiti, and Nigeria, and regions such as Central and Latin America, Africa, and the Middle \nEast. The Proclamation is but the latest in an iterative string of attempts to deny immigrant visas \nto foreign nationals on the basis of their national origin or race—a motivation President Trump \nhas expressed since he was a candidate.   \n162.  Indeed, in the same speech in which he announced his presidential bid, then-\ncandidate Trump declared: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re \nnot sending you. They’re not sending you.” Rather, he warned his audience, “They’re sending \npeople that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing \ndrugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” And, he added, “They’re not sending us the right \npeople. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  65 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 69 of 100\nand it’s coming probably—probably—from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have \nno protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening.”57 \n163.  Notwithstanding immediate public backlash to his remarks equating all Mexicans \nwith “rapists,” then-candidate Trump doubled down shortly thereafter in an interview on CNN. \nWhen asked about the North American Free Trade Agreement, then-candidate Trump pivoted to \nthe topic of immigration and volunteered: “I love the Mexican people. I do business with the \nMexican people, but you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they’re \nbad. They’re really bad.” He further clarified: “But you have people coming in and I’m not just \nsaying Mexicans, I’m talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists and \nthey’re coming into this country.”58 \n164.  The themes that then-candidate Trump presented in these early statements of his \ncandidacy have recurred in his public remarks about immigrants ever since. He has repeatedly and \nconsistently associated immigrants with crime and a lack of national security.59 He has repeatedly \nand consistently presented immigrants as not only undesirable to this country,60 but also different \n \n57 Full text: Donald Trump Announces a Presidential Bid, WASH.

While  criticizing  family-based  preferences  and  the  diversity  visa  lottery  as \n“outdated programs that hurt our national and economic security,”81 President Trump has also \nconsistently advocated for a new, “merit-based” system. Such a system “admits people who are \nskilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our \ncountry”82—in contrast with family-based and diversity immigrants, who are “mostly low-wage \nand low skilled,” and who “come into our country and immediately go onto welfare and stay there \nfor the rest of their lives.”83 President Trump has constantly portrayed merit-based immigrants as \npeople who “have skills, who can support themselves financially, and contribute to our economy,” \nand who will come to the country to “work hard.”84  \n172.

That President Trump divides immigrants into these two categories—undesirable \nfamily-based and diversity immigrants from predominantly non-white countries on the one hand, \nand employment- or “merit-” based immigrants who are either European or at least willing to \n“work hard” on the other—is no surprise in the context of other statements he has made evincing \nracial and nation-based animus grounded in ugly stereotypes.  \n174.

Taken in aggregate, President Trump’s public statements have repeatedly and \nconsistently evinced an animus towards nonwhite immigrants. And since entering the White \nHouse,  President  Trump  has  tried  various  ways  to  effectuate  his  desire  to  limit  nonwhite \nimmigration by limiting family-based and diversity visa immigration. \n176.  Early in his presidency, for example, President Trump championed the RAISE Act, \na bill that “favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and \nwho demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country.”90 \nThe same bill would cut family-based immigration in half by eliminating many currently existing \ncategories for family-sponsored immigration, and by permitting only spouses and minor children \n \n88 Josh Dawsey, Trump Derides Protections for Immigrants from ‘shithole’ Countries, WASH. \nPOST (Jan. 12, 2018) https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-\nimmigrants-from-shithole-countries-in-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-\n91af-31ac729add94_story.html  \n89 Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis, Trump Tells Four Liberal Congresswomen to ‘go back’ to \nTheir Countries, Prompting Pelosi to Defend Them, WASH.

You can’t just come in like in \npast weeks, years, and decades you come in, immediately start picking up welfare.”93 In mid-2017, \nthe RAISE Act failed in the Senate without a vote. \n177.  Around the same time that the Senate passed on voting on the RAISE Act, USCIS \nintroduced the new Public Charge rule, another attempt by the Trump Administration to curtail the \nimmigration of nonwhite individuals entering the country through family-based preferences or the \ndiversity visa. Echoing the point system of the RAISE Act, the Public Charge rule places varying \npositive or negative weights on certain factors that are then assessed in determining whether an \napplicant should be deemed inadmissible on public charge grounds.

The Proclamation follows in the footsteps of the failed RAISE Act and the enjoined \nPublic Charge rule. Like the RAISE Act and the Public Charge rule, the Proclamation has the \npotential to drastically cut family-based immigration. Unlike its predecessors, however, the \nProclamation  is  promulgated  by  presidential  fiat,  and  thus  untethered  to  the  legislative  or \nadministrative rulemaking processes. But although the RAISE Act, the Public Charge rule, and the \nProclamation each takes a different form and function, the intended result of each is the same: to \nreduce immigration from predominantly nonwhite countries. \nTHE PROCLAMATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION HARM PLAINTIFFS \n179.  The Proclamation will go into effect at 12:01 am, Eastern daylight time, on Sunday, \nNovember 3, 2019, and all publicly available information reflects that the State Department has \nbeen taking, and will take, definitive and concrete action to implement and enforce it. The press, \nfor example, has reported that “[m]ore than two dozen health officials are wrestling with highly \ntechnical questions, like which health plans would comply with the new requirements,” and that \nsome are “confused about numerous aspects of the proclamation.”95 Information made publicly \navailable on the State Department’s website, moreover, expressly instructs would-be immigrants \n \n94 Jeanne Batalova et al., Through the Back Door: Remaking the Immigration System via the \nExpected “Public Charge” Rule, MIGRATION POLICY INST.

When implemented and enforced, the Proclamation will cause Plaintiffs [and their \nmembers and clients] substantial, concrete, and particularized injury. The entry suspension of the \nProclamation is indefinite; the Proclamation provides no waiver from its suspension; and the \nProclamation provides no way to appeal the denial of a visa due to the Proclamation’s de facto \nwealth test. As a result, the Proclamation will permanently separate close family members and \ninflict irreparable harm.  \n181.  John Doe #1, a U.S. citizen, can no longer work due to a disability.

But he fears that his wife will not be able to show that she meets the \nProclamation’s health insurance and financial resources requirements at her consular interview. \n182.  John Doe #1 has not worked since May 2018 and had heart surgery in July 2018.  \nHe currently has a pacemaker. Around April 2019, he received his Social Security Disability \ndetermination and since he stopped working, Social Security Disability benefits have been his only \nincome source. Both he and his son have health insurance through the Oregon Health Plan, \nOregon’s Medicaid program, but, because he can no longer work, he cannot obtain insurance \nthrough an employer or afford private health insurance.  \n183.  Money is tight in John Doe #1’s family. After receiving approval for his wife’s \nfamily-based  visa  petition  and  her  I-601A  provisional  unlawful  presence,  completing  her \napplication  for  an  immigrant  visa,  submitting  documents  to  the  National  Visa  Center,  and \nscheduling a consulate interview for Wednesday, November 6, 2019 in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, \nMexico, John Doe #1 thought that his wife would finally become a legal resident and would be \nable to work. He thought his family would finally be able to breathe a financial sigh of relief after \nenduring a significant medical hardship, as well as anxiety about her legal status.  \n184.  But then they received news of the Proclamation. John Doe #1 does not believe that \nhis wife will be eligible to receive a visa now; she does not have health insurance and they do not \nhave sufficient financial resources, especially after his disability, to afford health insurance for her \nor pay her foreseeable health insurance costs. \n185.  The Proclamation will be destructive to John Doe #1’s family in many ways. He \ncannot imagine living apart from his wife. He and their son depend on her.  Their son suffers from \nhealth complications and is currently in the hospital. Given his own health issues, John Doe #1 \ncannot care for his son by himself; he needs his wife. If granted a visa, she could work to support \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  77 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 81 of 100\nthe family financially since John Doe #1 cannot work himself. Due to the significant medical issues \nfacing John Doe #1 and his son, he does not know what he would do if his wife goes to her \nNovember 6th interview and her visa is denied.  \n186.  Juan Ramon Morales, a U.S. citizen, would be able to enroll his wife, Vianca \nMorales, as a dependent in his employer’s health insurance plan, but the Proclamation makes both \nthis and the prospect of acquiring an immigrant visa for her his impossible.   \n187.  Mr. Morales’s employer told him that they could not add his wife as a dependent \non his health insurance plan unless she obtained a Social Security Number; once she does so, she \ncan be added. But she cannot do so until she receives legal status in the United States, and the \nProclamation requires that she show proof, which she cannot obtain, that she would be enrolled in \nhealth insurance within 30 days of her admission into the United States.  Through his research, \nMr. Morales learned that Social Security Numbers and “Green Cards” are typically not mailed \nquickly enough to arrive within 30 days after admission to the U.S. is granted.  Thus, even though \nMr. Morales would be able to enroll his wife in health insurance were she to receive permanent \nresidence, the Proclamation’s stringent requirements make it impossible. \n188.  Nor could the Morales family afford to purchase health insurance for Ms. Morales \nor her foreseeable medical expenses. Ms. Morales, who has lived in the U.S. since 2006, is \ndiagnosed with leukemia and has had emergency brain surgery. She also is epileptic and suffers \nfrom seizures. To manage these, she pays for prescription medicine out of pocket. Mr. Morales \nlikewise currently has significant medical costs; he carries significant debt due to back surgery he \nhad. Mr. Morales’ daughter, a U.S. citizen, and his step-daughter, a legal permanent resident, both \nhave subsidized health insurance that costs approximately $30 per month. Mr. Morales has \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  78 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 82 of 100\nresearched health insurance options to cover his wife, but has not found any available plans that \nhe could afford.  \n189.  When Mr. Morales first learned about the Proclamation, he felt tremendous anxiety \nand despair. Mr. Morales and his family had already gone through a long and laborious journey to \nget to where they are today in the immigrant visa process: they had their I-130 petition approved \nin July 2017; Ms. Morales filed a provisional unlawful presence waiver application in May 2018 \nbased on the extreme hardship Mr. Morales would suffer if she could not be able to obtain \npermanent residence in the U.S, and the application was approved in April 2019; Ms. Morales had \ncompleted all of the other required steps of the Consular Process; and now the family was waiting \nfor her interview to be scheduled in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. If his wife is denied permanent \nresidency, Mr. Morales and his children will suffer extreme psychological, emotional, financial, \nand physical hardship. It was while waiting for this interview that the Morales family first heard \nabout the Proclamation. Given the strict 30 day timeline, Ms. Morales’ health conditions, and Mr. \nMorales’ limited financial resources, Mr. Morales does not believe that Ms. Morales will have \nhealth insurance, that she will be able to prove that she will be able to obtain health insurance 30 \ndays after her admittance into the U.S., or that she will be able to afford foreseeable medical costs \nat the time of her visa interview. \n190.  As part of Ms. Morales’ waiver application, Vianca demonstrated that Mr. Morales \nwould suffer extreme hardship if Ms. Morales’ unlawful presence was not forgiven, including \nextreme psychological, emotional, financial, and physical hardship.  If she is denied an immigrant \nvisa, Mr. Morales would be separated from the love of his life and would have to raise his daughters \nalone. The thought that Ms. Morales may be denied her immigrant visa—and thus indefinitely \nseparated from him—has caused Mr. Morales significant stress.   \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  79 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 83 of 100\n191.

Her experiences as a victim of domestic abuse, a single mother, and an immigrant \nto the United States have often made Jane Doe #2 feel very alone. She particularly misses her \nparents. She has been living apart from her 59-year old parents, who live in Nicaragua, for 13 \nyears. This separation has been exceptionally painful. She can only communicate with her parents \ntwice a week, at most, because they live in a remote location.  It has been extremely stressful and \ndistressing to Jane Doe #2 to have experienced domestic violence without being able to turn to her \nparents for help. And the fact that they have not been able to witness the beautiful moments—like \nthe birth of her children—breaks her heart. Not only has she been separated from her parents, but \nher children have never met their grandparents. Jane Doe #2 sponsored two immigrant visas for \nher parents to reunite with them in the United States to change that.  \n193.  On or around December 19, 2018, Jane Doe #2 applied for her parents to come to \nthe United States. The visa petitions were approved on or around July 9, 2019.  Her parents have \nreceived the requisite letters from the National Visa Centers to proceed with the Consular Process. \nHer family is currently collecting information and documents to submit the DS-260 and immigrant \ndocuments. They were waiting for their interview when they heard news of the Proclamation.  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  80 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 84 of 100\n194.  When she heard about the Proclamation, Jane Doe #2 felt crushed. She cannot \nexplain the feeling of going through so many awful moments in her life and finally obtaining some \nhope of a light at the end of the tunnel by the possibility of reuniting with her family, only to have \nthat hope ripped away from her by the Proclamation. \n195.  Currently, Jane Doe #2’s parents do not have health insurance. They go to clinics \nin Nicaragua for their medical needs. As a single mother of two, Jane Doe #2’s financial resources \nare limited. She has searched for an available health insurance option for them that she could \nafford, but has not been successful and does not believe an “approved” and available insurance \noption is affordable. \n196.  Jane Doe #3, a U.S. citizen, can no longer work due to a disability, which also \nmakes it difficult for her to keep up with household tasks. After being separated from her husband \nfor almost two years, she hopes that having her husband, a German citizen, with her in the U.S. \nwill make things better. Living apart has been miserable for Jane Doe #3. Although they talk often, \nshe rarely gets to see her husband, and she needs to incur debt whenever she goes to visit him in \nGermany. Having her husband in the U.S. would help in almost every way. But she now believes \nthat her husband will not be able to meet the new requirements that the Proclamation created.  \n197.  Jane Doe #3 met her husband in Los Angeles in 2006, and they were married in \nFebruary 2018. After getting married, they decided to settle in the U.S. instead of Germany because \nof Jane Doe #3’s desire to stay close to her family. She lives nearby her immediate family, and is \nespecially thankful to be able to leave near her grandmother, who is a Holocaust survivor. \nAccordingly, she filed an immigrant visa petition for her husband in July 2018, and he returned to \nGermany so that he would not overstay his visitor visa. The I-130 petition was approved in April \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  81 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 85 of 100\n2019, and since then, they have been gathering documents required for consular processing and \nlooking forward to the time when they can be reunited.  \n198.  The Proclamation has forced them to put their plans for a future together on hold. \nJane Doe #3 does not know how her husband will be able to prove at a consular interview that he \nwill have approved health insurance within 30 days of entering the United States. Jane Doe #3 is \ncurrently enrolled in California’s Medicaid program and she cannot add her husband to this \ncoverage.  \n199.  While her husband likely has good employment prospects in Los Angeles—he is \nan architect who currently teaches architectural theory and design and he speaks both English and \nGerman fluently—it is extremely difficult for him to secure employment without knowing when \nhe will enter the United States. Even if he were to be able to obtain insurance through an employer, \nhe would almost certainly not be able to secure such employment at the time of his consular \ninterview. Furthermore, his current German health insurance will not cover him when he moves \nto the United States. In the past, when he has visited Jane Doe #3, he purchased traveler’s \ninsurance, but it is his understanding that he would also not be eligible to receive such insurance \nif he moves permanently to the U.S. Doe’s husband has multiple sclerosis, and his treatments are \nexpensive. She believes that she and her husband do not have the financial resources to afford \nhealth insurance for him or to pay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket. \n200.  Iris Angelina Castro, a U.S. citizen, is currently pregnant with her second child \nand separated from her husband, Hermogenes Castro Molina, a national and resident of the \nDominican Republic. She wishes to reunite with her husband in the United States because when \nher first son became very ill, she was forced to quit her job to take care of him, and she is now \nunemployed with no income source. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  82 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 86 of 100\n201.  Ms. Castro was previously employed as a teacher, but she has since lost all her \nbenefits when she stopped working to stay at home with her first son. Having Mr. Molina here in \nthe United States will help their whole family; he can work while she cares for the children.  \n202.  Ms. Castro filed an immigrant petition for her husband on November 14, 2018, \nwhich was approved on May 30, 2019. They have since been filing all the required documents so \nthat they can schedule a consular interview.  \n203.  News of the Proclamation devastated Ms. Castro. Because she is unemployed, she \ndoes not believe that they have sufficient financial resources to prove that Mr. Castro would be \nable to obtain health insurance within 30 days of his entry into the U.S. or pay for foreseeable \nmedical costs. She has already been living apart from her husband for almost a year and that \nseparation has been exceptionally painful. Furthermore, she is pregnant with their first child \ntogether. It is painful for her to think that her daughter’s father will not be here for her birth and \nthat she will have to raise her daughter without her father. Without him and his potential financial \nsupport, she believes that she will be forced to use public benefits for survival. \n204.  Blake Doe, a U.S. citizen and senior college student at Oregon State University, \nlived with his parents, Mexican citizens, in Oregon from the time he was born until he went to \ncollege. His parents are amazing people, and he aspires to live up to the values of compassion, \nhard work, and responsibility that they have always tried to instill in him. Due to their sacrifices, \nBlake Doe will be the first person in his family to graduate from college in June 2020. He has \napproved I-130 petitions for his parents, but they are afraid that if they leave the country for their \nconsular interview, they will be banned from coming back under the Proclamation. \n205.  Blake Doe is seeking to permanently unify his family in Oregon because it is where \nhe has lived his whole life. He sponsored immigrant visas for his parents on or around April 17, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  83 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 87 of 100\n2017, and on or around January 17, 2018, their I-I30 petitions were approved. On June 11, 2019, \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined that members of his \nfamily would suffer an extreme hardship if his parents’ visas were denied, and accordingly, \napproved an extreme hardship waiver so that his parents could complete the immigration process. \nHis parents are currently waiting to have an interview scheduled at the Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, \nMexico.  \n206.  Blake  Doe’s  mother’s  health  has  declined  recently.  She  has  two  painful \nconditions—rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. She currently pays for medical care out \nof pocket; her treatment is necessary to allow her to live without pain. She has tried to obtain health \ninsurance, but has been told she is ineligible due to her immigration status. Blake Doe’s father has \ntried to obtain health insurance for her, but has not been successful. Through research, Blake Doe \nhas found that it would be very expensive for him to obtain health insurance for his mother and \nfather. \n207.  As a full-time college student, Blake Doe has no income and has about $20,000 \nworth of student loan debt. He cannot afford health insurance for his parents. Therefore, Blake \nDoe does not believe that he has sufficient financial resources to prove that his parents would be \nable to obtain approved health insurance within 30 days of their admittance into the U.S. or pay \nfor foreseeable medical costs. \n208.  Given that the Proclamation has no waiver or termination date, Blake Doe is \nresigned to the fact that his parents will not be able to complete the immigration process. He \nbelieves that they will continue to live in fear and that he will continue to live in fear every day of \npermanent separation from his parents. This fear is causing him feelings of depression and makes \nhim constantly worried. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  84 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 88 of 100\n209.  Brenda Villarruel, a U.S. citizen, and her minor son, who is a United States \ncitizen, have been separated from her husband and the child’s step-father, for almost two years. \nShe now fears that the Proclamation will make that separation permanent. \n210.  Ms. Villarruel is employed as a licensed medical assistant, but does not have health \ninsurance through her work and pays out of pocket for medical services when necessary.  Ms. \nVillarruel has sponsored her husband, who currently resides in Mexico City, Mexico, for an \nimmigrant visa and, after receiving an approved waiver, has been scheduled for his final immigrant \ninterview on November 5, 2019.   \n211.  Ms. Villarruel needs her husband, Mr. Gabino Soriano Castellanos, in the United \nStates so that he can rejoin their thriving tattoo business and continue to be the father and caretaker \nof their son, who has battled depression due to the separation from the only father he has ever \nknown.  News  of  the  Proclamation  has  devastated  the  entire  family.  Ms.  Villarruel,  having \nresearched the costs of approved insurance, does not believe that the family has sufficient financial \nresources to prove that she and Mr. Castellanos would be able to obtain approved health insurance \nto comply with the President’s Proclamation within 30 days of Mr. Castellanos admittance into \nthe U.S. or pay for foreseeable medical costs.   \n212.  This is a time when Ms. And Mr. Castellanos should be building their thriving \ntattoo business and raising their son. Instead, they live in fear of living apart from each other \nindefinitely and being financially wiped-out due to the family separation. \n213.  Latino Network functions as an “immigration services navigator” to educate \nclients and connect them with legal-services providers who can assist with obtaining immigrant \nvisas for family members, and provides information to low- and moderate-income immigrant \nfamilies about options for health-care benefits. The Proclamation has and will continue to \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  85 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 89 of 100\nseverely restrict and frustrate Latino Network’s ability to fulfill its objectives of counseling and \nreferring low- and moderate-income immigrants to services that will enable them to obtain \nadequate health-care benefits.  \n214.  The Proclamation has forced and will continue to force Latino Network to divert \nsignificant resources: to identify viable health-care options for members who need to comply \nwith the Proclamation; to retrain Latino Network staff members, who had been previously \ntrained to help members find free, low-cost, or subsidized health-care plans, and who must now \nlearn to help members navigate the Proclamation’s terms; and to develop and publish \ninformation materials to inform our community. Latino Network’s need to devote resources to \nrespond to the Proclamation and mitigate its effects on the Portland Latino community \nnecessarily limit the resources available to carry out its core services and programs, and frustrate \nits ability to carry out its organizational purpose. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n215.  Individual Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), on behalf of themselves and all other persons for whom \nDefendants’ implementation of the Proclamation interferes with family reunification or the \nprocessing of their visa petitions in a manner consistent with applicable law. The individual \nplaintiffs seek certification of a class (the “Plaintiff Class”) consisting of:  \na.  Individuals in the United States who currently have an approved or pending petition \nto the United States government to sponsor a noncitizen family member for an \nimmigrant visa, or who will soon file such a petition; and whose sponsored family \nmember is subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to a consular \nofficer’s satisfaction that he or she “will be covered by approved health insurance” \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  86 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 90 of 100\nwithin 30 days after entry or will be able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts.” (“U.S. Petitioner Subclass”) \nb.  Individuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for or will soon apply \nto the United States government for an immigrant visa; (ii) are otherwise eligible \nto be granted the visa; but (iii) are subject to the Proclamation and unable to \ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of a consular officer that they “will be covered by \napproved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be able “to pay for \nreasonably foreseeable medical costs.” (“Visa Applicant Subclass”) \n216.  This action meets all of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites for maintaining a class action. \n217.  The Plaintiff Class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable, satisfying Rule \n23(a)(1).  Analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, based on data from the Census Bureau’s \n2014-16 American Community Survey (“ACS”), indicates that roughly 375,000 immigrants, \nmainly family-based immigrants, would be affected by the Proclamation each year.  In addition, \nthe class action is the only appropriate procedural avenue for the protections of the class members’ \nconstitutional rights and rights under the APA. \n218.  The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law, including \nwhether the Defendants’ Proclamation and its implementation exceeds the statutory authority \nprovided Defendants by the Immigration and Nationality Act; violates Plaintiff Class members’ \nrights under the APA; and violates Plaintiff Class members’ rights under the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n219.  The claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of fact, including, \nbut not limited to: \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  87 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 91 of 100\na.  whether the Proclamation and Defendants’ actions taken to implement it were \nmotivated by racial animus, sought to reduce immigration by people of color, or \nwere otherwise based on the race, ethnicity, and/or national origin of the individuals \naffected; \nb.  whether Defendants fail to address the Proclamation’s discriminatory impact; \nc.  whether, in issuing and implementing the Proclamation, Defendants relied on \nfactors Congress did not intend for it to consider; \nd.  whether,  in  issuing  and  implementing  the  Proclamation,  Defendants  failed  to \nconsider important aspects of the problem it is addressing; \ne.  whether, in issuing and implementing the Proclamation, Defendants explained its \ndecision counter to the evidence before it; \nf.  whether Defendants quantified or considered harms that would result from the \nProclamation and its implementation; \ng.  whether Defendants failed to follow required procedures, including notice and \nopportunity  for  public  comment,  before  issuing  and  implementing  the \nProclamation; \nh.  whether the Proclamation’s requirements are, in practice, irrational, vague and \nunworkable, rendering impossible the uniform application of the laws or review of \ndecisions for consistency with facts and evidence; \ni.  whether the Proclamation is being or will be enforced so as either to prevent class \nmembers from reuniting here in the United States, or to force their separation when \na noncitizen family member must leave the country for a consular interview. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  88 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 92 of 100\nj.  whether class members have suffered harm as a result of the Proclamation and \nDefendants’ actions taken to implement it. \n220.  Because the claims of the Plaintiff Class members share common issues of law and \nfact, they will not require individualized determinations of the circumstances to any plaintiff, and \nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2). \n221.  The claims or defenses of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the members of the Plaintiff Class, satisfying Rule 23(a)(3). Like other members of the class, \nthe Plaintiffs have been harmed, among other things, by Defendants’ failure to lawfully abide by \nstatutory limitations on their actions.  They have further been harmed by Defendants’ failure to \nproceed through proper notice-and-comment and other required procedures when issuing and \nimplementing its Proclamation, thereby leading to arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful action that \nfails to account for important aspects of the supposed problems it is addressing.  They have further \nbeen harmed by Defendants’ failure adequately to explain its decision to issue the Proclamation \nor describe its implementation in a manner that it may reasonably be followed by those it affects.  \nThey have been harmed by Defendants’ premising the Proclamation and its implementation on \nracial animus in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.  Each of \nthese actions, independently and collectively, have caused harm to Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff \nClass members. \n222.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Plaintiff \nClass, satisfying Rule 23(a)(4).  The named Plaintiffs will defend the rights of all proposed class \nmembers fairly and adequately, and have no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic \nto the interests of the Plaintiff Class.  The attorneys representing the named Plaintiffs include \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  89 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 93 of 100\nexperienced civil rights and immigration attorneys who are considered able practitioners in \nfederal constitutional litigation.  These attorneys should be appointed as class counsel.  \n223.  The members of the proposed class are readily ascertainable through Defendants’ \nrecords. \n224.  Through implementation and enforcement of the Proclamation at the center of the \nPlaintiff Class’s allegations, Defendants have acted, have threatened to act, and will act on \ngrounds  generally  applicable  to  the  Plaintiff  Class,  thereby  making  final  injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.  The Plaintiff Class may therefore by \nproperly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  \n225.  Prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Plaintiff Class would \ncreate  the  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying  adjudications  and  would  establish  incompatible \nstandards of conduct for individual members of the Plaintiff Class. The Plaintiff Class may \ntherefore by properly certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1). \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act)  \n(On behalf of All Plaintiffs, including the Class) \n226.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n227.  The Proclamation will go into effect on November, 3, 2019. Defendants have stated \nthat they will begin implementing the Proclamation on this date in the manner described on the \nState Department’s website. \n228.  Defendants have taken actions to implement the Proclamation, including informing \nvisa applicants and consular officials of new requirements effective November 3, 2019, that will \nresult in a direct impact on the rights of qualified prospective immigrants and constitute final \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  90 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 94 of 100\nagency action(s) within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. See Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. 154 (1997). \n229.  Defendants’ actions constitute violations of the APA in at least the following \nrespects: \na.  Defendants failed to reasonably justify their departure from settled practice. \nb.  Defendants failed to address conflicts with other laws and legislative intent, \nincluding but not limited to the specific scheme Congress mandated in the INA \nthrough provisions such within 8 U.S.C. § 1151; 8 U.S.C. § 1153; 8 U.S.C § \n1182; 8 U.S.C § 1182; 8 U.S.C § 1154; 8 USC § 1186; 8 U.S.C. § 245, and \nnumerous health care laws, such as the ACA, PRWORA, CHIP and CHIPRA, and \nnumerous regulations duly promulgated under these and other laws. \nc.  Defendants implemented the Proclamation in a manner that is not “consistent with \napplicable law” for reasons including that their actions replaced a statutory \ntotality of the circumstances test for public charge with a new test that is vague, \narbitrary, and unsupported by the evidence. \nd.  Defendants’ implementation of the Proclamation is pretextual because Defendants \nseek to reduce immigration by people of color. \ne.  Defendants fail to address the Proclamation’s discriminatory impact. \nf.  Defendants did not quantify or consider harms that will result. \ng.  Defendants states requirements that are irrational, vague and unworkable, \nrendering impossible the uniform application of the laws or review of decisions \nfor consistency with facts and evidence. \nh.  Defendants acted in excess of statutory authority. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  91 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 95 of 100\ni.  Defendants’ actions exceed the delegation of statutory authority to the President \nin U.S.C. § 1182(f) for reasons including that Congress did not delegate \nunfettered discretion to indefinitely rewrite the immigration or health care laws, \nallow for suspensions that are unconstitutional and/or unsupported by adequate \nfindings, create permanent and specific classes of inadmissibility, or eliminate the \nopportunity for visa applicants’ opportunity to show that they are unlikely to \nbecome a “public charge” by the terms Congressional mandated. \nj.  Defendants’ actions implement the Proclamation in a manner that is not consistent \nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) for reasons including that it replaces Congress’ \nspecific scheme for assessing who may become a “public charge,” and when \nadmission may be authorized for those who cannot show they are unlikely to \nbecome a public charge. \nk.  Defendants violate their own rules and regulations and binding norms to the \nprejudice of others.  See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. \n260 (1954). \nl.  Defendants failed to follow required procedures including notice and opportunity \nfor public comment, particularly with respect to the Posting and Emergency \nNotice. \n230.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are based on legal error; fail to \nconsider all relevant factors; and lack a rational explanation, and are therefore arbitrary and \ncapricious and an abuse of discretion, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  92 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 96 of 100\n231.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are contrary to constitutional \nrights, discriminating on the basis of national origin and race, thereby violating the equal \nprotection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n232.  Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation are ultra vires and in excess of \nany authority granted by the Proclamation, regulation, or statute, and not otherwise in accordance \nwith law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n233.   Defendants’ actions implementing the Proclamation affect Plaintiffs’ substantive \nrights and were made without observance of procedure required by law in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n234.  Defendants’ action are without good cause. \n235.  Defendants’ violation of the APA causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs. \n236.  Plaintiffs have no adequate alternative to immediate review under the APA. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Equal Protection) \n(On behalf of Resident Plaintiffs/U.S. Petitioners Subclass) \n237.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n238.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment states that no person will “be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n239.  The  Fifth  Amendment  prohibits  Defendants  from  intentionally  discriminating \nagainst Plaintiffs and Class Members based on race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. \n240.  The Proclamation and Defendants’ actions taken to implement the Proclamation \nare unconstitutional because they burden a fundamental right of Plaintiffs and Class Members \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  93 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 97 of 100\nand were motivated by intentional discrimination and/or animus based on race, ethnicity, and/or \nnational origin. \n241.  The Proclamation furthers no legitimate purpose, let alone a compelling one. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Ultra Vires) \n(On behalf of All Plaintiffs, including the Class) \n242.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein.  \n243.  The Proclamation is illegal and is therefore ultra vires. \n244.  Courts “ordinarily presume that Congress intends the executive to obey its statutory \ncommands and, accordingly, that it expects the courts to grant relief when an executive agency \nviolates such a command.”  Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, \n681 (1986). \n245.  The President’s attempt to indefinitely ban certain immigrants based on the inability \nto obtain specific types of health insurance or pay for medical care, and to create a new ground \nof inadmissibility that Congress has previously considered and chosen not to include in the INA, \nexceeds Congress’s delegated power to the President's power to suspend the entry of noncitizens \nand issue reasonable rules for the entry of noncitizens. \n246.  The President’s attempt to ban certain immigrants based on the inability to obtain \nspecific types of health insurance or pay for medical care violates constitutional separation of \npowers  principles  because  it  contravenes  Congress’s  expressed  intent  to  provide  a  certain \nminimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants and citizens in the United States and to extend \ncertain health care-related benefits to legal immigrants. \n   \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  94 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 98 of 100\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Procedural Due Process) \n(On behalf of Resident Plaintiffs/U.S. Petitioners Subclass) \n247.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n248.  The  Proclamation  state  that  an  individual  seeking  an  immigrant  visa  must \ndemonstrate, “to a consular officer’s satisfaction,” that she either “will be covered by approved \nhealth insurance” within 30 days of her entry to the United States, or “possesses the financial \nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The Emergency Notice and Posting \npublished by the Department of States confirm that consular officers will be questioning visa \napplicants  and  asking  for  medical  and  financial  documentation.  The  Emergency  Notice, \nfurthermore, specifies that “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses” are “those expenses related \nto existing medical conditions, relating to health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.” \n249.  A prospective immigrant’s entry to the United States therefore depends on a \ndetermination made by a consular officer with no medical training to accurately assess existing \nmedical conditions and health issues existing at the time of the visa adjudication.     \n250.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides \nthat “[n]o person . . . shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n251.  Congress has created statutory rights related to the petitioning for and issuance of \nvisas and other immigration benefits.  \n252.  Federal agencies have created regulatory rights related to the petitioning for and \nissuance of visas and other immigration benefits. \n253.  Individuals must be given due process prior to the deprivation of these statutory \nand regulatory rights. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  95 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 1    Filed 10/30/19    Page 99 of 100\n254.  Additionally,  United  States  citizens  and  lawful  permanent  residents  have \nconstitutionally protected liberty interests in family reunification. Individuals must be given due \nprocess prior to any deprivation of these liberty interests. \n255.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, deprive individuals, including Plaintiffs and \ntheir members or clients, of the aforementioned statutory and regulatory rights, and liberty \ninterests, without due process. \n256.

The government requests an emergency temporary stay of\nthe district court's order preliminarily enjoining Presidential Proclamation No. 9945,\nSuspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States\nHealth Care System, pending consideration of the motion for a stay pending appeal.\nThe government also seeks a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The\nplaintiffs oppose both motions. A temporary stay in this context (sometimes referred to\nas an administrative stay) is only intended to preserve the status quo until the\nsubstantive motion for a stay pending appeal can be considered on the merits, and does\nnot constitute in any way a decision as to the merits of the motion for stay pending\nappeal. Here, the status quo would be disrupted by granting the temporary stay request.\nTherefore, we deny the request for a temporary stay. The Proclamation has not yet\ngone into effect. The changes it would make to American immigration policy are\nmajor and unprecedented; the harms the government alleges it will suffer pending\nreview of the motion for stay pending appeal are long−term rather than immediate.\nOur ruling is based solely on the absence of a sufficient exigency to justify changing\nthe status quo, particularly during the few weeks before scheduled oral argument on\nthe merits of the emergency motion; we do not consider the merits of the dispute in\nany respect. By this order we are expediting briefing and oral argument on the\nemergency motion and anticipate an expeditious issuance of a decision following\nargument. Any government reply to plaintiffs' opposition to the motion for stay\npending appeal is due December 23, 2019. The parties are directed to appear for oral\nargument on the motion for stay pending appeal on Thursday, January 9, 2020, at\n10:00 am in San Francisco, California. Each side will be allotted 20 minutes of\nargument time. The parties are encouraged to appear in person if possible. If any party\nwishes to appear by video, that party must notify Kwame Copeland, 415.355.7888, no\nlater than Friday, January 3, 2020, and must coordinate with Mr. Copeland in making\nsuitable arrangements for an appearance by video. The opening brief and excerpts of\nrecord are due January 2, 2020; the answering brief is due January 30, 2020 or 28 days\nafter service of the opening brief, whichever is earlier; and the optional reply brief is\ndue within 21 days after service of the answering brief. This case will be assigned to\nthe next available oral argument panel for a decision on the merits of the appeal.

We direct the Clerk of Court to expedite the appeal (SEE\nORDER FOR FULL TEXT). In sum, the government has not established the requisite\nirreparable harm necessary to justify a stay pending appeal. Its rights may be\nvindicated upon completion of this litigation. The alleged monetary harms to third\nparties upon which the government relies do not constitute irreparable harm. While\nthat sole factor is dispositive, we also conclude that the government did not meet its\nhigh burden to satisfy the other Nken factors. It has not demonstrated likelihood of\nsuccess. Staying the injunction would injure both the plaintiff class and third parties,\nand the public interest weighs against entering a stay. The preliminary injunction\npreserves the status quo during the pendency of this appeal. The district court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining the scope of the preliminary injunction. For these\nreasons, we deny the motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. We do\nnot prejudge the consideration of the merits appeal. MOTION DENIED.

Of Attorneys for \nDefendants. \n \nMichael H. Simon, District Judge. \n \nOn October 4, 2019, the President of the United States issued Proclamation No. 9945, \ntitled “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will \nFinancially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”). The \nPAGE 1 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 2 of 37\n \nProclamation requires certain immigrants to show proof of health insurance or sufficient \nfinancial resources to pay for the costs of anticipated health care before those immigrants may \nqualify for immigrant visas. On October 30, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their putative class action \ncomplaint, alleging that: (1) Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”); \n(2) Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process clause’s requirement of equal \nprotection based on race, ethnicity, and national origin; (3) Defendants’ actions are ultra vires, \nincluding that the President’s issuance of the Proclamation violates the separation of powers \ndoctrine and is outside the authority delegated to him in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f); and (4) Defendants \nviolated the Fifth Amendment Due Process clause’s procedural due process guarantee. \n On November 2, 2019, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order, temporarily \nenjoining Defendants from taking any action to implement or enforce the Proclamation through \nNovember 30, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the Court entered a preliminary injunction order, \nenjoining Defendants from taking any action to implement or enforce the Proclamation until the \nCourt resolves this case on the merits. The Court then permitted discovery relating to Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification and allowed supplemental briefing on that motion. Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification is now before the Court. Plaintiffs request certification of two \nsubclasses: (1) a subclass of United States citizens who are petitioners sponsoring a visa for \nfamily members; and (2) a subclass of foreign nationals who are visa applicants. For the reasons \ndiscussed below, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED, with a modest modification of the requested \ndefinition of the subclass of United States citizen petitioners. \nSTANDARDS \nFederal class actions are governed by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nThe plaintiff “must be prepared to prove” that each of the applicable requirements of the rule is \nsatisfied. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). Rule 23 sets forth more than \nPAGE 2 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 3 of 37\n \na “mere pleading standard.” Id. Rule 23 also provides district courts with broader discretion to \ncertify a class than to deny certification. See Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., Inc., 731 F.3d 952, \n956 (9th Cir. 2013).  \nA party seeking class certification must satisfy each of the four requirements of \nRule 23(a) and at least one requirement of Rule 23(b). Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 \nF.3d 538, 542 (9th Cir. 2013). Under Rule 23(a), a district court may certify a class only if:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law and fact common to \nthe class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). In other words, a proposed class must meet the requirements of \nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. Mazza v. Am. Honda \nMotor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 588 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nAlong with the requirements of Rule 23(a), a party seeking to maintain a class action also \nmust “satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule 23(b).” Comcast \nCorp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013). Plaintiffs seek to certify the proposed class under \nRule 23(b)(2) or, alternatively, Rule 23(b)(1)(A). Under Rule 23(b)(2), a class action may \nproceed if “the party opposing the class has acted or refuses to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Under Rule 23(b)(1)(A), a \nclass action may proceed if “prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members \nwould create a risk of: (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class \nmembers that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). \nPAGE 3 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 4 of 37\n \nThe Rule 23 analysis is “rigorous” and may “entail some overlap with the merits of the \nplaintiff’s underlying claim.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351 (quotation marks omitted); \nComcast, 569 U.S. at 33-34.

See An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 \nStat. 214 (1882). Since then, Congress amended the immigration laws several times. In 1952, \nCongress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Congress later significantly \namended this statute when it enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (“INA”). \nAspects of the INA have been amended many times through the passage of other laws, but most \nsignificantly through direct amendments in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the \nImmigration Act of 1990, and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996. \nCongress adopted an immigrant visa system to further four main goals: reunifying \nfamilies, admitting immigrants with skills that are useful to the United States economy, \nprotecting refugees and others in need of humanitarian resettlement, and promoting diversity. \nCongress gave priority, however, to family reunification when it established the current \nimmigration system. The method of allocating visas reflects this goal. The INA authorizes an \nPAGE 4 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 5 of 37\n \nunlimited number of permanent visas to “immediate relatives,” who are defined as “the children, \nspouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States, except that, in the case of parents, such \ncitizens shall be at least 21 years of age.” 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b). These visas are granted regardless \nof country of national origin, even though other visa categories have limits, or caps, based on \ncountry of national origin and total number of allocated visas. Other family-based preference \ncategories, such as those for adult children, siblings, and relatives of Legal Permanent Residents, \nare capped at 480,000 per year (with a statutory minimum of 226,000), as compared to 140,000 \nmaximum annual employment immigrant visas and 55,000 maximum annual diversity immigrant \nvisas. 8 U.S.C. § 1151(c)-(e). Family-based petitions account for 65 percent of immigrant visas \ngranted each year. \nThe first step in both the family-based and employment visa application process is for a \nrelative or employer in the United States to file a sponsorship petition on behalf of the \nprospective immigrant. After the sponsorship petition is approved, the prospective immigrant \napplies for a visa and submits supporting documentation. Thus, this Opinion and Order \nreferences the “petition” (from the sponsoring family member) and the “application” (from the \nimmigrant). These differing terms also are important in the context of the two different proposed \nsubclasses. \nWhen the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) finds the application \ncomplete, the immigrant visa applicant is interviewed. Applicants who are outside the United \nStates must interview at a United States consulate abroad. For applicants who are inside the \nUnited States, some may be eligible to apply for immigrant visas domestically, without having to \ntravel to a consulate, but others must leave the country to appear for a consular interview abroad. \nIndividuals in this latter category include noncitizens who have accrued more than 180 days of \nPAGE 5 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 6 of 37\n \nunlawful presence in the United States but have obtained an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility to \nexcuse the unlawful presence bar under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B). See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e). To \nobtain an I-601A waiver, applicants must show that refusal of admission of the immigrant \napplicant would cause “extreme hardship” to eligible family members. See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 212.7(e)(3)(vi) (incorporating the “extreme hardship” standard of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v)). \nDiversity visas are available through a lottery to individuals from countries with historically low \nrates of immigration to the United States; the lottery winners self-petition and apply to a \nconsulate for their visa. \nAt the interview, the consular officer determines whether the immigrant visa applicant is \neligible for admission to the United States. As part of the INA, Congress established ten \ncategories of “Inadmissible Aliens” who are “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be \nadmitted to the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). If a visa applicant falls into one of these \ncategories, his or her application will be denied. In addition, after listing specific categories of \ninadmissibility, Congress provided that the President may, upon finding that the entry of any \naliens or class of aliens into the United States “would be detrimental to the interests of the United \nStates,” by proclamation suspend the entry of any class of aliens as immigrants or impose on the \nentry of aliens any additional restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Id. § 1182(f). \nIf the consular officer denies the applicant’s immigrant visa at the interview, the applicant \nmay choose to attempt to navigate the complex reconsideration process while remaining outside \nthe United States. When an application is denied, I-601A waivers are automatically revoked. \nApplicants for whom family separation was found by USCIS to create an extreme hardship thus \nwill be separated. They cannot return to the United States until they either obtain reconsideration \nof their visa denial, or obtain a new provisional waiver.  \nPAGE 6 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 7 of 37\n \nB.  Proclamation \n1.  Overview of the Proclamation \nOn October 4, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued the Proclamation. It barred \notherwise qualified legal immigrants, visa applicants primarily seeking reunification with family \nmembers, from entering the United States unless they can show the consular officer that they will \nnot financially burden the United States healthcare system. President Trump directed that the \nProclamation become effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on November 3, 2019. Before \nthe Proclamation went into effect, the Court preliminarily enjoined Defendants from taking any \naction to implement or enforce the Proclamation, first with the Temporary Restraining Order and \nthen with the Preliminary Injunction Order.  \nThe Proclamation estimated “uncompensated [health] care costs” at more than $35 billion \nin each of the last 10 years. The Proclamation measured these costs as “unreimbursed services \nthat hospitals give their patients.” The Proclamation does not explain the source of this figure or \nhow it was calculated. For example, it is not clear whether the underlying “unreimbursed \nservices” costs are the amount billed by hospitals—often much higher than the cost actually paid \nby insurance companies or patients who individually pay their bills—or a “market” figure such \nas an average “allowed amount” that insurance plans would have paid for the care. It is also \nunclear whether all of these “unreimbursed services” are for uninsured persons or whether they \nalso include amounts not paid from insured persons who are unable to pay co-insurance amounts, \nco-pays, or deductibles.  \nThe Proclamation links the burden of “uncompensated care costs” to legal immigrants \nwith a single unsourced sentence: “data show that lawful immigrants are about three times more \nlikely than US citizens to lack health insurance.” Based on this, the President concluded that \nallowing certain otherwise qualified legal immigrants into the United States would “saddle” the \nPAGE 7 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 8 of 37\n \nU.S. healthcare system and the American taxpayer with increased costs. Under the Proclamation, \na visa applicant intending lawfully to immigrate to the United States will presumptively \nfinancially burden the healthcare system and American taxpayers unless the applicant “will be \ncovered by approved health insurance . . . within 30 days of the [applicant’s] entry into the \nUnited States,” or “unless the [applicant] possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable healthcare costs.” \nThe Proclamation does not discuss any data or provide any estimate for how much of the \nestimated $35 billion in “uncompensated costs” stems from recent uninsured legal immigrants or \nhow often recent uninsured legal immigrants use the nation’s healthcare system. On the other \nhand, Plaintiffs provide the opinion of an expert, Dr. Leighton Ku, who has more than 25 years \nof experience as a health policy researcher.1 ECF 54. Dr. Ku opines that recent uninsured \nimmigrants use less than one-tenth of one percent (0.06 percent) of total American medical \nresources and only 0.08 percent of emergency room services. Id. at 10. Moreover, if only legal \nuninsured immigrants were considered (the group included in the Proclamation), the numbers \nwould be even lower. Id. \n2.  Types of Approved Health Insurance and Barriers to Access \nThe Proclamation lists eight types of approved health insurance: (1) employer-sponsored \nplans; (2) “unsubsidized” ACA market plans on state exchanges; (3) Short Term Limited \nDuration Insurance (“STLDI”) plans effective for at least 364 days; (4) catastrophic plans; \n(5) family member plans; (6) TRICARE and the like; (7) visitor health plans effective for at \nleast 364 days; and (8) Medicare. The Proclamation does not clarify what is meant by \n                                                 \n1 Dr. Ku is a Professor of Health Policy and Management and Director of the Center for \nHealth Policy Research at the Milken Institute School of Public Health of George Washington \nUniversity in Washington, D.C. \nPAGE 8 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 9 of 37\n \n“unsubsidized” ACA market plans, but the Court assumes that it refers to plans bought without \nthe help of premium tax credits. \nMany of these approved plans are legally or practically unavailable to intending, or \nprospective, immigrants. Employer-sponsored plans are often not an option for family-based visa \napplicants, who are unlikely to have a job offer waiting before arriving in the United States. \nFamily-based visa applicants have difficulty applying for jobs before entry because when they \nmight receive approval to enter the United States is unknown and approval may take years. Even \nthose fortunate enough to have secured employment may fall short. Most employers impose a \nwaiting period before coverage begins, and the average waiting period is longer than the \nProclamation’s 30-day coverage deadline. Market-rate ACA plans can be prohibitively \nexpensive and have high deductibles. The Proclamation does not explain why “unsubsidized” \nACA plans are allowed yet “subsidized” ACA plans are not.  \nSTLDI plans are banned or restricted in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New \nYork, and Rhode Island. Twenty states have contract term limitations making STLDI plans \nineligible under the Proclamation. Nineteen states limit the contract term to 11 months or less \nand Maine requires that the insurance contract end on December 31st, making it improbable the \ncontract term will last for 364 days. STLDI plans also do not cover essential health benefits and \nare thus unavailable on exchanges. Unlike exchange plans, STDLI plans can deny coverage \nbased on preexisting conditions and impose dollar caps on core coverage.  \nThere are additional barriers to the other “approved” plans. Family-member plans are \nonly available to applicants younger than 27 years old. Visitor’s insurance plans are designed for \nshort-term visits, have caps on individual coverage and lifetime benefits, and often exclude \npreexisting conditions, mental health conditions, and maternity care. Such plans often result in \nPAGE 9 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 10 of 37\n \nsignificant uncompensated care. People who receive insurance through state Medicaid programs \nmay not be able to add their family members to their plan. Catastrophic plans are only available \nto people who are already legally present. Even then, only people under 30 (or who obtain a \nspecial hardship exemption) are eligible to enroll. TRICARE is available only to members of the \nUnited States military and their close relatives. Medicare is perhaps the least feasible option—\nonly intending immigrants older than 65 who have already been living continuously in the \nUnited States for five years may enroll.  \nC.  Named Plaintiffs in this Putative Class Action \n1.  Latino Network \nLatino Network is an organization that provides programs aimed at educating and \nempowering Multnomah County Latinos. The Proclamation has already significantly affected \nLatino Network’s ability to accomplish its mission.  \nLatino Network employs an “Immigration Navigator,” who helps clients move through \nthe complicated immigrant visa process. After the President issued the Proclamation, the \nworkload of Latino Network’s Immigration Navigator ballooned. Normally, the Immigration \nNavigator connects families with low-cost legal services and develops educational workshops on \nimmigration legal services. He has put these duties on hold since the Proclamation was issued \nand has had to postpone individual intake interviews and cancel workshops to serve essentially \nas a consultant on how the Proclamation will affect worried families. The Proclamation’s burden \nfalls upon other Latino Network employees as well. The Executive Director had to reassign the \nEarly Childhood Director to coordinate Latino Network’s response to the Proclamation. As a \nresult, Latino Network’s childhood development programs are essentially on hold. \nLatino Network’s Executive Director estimates that responding to the Proclamation will \nconsume up to 15 percent of paid staff members’ weekly time. Training staff and conducting the \nPAGE 10 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 11 of 37\n \nnecessary research will cost Latino Network almost $14,000—money not in its budget. The time \nand money that Latino Network employees spend responding to the Proclamation is time and \nmoney they are unable to spend fulfilling its core mission. \n2.  Individual Named Plaintiffs \nThe individual named plaintiffs submitted declarations describing their personal \ncircumstances, health, and financial situation and explaining why they and their relatives would \nnot be able to comply with the requirements of the Proclamation. Defendants also submitted \ninterrogatory responses provided by the named plaintiffs. Other than Plaintiff Gabino Soriano \nCastellanos, added as a Plaintiff in the First Amended Class Action Complaint, the named \nplaintiffs are United States citizens who are sponsoring immediate family members for \nimmigrant visas. Mr. Castellanos is a foreign national visa applicant who is the husband of a U.S. \ncitizen, another named plaintiff, who sponsored the petition for Mr. Castellanos’s visa. All \nPlaintiffs seek only legally to reunite with their family members.  \nPlaintiff John Doe #1 is a U.S. citizen who lives in Oregon with his U.S. citizen son and \nnoncitizen wife. He and his son have coverage through the Oregon Health Plan, Oregon’s \nMedicaid program. He sponsored an immigrant visa for his wife, a national of Mexico. Her \napplication was approved in July 2017. She also received an I-601A conditional waiver. John \nDoe #1 is no longer able to work due to a disability. He had heart surgery in 2018 and is \nreceiving social security disability benefits. The family expects that after his wife receives lawful \nimmigrant status, she will work and help financially support the family. Additionally, given the \nhealth problems of John Doe #1 and his son, his wife currently takes care of both of them. If her \nI-601A visa is revoked, it will cause extreme hardship for the family. She had a consulate \ninterview scheduled for November 6, 2019, in Mexico, but on November 1, 2019, she requested \nthe interview be postponed because of the Proclamation and her fear that her immigrant visa \nPAGE 11 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 12 of 37\n \nwould be denied and her waiver would be revoked. The interview is now scheduled for May 28, \n2020. John Doe #1 investigated potential approved insurance options with his attorney and could \nnot find an available and reasonably affordable plan. John Doe #1 also contacted some insurers \nhimself, and was quoted unaffordable premiums, including premiums of $450 and $500 per \nmonth. John Doe #1 cannot add his wife to his plan because he is on Medicare.  \nPlaintiff Juan Ramon Morales is a U.S. citizen who lives in New York with his U.S. \ncitizen daughter, lawful permanent resident step-daughter, and noncitizen wife. He sponsored an \nimmigrant visa for his wife, a national of Mexico. Her application was approved in July 2017. \nShe also received an I-601A waiver in April 2019. The National Visa Center has informed \nMr. Morales and his wife that they have received all the requested documentation and his wife is \n“in the queue” for an interview. He and his wife are both currently employed. He and his \nchildren all have health insurance coverage. His children, however, are covered by subsidized \nplans, and he is covered by a catastrophic plan through his employer. His wife’s employer does \nnot provide health insurance. Mr. Morales is not able to add his wife to his plan until she has a \nsocial security number. Thus, after she has received her immigrant visa, she can be added, but \nuntil then she cannot be added to his plan. He has asked his employer for documentation to this \neffect, but nothing guarantees that she will have coverage within 30 days of her eligibility to be \nadded to his employer-sponsored plan. Mr. Morales called at least three different health \ninsurance companies about buying a plan for his wife, but he could not purchase a plan for her \nwithout her having a social security number. Mr. Morales investigated potential approved \ninsurance options with his attorney and could not find an available and reasonably affordable \nplan. His wife had emergency brain surgery in 2010 and suffers from seizures and headaches. \nPAGE 12 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 13 of 37\n \nHer preexisting conditions make other available insurance and her reasonably anticipated \nmedical expenses cost prohibitive. \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #2 is a United States citizen who lives in California and is a single \nmother to her two U.S. citizen children. She is insured through Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid \nprogram. She sponsored immigrant visas for her parents, who currently reside in Nicaragua. \nTheir petitions were approved in July 2019. They are collecting the necessary information for the \nvisa application process. Jane Doe #2 investigated potential approved insurance options with her \nattorney and could not find an available and reasonably affordable plan for her parents.  \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a United States citizen who lives in California. Her husband is an \narchitect who teaches architectural theory and design and is a German national, living in \nGermany. She and her husband have been apart for more than two years. Her sponsorship \npetition for her husband was approved in April 2019. The documents for his application have \nbeen submitted but no interview had yet been scheduled. Jane Doe #3 has a disability, is unable \nto work, and has health insurance through Medi-Cal. Because it is unknown when her husband \nmay be permitted entry into the United States, he is unable to apply for jobs before entry. His \nemployment prospects are good and part of the benefit of having him living in this country is his \nexpected financial support as well as family reunification and emotional, psychological, and \nphysical support. He is unable, however, to show that he will be employed and have health \ninsurance within 30 days of entry. He also has multiple sclerosis (“MS”), which requires \ntreatment. They cannot show that they can pay cash for his reasonably anticipated medical \nexpenses or can purchase “acceptable” insurance given his preexisting conditions, because it is \nunknown exactly when he will be employed. Jane Doe #3 researched different insurance options \nand discovered that she cannot add her husband to her Medi-Cal plan, TriCare is not an option \nPAGE 13 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 14 of 37\n \nbecause she never served in the military, and STLDI plans are unavailable in California. Her \nhusband researched options from German insurance companies, but they would not cover his \nchronic condition of MS, only would cover emergencies, and required his residence be in \nGermany. Jane Doe #3 also researched unsubsidized plans on the California exchange, which \nwere unaffordable. These plans premiums ranging from $350 to $500 per month. Jane Doe #3 \nand her husband can afford a subsidized plan, but those are not approved under the Proclamation. \nPlaintiff Iris Angelina Castro is a U.S. Citizen living in Massachusetts with her U.S. \ncitizen son. She had to leave her job as a teacher when her son became sick. She currently has \nMassHealth insurance, Massachusetts’s Medicaid. She sponsored an immigrant visa for her \nhusband, who currently lives in and is a national of the Dominican Republic. Ms. Castro’s \npetition was approved in May 2019. Ms. Castro and her husband believe they have submitted all \nnecessary paperwork as of December 2019. Ms. Castro notes that the consulate in the Dominican \nRepublic generally promptly schedules an interview after all paperwork has been submitted. \nWithout her job, Ms. Castro does not believe that she and her husband can show the necessary \nfinancial resources to pay for health care costs, and without her health insurance benefits her \nMedicaid plan is not an approved plan. Ms. Castro investigated potential approved insurance \noptions with her attorney and could not find an available and reasonably affordable plan. She \nalso contacted insurance companies on her own, but the prices quoted were more than she could \nafford and were plans that provided incomplete coverage. For example, one plan would cost \n$315 per month but would not cover mental health care or maternity care. At the time Ms. Castro \nfiled her declaration, she was pregnant. She also was unemployed and could not afford the \npremium. Ms. Castro desires to have her husband living with her to help emotionally, physically, \nmentally, and financially. \nPAGE 14 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 15 of 37\n \nPlaintiff Blake Doe attends Oregon State University, studying civil engineering. His wife \nworks full time. His noncitizen parents also live in Oregon, but are nationals of Mexico. He \nsponsored his parent’s family visa petition in 2017, and the State Department approved that \npetition in January 2018. On June 11, 2019, USCIS granted Blake Doe’s parents an I-601A \nprovisional unlawful status waiver. As of February 2020, Blake and his parents were informed \nthat all of his parents’ necessary paperwork has been received and they are “queued” for an \ninterview. Blake investigated insurance options with his attorney and could not find an available \nand reasonably affordable plan for his parents. Quoted premiums were $2,500 or more per \nmonth. His mother has health conditions, and he does not believe that his parents will be able to \nshow that they have the resources to pay for reasonably anticipated medical costs, even though \nhis father is employed. His father’s employer does not provide medical insurance. His parents \ncannot be added to his student insurance or his wife’s insurance through her employment. \nPlaintiff Brenda Villarruel is a U.S. citizen living in Illinois with her U.S. citizen son and \nparents and noncitizen husband. She sponsored an immigrant visa for her husband, Plaintiff \nGabino Soriano Castellanos, who is a citizen of Mexico. Her petition was approved in \nSeptember 2016. Ms. Villarruel works part-time as a medical assistant and part-time at her \nhusband’s tattoo shop. Mr. Soriano is a professional tattoo artist who previously lived with \nMs. Villarruel in Chicago but went to Mexico in March 2018. Mr. Castellanos had more than \n100 customers awaiting his return for tattoos. Mr. Castellanos had his interview scheduled for \nNovember 5, 2019, but after learning of the Proclamation and researching insurance plans, he \nand Ms. Villarruel requested that his interview be postponed. They did not believe that they \ncould meet the terms of the Proclamation. The interview was rescheduled for January 28, 2020. \nAt that time, the consular officer granted Mr. Castellanos’s application for an immigrant visa. \nPAGE 15 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 16 of 37\n \nANALYSIS \nA.  Class Certification  \nPlaintiffs move to certify the following two subclasses: \n(1) Individuals in the United States who currently have an \napproved or pending petition to the United States government to \nsponsor a noncitizen family member for an immigrant visa, or who \nwill soon file such a petition; and whose sponsored family member \nis subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to a \nconsular officer’s satisfaction that he or she “will be covered by \napproved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be \nable “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs” (“U.S. \nPetitioner Subclass”); and \n(2) Individuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for \nor will soon apply to the United States government for an \nimmigrant visa; (ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted the visa; \nbut (iii) are subject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate \nto the satisfaction of a consular officer that they “will be covered \nby approved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be \nable “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs” (“Visa \nApplicant Subclass”). \nDefendants argue that certification is inappropriate because: (1) Mr. Castellanos received \nhis visa, mooting his claims and rendering the Visa Applicant Subclass without a class \nrepresentative; (2) Plaintiffs in the U.S. Petitioner Subclass lack standing; and (3) the U.S. \nPetitioner Subclass does not satisfy the requirements of Rules 23(a), 23(b)(2), or 23(b)(1)(a) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n1.  Visa Applicant Subclass—Representative \nPlaintiffs moved for class certification on November 8, 2019, noting that they would be \nfiling an amended complaint adding Plaintiff Gabino Soriano Castellanos to represent the Visa \nApplicant Subclass. Plaintiffs included Mr. Castellanos’s declaration with their materials \nsupporting the motion for class certification. When filing their amended complaint on \nNovember 27, 2019, Plaintiffs noted that they filed it as a matter of course under \nPAGE 16 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 17 of 37\n \nRule 15(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because Defendants had not yet filed \nan answer or otherwise responded to Plaintiffs’ original complaint, citing American Realty \nInvestors, Inc. v. Prime Income Asset Mgmt., LLC, 2013 WL 5663069, at *5 (D. Nev. Oct. 15, \n2013) (“A complaint is a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required. Therefore, under \nRule 15(a)(1)(B), a party has an absolute right to amend its complaint at any time from the \nmoment the complaint is filed until 21 days after the earlier of the filing of a responsive pleading \nor a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f).” (quoting Villery v. Dist. of Columbia, 277 F.R.D. 218, \n219 (D.D.C. 2011)). Plaintiffs filed their reply brief in support of their motion for class \ncertification on November 27, 2019, the same day that Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Class \nAction Complaint. \nThe Court issued its Opinion and Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction on November 26, 2019. On November 27, 2019, the Court issued a scheduling order, \nrequesting that the parties confer on a schedule for class discovery and supplemental briefing on \nthe motion for class certification. On December 26, 2019, the Court issued a case management \nscheduling order, permitting discovery relating class certification and setting a deadline of \nFebruary 24, 2020 for Defendants to file a supplemental surresponse in opposition to Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for class certification and March 9, 2020 for Plaintiffs’ to file their surreply in support of \ntheir motion. On January 29, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a “Notice of Additional Facts,” which \ndescribed certain changed circumstances since they filed their motion and supporting documents \nin November 2019, including that Mr. Castellanos had been approved for his immigrant visa \nduring his January 2020 interview. \nDefendants argue in their surresponse that the changed circumstance of Mr. Castellanos \nreceiving his immigrant visa moots his claim in this lawsuit and renders him an invalid class \nPAGE 17 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 18 of 37\n \nrepresentative. This, argue Defendants, “dooms” Plaintiffs’ request to certify the Visa Applicant \nSubclass. Defendants note that when “the plaintiff’s claim becomes moot before the district court \ncertifies the class, the class action normally also becomes moot.” Slayman v. FedEx Ground \nPackage Sys. Inc., 765 F.3d 1033, 1048 (9th Cir. 2014). Defendants further argue that because \nPlaintiffs invoked no exception to mootness, such as that the class claims are “inherently \ntransitory,” Plaintiffs may not invoke such an exception in their surreply. \nThe Court rejects Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs waived their opportunity to invoke \nthe inherently transitory mootness exception. Plaintiffs added Mr. Castellanos in their First \nAmended Complaint, filed November 27, 2019, the same day that Plaintiffs filed their reply in \nsupport of their motion for class certification. Plaintiffs had no reason to argue a mootness \nexception to Mr. Castellanos’s claims in that reply—Plaintiffs had just added Mr. Castellanos as \na named plaintiff. He did not even have a consular interview scheduled at that time. The next \nbrief that Plaintiffs filed in which they could raise a mootness exception was their surreply filed \non March 9, 2020, and in which Plaintiffs’ invoked the exception. Plaintiffs, therefore, did not \nwaive the inherently transitory mootness exception. \nIn their surreply, Plaintiffs cite the Supreme Court’s discussion of the inherently \ntransitory mootness exception in Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954 (2019). In Nielsen, two classes \nof aliens brought a class action complaint challenging the INA’s provision relating to mandatory \ndetention without bond. Id. at 960-61. The government argued that because the putative class \nrepresentatives had “obtained either cancellation of removal or bond hearings” by the time of \nclass certification, the class action was moot. Id. at 963. The Supreme Court noted, “Class \nactions are ‘[n]ormally . . . moot if no named class representative with an unexpired claim \nPAGE 18 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 19 of 37\n \nremain[s] at the time of class certification.’” Id. at 962 (alterations in original). The Court \nconcluded, however, “that general norm is no hurdle here.” Id.  \nThe Supreme Court held that there was at least one plaintiff with a live claim at the time \nthat the class was certified. Id. at 963. The Court explained: \nEven if that had not been so, these cases would not be moot \nbecause the fact that a class “was not certified until after the named \nplaintiffs’ claims had become moot does not deprive us of \njurisdiction” when, as in these cases, the harms alleged are \ntransitory enough to elude review. Respondents claim that they \nwould be harmed by detention without a hearing pending a \ndecision on their removal. Because this type of injury ends as soon \nas the decision on removal is made, it is transitory. So the fact that \nthe named plaintiffs obtained some relief before class certification \ndoes not moot their claims. \nId. (citations omitted). \nLike the immigration decisions in Nielsen, the type of injury alleged here ends as soon as \nthe consular interview is held and the visa decision is made at the interview. It is transitory. \nThus, the fact that Mr. Castellanos obtained some relief before class certification does not moot \nhis claims and does not render the Visa Applicant Subclass unable to be adjudicated. Id.; see also \nPitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d 1081, 1087, 1089-90 (9th Cir. 2011). \n2.  U.S. Petitioner Subclass—Standing \nDefendants argue that the U.S. Petitioner Subclass named plaintiffs lack standing. \nDefendants’ primary argument relating to standing, like arguments they assert against many of \nthe Rule 23 factors, is that these plaintiffs lack standing because the Court enjoined Defendants \nfrom enforcing or applying the Proclamation before it went into effect and thus no consular \nofficer applied the Proclamation to any immigrant. Defendants’ argument is premised on an \nassumption that only immigrants against whom the Proclamation has actually been applied or \ntheir sponsoring family members have standing. This argument is rejected. \nPAGE 19 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 20 of 37\n \nTo demonstrate standing to seek injunctive relief under Article III, \na plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering “injury in \nfact” that is concrete and particularized; the threat must be actual \nand imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; it must be fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and it must be \nlikely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the \ninjury. \nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009). \nA plaintiff may not assert claims that are “imaginary or speculative,” but “it is not \nnecessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to \nchallenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.” Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 (1974); see also Italian Colors Rest. v. Becerra, 878 F.3d 1165, \n1171 (9th Cir. 2018) (“The injury requirement does not force a plaintiff to ‘await the \nconsummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.’” (quoting Blanchette v. Conn. \nGen. Ins. Corps., 419 U.S. 102, 143 (1974))). As the Ninth Circuit has explained: \nIt is well-established that, although a plaintiff “must demonstrate a \nrealistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of a statute’s \noperation or enforcement,” a plaintiff “does not have to await the \nconsummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.” \nBabbitt v. United Farm Workers, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Santiago need not await \nprosecution to challenge § 13-2929. Id. (“[I]t is not necessary that \n[the plaintiff] first expose himself to actual arrest or a prosecution \nto be entitled to challenge [the] statute that he claims deters the \nexercise of his constitutional rights.”) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). “[I]t is ‘sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiff \nintends to engage in a ‘course of conduct arguably affected with a \nconstitutional interest’ and that there is a credible threat that the \nprovision will be invoked against the plaintiff.’” Ariz. Right to Life \nPolitical Action Comm. v. Bayless, 320 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th \nCir. 2003) (quoting LSO, Ltd. v. Stroh, 205 F.3d 1146, 1154-55 \n(9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Babbitt, 442 U.S. at 298)). \nValle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir. 2013) (alterations in original); see \nalso Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 735 F.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 2013 (holding that a “‘credible \nPAGE 20 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 21 of 37\n \nthreat’ that a probabilistic harm will materialize” is enough to support standing) (quoting \nCovington v. Jefferson Cty., 358 F.3d 626, 641 (9th Cir. 2004)). \nDefendants also argue that the U.S. Petitioner Subclass Plaintiffs have not established \nthat the threatened injury from the Proclamation is sufficiently imminent, because they have not \nshown that a consular officer would apply the Proclamation to deny their family members a visa. \nThese Plaintiffs, however, do not have to prove that their family members will be denied visas to \nestablish standing. Plaintiffs need only prove that based on their course of conduct, there is a \n“realistic danger” or a “credible threat” that operation or enforcement of the Proclamation would \ncause them injury. Valle del Sol, 732 F.3d at 1015; Nat. Res. Def. Council, 735 F.3d at 878. \nThese Plaintiffs’ visa petitions have been approved for sponsored family members. Their family \nmembers have completed applications and are all awaiting interviews, one of which is scheduled \nfor May 2020, to see if their visas will be granted or denied. The U.S. Petitioner Plaintiffs’ \ndeclarations and answers to interrogatories are sufficient to show that their family members have \nhealth issues and financial constraints. In their declarations and responses to interrogatories, \nthese Plaintiffs also describe that they or their family members investigated various health \ninsurance options approved under the Proclamation and those options are not reasonably \navailable or affordable.2  \nDefendants highlight certain named plaintiffs who responded to interrogatories by \ndescribing low out-of-pocket health care costs for their sponsored immigrant family members in \n                                                 \n2 Defendants dispute the thoroughness with which Plaintiffs investigated insurance \noptions, arguing that Plaintiffs need to show that they could not obtain any possible insurance \nthat may somehow conceivably fall within the parameters of the Proclamation. Defendants cite \nno authority for such a stringent standard to show injury for standing. Plaintiffs describe multiple \nattempts at researching possible insurance options and describe injury that is imminent and not \nhypothetical or conjectural. That is what is required to support standing. Summers, 555 U.S. \nat 493. \nPAGE 21 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 22 of 37\n \nthe preceding year. Defendants argue that it is likely those named plaintiffs would not be injured \nby the Proclamation because their sponsored family members would be found by a consular \nofficer to be able to pay for their own anticipated health care costs. Those named plaintiffs, \nhowever, describe how their sponsored immigrant visa applicant family members have certain \nhealth concerns or conditions and that they were unable to seek medical care for those concerns \nor conditions because of costs. Thus, there is a realistic danger that a consular officer would find \nthat there are anticipated health care costs associated with those medical concerns and conditions \nand would evaluate the immigrant visa applicant’s ability to pay for those anticipated costs. \nThese Plaintiffs describe how they would be unable to afford the associated medical costs. \nConsidering the record, the Court finds that the U.S. Petitioner Plaintiffs have shown a credible \nthreat or realistic danger of injury from the Proclamation. \nFinally, Defendants argue that even if unadjudicated visa petitions could provide \nstanding, all the named plaintiffs in the U.S. Petitioner Subclass, except one based on newly \nchanged circumstances, lack standing because their claims are not ripe. Defendants assert that \nthese Plaintiffs’ claims are unripe because their immigrant family members do not have \ninterviews scheduled with a consular officer.3 It is Defendants, however, that schedule the \nconsular interviews. Many Plaintiffs and their family members have submitted all the requested \ndocumentation and are waiting for the interview of their family members to be scheduled—the \n                                                 \n3 Defendants’ concept of justiciability is quite narrow. Defendants argue that the claim is \nmoot for the Visa Applicant Subclass Plaintiff who kept his interview and the claims are unripe \nfor Plaintiffs whose family members do not have an interview. This allows standing only for \npersons during the narrow window of time between when an interview is scheduled and when it \ntakes place, or if the visa is denied at the interview and the harm has then occurred. This view of \nstanding, as discussed above, is rejected because a plaintiff does not have to wait for a credibly \nthreatened threat of injury to occur to have standing, and the requirement that standing is \nconferred only in the months between an interview being scheduled and it taking place is \nunreasonably narrow and incompatible with the purposes of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. \nPAGE 22 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 23 of 37\n \nscheduling is outside their control. Others are gathering additional documents requested. In any \nevent, Plaintiffs in this subclass face the same imminent injury, with or without an interview \ncurrently scheduled for the visa applicant. They are all persons who have sponsored an \nimmigrant whose petition has been approved, the sponsored immigrant’s application is complete \nor nearly complete, and the immigrant is waiting for an interview at which time the visa will be \napproved or denied. That approval decision will be significantly affected by whether the \nProclamation is in force at the time of the interview. As discussed above, a plaintiff “does not \nhave to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.” Valle del Sol, \n732 F.3d at 1015 (quoting Babbitt, 442 U.S. at 298). Based on Plaintiffs’ course of conduct, there \nis a credible threat that the Proclamation will cause them injury, and that is sufficient for \nstanding. Id. \n3.  Rule 23(a) Requirements \na.  Numerosity \nIn this district, there is a “rough rule of thumb” that 40 class members is sufficient to \nmeet the numerosity requirement. Giles v. St. Charles Health Sys., Inc., 294 F.R.D. 585, 590 (D. \nOr. 2013); see also Wilcox Dev. Co. v. First Interstate Bank of Or., N.A., 97 F.R.D. 440, 443 (D. \nOr. 1983) (same); 1 McLaughlin on Class Actions § 4:5 (15th ed.) (“The rule of thumb adopted \nby most courts is that proposed classes in excess of 40 generally satisfy the numerosity \nrequirement.”). Further, when plaintiffs seek injunctive or declaratory relief, “the numerosity \nrequirement is relaxed and plaintiffs may rely on the reasonable inference arising from plaintiffs’ \nother evidence that the number of unknown and future members of [the proposed class] is \nsufficient to make joinder impracticable.” Sueoka v. United States, 101 F. App’x 649, 653 (9th \nCir. 2004); see also Nightingale v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 333 F.R.D. 449, 457 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019). \nPAGE 23 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 24 of 37\n \nDefendants argue that this element is not met because no person currently is affected by \nthe Proclamation because the Court enjoined the Proclamation before it went into effect. \nDefendants’ argument is based on Defendants’ theory that no one has standing to challenge the \nProclamation until it is enforced against an immigrant. Because the Court rejects this theory, \nDefendants’ contention that numerosity is not met also is rejected. Defendants concede that the \nProclamation will apply to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of immigrants. It is a \nreasonable inference, as Defendants assert in their arguments about purported conflicts (arguing \nthat the subclasses will be extremely large), that many of those immigrants will fall within the \ndefinition of the putative subclasses. Given the “relaxed” numerosity standard in cases \nrequesting injunctive and declaratory relief and the fact that Plaintiffs may rely on the reasonable \ninference of unknown and future members, numerosity is met in this case.  \nb.  Commonality \nTo satisfy the commonality requirement, a representative plaintiff must show that the \nputative class members suffered the “same injury,” i.e., that their claims depend on a “common \ncontention.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (quotation marks \nomitted). “That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of \nclasswide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Id. But class members need \nnot have every issue in common: Commonality requires only “a single significant question of \nlaw or fact” in common. Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, 589 (9th Cir. 2012); see \nalso Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359 (“We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) even a single \ncommon question will do.” (alterations and quotation marks omitted)).  \n“[C]ommon questions may center on ‘shared legal issues with divergent factual \npredicates [or] a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies.’” Jimenez \nPAGE 24 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 25 of 37\n \nv. Allstate Ins. Co., 765 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) (first alteration added, second alteration \nin original) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)); see also \nEvon v. Law Offices of Sidney Mickell, 688 F.3d 1015, 1029 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Where the \ncircumstances of each particular class member vary but retain a common core of factual or legal \nissues with the rest of the class, commonality exists.”); Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1046 \n(9th Cir. 1998) (“Differences among the class members with respect to the merits of their actual \ndocument fraud cases, however, are simply insufficient to defeat the propriety of class \ncertification. What makes the plaintiffs’ claims suitable for a class action is the common \nallegation that the INS’s procedures provide insufficient notice.”). Thus, the Ninth Circuit has \nrejected arguments that factual variations preclude a finding of commonality, particularly in civil \nrights cases, explaining: “We have previously held, in a civil-rights suit, that commonality is \nsatisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the \nputative class members.” Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001), overruled on \nother grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005); see also Parsons v. Ryan, 754 \nF.3d 657, 682 (9th Cir. 2014) (“In a civil rights suit such as this one . . . commonality is satisfied \nwhere the lawsuit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class \nmembers. Under such circumstances, individual factual differences among class members pose \nno obstacle to commonality.” (quoting Rosas v. Baca, 2012 WL 2061694, at *3 (C.D. Cal. \nJune 7, 2012) (Pregerson, J.)) \nPlaintiffs’ alleged harm is that they and all putative class members will be subject to the \nProclamation, which Plaintiffs allege is unconstitutional and the implementation and \nenforcement of which Plaintiffs allege violates Constitution and the APA. Plaintiffs also seek the \nsame relief for themselves and the putative class—a permanent injunction preventing \nPAGE 25 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 26 of 37\n \nimplementation and enforcement of the Proclamation. Defendants focus on the fact that Plaintiffs \nand the individual visa applicants have varying factual circumstancing relating to their financial \nand medical circumstances, and thus there will be differing circumstances for consular officers to \nconsider when making specific visa determinations.4 That, however, is not the dispositive \nquestion for commonality in this case. Plaintiffs are not challenging specific visa determinations. \nPlaintiffs are challenging the legality of the implementation and enforcement of a broadly-\napplicable change to how immigration visas are to be processed and whether the President \nviolated the Constitution in issuing the Proclamation. \nThere are many alleged common issues of law and fact. These include: (1) whether in \nissuing the Proclamation President Trump violated the doctrine of separation of powers, such as \nby the Proclamation conflicting with provisions of the INA; (2) whether in issuing the \nProclamation President Trump exceeded the powers delegated to him in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), such \nas by being indefinite or otherwise not complying with the statutory authority granted to the \nPresident by Congress; (3) whether under the circumstances of this case and this exercise of \nauthority, the Proclamation, by relating only to domestic, non-national security issues, violated \nthe non-delegation doctrine; (4) whether Defendants violated the APA; (5) whether Defendants \nviolated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Equal Protection Clause; (5) whether Defendants violated \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause; (6) whether the Proclamation contains terms that \n                                                 \n4 Defendants also assert that commonality is lacking because Plaintiffs “have not asserted \nthat they have researched every health insurance plan available in every single state, district, and \nterritory in the United States, or in every single country in the world, and that there are no \noptions available to any of them—nor could they make such an assertions.” Commonality does \nnot require such an assertion. Commonality requires “common contentions whose truth or falsity \ncan be determined in one stroke” and that are the “‘glue’ that holds together the putative class,” \nmeaning that each of the challenged “policies and practices is unlawful as to every [class \nmember] or it is not.” Parsons, 754 F.3d at 678. Those parameters are met in this case. \nPAGE 26 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 27 of 37\n \nare vague or unworkable, rendering uniform application impossible; (7) whether the \nProclamation was self-executing or required agency action; and (8) whether the Proclamation \nwas motived by racial animus. These, and other, common issues are not determined by any \nindividual plaintiff’s factual circumstances. They are all subject to classwide resolution. \nMoreover, resolving these issues is central to the validity of Plaintiffs’ claims and will “drive the \nresolution of the litigation.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350. Finally, the remedy sought is the same \nfor Plaintiffs and the putative class members.  \nThe Court finds, however, that there is not commonality among the U.S. Petitioner \nSubclass named plaintiffs, whose petitions were approved sponsoring family members for an \nimmigrant visa, and those putative class members who may “soon” file a petition but have not \nyet filed a petition. It is too speculative whether the alleged injury will befall persons who may \nsoon file a petition but have not yet done so. Someone who may intend to file a petition may not \nactually file a petition and then will not be subject to the Proclamation. Plaintiffs assert that their \nintent in including such persons in the class definition was to ensure that future petitioners would \nbe included in the class. Future U.S. citizens who actually file a petition, however, would then be \npersons who have a pending petition, and they would fall within the subclass definition of \npersons who have a petition pending. Plaintiffs’ concern can be resolved by adding “will have” \nto the class definition, ensuring that future persons who actually file petitions will be in the class. \nDeleting persons who will “soon” file a petition excludes persons who are only intending to file \npetitions but may not file them for some reason.5 This results in a modified subclass definition \nof:  \n                                                 \n5 The Court does not find the same problem with the subclass definition for the Visa \nApplicant subclass, which also includes applicants who will soon apply for a visa. This is \nbecause members of this subclass apply after their U.S. citizen sponsor’s petition has been \nPAGE 27 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 28 of 37\n \nIndividuals in the United States who currently have or will have an \napproved or pending petition to the United States government to \nsponsor a noncitizen family member for an immigrant visa; and \nwhose sponsored family member is subject to the Proclamation \nand unable to demonstrate to a consular officer’s satisfaction that \nhe or she “will be covered by approved health insurance” within 30 \ndays after entry or will be able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable \nmedical costs.” \nThis modified definition creates a subclass not frozen in time and allows for future \nputative class members that are similarly situated to join the class as the case progresses. See \nRodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2010) (“The inclusion of future class \nmembers in a class is not itself unusual or objectionable.”) (collecting cases); accord Ms. L. v. \nU.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 331 F.R.D. 529, 541 (S.D. Cal. 2018) (certifying a class of \nadults who “have been, are, or will be detained in immigration custody” and “have a minor child \nwho is or will be separated from them”); Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth Collective v. \nNielsen, 2018 WL 1061408, at *7-8 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 26, 2018) (certifying a class that includes \nthose who “will have their DACA terminated without notice or process”). \n“[D]istrict courts have broad discretion to modify class definitions.” Nevarez v. Forty \nNiners Football Co., LLC, 326 F.R.D. 562, 575 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting \nWilliams v. City of Antioch, 2010 WL 3632199, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2010) and Powers v. \nHamilton County Public Defender Com’n, 501 F.3d 592, 619 (6th Cir. 2007)); see also 7A \nCharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1759 (3d ed.).The \nCourt therefore modifies the definition of the U.S. Petitioner Subclass as set forth above. As \n                                                 \napproved by USCIS. The likelihood that the immigrant visa applicant will not submit the \napplication, therefore, is minimal. The visa process already has begun with the petition, and the \nvisa application is a continuation of an ongoing process. This is unlike the petition in the U.S. \nPetitioner Subclass, which is the beginning of the visa process, and therefore creates greater \nconcern with including “soon” in the subclass definition.  \nPAGE 28 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 29 of 37\n \nmodified, the Court finds that commonality is met for both proposed subclasses. This finding \ncomports with many courts that have found commonality to be satisfied in cases involving \nchallenges to systemic immigration policies and procedures, even though immigration decisions \nultimately involve discretionary decisions by consular officers. See, e.g., Doe v. Wolf, 2020 \nWL 209919, at *7 (S.D. Cal. Jan. 14, 2020); Ms. L. v. U.S Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 330 \nF.R.D. 284, 289 (S.D. Cal. 2019); Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 331 F.R.D. \nat 538; Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth Collective, 2018 WL 1061408, at *8; Hernandez v. \nLynch, 2016 WL 7116611, at *17 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2016), aff’d sub nom. Hernandez v. \nSessions, 872 F.3d 976 (9th Cir. 2017). \nDefendants also argue that the Visa Applicant Subclass is unable to meet the \ncommonality requirement because unadmitted and nonresident aliens have no constitutional right \nof entry to the United States and have to right to cause of action in furtherance of their claim for \nadmission. Defendants cite Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2131 (2015), and Kleindienst v. \nMandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762 (1972), both of which involved plaintiffs requesting court orders \nrequiring admission into the country of certain persons. Those cases are distinguishable because \nPlaintiffs are not claiming a constitutional right of entry for the Visa Applicant Subclass. Nor are \nPlaintiffs requesting the remedy of an order allowing members of this subclass, or any plaintiff, \nto enter the country or any similar type of injunctive relief. This is not a case in furtherance of \nany plaintiffs’ specific application for admission. It is a civil rights case challenging a generally \napplicable policy and procedure. The Court rejects Defendants’ argument. \nc.  Typicality \nTo meet the typicality requirement, a representative plaintiff must show that his or her \nclaims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \nUnder the “permissive standards” of Rule 23(a)(3), a “representative’s claims are ‘typical’ if they \nPAGE 29 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 30 of 37\n \nare reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially \nidentical.” Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). “The purpose of the \ntypicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named representative aligns with the \ninterests of the class.” Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992). To \ndetermine whether claims and defenses are typical, courts look to “whether other members have \nthe same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the \nnamed plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of \nconduct.” Id. (quotation marks omitted); see also Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, 617 \nF.3d 1168, 1175 (9th Cir. 2010). \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims are not typical because they lack standing. The \nCourt has rejected Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs lack standing. Defendants also argue that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not typical because Plaintiffs and their family members all have different \nfinancial and personal circumstances that could affect the individual determination by the \nconsular officer at the interview. This, however, is not the standard for typicality. Typicality \nexamines the claims in the case and whether they are typical of the claims of the absent class \nmembers. The claims here are not dependent on the unique factual circumstances of any specific \nPlaintiff. For example, whether a particular named plaintiff has financial resources has no \nbearing on whether President Trump violated the separation of powers doctrine in issuing the \nProclamation. Similarly, whether a particular named plaintiff may be eligible for an approved \ninsurance plan does not affect the legal analysis about whether the agencies’ engaged in final \nagency action and, if so, whether that action violated the APA.  \n“Defendants’ typicality challenge fails to the same extent as their commonality challenge. \nEven if the named plaintiffs’ individual cases contain some factual variations, that does not \nPAGE 30 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 31 of 37\n \nchange the fact that all are challenging the legality of [the Proclamation, its implementation and \nenforcement] under the APA and due process clause.” Inland Empire-Immigrant Youth \nCollective, 2018 WL 1061408, at *10; see also Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686 (“It does not matter that \nthe named plaintiffs’ may have in the past suffered varying injuries or that they may currently \nhave different health care needs; Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that their claims be ‘typical’ of the \nclass, not that they be identically positioned to each other to every class member.”); Rodriguez v. \nHayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1124 (9th Cir. 2010) (“The particular characteristics of the Petitioner or \nany individual detainee will not impact the resolution of this general statutory question and, \ntherefore, cannot render Petitioner’s claim atypical.”). With the Court’s modified definition of \nthe U.S. Petitioner Subclass, the Court finds that the typicality requirement is met. \nd.  Adequacy of representation \nRule 23(a)(4) states that before a class can be certified, a court must find that “the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” This \nrequirement turns on two questions: (1) whether “the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any \nconflicts of interest with other class members”; and (2) whether “the named plaintiffs and their \ncounsel [will] prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class.” Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. \nThe adequacy requirement is based on principles of constitutional due process, and so a court \ncannot bind absent class members if class representation is inadequate. Hansberry v. Lee, 311 \nU.S. 32, 42-43 (1940); Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs are inadequate because the subclasses will be so large \n(despite Defendants’ contradictory arguments that numerosity is not met because the subclasses \nhave a size of zero) that there will surely be conflicts within them. Defendants speculate that \nsome subclass members will have health insurance and some will not, and there will be conflicts \nbetween those that do and those that do not. Immigrant visa applicants with health insurance will \nPAGE 31 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 32 of 37\n \nnot be class members, and Defendants do not explain how Plaintiffs, most of whom do have \nhealth insurance, have conflicts with one another or putative class members because of their \nhealth insurance or lack thereof. “‘Only conflicts that are fundamental to the suit and that go to \nthe heart of the litigation prevent a plaintiff from meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy \nrequirement.’” In re Online DVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 F.3d 934, 942 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting William B. Rubenstein et al., 1 NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3.58 (5th ed. 2011)). “A \nconflict is fundamental when it goes to the specific issues in controversy.” Id. (quoting \nNEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3.58). Defendants describe no purported conflicts that go to the \nheart of Plaintiffs’ claims in this lawsuit. \nDefendants also presume that there will be conflicts between the two subclasses, because \nrequiring the foreign immigrant subclass members to have health insurance reduces a financial \nburden on the U.S. citizen subclass members. Defendants submit no evidence, no statistics, no \nstudies, nor anything other than rampant speculation and attorney argument to support their \narguments relating to purported conflicts. The Court rejects Defendants’ speculation. See In re \nOnline DVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 F.3d at 942 (“However, we do not ‘favor denial of class \ncertification on the basis of speculative conflicts.’” quoting Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d 886, \n896 (9th Cir. 2003)).  \nDefendants also argue that counsel are inadequate because counsel did not submit their \nresumes. Counsel described their extensive and relevant experience and cases on which they \nhave been found to be adequate class counsel. This is sufficient, and the Court does not find \nDefendants’ objection persuasive. \ne.  Ascertainability \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs also must show that the requirement of ascertainability is \nmet. Plaintiffs respond that ascertainability is not required in the Ninth Circuit and especially not \nPAGE 32 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 33 of 37\n \nin cases seeking certification under Rule 23(b)(2). In cases involving certification under \nRule 23(b)(3), courts in this district have previously considered the issue of “ascertainability” in \ndeciding whether to certify a class seeking money damages. See, e.g., Ott v. Mortg. Inv’rs Corp. \nof Ohio, Inc., 65 F. Supp. 3d 1046, 1064 (D. Or. 2014). This Court, however, did not require a \nshowing of ascertainability when considering class action certification solely in the context of \ninjunctive relief. See, e.g., A.F. ex rel. Legaard v. Providence Health Plan, 300 F.R.D. 474 (D. \nOr. 2013) (granting class certification solely under Rule 23(b)(2), without discussing \nascertainability). \nIn A.F., the Court did not specifically discuss the applicability, or lack thereof, of the \njudicially created “implicit” factor of ascertainability to certification under Rule 23(b)(2). There \nis some disagreement among courts about the applicability of this requirement. Compare Shook \nv. El Paso Cty., 386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004) (holding that the lower court erred in \nrequiring ascertainability of a Rule 23(b)(2) class and explaining that “while the lack of \nidentifiability is a factor that may defeat Rule 23(b)(3) class certification, such is not the case \nwith respect to class certification under Rule 23(b)(2)”) with Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., \n668 F.3d 481, 495-97 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding a lack of ascertainability fatal to a Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass certification because the class definition was too indefinite). The majority view, however, \nappears to favor either a lower standard for the ascertainability requirement or no requirement at \nall in the 23(b)(2) context. See, e.g., Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 561-62 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(finding the “judicially-created implied requirement of ascertainability . . . inappropriate for \n(b)(2) classes”); Dunakin v. Quigley, 99 F. Supp. 3d 1297, 1325-26 (W.D. Wash. 2015) (noting \n“many courts have determined that [ascertainability] is of less importance or not applicable at all \nPAGE 33 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 34 of 37\n \nwhen considering certification under Rule 23(b)(2)”). The Ninth Circuit has not specifically \ndiscussed “ascertainability” in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. \nIn 2017, the Ninth Circuit decided Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121 (9th \nCir. 2017). In that case, the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that class plaintiffs in a \nRule 23(b)(3) class must show “an administratively feasible way to identify putative class \nmembers.” Id. at 1133. For similar reasons, this Court declines to hold that administrative \nfeasibility is a requirement for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). \nTo the extent any aspect of ascertainability remains in this circuit after Briseno, under a \nRule 23(b)(2) class, the Court finds persuasive the Third Circuit’s reasoning in Shelton v. \nBledsoe. As discussed by the Third Circuit, a class under Rule 23(b)(2) is indivisible by nature \nand the alleged conduct can be declared unlawful as to all class members or none of them. 775 \nF.3d at 561. There is no right to opt out of such a class, the focus of this type of class is on the \nremedy sought, and the class must be cohesive as derived from Rule 23(b)(2), not \nascertainability. Id. Because the focus is on the remedy sought, “and because a remedy obtained \nby one member will naturally affect the others, the identities of individual class members are less \ncritical in a (b)(2) action than in a (b)(3) action.” Id. That also is why a court need not analyze \npredominance and superiority in a Rule 23(b)(2) class. Id. As further explained by the Third \nCircuit: \nIndeed, an Advisory Committee note to Rule 23 notes that \n“illustrative” examples of a Rule 23(b)(2) class “are various \nactions in the civil-rights field where a party is charged with \ndiscriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one whose \nmembers are incapable of specific enumeration.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23 advisory committee’s note (1966) (emphasis added). In light \nof this guidance, a judicially-created implied requirement of \nascertainability—that the members of the class be capable of \nspecific enumeration—is inappropriate for (b)(2) classes. \nMoreover, the enforcement of the remedy usually does not require \nPAGE 34 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 35 of 37\n \nindividual identification of class members in (b)(2) class actions: \n“If relief is granted . . . the defendants are legally obligated to \ncomply, and it is usually unnecessary to define with precision the \npersons entitled to enforce compliance, since presumably at least \nthe representative plaintiffs would be available to seek . . . relief if \nnecessary.” Rice v. City of Phila., 66 F.R.D. 17, 19 (E.D. \nPa. 1974). \nId. (emphasis in original). Thus, the Court declines to find that ascertainability is required in this \ncase. \n4.  Rule 23(b)(2)—Nationwide Injunctive Relief Class \nPlaintiffs request certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. Rule 23(b)(2) permits class treatment when “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefuses to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(b)(2). “The fact that some class members may have suffered no injury or different injuries \nfrom the challenged practice does not prevent the class from meeting the requirements of \nRule 23(b)(2).” Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2009). The requirements of \nRule 23(b)(3) of predominance and superiority do not apply to a class under Rule 23(b)(2). See \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 362. There is also no requirement of notice or that class members be \nallowed to opt-out. See id. \nAdditionally, the primary relief sought must be injunctive or declaratory. Wang, 737 F.3d \nat 544 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360). The principle undergirding this requirement is that the \n“indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy” justifies certification because the \n“conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members \nor as to none of them.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360 (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class \nCertification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (April 2009)). The \nAdvisory Committee Notes explain that subdivision (b)(2) was intended to reach situations when \nPAGE 35 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 36 of 37\n \nthe final relief settles the “legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole.” Advisory \nCommittee Notes to 1966 amendments to Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize \ncertification “when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment against the defendant.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360 (emphasis in original); \nsee also Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 987 (9th Cir. 2011) (same). Moreover, \nclaims for monetary relief that are “not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief” are \nineligible for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360. \nDefendants do not dispute that the elements to certify a nationwide class under \nRule 23(b)(2) are met here. Defendants only dispute standing and the elements under Rule 23(a). \nResolving Plaintiffs’ proposed injunctive relief class would finally settle the legality of \nDefendants’ “behavior with respect to the class a whole.” Advisory Committee Notes to 1966 \namendments to Rule 23(b)(2). The proposed class also involves conduct that “can be enjoined or \ndeclared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. \nat 360. As a result, certification of a nationwide injunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate. Because the Court certifies the class under Rule 23(b)(2), the Court does not reach \nPlaintiffs’ alternative argument under Rule 23(b)(1)(a). \nB.  Class Counsel and Class Representatives \nUnder Rule 23(g), the Court appoints Karen C. Tumlin and Esther H. Sung of Justice \nAction Center; Stephen Manning, Nadia Dahab, and Tess Hellgren of Innovation Law Lab; Scott \nD. Stein and Kevin M. Fee of Sidley Austin; and Jesse Bless of American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation as Class Counsel. The Court also appoints Plaintiffs John Doe #1; Juan Ramon \nMorales; Jane Doe #2; Jane Doe #3; Iris Angelina Castro; Blake Doe; Brenda Villarruel; Gabino \nSoriano Castellanos, and Latino Network as class representatives. \nPAGE 36 – OPINION AND ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 132    Filed 04/07/20    Page 37 of 37\n \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (ECF 44) is GRANTED, with a modified \nsubclass definition. The Court certifies under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure these two subclasses: \n(1) U.S. Petitioner Subclass: \nIndividuals in the United States who currently have or will have an \napproved or pending petition to the United States government to \nsponsor a noncitizen family member for an immigrant visa; and \nwhose sponsored family member is subject to the Proclamation \nand unable to demonstrate to a consular officer’s satisfaction that \nhe or she “will be covered by approved health insurance” within 30 \ndays after entry or will be able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable \nmedical costs”; and \n(2) Visa Applicant Subclass: \nIndividuals who are foreign nationals who (i) have applied for or \nwill soon apply to the United States government for an immigrant \nvisa; (ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted the visa; but (iii) are \nsubject to the Proclamation and unable to demonstrate to the \nsatisfaction of a consular officer that they “will be covered by \napproved health insurance” within 30 days after entry or will be \nable “to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this 7th day of April, 2020. \n              /s/ Michael H.

Simon, District Judge. \n \nOn October 4, 2019, the President of the United States issued Proclamation No. 9945, \ntitled “Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will \nFinancially Burden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”). President \nDonald J. Trump directed that the Proclamation become effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight \ntime on November 3, 2019. On October 29, 2019, the U.S. Department of State issued a “Notice \nof Information Collection” for “Emergency Review” (the “Emergency Notice”), which was \npublished in the Federal Register on October 30, 2019, and provided a comment period of less \nthan 48 hours. The Emergency Notice states that “to implement [the Proclamation] when it goes \ninto effect on November 3, 2019,” consular officers “will verbally ask immigrant visa applicants \ncovered by [the Proclamation] whether they will be covered by health insurance in the United \nStates within 30 days of entry to the United States and, if so, for details relating to such \ninsurance.” If the applicant says yes, “consular officers will ask for applicants to identify the \nspecific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and such other information related to \nthe insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary.” The Emergency Notice further adds \nthat visa applicants will not be suspended “if they do not have coverage but possess financial \nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical expenses.” It defines “reasonably \nforeseeable medical expenses” as “those expenses related to existing medical conditions, relating \nto health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.” \nOn October 30, 2019, seven U.S. citizens and a nonprofit organization (collectively, \n“Plaintiffs”) filed a nationwide class action complaint against the President, the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department \nof State, and related Cabinet Secretaries (collectively, “Defendants”), challenging both the \nPAGE 2 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 3 of 18\n \nProclamation and the Emergency Notice. Plaintiffs contend that the Proclamation is contrary to \nlaw. Plaintiffs also argue that the Emergency Notice is “arbitrary and capricious” under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and also fails to follow the “notice and comment” \nprocedures required by the APA. On November 1, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”), seeking to preserve the status quo and prevent Defendants from \nimplementing or enforcing the Proclamation, at least until after the Court can hear and decide a \nmotion for preliminary injunction. On Saturday, November 2, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific daylight \ntime, the Court held a hearing pursuant to Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to \nconsider Plaintiffs’ TRO motion. All parties appeared through counsel, although Defendants \nhave not yet had an opportunity to submit their arguments in writing. \nAt this early stage of the proceedings, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have shown \neither a substantial likelihood of success on the merits or at least serious questions going to the \nmerits regarding their arguments that the Proclamation and its plan of implementation and \nenforcement conflict with the “public charge” provisions in Congress’ Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”) and related federal health care statutes. Plaintiffs have also shown, at \nleast at this stage of the litigation, serious questions going to the merits regarding whether the \nEmergency Notice was arbitrary and capricious and, thus, in violation of the APA. At this time, \nthe Court declines to reach whether the Emergency Notice also violated the procedural “notice \nand comment” requirements of the APA. Further, Plaintiffs have shown, at least thus far, that \nthey are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of temporary relief, that the balance of \nhardships tips sharply toward Plaintiffs, and temporary relief is in the public interest. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for TRO is granted, for a period not to exceed 28 days, to allow \nthe parties sufficient time to brief and argue whether the Court should issue a preliminary \nPAGE 3 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 4 of 18\n \ninjunction suspending the implementation and enforcement of the Proclamation until the issues \npresented in this lawsuit have been resolved on the merits. \nSTANDARDS \nIn deciding whether to grant a motion for TRO, courts look to substantially the same \nfactors that apply to a court’s decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction. See \nStuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001). A \npreliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Defense Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show that: \n(1) he or she is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in his or her favor; and (4) that \nan injunction is in the public interest. Id. at 20 (rejecting the Ninth Circuit’s earlier rule that the \nmere “possibility” of irreparable harm, as opposed to its likelihood, was sufficient, in some \ncircumstances, to justify a preliminary injunction). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, however, did not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s \nalternative “serious questions” test. All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131-32 \n(9th Cir. 2011). Under this test, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship balance \nthat tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other \ntwo elements of the Winter test are also met.” Id. at 1132. Thus, a preliminary injunction may be \ngranted “if there is a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff; there are serious questions going \nto the merits; the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the plaintiff; and the injunction is \nin the public interest.” M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 725 (9th Cir. 2012). \nPAGE 4 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 5 of 18\n \nDISCUSSION \nA.  Overview of the Immigration and Nationality Act and National Healthcare Statutes \nThe INA has, through a series of congressional amendments since its enactment in 1952, \ncreated a system that allows the United States to grant up to 675,000 permanent immigrant visas \neach year, as well as an unlimited number of permanent immigrant visas for the admission of \nU.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children. Congress adopted this system to further four \nprincipal goals: reunifying families, admitting immigrants with skills that are useful to the United \nStates economy, protecting refugees and others in need of humanitarian resettlement, and \npromoting diversity. \nConsistent with these goals, Congress has set allocations for “family-based visas” (a \nminimum of 266,000), “employment-based visas” (a minimum of 144,000) and “diversity-\nbased” visas (a maximum of 55,000). 8 U.S.C. § 1151. In addition to these allocations, Congress \nhas set certain per-country limits on the numbers of visas that can be granted, so that no single \nnation can receive more than 7% of the total green cards issued in a year. 8 U.S.C. § 1152. In \nrecognition of the singular importance of family reunification, however, Congress has prioritized \nvisas for “immediate relatives,” which are defined as “the children, spouses, and parents of a \ncitizen of the United States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21 \nyears of age.” 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b). There are no limits on the number of visas granted to such \nindividuals, regardless of their country of national origin. Id. Under this system set out in the \nINA, family-based petitions account for approximately 65% of the immigrant visas granted \nevery year. The diversity lottery visa system accounts for approximately 4.5%. \nU.S.-based family members and employers may sponsor a noncitizen for an immigrant \nvisa. Once a sponsorship petition is approved, the noncitizen may apply for an immigrant visa. If \nthe applicant is outside the United States, she must apply to a U.S. consulate abroad and appear \nPAGE 5 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 6 of 18\n \nfor a consular interview. For applicants inside the United States, some may be eligible to apply \nfor immigrant visas domestically, without having to travel to a consulate, but others must leave \nthe country to appear for a consular interview abroad. Individuals in this latter category include \nnoncitizens who have accrued more than 180 days of unlawful presence in the United States but \nhave obtained an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility to excuse the unlawful presence bar under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B). See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e). Diversity visas are available through a lottery to \nindividuals from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States; the \nlottery winners self-petition and apply to a consulate for their visa. \nBefore the issuance of an immigrant visa, the noncitizen must establish that she is eligible \nfor admission to the country. Section 1182 of Title 8 is titled “Inadmissible Aliens” and sets forth \nten classes of noncitizens “ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United \nStates.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a) (prescribing the inadmissibility of, among others, noncitizens with a \ncommunicable disease of public health significance, those convicted of two or more criminal \noffenses, and those who engaged in terrorist activities). In addition, several related and \ninteracting healthcare statutes, including the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (“PRWORA”), and the \nChildren’s Health Insurance Plan Reauthorization Act, reflect Congress’s intent to expand access \nto meaningful and affordable health insurance coverage for all U.S. residents, including legal \nimmigrants, at a guaranteed minimum level of coverage. \nB.  The Proclamation \nUnder the Proclamation, an intending immigrant who has satisfied all statutory \nrequirements set out in the INA will nevertheless be permanently barred from entering the \nUnited States if that person cannot show, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, that he or she \neither “will be covered by approved health insurance” within 30 days of entering the United \nPAGE 6 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 7 of 18\n \nStates, or “possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” \nWith narrow exceptions, such as certain special Immigrant Visa applicants specifically from Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and unaccompanied biological and adopted children, the Proclamation will be \napplied to all intending immigrants. The Proclamation is set to go into effect at 12:01 am eastern \ndaylight time on November 3, 2019. The Proclamation is expected to affect nearly two-thirds of \nall legal immigrants, with a disproportionate impact on immigrants from Latin America, Africa, \nand Asia. \nThe Proclamation provides eight specific types of “approved health insurance” for an \nintending immigrant: (1) an employer-sponsored plan; (2) an “unsubsidized health plan offered \nin the individual market within a State;” (3) a short-term limited duration insurance (“STLDI”) \nplan “effective for a minimum of 364 days;” (4) a catastrophic plan; (5) a family member’s plan; \n(6) TRICARE and similar plans made available to the U.S. military; (7) a visitor health insurance \nplan “that provides adequate coverage for medical care for a minimum of 364 days;” and \n(8) Medicare. A prospective immigrant may also obtain a “health plan that provides adequate \ncoverage for medical care as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his \ndesignee,” but the Proclamation provides no guidance as to how “adequate coverage” is defined. \nSimilarly, “catastrophic plan” is undefined, and the Proclamation is unclear whether this term \nrefers generically to certain high-deductible plans or specifically to catastrophic plans defined by \nthe ACA with certain coverage parameters and eligibility requirements. In addition, although the \nACA provides various forms of financial assistance based on an enrollee’s income level, the \nACA does not refer to any of these forms of financial assistance as a “subsidy,” and the \nProclamation does not clarify what forms of assistance would render a plan “subsidized” and \ntherefore not “approved.” The Proclamation excludes from the scope of “approved health \nPAGE 7 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 8 of 18\n \ninsurance” any “subsidized” healthcare offered in the individual market within a State under the \nACA, as well as Medicaid for individuals over 18 years of age, even though some states have \nchosen to make Medicaid available to certain adults over 18 years of age, including certain new \nand recently arrived immigrants. \nThe Proclamation also contains exceptions for noncitizens “whose entry would further \nimportant United States law enforcement objectives,” or “whose entry would be in the national \ninterest,” as “determined by the Secretary of State or his designee.” Proclamation § 2(b)(vii), \n(viii). The Proclamation, however, provides no procedure for would-be immigrants either to \nlearn or to demonstrate how they would qualify for such exceptions. For the following reasons, \nthe Proclamation’s eight types of “approved health insurance” are legally or practically \nunavailable to many immigrants, including most immigrants seeking family-based visas: \n•  Medicare is effectively an impossible option: it is unavailable to \nimmigrants unless they are more than 65 years old and have been living \ncontinuously in the United States for five years. \n•  TRICARE plans and other similar plans are only available to \nmembers of the United States military, their spouses, and children up to 26 \nyears of age. \n•  Family member plans are often only available, if at all, to spouses \nand children under 27 years old. Any other relation, such as a parent and a \nchild over 27, is not normally considered a “dependent” eligible to be \nincluded in a family health insurance plan. \n•   Employer-sponsored plan: Approximately two thirds of immigrant \nvisa applicants are family-based visa applicants and therefore exceedingly \nPAGE 8 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 9 of 18\n \nunlikely to have an offer of employment before arriving in the United \nStates and acquiring work authorization. Even immigrants with employer-\nsponsored visas may not be able to show, to a consular officer’s \nsatisfaction, that they will have employer-sponsored health insurance \nwithin 30 days of their arrival. Employers are permitted under federal law \nto impose a waiting period of up to 90 days before new employees can be \ncovered by employer-sponsored coverage. One survey showed that 71% of \nemployers impose a waiting period, with waiting periods on average \nlasting 1.9 months. \n•  Catastrophic and “unsubsidized” insurance bought on an ACA \nmarketplace are only available to individuals residing within the United \nStates. Catastrophic insurance, moreover, is only available to individuals \nunder 30 years old and those who qualify for a hardship or affordability \nexception. \n•  STLDI plans may not be available to individuals who are not a \nUnited States citizen or resident. They are often unavailable to individuals \nwith pre-existing conditions. Half of the states do not offer STLDI plans \nwith coverage for 364 days, the minimum required by the Proclamation. \n•  Visitor plans often do not cover individuals with pre-existing \nconditions.  \nThe only viable options for “approved health insurance” under the Proclamation appear \nto be visitor insurance plans and possibly STLDI plans. Neither of these types of plans, however, \nare offered or purchased on ACA Exchanges. The fact that they are not offered on ACA \nPAGE 9 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 10 of 18\n \nExchanges means that they are less regulated and non-comprehensive. Unlike plans available on \nACA Exchanges, visitor and STLDI plans are not required to provide “essential health benefits,” \nwhich include hospitalization, prescription drugs, emergency services, and maternity and \nnewborn care. Moreover, they often leave individuals underinsured or effectively uninsured \nbecause they are non-comprehensive. Because visitor and STLDI plans, however, are the most \nrealistically accessible “approved health insurance” plans available to comply with the \nProclamation, the Proclamation effectively incentivizes, if not requires, prospective immigrants \nto purchase a non-comprehensive plan that will likely leave the immigrant underinsured. Indeed, \nalthough an immigrant who receives financial assistance under the ACA to purchase \ncomprehensive health insurance would be better insured than an immigrant who purchases non-\ncomprehensive visitor or STLDI insurance, the Proclamation bars the former and allows the \nlatter. \nIf an intending immigrant cannot demonstrate that she will have “approved health \ninsurance” within 30 days of her arrival, she must show that she has sufficient “financial \nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The Proclamation, however, does not \ndefine what “reasonably foreseeable medical costs” are, and it does not indicate how a consular \nofficer with no medical training should evaluate what medical costs may be “reasonably \nforeseeable” for a specific prospective immigrant, or how the consular officer should assess \nwhether that individual has sufficient “financial resources” to cover such costs. The Emergency \nNotice simply provides that a consular officer shall verbally ask questions and make the required \nassessment, and defines “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses” as “those expenses related to \nexisting medical conditions, relating to health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.” \nPAGE 10 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 11 of 18\n \nC.  Plaintiffs \nPlaintiff John Doe #1 is a United States citizen of Mexican origin who resides in \nBeaverton, Oregon, with his wife, a Mexican citizen, and his fourteen-year-old United States \ncitizen son. John Doe #1, who is not able to work due to a disability, sponsored an immigrant \nvisa for his wife so that she can have legal status to live and work in the United States. Her \nimmigrant visa consular interview is scheduled for November 6, 2019. Under the Proclamation \nand Defendants’ implementation of its requirements, John Doe #1 and his wife cannot afford or \nqualify for an “approved” health insurance option for her and he fears that they lack sufficient \nfinancial resources to pay foreseeable medical costs out of pocket. ECF 1, ¶ 14; ECF 28. \nPlaintiff Juan Ramon Morales is a United States citizen originally from Puerto Rico who \nnow resides in Liberty, New York with his wife, Vianca Morales, a Mexican citizen; their \ndaughter; and Ramon’s step-daughter. Mr. Morales has sponsored his wife for an immigrant visa \nand she is waiting to schedule her consular interview, but he is not able to add his wife to his \nemployer-sponsored health insurance or obtain another “approved” health insurance plan under \nthe Proclamation due to cost. ECF 1, ¶ 15; ECF 26. \nJane Doe #2 is a United States citizen of Nicaraguan origin and a single mother of two \nchildren who resides in Rancho Cucamonga, California. She has an approved I-130 petition for \nher parents, who are living in Nicaragua and waiting to schedule their consular interview. She \nhas been unable to find available and affordable health insurance for her parents that complies \nwith the Proclamation, and it is unlikely that they will be able to show the ability to pay for \nreasonably foreseeable medical costs as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ \nimplementation of its provisions. ECF 1, ¶ 16; ECF 29.  \nPlaintiff Jane Doe #3 is a U.S. citizen who currently resides in Los Angeles, California. \nShe is unable to work due to a disability and has insurance through Medi-Cal, California’s \nPAGE 11 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 12 of 18\n \nMedicaid program. Jane Doe #3 has an approved I-130 petition for her husband, a German \ncitizen who currently resides in Berlin, Germany and is an architect who teaches architectural \ntheory and design. Although he is gathering documents for consular processing, Jane Doe #3 \ndoes not believe that her husband will be able to prove at a consular interview that he would be \ncovered by approved health insurance within 30 days of his entry into the United States because \nthey do not believe that they have the financial resources to afford “approved” health insurance \nas defined in the Proclamation or to pay his foreseeable medical expenses out of pocket as \nrequired by the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of it. ECF 1, ¶ 17; ECF 30. \nPlaintiff Iris Angelina Castro is a United States citizen who lives in Springfield, \nMassachusetts with her son, who is a U.S. citizen. She recently became unemployed and \ncurrently has state health insurance. She has an approved I-130 visa petition for her husband, \nHermogenes Castro Molina, a Dominican citizen, so that they can reunite in the United States. \nHe is currently in the process of filing all necessary documents so that they can schedule a \nconsular interview, but they do not believe that he will be able to prove that he can obtain \navailable and affordable “approved” health insurance within 30 days of entering the U.S. or pay \nfor foreseeable medical costs as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ \nimplementation of its provisions. ECF 1, ¶ 18; ECF 24. \nPlaintiff Blake Doe is a U.S. citizen living in Corvallis, Oregon, with his wife. He has \napproved I-130 immigrant petitions for his parents, both Mexican citizens, with whom he had \nlived his entire life in Oregon until going to college at Oregon State University to study civil \nengineering. Blake Doe’s parents are currently waiting to have their consular interview \nscheduled in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Blake Doe and his parents do not believe that they would \nbe able to prove that his parents would be able to obtain available and affordable “approved” \nPAGE 12 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 13 of 18\n \nhealth insurance within 30 days of their entry into the U.S. or to pay foreseeable medical \nexpenses out of pocket as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ implementation of \nits provisions. ECF 1, ¶ 19; ECF 27. \nPlaintiff Brenda Villarruel is a U.S. citizen who currently resides in Chicago, Illinois, \nwith her United States citizen son and United States citizen parents. Ms. Villarruel works part \ntime as a licensed medical assistant. She does not have medical insurance and receives health \ncare, when necessary, through a clinic that charges based on income. Ms. Villarruel has \nsponsored an immigrant visa for her husband, a Mexican citizen who currently resides in Mexico \nCity, Mexico, and is awaiting consular processing. Ms. Villarruel and her husband do not have \nthe resources to obtain “approved” health insurance coverage for him or to pay his foreseeable \nmedical expenses out of pocket as required under the Proclamation and Defendants’ \nimplementation of its provisions. ECF 1, ¶ 20; ECF 25. \nPlaintiff Latino Network is a non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon. Latino \nNetwork’s organization mission is to educate and empower Multnomah County Latinos to \nachieve physical and mental health, safe housing, sustainable financial stability, and social \nsupport. Latino Network does so by offering a variety of programs and services, including early \nchildhood services, community-based programs, school-based programs, arts and culture \nprograms for youth, health and wellness programs, and civic leadership programs. The \nimpending effective date of the Proclamation has forced Latino Network to divert resources from \nits core activities to address the Proclamation’s fallout within the community the organization \nserves. ECF 1, ¶ 21; ECF 23. \nD.  Delay \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed in filing their motion for a TRO, \ncreating their own “emergency” and making it impossible for Defendants to have a reasonable \nPAGE 13 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 14 of 18\n \nopportunity to respond. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs primarily challenge the Proclamation, \nwhich was issued on October 4, 2019. Defendants assert that because Plaintiffs did not file their \nComplaint until October 30, 2019, and their motion for a TRO until November 1, 2019, only two \ndays before the Proclamation was to go into effect, the motion should not be granted and should \ninstead be converted to a motion for preliminary injunction. \nThe Ninth Circuit has noted that “[d]elay by itself is not a determinative factor in whether \nthe grant of interim relief is just and proper.” Aguayo ex rel. NLRB v. Tomco Carburetor \nCo., 853 F.2d 744, 750 (9th Cir. 1988). The Ninth Circuit also has noted that delay is most \nrelevant when it “suggests that ‘the harm has occurred and the parties cannot be returned to the \nstatus quo.’” Miller ex rel. NLRB v. Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr., 991 F.2d 536, 544 (9th Cir. 1993), \nvacated on rehearing en banc on other grounds, 19 F.3d 449 (9th Cir. 1994) (quoting \nTomco, 853 F.2d at 750). Additionally, the court has emphasized that a “long delay” before \nseeking injunctive relief “implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.” Oakland Tribune, Inc. \nv. Chronicle Publ’g Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985). \nThe Court does not find that the delay in this case was unreasonable given the complexity \nof the factual and legal issues presented. The Complaint includes allegations on behalf of several \nPlaintiffs residing throughout the United States, and the Court accepts that it takes time to locate \nsuch persons willing to be plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit and obtain the facts needed to support \ntheir claims. The Court also does not find the 26-day was lengthy or created unfair prejudice to \nDefendants. Plaintiffs’ Complaint and motion were filed before the alleged harm had occurred, \nand Defendants had the opportunity to respond at oral argument.  \nE.  Satisfaction of TRO Standards \nThe Proclamation relies on a single dispositive factor—the health care insurance status of \nan individual—to determine whether the individual will “financially burden” the United States. \nPAGE 14 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 15 of 18\n \nIf an individual lacks an “approved” health care insurance plan and cannot otherwise \ndemonstrate that he or she currently has the financial resources to pay for medical care, while \ndeliberately excluding from consideration insurance plans (such as ACA plans) that would \notherwise be available to that person after he or she enters the country, that individual is deemed \nto be a financial burden and the applicant will not be admitted. The Proclamation’s reliance on \nthe health care insurance status of an individual as the sole factor for determining inadmissibility \nas a public charge conflicts with 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) in at least five ways. First, Congress has \nspoken directly to the circumstances in which an individual may be deemed to become a \n“financial burden” to the United States and has rejected the Proclamation’s core premise. See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). This provision states that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the \nconsular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at \nthe time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a \npublic charge is inadmissible.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). When determining whether an \nindividual may become a public charge, the statute enumerates the factors that are to be \nconsidered “at a minimum” to include the applicant’s age; health; family status; assets, \nresources, and financial status; and education and skills. The statute outlines the permissible \nfactors in the public charge determination and nowhere mentions an individual’s health care \ninsurance status as one of the permissible factors. Given the statute’s enumeration of age and \nhealth, the statute’s omission of “health care insurance status” is important. \nSecond the statute precludes any single factor from being a dispositive factor. Indeed, the \nstatute requires a totality of the circumstances test to be applied. “[A]t a minimum” an \nindividual’s age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills \nmust be must considered to determine whether an individual will “financially burden” the United \nPAGE 15 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 16 of 18\n \nStates. The totality of the circumstances test has long been a feature of the public charge ground \neven before Congress statutorily mandated it in 1996. See, e.g., Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. \nDec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974). The Proclamation, however, conflicts with the statutory text by \ndeeming an individual to be a financial burden based solely on her health care insurance status \nand eschewing all the other statutory factors including, perhaps most incongruously, the health of \nthe individual herself. \nThird, the Proclamation’s dispositive reliance on health care insurance status contravenes \ndecades of agency interpretation. Fourth, the Proclamation’s reliance on an individual’s \naccessing short-term health care benefits as a reason to find the person a “financial burden” has \nbeen expressly rejected. City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration \nServs., 2019 WL 5100718, at *28 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2019) (the public charge statute has had a \n“longstanding allowance for short-term aid”). Fifth, the Proclamation revives a test for financial \nburden—the receipt of non-cash benefits—that Congress has rejected. In 1996, Congress enacted \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, \n§ 531, 110 Stat. 3009, 3674-75 (1996), which amended the INA by codifying five factors \nrelevant to a public charge determination. The Senate rejected the effort to include previously \nunconsidered, non-cash public benefits in the public charge test and to create a bright-line \nframework of considering whether the immigrant has received public benefits for an aggregate of \ntwelve months as “too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the same public \nassistance that many Americans need to get on their feet.” S. Rep. No. 104-249, at *63-64 (1996) \n(Senator Leahy’s remarks). Accordingly, in its final bill, Congress did not include the receipt of \nMedicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Plan, supplemental food assistance, Supplemental \nPAGE 16 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 17 of 18\n \nSecurity Income, and other means-tested public benefits as determinative of a public charge. See \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have shown, at least at this stage of the litigation, a \nsubstantial likelihood of success, or at least serious questions going to the merits, on whether \nDefendants’ actions are ultra vires and also “not in accordance with law” under the APA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 706 (2)(A); see East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742 (2018) \n(concluding that an agency had unlawfully done what the “Executive cannot do directly; amend \nthe INA”). Further, for similar reasons, Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing \nDefendants’ implementation of the Proclamation likely constitutes final agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” Organized Vill. of Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric., 795 F.3d 956, 966 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (quoting 5. U.S.C. 706(2)(A))). \nIn addition, Plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood that many, if not all, of the \noptions the Proclamation provides as “approved health insurance” are legally or practically \nimpossible for the individual Plaintiffs and the members and clients of Latino Network to \nacquire. Plaintiffs also have shown irreparable harm. Defendants argue that because any visa \napplicant who is denied a visa during the time period before any preliminary injunction might \nissue could file for reconsideration, Plaintiffs cannot suffer irreparable harm. Facing a likely risk \nof being separated from their family members and a delay in obtaining a visa to which family \nmembers would otherwise be entitled is irreparable harm. This is particularly true for Plaintiffs \nwhose family members have already obtained an I-601A waiver, which means that they have \nalready demonstrated an extreme hardship if the visa applicant were to be separated from family \nmembers. \nPAGE 17 – TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SB    Document 33    Filed 11/02/19    Page 18 of 18\n \nAlso, when the federal government is a party, the balance of the equities and public \ninterest factors merge. Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that temporary \ninjunctive relief is in the public interest because of the widespread detrimental effects that the \nProclamation will cause if it takes effect before the parties can be heard on whether the Court \nshould issue a preliminary injunction pending a final resolution on the merits.  \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n1.  Defendants are hereby temporarily restrained and enjoined from taking any action \nto implement or enforce Presidential Proclamation No. 9945 (“Presidential Proclamation on the \nSuspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United States Healthcare \nSystem”). \n2.  In the interest of justice, Plaintiffs need not provide any security and all \nrequirements under Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are waived. \n3.  The Court will hold a hearing on Friday, November 22, 2019, at 1:00 p.m. in \nCourtroom 15B of the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland, Oregon to \ndetermine whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. The Court will set a briefing \nschedule by separate order. \n4.  This Order shall expire twenty-eight (28) days after entry, unless otherwise \nextended by stipulation of the parties or by further order of the Court. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATED this 2nd day of November, 2019, at 4:15 p.m. \n              /s/ Michael H.

Bress, Circuit Judges.\nOrder by Chief Judge Thomas;\nDissent by Judge Bress\nSUMMARY*\nImmigration / Preliminary Injunction\nThe panel denied the government’s motion for a stay\npending appeal of the district court’s preliminary injunction\nenjoining Presidential Proclamation No. 9945, Suspension of\nEntry of Immigrants Who Will Financially Burden the United\nStates Health Care System.\nIssued on October 4, 2019, the Proclamation barred, with\nsome exceptions, individuals seeking to enter the United\nStates on an immigrant visa from entering unless they could\ndemonstrate that they will be covered by certain approved\nhealth insurance within 30 days of entry or that they have the\nresources to cover foreseeable healthcare costs.  Individual\nPlaintiffs are seven U.S. citizens who are sponsoring family\nmembers for immigrant visas and whose applicant family\nmembers have successfully completed the traditional steps for\nobtaining  an  immigrant  visa,  but  would be  barred  from\nentering the United States under the Proclamation.  The\n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 3 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 3\norganizational Plaintiff provides programs aimed at educating\nand empowering a community of Latinos in Oregon and\nprovides services to navigate the immigrant visa process.\nFirst, the panel concluded that the government failed to\nmeet its burden of showing irreparable harm absent a stay,\nexplaining that: 1) the government’s perceived institutional\ninjury is not “irreparable” because the government may yet\nvindicate its interests in this litigation; 2) the government’s\nclaim of harm in the form of costs to healthcare providers and\ntaxpayers by uninsured immigrants was not supported by the\nrecord,  and  the  court  was  not  required  to  accept  the\nProclamation’s conclusory findings as true; and 3) the harm\nasserted by the government is purely monetary, and such\ninjury is not normally considered irreparable.\nThe panel also concluded that the record amply supported\nthe district court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs would suffer\nirreparable harm absent preliminary injunctive relief.  The\npanel explained that, based on findings that Plaintiffs and\n60%  of  visa  applicants  would  be  unable  to  satisfy  the\nrequirements of the Proclamation, the district court concluded\nthat the Proclamation would result in prolonged separation\nfrom  family  members,  a  factor  that  this  court  has  held\nconstitutes sufficient irreparable harm.\nThe panel noted that its analysis could conclude here,\ngiven that if a stay applicant cannot show irreparable harm,\na stay may not issue, regardless of the petitioner’s proof\nregarding  the  other  stay  factors,  but  concluded  that  the\ncontext of this case  suggested that the panel should proceed\nwith examining the remaining factors.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 4 of 97\n4 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nSecond, the panel concluded that the government had not\nmet the high standard of showing a strong likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits.  In doing so, the panel observed that,\nas a motions panel, it must take care not to prejudge the\nmerits of the appeal, but rather to assess the posture of the\ncase  in  the  context  of  the  necessity  of  a  stay  pending\npresentation to a merits panel.  Further, the panel concluded\nthat the government had not shown a strong likelihood of\nsuccess on Plaintiffs’ claim that the Proclamation conflicts\nwith the Violence Against Women Act’s amendments to the\nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), the Affordable\nCare Act, and the “public charge” provision of the INA.\nThe panel also considered 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), the section\nof the INA that provides that the President may, under certain\ncircumstances, “for such a period as he shall deem necessary,\nsuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens . . . or\nimpose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to\nbe appropriate.”  The panel acknowledged that the President\nis owed broad deference with respect to this provision, but\nnonetheless concluded at this juncture, for two reasons, that\nthe  Plaintiffs  are  likely  to  succeed  in  refuting  the\ngovernment’s  contention  that  §  1182(f)  legitimizes  the\nProclamation:  1)  the  Proclamation’s  perfunctory  time\nlimitations  do  not  comport  with  the  textual  limits  of\n§ 1182(f); and 2) § 1182(f) does not provide the President\nwith limitless power to deny visas to immigrants based on\npurely long-term economic concerns.\nThird, the panel concluded that a stay would substantially\ninjure Plaintiffs, as well other parties, including Twenty-one\nstates, the District of Columbia, and the City of New York, all\nof which filed amici briefing describing the significant harm\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 5 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 5\nthey  and  other  governmental  entities  will  suffer  if  the\nProclamation goes into effect.\nFourth, the panel concluded that the public interest lies\nwith maintaining the status quo while the appeal is pending,\nexplaining that for countless decades, a stable immigration\nsystem has provided for families to be united through a visa\nsystem that did not require purchase of selected insurance\nproducts.  Given the irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs, the\nlack of irreparable harm to the United States for maintaining\nthe status quo pending resolution of this appeal, and the\ninjury to other parties if the Proclamation is immediately\nimplemented, the panel concluded that the public interest\nfavors preserving the status quo.\nFinally, the panel concluded that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in entering a nationwide injunction.  The\npanel noted that, subsequent to the preliminary injunction, the\ndistrict court certified two nationwide subclasses and that the\ngovernment had not yet sought to appeal that certification. \nBecause  the  class  here  is  nationwide,  and  because  a\nnationwide  injunction  is  necessary  to  provide  the  class\nmembers with complete relief, the panel concluded that the\nscope  of  the  injunction  is  appropriate  at  this  juncture,\nregardless of whether or not it was when originally issued. \nThus, the panel concluded that, because the certified class is\nnationwide and promotes uniformity in administering federal\nimmigration law, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nas to the scope of the injunction.\nAccordingly, the panel denied the motion and directed the\nClerk of Court to expedite the appeal.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 6 of 97\n6 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nDissenting, Judge Bress wrote that the majority’s decision\nis yet the latest example of this court allowing a universal\ninjunction  of  a  clearly  constitutional  Executive  Branch\nimmigration policy.  First, as to success on the merits, Judge\nBress concluded that the majority erred in concluding that the\nProclamation is likely unconstitutional and that it conflicts\nwith  the  INA  and  other  statutes.    Second,  Judge  Bress\nconcluded that the government established irreparable harm\nto the interests the Executive seeks to promote through the\nProclamation and to the core separation of powers principles\nthat make the Proclamation lawful, and established harm in\nthe form of costs while the injunction remains in effect. \nThird, as to harm to the opposing party, Judge Bress wrote\nplaintiffs had not established that their relatives are entitled\nto visas but for the Proclamation.  Fourth, Judge Bress\nconcluded that the public interest strongly supports staying\nthe  injunction,  stating  that  the  majority  added  a  new,\nunauthorized  stay factor:  preservation  of the status  quo. \nJudge Bress also wrote that, even if maintenance of the status\nquo were among the factors that courts consider in this\ncontext, the actual status quo is a legal environment in which\nthe Proclamation is authorized.\nFinally, as to the scope of the injunction, Judge Bress\nwrote that the majority’s reliance on the district court’s recent\nclass certification decision was a concession that the scope of\nthe injunction was invalid when issued.  Judge Bress also\nconcluded  that  the  problem  with  many  nationwide\ninjunctions,  as  here,  is  that  they  are  premised  on  class\ncertification orders that are themselves infirm.  Further, Judge\nBress  wrote  that  this  circuit  has  co-opted  the  policy  of\npromoting uniform immigration laws as a justification for\ncourts issuing nationwide injunctions of Executive Branch\nimmigration policies.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 7 of 97\nDOE #1 V.

TRUMP\nORDER\nTHOMAS, Chief Judge:\nIn this case, we consider the government’s motion to stay\nthe  district  court’s  preliminary  injunction  enjoining  a\nPresidential  Proclamation  restricting  family-sponsored\nimmigrants from entering the United States without acquiring\nspecified health insurance.  We deny the motion.  We direct\nthe Clerk of Court to expedite the appeal.\nI\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), Pub. L.\nNo. 82-414, 66 Stat. 163 (1952), allows noncitizens to apply\nfor an immigrant visa to permit them to permanently reside in\nthe  United  States.    8  U.S.C.  §§  1101(a)(15),  1181(a),\n1182(a)(7), 1201(a).  Before an individual may apply for an\nimmigrant visa, a prospective employer or a family member\nwho is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident\nmust file a sponsorship petition on behalf of the individual. \nId. §§ 1151(a)–(b), 1153.  The petition is submitted to and\napproved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,\nwhich forwards the approved petition to the National Visa\nCenter.  See id. § 1201.  The immigrant must then complete\nvisa processing and schedule an in-person interview before a\nconsular officer at a U.S. embassy or consulate.  See id.\n§ 1202(a), (e); 22 C.F.R. § 42.62.  The consular officer then\nmakes a determination to issue or refuse the visa application.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1), (g); 22 C.F.R. §§ 42.71, 42.81(a). \nIf  an  immigrant  falls  into  one  of  the  ten  categories\nenumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a), they are deemed ineligible\nfor a visa and ineligible for admission into the United States. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 11 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 11\nCurrently,  insured  status  is  not  one  of  the  criteria  for\neligibility.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).\nOn  October  4,  2019,  the  President  issued  the\nProclamation in dispute, Proclamation No. 9945, entitled\nSuspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially\nBurden the United States Healthcare System, in Order to\nProtect the Availability of Healthcare Benefits for Americans,\n84  Fed.  Reg.  53,991.    The  Proclamation  identified  the\nperceived problem of uncompensated medical expenses in the\nUnited States, stating, without citation to any source, “data\nshow that lawful immigrants are about three times more\nlikely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.” \nTo address this issue, the Proclamation barred, with some\nexceptions, individuals seeking to enter the United States on\nan immigrant visa from entering the United States unless they\ncould  demonstrate  that  they  will  be  covered  by  certain\napproved health insurance within 30 days of entry or that they\nhave the resources to cover foreseeable healthcare costs.  Id.\nat 53,992.\nThe Proclamation identified a narrow definition of what\nconstitutes “an approved health insurance plan,” namely:\n(i) an employer-sponsored plan, including a\nretiree  plan,  association  health  plan,  and\ncoverage  provided  by  the  Consolidated\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985;\n(ii) an unsubsidized health plan offered in the\nindividual market within a State;\n(iii)  a  short-term  limited  duration  health\npolicy  effective  for  a  minimum  of\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 12 of 97\n12 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\n364 days—or until the beginning of planned,\nextended travel outside the United States;\n(iv) a catastrophic plan;\n(v) a family member’s plan;\n(vi) a medical plan under chapter 55 of title\n10, United States Code, including coverage\nunder the TRICARE program;\n(vii)  a  visitor  health  insurance  plan  that\nprovides adequate coverage for medical care\nfor a minimum of 364 days—or until the\nbeginning of planned, extended travel outside\nthe United States;\n(viii)  a  medical  plan  under  the  Medicare\nprogram; or\n(ix)  any  other  health  plan  that  provides\nadequate  coverage  for  medical  care  as\ndetermined by the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services or his designee.\nId.\nBy the terms of the Proclamation, Medicaid does not\nconstitute “approved health insurance” for individuals over\nthe age of 18.  Id.\nThe President directed that the Proclamation become\neffective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on November 3,\n2019.  On October 30, Plaintiffs filed this action.  The\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 13 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 13\nindividual  Plaintiffs  are  seven  U.S.  citizens  who  are\nsponsoring family members for immigrant visas and whose\napplicant family members have successfully completed the\ntraditional steps for obtaining an immigrant visa, but would\nbe  barred  from  entering  the  United  States  under  the\nProclamation.  The organizational Plaintiff is the Latino\nAction Network, an organization that provides programs\naimed at educating and empowering Latinos in Multnomah\nCounty, Oregon.  The Latino Action Network also provides\nservices to navigate the immigrant visa process.\nOn  November  2,  2019,  the  district  court  issued  a\ntemporary restraining order precluding the Proclamation from\ntaking effect.  See Doe # 1 v. Trump, 414 F. Supp.3d 1307\n(D. Or. 2019).  On November 26, before the expiration of the\ntemporary  restraining  order,  the  district  court  issued  a\nnationwide  preliminary  injunction  prohibiting\nimplementation of the Proclamation.  Doe v. Trump, 418 F.\nSupp. 3d 573, 604 (D. Or. 2019).  In doing so, the district\ncourt applied the familiar Winter factors, concluding that the\nPlaintiffs had shown that (1) they were likely to succeed on\nthe merits; (2) they were likely to suffer irreparable harm in\nthe absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities\ntipped in their favor; and (4) that a preliminary injunction was\nin the public interest.  Id. at 579 (citing Winter v. Nat. Res.\nDefense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  The United\nStates filed this emergency motion to stay the district court\norder pending appeal.\nWhile this stay motion was pending, on April 7, 2020, the\ndistrict court certified the following two subclasses:\nThe U.S. Petitioner Subclass: Individuals in\nthe United States who currently have or will\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 14 of 97\n14 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nhave an approved or pending petition to the\nUnited  States  government  to  sponsor  a\nnoncitizen family member for an immigrant\nvisa; and whose sponsored family member is\nsubject to the Proclamation and unable to\ndemonstrate to a consular officer's satisfaction\nthat he or she “will be covered by approved\nhealth insurance” within 30 days after entry or\nwill be able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable\nmedical costs;” and\nThe Visa Applicant Subclass: Individuals\nwho  are  foreign  nationals  who  (I)  have\napplied for or will soon apply to the United\nStates  government  for  an  immigrant  visa;\n(ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted the\nvisa; but (iii) are subject to the Proclamation\nand unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction\nof a consular officer that they “will be covered\nby approved health insurance” within 30 days\nafter  entry  or  will  be  able  “to  pay  for\nreasonably foreseeable medical costs.”\nII\nA request for a stay pending appeal is committed to the\nexercise of judicial discretion.  Virginian Ry. Co. v. United\nStates, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926).  A party requesting a stay\npending  appeal  “bears  the  burden  of  showing  that  the\ncircumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.”  Nken v.\nHolder,  556  U.S.  418,  433–34  (2009).    In  considering\nwhether  to  exercise  our  discretion  in  granting  the\nGovernment’s motion to stay the preliminary injunction, we\napply the familiar standard set forth by the Supreme Court in\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 15 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 15\nNken, namely: (1) whether the Government has made a strong\nshowing  of  the  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits;\n(2) whether the appellants will be irreparably injured absent\na stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure other\nparties; and (4) where the public interest lies.  Id. at 426. “The\nfirst two factors . . . are the most critical.”  Id. at 434.  We\nconsider the last two factors if the first two factors are\nsatisfied.  Id. at 435.  We review the scope of the district\ncourt’s  preliminary  injunction  for  abuse  of  discretion. \nCalifornia v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 568 (9th Cir. 2018), cert.\ndenied sub nom. Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan\nResidence v. California, 139 S. Ct. 2716 (2019).\nIII\nA\nNken instructed “that if the petition has not made a certain\nthreshold showing regarding irreparable harm . . . then a stay\nmay not issue, regardless of the petitioner’s proof regarding\nthe other stay factors.”  Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962,\n965 (9th Cir. 2011) (per curium) (citing Nken, 556 U.S.\nat 433–34).  We therefore begin our Nken analysis with\nconsideration of irreparable harm.  Cf. Al Otro Lado v. Wolf,\n952 F.3d 999, 1007 (9th Cir. 2020) (listing the Nken factors\nand explaining, “We first consider the government’s showing\non irreparable harm, then discuss the likelihood of success on\nthe merits under the sliding scale approach”).\nThe government has failed to meet its burden of showing\nirreparable harm.  In the context of a stay request, “simply\nshowing  some  possibility  of  irreparable  injury”  is\ninsufficient.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (citation and internal\nquotation  marks  omitted).    Rather,  at  this  juncture,  the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 16 of 97\n16 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ngovernment has the burden of showing that irreparable injury\nis likely to occur during the period before the appeal is\ndecided.  Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 968.  The government did\nnot satisfy its burden.\nThe government first argues that it will suffer irreparable\nharm  because  the  preliminary  injunction  prevents  “the\nPresident  from  taking  action  effectuating  an  Act  of\nCongress.”  But the question of whether the Proclamation\nconflicts  with  congressionally  set  qualifications  for\nimmigrant  visas  or  exceeds  the  President’s  authority  to\nchange these qualifications is at the core of this dispute, to be\nresolved at the merits stage of this case.  Thus, the harm of\nsuch a perceived institutional injury is not “irreparable,”\nbecause the government “may yet pursue and vindicate its\ninterests in the full course of this litigation.”  Washington v.\nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1168 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curium),\ncert. denied sub nom. Golden v. Washington, 138 S. Ct. 448\n(2017).    Indeed,  if  we  were  to  adopt  the  government’s\nassertion that the irreparable harm standard is satisfied by the\nfact of executive action alone, no act of the executive branch\nasserted to be inconsistent with a legislative enactment could\nbe the subject of a preliminary injunction.  That cannot be so.\nThe government next argues that it will be irreparably\nharmed during the pendency of the appeal because of the\nalleged substantial cost to healthcare providers and taxpayers\nby  uninsured  immigrants.    For  support,  the  government\nsimply cites to the statement in the Proclamation that recent\nimmigrants are three times more likely than citizens to lack\nhealth insurance.  There is no citation in the Proclamation for\nthis statistic, nor is one to be found anywhere in the record. \nNor  could  the  government  provide  any  source  for  this\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 17 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 17\nassertion  in  briefing  or  at  oral  argument.    And  the\nProclamation contains no further cost quantification.\nBy contrast, the Plaintiffs placed into the record evidence\nthat uninsured immigrants represent only 0.3% of American\nadults  and  only  2.9%  of  uninsured  adults.    The  record\nevidence also shows that uninsured immigrants use less than\n0.06% of total American medical resources and only 0.08%\nof emergency service expenditures.  These statistics include\nillegal as well as legal immigrants, so the numbers pertinent\nhere may be considerably lower.  The record further indicates\nthat  immigrants  are  more  likely  to  represent  “favorable\ninsurance  risk[s]”  in  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)\nmarketplaces because they tend to be relatively healthier than\nthe normal insured population and use fewer healthcare goods\nand services.  For instance, in California, immigrants who are\ninsured  through  an  ACA-compliant  plan  (which,  if\nsubsidized, are not permitted under the Proclamation) have\n10% lower medical claims than citizen enrollees in the same\nplans.  As a result of excluding low-risk consumers, the\noverall health of the risk pool will decrease, resulting in\nincreased  premiums  for  all  consumers  using  state\nmarketplaces.\nThe  government  claims  that  we  are  precluded  from\nreviewing the Proclamation’s conclusory findings and must\naccept them as true.  This assertion runs afoul of Nken, which\nplaces the burden on the government, and instructs us only to\nexercise our discretion to enter a stay when irreparable harm\nis probable, not merely possible.  556 U.S. at 434.  The\ngovernment  cannot  meet  this  burden  by  submitting\nconclusory factual assertions and speculative arguments that\nare unsupported in the record.  See Azar, 911 F.3d at 581.  In\nthis  respect,  this  Proclamation’s  findings  stand  in  stark\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 18 of 97\n18 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ncontrast to the proclamation’s findings in Trump v. Hawaii,\n138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018).  That case involved a proclamation\nthat set forth “extensive findings,” which the President found\nafter  ordering  the  relevant  agencies  to  “conduct  a\ncomprehensive evaluation” of the countries affected by the\nproclamation, and the proclamation then tailored its findings\nto the agencies’ recommendations.  See id. at 2408.  Thus, in\nassessing whether the government has met its burden, we\nmust examine and review the entire record, not simply rely on\none unsupported conclusory statement.  See Washington,\n847 F.3d  at 1162–63.\nEven  if  we  credit  the  Proclamation’s  assertions,  the\ngovernment has not demonstrated that the healthcare system\nwill be irreparably burdened while this appeal is pending. \nThe record evidence shows that many of the immigrants\naffected by the Proclamation could obtain some form of\ninsurance  that  would  reduce  their  already  minimal\ncontribution to healthcare costs, but these immigrants are\nnonetheless inadmissible under the Proclamation because\nthey cannot obtain an “approved” health insurance plan or\ncannot obtain a plan within the 30-day deadline.  In short, the\nrecord  evidence  shows  that  the  impact  of  uninsured\nimmigrants on uncompensated healthcare costs is minimal,\nand that many of the affected immigrants could obtain health\ninsurance if permitted to look beyond the plans and 30-day\nlimitation  in  the  Proclamation.    The  government  has\nsubmitted no evidence disputing these points.\nFurther, the harm asserted by the government is purely\nmonetary, and “‘monetary injury is not normally considered\nirreparable.’”  hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp., 938 F.3d\n985,  993  (9th  Cir.  2019)  (quoting  Los  Angeles  Mem’l\nColiseum Comm’n v. Nat’l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197,\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 19 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 19\n1202 (9th Cir. 1980)).  In addition, monetary injury to third\nparties, such as health care providers, or to the economy in\ngeneral provides an even weaker justification for a finding of\n“irreparable harm.”  After all, the Nken irreparable harm\nstandard is “whether the applicant will be irreparably injured\nabsent a stay.”  556 U.S. at 426 (emphasis added).\nBy contrast, the district court concluded that the evidence\ndemonstrated that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm\nabsent preliminary injunctive relief and that the government\nwas unlikely to succeed in showing otherwise.  Doe, 418 F.\nSupp. 3d at 599.  The Plaintiffs submitted evidence that all\nseven individual Plaintiffs are either unable to afford an\n“approved” plan, unable to add the immigrant family member\nto an existing employer-sponsored plan, unable to acquire an\napproved  plan  within  the  30-day  deadline,  or  lack  the\nresources to demonstrate they could independently pay for\nforeseeable medical costs.  See id. at 584–86.\nThe district court concluded that the Proclamation likely\nwould negatively affect approximately 60% of all immigrant\nvisa applicants.  Id. at 597.  Plaintiffs aver, citing data from\nthe United States Census Bureau, that approximately 375,000\nimmigrants each year—primarily those seeking to enter the\nUnited  States  on  family-sponsored  petitions—would  be\naffected,  and  potentially  precluded  from  obtaining  an\nimmigrant visa, by the Proclamation.\nBased on the evidence in the record, the district court\nfound that the approved insurance plans delineated in the\nProclamation  were  “legally  or  practically  unavailable  to\nintending, or prospective, immigrants.”  Id. at 583.  The\ndistrict court found that employer-based plans often had a\nwaiting  period  that  exceeded  the  Proclamation’s  30-day\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 20 of 97\n20 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ndeadline and highlighted the fact that the prohibition against\nobtaining subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act\nrendered  that  market,  for  the  most  part,  inaccessible  to\narriving immigrants.  Id.  It also highlighted the fact that\nShort Term Limited Duration Insurance plans, which were\namong the Proclamation’s “approved” plans, are banned in\nCalifornia, and that Oregon’s contract term requirements\nmake such plans ineligible under the Proclamation there.  Id. \nThe district court underscored that reliance on Medicaid for\nany  immigrant  over  the  age  of  18  is  prohibited  by  the\nProclamation.\nAs  to  the  other  “approved”  plans,  the  district  court\nexplained that:\nFamily-member plans are only available to\napplicants  younger  than  27  years  old.\nVisitor’s  insurance  plans  are  designed  for\nshort-term  visits,  have  caps  on  individual\ncoverage  and  lifetime  benefits,  and  often\nexclude preexisting conditions, mental health\nconditions, and maternity care. Such plans\noften  result  in  significant  uncompensated\ncare.  People who receive insurance through\nstate Medicaid programs may not be able to\nadd  their  family  members  to  their  plan.\nCatastrophic  plans  are  only  available  to\npeople who are already legally present. Even\nthen, only people under 30 (or who obtain a\nspecial hardship exemption) are eligible to\nenroll.    TRICARE  is  available  only  to\nmembers of the United States military and\ntheir close relatives.  Medicare is perhaps the\nleast feasible option—only intending [that]\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 21 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 21\nimmigrants older than 65 who have already\nbeen living continuously in the United States\nfor five years may enroll.\nDoe, 418 F. Supp. 3d at 583–84.\nThe  district  court  concluded,  based  on  the  record\nevidence, that the Proclamation would result in prolonged\nseparation from family members, a factor that we have held\nconstitutes sufficient irreparable harm.  Hawai’i v. Trump,\n878 F.3d 662, 699 (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d on other grounds\nand remanded, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018); see also Washington,\n847 F.3d at 1168–69.  For example, the district court found\nthat one of the Plaintiffs risks having his wife’s I-601A\nwaiver automatically revoked if she is denied a visa at her\ninterview.  See Doe, 418 F. Supp. 3d at 598.  The district\ncourt further found that Plaintiffs who have already secured\nI-601A waivers through their family member sponsors had a\nhigh risk of being forced to leave the United States for an\nindefinite period of time.  Id.  Based on the record, the district\ncourt determined that the Plaintiffs were unlikely to acquire\none of the “approved health insurance” plans set forth in the\nProclamation, but were otherwise likely qualified for entry\nunder § 1182(a).  Id.  In sum, without reciting all of the\nrecord evidence, the record amply supported the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable\nharm.\nUltimately,  the  government  has  failed  to  sustain  its\nburden of establishing that it would suffer irreparable harm\nabsent a stay of the preliminary injunction pending a hearing\nby a merits panel. The record supports the district court’s\nconclusion that the Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm\nabsent a preliminary injunction.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 22 of 97\n22 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nB\nOur  Nken analysis could conclude here, given that if a\nstay applicant cannot show irreparable harm, “a stay may not\nissue, regardless of the petitioner’s proof regarding the other\nstay factors.”  Leiva-Perez, 640 F.3d at 965.  However, the\ncontext of this case suggests that we should proceed with\nexamining the remaining Nken factors.\nThe second most important Nken factor is whether the\napplicant has made a strong showing of the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 426.  As a\nmotions panel, we must take care not to prejudge the merits\nof the appeal, but rather to assess the posture of the case in\nthe context of the necessity of a stay pending presentation to\na merits panel.  See Washington, 847 F.3d at 1168. Thus, we\nwill not address the merits in detail, but only as necessary to\napply the Nken factors.  Here, the government has not met the\nhigh standard of showing a strong likelihood of success on\nthe merits.\n1\nThe  government  has  not  shown  that  it  has  a  strong\nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  Plaintiffs’  claim  that  the\nProclamation conflicts with the Violence Against Women\nAct’s (“VAWA”) amendments to the INA.  See 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(E).  Indeed, on this claim the government has\nmade no showing at all.\nThe  VAWA  amendments  exempted  from  the  public\ncharge  exclusion  certain  immigrant  relatives  of  victims\nof violent crimes, such as felony assault, sexual assault,\nincest,  kidnapping,  or  human  trafficking.    8  U.S.C.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 23 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 23\n§ 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii).  These amendments also exempted\nvictims  of  battering  and  extreme  cruelty.    8  U.S.C.\n§ 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(vi).  Congress expressly provided that\nthese  immigrants—including  the  spouses,  children,  and\nparents of violent crime victims—were categorically exempt\nfrom the financial burden or “public charge” provisions of the\nINA.  Id.\nThe Proclamation makes no such exemption.  Rather, it\neffectively prohibits family members of violent crime victims\nfrom obtaining visas and joining their families in the United\nStates  by  declaring  them  to  be  financial  burdens  and\nineligible, directly contradicting VAWA.  This preclusion\ncontravenes the well-settled principle that the President’s\npowers are executive, not legislative,  in nature.  “[T]he\nPresident’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed\nrefutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.”  Youngstown\nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952).  The\nPresident’s authority to act “must stem either from an act of\nCongress or from the Constitution itself.”  Id. at 585.  Here,\nCongress has enacted the VAWA amendments specifically to\nenable the subject immigrants to qualify for admission and\nvisas, see 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(vi), and “[t]here is\nno provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President\nto enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.”  Clinton v. City of\nNew York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998).\nThe government does not respond to the merits of this\nchallenge; it only suggests that the statutory conflict does not\naffect  many  people.    Of  course,  this  consideration  is\nirrelevant to the determination of whether the government has\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success of prevailing on\nthe VAWA issue.  By contrast, Plaintiffs point out that\nimmigrant  family  members of victims of violent  crimes\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 24 of 97\n24 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ncomprise at least 20 categories of noncitizens seeking to enter\nthe United States with an immigrant visa.  See 22 C.F.R.\n§ 42.11.\nAt this stage, the government has failed to make a strong\nshowing that it is likely to prevail on Plaintiffs’ claim that the\nProclamation conflicts with the Violence Against Women\nAct.\n2\nThe government has also not sustained its burden of\nshowing  that  it  has  a  strong  likelihood  of  success  of\nprevailing on Plaintiffs’ claim that the Proclamation violates\nthe ACA.  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 18021 to 18024, 18031; see also\n26 U.S.C. § 36B.  The government has not submitted any\nevidence to indicate that it is likely to succeed on this claim.\nIn enacting the ACA, Congress authorized the creation of\nstate-based markets that present consumers with multiple\ninsurance coverage choices so that consumers can compare\nand purchase plans in an effort to “increase the number of\nAmericans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost\nof health care.”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S.\nCt. 2566, 2580 (2012).  To purchase insurance in a state’s\nmarketplace, an individual must prove that they reside in the\nUnited States or a territory thereof and that they are “lawfully\npresent.”    42  U.S.C.  §  18032(f)(1)(A)(ii);  45  C.F.R.\n§ 155.305(a)(1)–(3).  To incentivize the purchase of insurance\nplans  through  ACA  marketplaces,  Congress  provided\npremium tax credits to offset the costs of purchasing an\ninsurance plan and expressly extended the availability of\nthose credits to any taxpayer who “is an alien lawfully present\nin the United States.”  26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 25 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 25\nDespite Congress’s clear intent to extend these tax credits\nto legal immigrants, the Proclamation explicitly excludes\nsuch “subsidized plans” from the list of approved health\ninsurance plans.  As a result, an immigrant attempting to\nlegally enter the United States will not have access to ACA\ntax credits as Congress intended.  Compare 84 Fed. Reg. at\n53,992 to 26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii).  And, unless an\nimmigrant succeeds in searching for, finding, and paying for\neligible insurance—which is unlikely—they will not be able\nto legally immigrate, even if otherwise eligible under the\ncriteria Congress established.\nAdditionally,  the  government’s  contention  that  an\nimmigrant may satisfy the Proclamation by purchasing a plan\nthat does not include tax credits (i.e., an “unsubsidized” plan)\nunder the ACA is, in practice, nearly impossible, even though\nsuch  plans  are  technically  “approved”  under  the\nProclamation.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,992.  An immigrant\nmay only participate in the ACA marketplace after they have\nestablished both their residency and lawful presence, but the\nimmigrant cannot reside in and be legally present in the\nUnited  States  under  the  Proclamation  without  first\npurchasing “approved” health insurance.  See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 18032(f)(1)(A)(ii); 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(a)(1)–(3).  The\nimmigrant is consequently left in a Catch-22: they cannot\nobtain an “approved” unsubsidized insurance plan unless they\nhave  been  legally  admitted,  but  they  cannot  be  legally\nadmitted unless they have obtained an “approved” insurance\nplan.  Thus, the Proclamation bars immigrants from accessing\nsubsidized insurance plans despite Congress’s express intent\nto  extend  those  plans  to  legal  immigrants,  26  U.S.C.\n§ 36B(c)(1)(B)(ii), and it essentially prohibits immigrants\nfrom obtaining an unsubsidized plan despite such plans being\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 26 of 97\n26 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\n“approved” under the Proclamation.  The government has not\nseriously contested this claim.\nIn sum, given that the evidence in the record supports a\nconclusion that the Proclamation prevents otherwise eligible\nimmigrants from accessing either subsidized or unsubsidized\nhealth insurance plans as Congress intended and instead\nrequires them to obtain—if they can—different, lower quality\ninsurance to be eligible for a visa, we conclude that the\ngovernment has not shown that it is likely to succeed on this\nclaim.\n3\nThe government has also not sustained its burden of\nshowing  that  it  has  a  strong  likelihood  of  success  of\nprevailing on Plaintiffs’ claims that the Proclamation violates\nthe INA.  Although we leave a complete analysis of these\nclaims to the merits panel, several of these claims are worthy\nof discussion at this stage, in light of the serious questions on\nthe merits Plaintiffs raise.  See All. for the Wild Rockies v.\nCottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1137 (9th Cir. 2011).\nFirst, the Proclamation is connected in its avowed purpose\nto the INA’s “public charge” provision.  That provision states\nthat “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at\nthe time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the\nAttorney General at the time of application for admission or\nadjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public\ncharge is inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The\nstatute  lists  various  factors  that  the  consular  office  can\nconsider.  Health insurance is not among them.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 27 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 27\nMore importantly, the statute requires that all of the\nspecified factors should be considered in determining whether\nan  applicant  should  be  deemed  a  financial  burden  and\nconsequently inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B).  The\nProclamation eviscerates the statutory scheme by making the\nacquisition of designated forms of health insurance the sole\nconsideration of whether an applicant should be excluded\nfrom consideration for a family visa.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at\n53,992.  Any argument contending that the Proclamation\ncomplements the public charge statutory scheme is therefore\nincorrect.\nRegarding § 1182(a)(4)(B), we have recognized that this\nprovision establishes “factors [that] are to be considered ‘at\na minimum,’” but “[o]ther factors may be considered as well,\ngiving officials considerable discretion in their decisions.” \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 F.3d 773, 972\n(9th Cir. 2019).  The Proclamation does not permit any\nexercise  of  official  discretion,  as  the  enumerated\n§ 1182(a)(4)(B) factors do, but instead imposes an absolute\nbar on the entry of uninsured immigrants.  For instance, one\nof the individual Plaintiffs has submitted evidence that he\ncould add his wife to his employer’s healthcare plan once she\nobtained a social security card, but social security cards are\nnot mailed quickly enough to meet the 30-day deadline\nmandated by the Proclamation.  Even in this situation, the\nconsular  officer  has  no  discretion  to  consider  that  the\nPlaintiff’s wife can obtain an approved health insurance plan\nand that this factor would weigh against finding that she is\nlikely to become a public charge under § 1182(a)(4)(B). \nInstead the officer must find that she is inadmissible because\nshe cannot obtain this insurance within 30 days.  Without the\nProclamation,  the  officer  would  have  the  discretion  to\nconsider her admissible, as § 1182(a)(4)(B) intended.  In sum,\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 28 of 97\n28 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nthe Proclamation’s health insurance requirement supplants\nthe  discretion  afforded  to  consular  officers  in\n§ 1182(a)(4)(B).\nSecond, the Plaintiffs raise serious questions related to\n§ 1182(f) of the INA.  This section of the INA provides that,\nwhen “the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any\nclass of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to\nthe interests of the United States,” then he may, “for such a\nperiod as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all\naliens or any class of aliens . . . or impose on the entry of\naliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  Section 1182(f) “exudes deference to the\nPresident.”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408.  We acknowledge\nthis  broad  deference,  but  nonetheless  conclude  at  this\njuncture, for two reasons, that the Plaintiffs are likely to\nsucceed  in  refuting  the  government’s  contention  that\n§  1182(f)  legitimizes  the  Proclamation:  first,  the\nProclamation’s perfunctory time limitations do not comport\nwith the textual limits of § 1182(f); and second, § 1182(f)\ndoes not provide the President with limitless power to deny\nvisas to immigrants based on purely long-term economic\nconcerns.\nWe first consider whether the Proclamation comports\nwith the temporal limitations of § 1182(f) established by the\nstatute itself: that the President has the power to “suspend”\nthe entrance of aliens “for such period as he shall deem\nnecessary.”\n“[A]s with any statute, ‘we look first to its language,\ngiving the words used their ordinary meaning.’”  Roberts v.\nSea-Land Servs., Inc., 566 U.S. 93, 100 (2012) (quoting\nIngalls Shipbuilding Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 29 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 29\nProgs., 519 U.S. 248 (1997)).  Ordinarily, to “suspend”\nmeans to “cause to stop temporarily,” Suspend, MERRIAM-\nWEBSTER DICTIONARY (2019), or “connotes a deferral till\nlater,” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (citation omitted).  The\nProclamation summarily states that the entrance of “aliens\nwho will burden the healthcare system is hereby suspended,”\nbut the mere use of the word “suspend” does not remedy the\nfact that the Proclamation omits any indication that the health\ninsurance  requirement  is  temporary.    See  84  Fed.  Reg.\nat  53,992.    Instead,  the  Proclamation  ties  the  putative\nsuspension to the problem of uncompensated healthcare costs,\na  speculative  argument  given  that  this  problem  has  no\napparent resolution under the current healthcare system.\nBy the Proclamation’s own terms, it does not have an\nendpoint.  Rather, it only requires periodic status reports and\nmerely provides that if the Secretary of State, after consulting\nother officials, “determines that circumstances no longer\nwarrant the continued effectiveness of the suspension . . . the\nSecretary  shall  immediately  advise  the  President.”    See\n84 Fed. Reg. at 53,993.  There is no requirement that the\nPresident act on the advice.  Although § 1182(f) does not\nrequire an explicit duration, see Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2410,\nthe lack of an explicit time limitation is problematic in light\nof the absence of any language that suggests even an implicit\nlimitation, such as a limit measured by the occurrence of\nsome future event or condition.  The Proclamation here is\ntherefore distinguishable from the Proclamation at issue in\nHawaii, which “ma[de] clear that its ‘conditional restrictions’\nwill remain in force only so long as necessary to ‘address’ the\nidentified  ‘inadequacies  and  risks’  within  the  covered\nnations.”  Id.  To achieve its goal, the Hawaii Proclamation\nestablished “an ongoing process to engage covered nations\nand assess every 180 days whether the entry restrictions\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 30 of 97\n30 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nshould be modified or terminated,” and the Proclamation\nstated that it aimed to “‘relax[ ] or remove[ ]’ the entry\nrestrictions ‘as soon as possible.’”  Id.\nBy contrast, the Proclamation here includes no suggestion\nthat the health insurance requirement is temporally limited by\nanything, including the overall reduction in uncompensated\nhealthcare costs.  Although the Secretary of State will review\nthe effectiveness of the program in 180 days and, from then\non, on a yearly basis, see 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,993, there is no\nlanguage that suggests that the requirement will be removed\n“as soon as possible,” or when any specified circumstance\nchanges.  Cf. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2410.  Furthermore, unlike\nthe Proclamation in Hawaii, which was promulgated after\nDHS  and  other  agencies  “conducted  a  comprehensive\nevaluation of every single country’s compliance with the\ninformation and risk assessment baseline,” id. at 2408, the\nProclamation here was not issued following any sort of\ncomprehensive  agency  review  supported  by  data-driven\nanalysis.  Indeed, the government has submitted no evidence\nto suggest that the health insurance requirement will reduce\nuncompensated healthcare costs in such a way as to render\nthe limitation feasibly temporary.\nFor example, the Proclamation states that uncompensated\nhealthcare costs have “exceeded $35 billion in each of the last\n10 years,” and suggests that this figure could be lowered by\nrefusing  to  admit  immigrants  who  lack  approved  health\ninsurance.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,991.  However, data in the\nrecord indicates that uncompensated health care costs have\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 31 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 31\nremained around $35 billion since at least 2001.1  As stated\nabove,  we  credit  the  Plaintiffs’  evidence  that  uninsured\nimmigrants contribute minimally to this amount.  These facts\ncall into question whether the Proclamation is consistent with\nthe  direction  to  “suspend”  immigration  for  so  long  as\nnecessary to effectuate the government’s goal of decreasing\nuncompensated healthcare costs.\nThe Proclamation’s  longevity  is contingent upon the\ndiminishment of uncompensated healthcare costs—costs that\nhave remained stable for at least two decades—which it\npurports  to  reduce  by  restricting  entry  of  a  class  of\nimmigrants that has been shown not to significantly affect\nthat figure, and whose dollar impact on uncompensated costs\nwill likely remain static, whatever happens to uncompensated\ncosts in general.  Consequently, the likely ineffectiveness of\nthe  health  insurance  requirement  suggests  that\nuncompensated care costs will remain high, and the perceived\n“necessity” of the Proclamation could therefore continue in\nperpetuity.  Cf. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2410 (“[W]hen a\npresident suspends entry in response to a diplomatic dispute\nor  policy  concern,  he  may  link  the  duration  of  those\nrestrictions, implicitly or explicitly, to the resolution of the\ntriggering condition.”).  In short, the Proclamation’s failure\nto explicitly or implicitly establish any time constraints on the\nhealth insurance prohibition raises serious questions as to\n1  See  INSTITUTE  OF  MEDICINE  (US)  COMMITTEE  ON  THE\nCONSEQUENCES OF UNINSURANCE, HIDDEN COSTS, VALUES LOST 47\n(2003) (available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ books/NBK221662/);\nsee also American Hospital Association, Uncompensated Hospital Care\nCost Fact Sheet 3 (January 2019) (https://www.aha.org/system/files/2019-\n01/uncompensated-care-fact-sheet-jan-2019.pdf)  (establishing  that\nuncompensated healthcare costs totaled approximately $21.5 billion in\n2001, which is roughly $32 billion when adjusted for inflation).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 32 of 97\n32 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nwhether the Proclamation is a “suspension” according to the\nplain meaning of the term in § 1182(f).\nWe  turn  now  to  Plaintiffs’  second  challenge  to  the\ngovernment’s arguments concerning § 1182(f)—namely, that\nthe President exceeded even the broad authority prescribed to\nhim in § 1182(f) when he issued the Proclamation.  Based on\nthe evidence in the record and the stated objectives of the\nProclamation, we conclude that the government is not likely\nto succeed on this issue either.\nWe acknowledge that “[b]y its plain language, § 1182(f)\ngrants the President broad discretion to suspend the entry of\naliens into the United States.”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408. \nNonetheless,  the  substantive  scope  of  this  power  is  not\nlimitless.  The “sole prerequisite set forth in § 1182(f) is that\nthe President ‘find[ ]’ that the entry of the covered aliens\n‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.’” \nId.    The  President  satisfied  this  prerequisite  in  Hawaii\nbecause “the entry policy [in the Proclamation was] plausibly\nrelated to the Government’s stated objective to protect the\ncountry and improve vetting processes.”  Id. at 2420.  Thus,\nthere,  the  President  acted  within  the  traditional  spheres\nauthorized by § 1182(f): in the context of international affairs\nand  national  security,  and  working  in  tandem  with  the\ncongressional goals of vetting individuals from countries\nidentified as threats through an agency review.  See id.\nat 2409, 2412.\nBy contrast, the Proclamation here deals with a purely\ndomestic economic problem: uncompensated healthcare costs\nin the United States.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,991.  We reject\nthe government’s argument that the Proclamation implicates\nthe President’s foreign affairs powers simply because the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 33 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 33\nProclamation  affects immigrants.   Cf.  E. Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant v. Trump, 950 F.3d 1242, 1279 (9th Cir. 2020)\n(“Broadly  citing  to  the  Rule’s  immigration  context  is\ninsufficient to invoke the foreign-affairs exception” so that\nthe President does not have to follow the traditional pathways\nof public rulemaking.).  Therefore, while the “President\n[may] adopt[ ] ‘a preventive measure . . . in the context of\ninternational affairs and national security,’” and he is then\n“‘not required to conclusively link all of the pieces in the\npuzzle  before  [courts]  grant  weight  to  [his]  empirical\nconclusions,’” Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (quoting Holder v.\nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 35 (2010)), his power\nis more circumscribed when he addresses a purely domestic\neconomic issue, see E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 950 F.3d\nat 1279.\nIndeed,  in  domestic  economic  matters,  the  national\nsecurity  and  foreign  affairs  justifications  for  policy\nimplementations disappear, and the normal policy-making\nchannels remain the default rules of the game.  For instance,\nthe “public charge rule” discussed above attempts to resolve\nsimilar concerns related to the perceived financial burden of\nimmigrants without resorting to § 1182(f) for justification. \nSee City & Cty. of S.F., 944 F.3d at 779–80 (explaining that\nthe proposed rule interpreting this provision of the INA went\nthrough the typical notice-and-comment period under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act).  In contrast, the Proclamation\nhere was issued with virtually no factual findings, minimal\nreasoning,  and  an  extremely  limited  window  for  public\ncomment,  raising  serious  questions  as  to  whether  the\nPresident has effectively rewritten provisions of the INA.  We\ntherefore find it unlikely that the government will succeed in\nits broad reliance on § 1182(f).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 34 of 97\n34 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nAgain, we do not prejudge the resolution of the merits of\nthis issue because the question is whether the government has\nshown a strong likelihood of success on the merits.  The\nPlaintiffs have raised sufficiently serious questions on the\nmerits of their INA claim, including on the government’s\ndefenses, that we cannot conclude that the government has\nsustained its high burden of showing a strong likelihood of\nsuccess of the merits.\n4\nThe  district  court  issued  a  lengthy,  thoughtful,  and\nforceful  opinion  focusing  on  whether  the  Proclamation\nviolated the nondelegation doctrine.  In deference to the\nmerits panel, we decline to address the probable likelihood of\nsuccess for either party on this claim.  See Washington,\n847 F.3d at 1168.\nIn addition, the Plaintiffs have raised a number of issues\nnot addressed by the district court, such as the violation of the\nAdministrative  Procedure  Act,  which  also  may  present\nserious questions on the merits.\nC\nThe third Nken factor is whether a stay will substantially\ninjure other parties, on which we touch only briefly given the\ngovernment’s failure to satisfy the two most important Nken\nfactors.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  We have already\nexplained  that  the  plaintiffs  have  established  irreparable\ninjury.    See  Part  III.A,  supra.    In  addition,  the  record\ndemonstrates the significant effect of the Proclamation on\nother parties.  Twenty-one states, the District of Columbia,\nand the City of New York filed amici briefing describing the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 35 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 35\nsignificant harm they and other governmental entities will\nsuffer if the Proclamation is allowed to go into effect.  These\namici explain that immigrants “are vital to the economic,\ncivic, and social fabric of our states and city.”  Indeed, the\nevidence in the record indicates that in 2014, immigrant-led\nhouseholds paid more than $26 billion in state and local taxes\nin California,2 and $736 million in state and local taxes in\nOregon.3  Plaintiffs and amici provided further evidence\ncredited by the district court to satisfy this factor.  See Doe,\n418 F. Supp. 3d at 599–600 (crediting evidence that the\nimplementation of the Proclamation will interrupt family\nreunification,  detrimentally  affect  job  sectors  that\ndisproportionately  employ  immigrants,  and  increase  the\nnumber of underinsured immigrants who will be prohibited\nfrom purchasing subsidized ACA insurance plans).  The\ngovernment does not seriously contest this evidence.  This\nfactor favors the Plaintiffs.\nD\nThe final Nken factor is where the public interest lies. \n“The purpose of a preliminary injunction is always to prevent\nirreparable injury so as to preserve the court’s ability to\nrender a meaningful decision on the merits.  It often happens\nthat this purpose is furthered by the status quo, but not\nalways.”  Golden Gate Restaurant Ass’n v. City & Cty. of San\nFrancisco, 512 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting\n2  Am. Immigration Council, Immigrants in California 4 (2017)\n(https://tinyurl.com/CAP-Immigrants-in-CA).\n3    Am.  Immigration  Council,  Immigrants  in  Oregon  (2017)\n(https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/immigrants-\noregon).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 36 of 97\n36 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nCanal Authority of Florida v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567, 576\n(5th Cir. 1974)).  In this case, the public interest lies with\nmaintaining the status quo while the appeal is pending.  For\ncountless decades, a stable immigration system has provided\nfor families to be united through a visa system that did not\nrequire purchase of selected insurance products for entry into\nthe United States.\nThe government contends this factor weighs in its favor\nbecause the Proclamation as implemented constitutes the\nstatus quo, which would be upended if a stay is not issued. \nBut it was the Proclamation that altered the status quo for the\nPlaintiffs, whose family members had qualified for entry\nunder  established  immigration  policy,  but  are  now\ninadmissible under the Proclamation.  The “purpose of a\npreliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative\npositions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” \nUniv. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  This\nobservation  has  even  more  force  here,  where  we  are\nconsidering only a stay pending appeal of a preliminary\ninjunction.  In the government’s re-imagining of the status\nquo in this context, this factor would always tip in the\ngovernment’s  favor,  effectively  rendering  the  Court\npowerless to exercise its discretion on this factor in such\ninstances.\nGiven the irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs, the lack of\nirreparable harm to the United States for maintaining the\nstatus quo pending resolution of this appeal, and the injury to\nother parties if the Proclamation is immediately implemented,\nthe public interest favors preserving the status quo.  This\nfactor falls to the Plaintiffs.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 37 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 37\nIV\nWe finally consider  the scope of  the district  court’s\npreliminary  injunction.    In  this  case,  the  district  court\ndetermined that a nationwide injunction was appropriate. \nBased on evidence in the record, the district court concluded\nthat  the  Proclamation  would  cause  significant  harm  to\n21 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City if\nallowed to go into effect there.  Accordingly, the court\nenjoined the Proclamation across the country to preserve\nuniformity in immigration policies.  Doe, 418 F. Supp. 3d at\n603.    Subsequently,  the  district  court  certified  the  two\nnationwide  subclasses  noted  above:  the  United  States\nPetitioner subclass and the Visa Applicant subclass.  The\ngovernment has not yet sought to appeal that certification.\nIn the present procedural posture—a request for a stay\npending  the  appeal  of  a  preliminary  injunction—a\nprovisionally  certified  nationwide  class  is  sufficient\njustification for a nationwide injunction.4  See Al Otro Lado,\n952 F.3d at 1004 n.4.  Because the class here is nationwide,\nand because a nationwide injunction is necessary to provide\nthe class members with complete relief, we conclude that the\nscope  of  the  injunction  is  appropriate  at  this  juncture,\nregardless of whether or not it was when originally issued.\n“The scope of an injunction is ‘dependent as much on the\nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it\npresents,’ and courts must tailor the scope ‘to meet the\nexigencies of the particular case.’”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 584\n(quoting Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 137 S. Ct.\n4 Should the government ultimately prevail in reversing the class\ncertification, then the scope of the injunction should be revisited.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 38 of 97\n38 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\n2080, 2087 (2017)).  Here, the balance of the equities tips in\nfavor of protecting the certified class: the government has not\nshown that it will be irreparably injured absent enforcement\nof the Proclamation, while the Plaintiffs have shown that the\nimmediate implementation of the Proclamation will affect the\nlong-standing  practice  of  how  immigration  visas  are\nprocessed and will prevent class members from reuniting with\ntheir families.  Plaintiffs have raised serious concerns that\nclass members will be seriously injured if the Proclamation\nis implemented immediately, and thus the exigencies of this\ncase indicate that an injunction protecting the certified class\nis “not more burdensome than necessary” to provide relief\nwhile the merits of this case are pending.  See id. (citing\nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979)).\nIn addition,  “there  is no bar against  class-wide,  and\nnationwide relief in federal district or circuit court when it is\nappropriate,” Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir.\n1987), and here the class-wide, nationwide relief is necessary\nto afford the class members the relief to which they are\nentitled.  Many of the typical circumstances that counsel\nagainst the nationwide scope of an injunction are absent from\nthis case.  No litigation challenging this Proclamation is\npending  elsewhere,  alleviating  concerns  occasionally\nassociated with nationwide injunctions that such injunctions\ndeprive other courts from offering diverse perspectives on the\nlegal issues while similar litigation is ongoing in multiple\nforums.  See Azar, 911 F.3d at 583.  Moreover, the district\ncourt here has not stayed the preparation of this case for trial\npending the appeal of the nationwide injunction, removing a\nconsideration that “magnifies” the concerns associated with\nnationwide injunctions.  See id.  The nationwide scope of the\ninjunction is also based on the certified subclasses, which\neliminates  some concern that a nationwide  injunction  is\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 39 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 39\noverly burdensome.  Cf. id. at 582–83 (“[I]njunctive relief\ngenerally should be limited to apply only to named plaintiffs\nwere there is no class certification”) (quoting Easyriders\nFreedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 F.3d 1486, 1501 (9th\nCir. 1996)).\nFurther, “[t]he INA was designed to implement a uniform\nfederal policy,”  Kahn v. INS, 36 F.3d 1412, 1414 (9th Cir.\n1994),  and  we  have  underscored  the  need  for  a\n“comprehensive and unified” immigration policy,  Arizona v.\nUnited States, 567 U.S. 387, 401 (2012); see also, e.g.,\nRegents  of  the  Univ.  of  Cal.  v.  United  States  Dep’t  of\nHomeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 511 (9th Cir. 2018) (“Allowing\nuneven application of nationwide immigration policy flies in\nthe face of [uniformity] requirements”); Hawaii v. Trump,\n878  F.3d  662,  701  (9th  Cir.  2017)  (“Because  this  case\nimplicates immigration policy, a nationwide injunction was\nnecessary to give Plaintiffs a full expression of their rights”),\nrev’d on other grounds, — U.S. —, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018). \nThe  provisions  of  the  INA  that  are  affected  by  the\nProclamation represent the current “national immigration\npolicy, and an injunction that applies that policy to some\nindividuals while rescinding it as to others is inimical to the\nprinciple  of uniformity.”   Regents  of  the  Univ.  of  Cal.,\n908 F.3d at 512.  Consequently, a more limited injunction of\nthe Proclamation would “needlessly complicate agency and\nindividual action in response to the United States’s changing\nimmigration  requirements,”  E.  Bay  Sanctuary  Covenant,\n950 F.3d at 1284, and so the nationwide injunction of the\nProclamation is justified.\nThus, because the certified class is nationwide in scope\nand  promotes  uniformity  in  administering  federal\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 40 of 97\n40 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nimmigration law, the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin entering a nationwide injunction.\nV\nIn sum, the government has not established the requisite\nirreparable harm necessary to justify a stay pending appeal. \nIts  rights  may  be  vindicated  upon  completion  of  this\nlitigation.  The alleged monetary harms to third parties upon\nwhich the government relies do not constitute irreparable\nharm.  While that sole factor is dispositive, we also conclude\nthat the government did not meet its high burden to satisfy the\nother Nken factors.  It has not demonstrated likelihood of\nsuccess.  Staying the injunction would injure both the plaintiff\nclass and third parties, and the public interest weighs against\nentering a stay.  The preliminary injunction preserves the\nstatus quo during the pendency of this appeal.  The district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in determining the scope of\nthe preliminary injunction.\nFor  these  reasons,  we  deny  the  motion  to  stay  the\npreliminary injunction pending appeal.  We do not prejudge\nthe consideration of the merits appeal.\nMOTION DENIED.\nBRESS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nToday’s decision is yet the latest example of our court\nallowing a universal injunction of a clearly constitutional\nExecutive  Branch  immigration  policy.    This  time,  the\nPresident  in  Proclamation  No.  9945  imposed  certain\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 41 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 41\nrestrictions on the entry of immigrants who, in the President’s\njudgment,  will  unduly  burden  the  American  healthcare\nsystem.  In what unfortunately has become standard operating\nprocedure, the district court enjoined the Proclamation on a\nnationwide basis before it could take effect.  While declining\nto endorse the district  court’s  central  rationale, my fine\ncolleagues in the majority find a way to justify the district\ncourt’s decision, while refusing to stay or limit its blanket\ninjunction.\nThe  majority  gravely  errs  in  concluding  that  the\nProclamation is likely unconstitutional.  There is no legal\nbasis to impose novel and unjustified restrictions on what the\nSupreme Court has described as “the President[’s] sweeping\nauthority to decide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to\nsuspend, and for how long.”  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct.\n2392, 2413 (2018).  The President issued Proclamation No.\n9945 based on his constitutional powers and his statutory\nauthority in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  The Supreme Court has held\nthat this provision “[b]y its terms” “exudes deference to the\nPresident in every clause.”  Id. at 2408.  Yet the majority\nopinion gives deference to everyone but the President—the\ndistrict court, whose analysis was deeply flawed; States who\njoined an amicus brief and who are not even parties to this\ncase; and plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Leighton Ku, who candidly\nadmits he performed “not an ideal analysis.”\nIt is a bad day for the separation of powers when the\nExecutive—operating  at  the  apex  of  his  constitutional\nmandate—loses out to players who lack the authority that the\nConstitution and Congress entrusted to him.  And it is an\nequally bad day for the rule of law when the majority opinion\nendorses  arguments  that  the  Supreme  Court  expressly\nrejected two years ago in Trump v. Hawaii.  As with many\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 42 of 97\n42 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nimmigration  policies,  reasonable  minds  will  differ  as  to\nwhether Proclamation No. 9945 is good or bad policy.  But\nthe great policy debates of our time should be resolved in the\nhalls of Congress, the public square, and at the ballot box, not\nby a district court in Oregon or a three-judge panel in San\nFrancisco.  What I know is that Proclamation No. 9945 is\nvalid as a matter of law.  And that is what matters here.\nThe  majority’s  unjustified  intrusion  on  presidential\nprerogative is, however, only made more problematic by the\nscope of the injunction that the court allows.  The district\ncourt, as noted, issued a nationwide injunction, and one that\nin fact operates worldwide.  Injunctions such as this raise\nmany issues, as the Supreme Court has signaled in repeatedly\nstaying lower courts’ (and our court’s) universal injunctions. \nSee Wolf v. Innovation Law Lab, No. 19A960, 2020 WL\n1161432 (U.S. Mar. 11, 2020); Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.\nNew York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020); Barr v. E. Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant,  140  S.  Ct.  3  (2019);  Trump  v.  Int’l  Refugee\nAssistance Project, 138 S. Ct. 542 (2017); Trump v. Hawaii,\n138 S. Ct. 542 (2017).\nNot heeding these signals, the majority allows another\nuniversal injunction to remain in place, but with new and\nunfortunate  twists.    When  the  district  court  enjoined\nProclamation No. 9945, it did so without certifying any class. \nJust recently, however, and many months into this appeal of\nits injunction, the district court certified two classes, one of\npersons in the United States and one of “foreign nationals”\naround the world.  The sequence of events here is cause for\nconcern, and the majority’s reliance on the belated class\ncertification  decision  confirms  that  the  district  court’s\nuniversal injunction was not justified when issued.  But what\nthe class certification ruling also shows is that the excesses\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 43 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 43\nof universal injunctions stem in large part from a failure\nto  abide  by  the  rigorous  requirements  for  class\ncertification—requirements  that  the  district  court\nunfortunately did not observe.\nIf there is any solace here, it is that the majority has only\ndenied a stay of the injunction.  I hope the merits panel that\nreceives  this  case  will  see  things  differently.    But  that\ndecision will be issued many months from now, if not longer. \nThere is no reason for the Executive to have his chosen and\nplainly  constitutional  Proclamation  put  on  ice  in  the\ninterim—a  delay  that  inflicts  real  damage  on  our\nconstitutional system.  For the reasons expressed here and in\nmy prior dissent in this matter, see Doe #1 v. Trump, 944 F.3d\n1222, 1223–29 (9th Cir. 2019) (Bress, J., dissenting), I would\nhave  stayed  the  district  court’s  injunction.    I  therefore\nrespectfully dissent.\nI\nOn October 4, 2019, the President issued Presidential\nProclamation No. 9945, Suspension of Entry of Immigrants\nWho Will Financially Burden the United States Healthcare\nSystem, in Order To Protect the Availability of Healthcare\nBenefits  for  Americans.    84  Fed.  Reg.  53991  (2019). \nInvoking the President’s authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)\nand the Constitution, the Proclamation restricts the entry of\ncertain immigrants who cannot show that, within 30 days of\narriving  in  the  United  States,  they  “will  be  covered  by\napproved  health  insurance”  or  “possess[]  the  financial\nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” \nId. at 53992.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 44 of 97\n44 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nThe  Proclamation  is  founded  on  the  President’s\ndetermination that uninsured immigrants impose unwarranted\ncosts on the American healthcare system.  The Proclamation\nreferences “data show[ing] that lawful immigrants are about\nthree times more likely than United States citizens to lack\nhealth insurance,” noting the “substantial” burden that the\nuninsured impose on healthcare providers and taxpayers.  Id.\nat 53991.  The President found that this burden—which takes\nthe “form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees\nfor medical services”—has contributed to uncompensated\ncare  costs in  excess  of $35 billion for each  of the last\n10 years.  Id.  The Proclamation also identified other burdens\nthat the uninsured impose, including “reliance on publicly\nfunded programs” and overreliance on emergency room care,\nwhich creates “delays for those who truly need emergency\nservices.”  Id.  The President concluded that “[c]ontinuing to\nallow entry into the United States of certain immigrants who\nlack health insurance or the demonstrated ability to pay for\ntheir healthcare would be detrimental” to the national interest. \nId.\nTo address these problems, the Proclamation requires visa\napplicants to show they “will be covered by approved health\ninsurance . . . within 30 days of the alien’s entry into the\nUnited States, . . . unless the alien possesses the financial\nresources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” \nId. at 53992.  The Proclamation defines “approved health\ninsurance” by reference to a lengthy list of coverage options. \nId.  These include employer-sponsored and retiree plans,\nfamily plans, visitor health insurance plans, unsubsidized\nhealth plans offered on State exchanges, Medicare, or “any\nother health plan that provides adequate coverage for medical\ncare as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices.”  Id.  Plans need not be purchased prior to entry;\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 45 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 45\nrather, the immigrant must only show that he or she will have\nthe required coverage within 30 days of entry.  Id.\nEnforcement of the Proclamation takes place all over the\nworld at the consular officer level.  An immigrant must\n“establish  that  he  or  she  meets  [the  Proclamation’s]\nrequirements, to the satisfaction of a consular officer, before\nthe adjudication and issuance of an immigrant visa.”  Id. at\n53993.  The Proclamation also empowers the Secretary of\nState to “establish standards and procedures [to] govern[]\nsuch determinations.”  Id.  This review is distinct from other\nrequirements  that  the  law  otherwise  imposes.    As  the\nProclamation makes clear, its review process “is separate and\nindependent from the review and determination required by\nother statutes, regulations, or proclamations in determining\nthe admissibility of an alien.”  Id.  That would include, for\ninstance, the public charge provisions of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (INA).  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).\nImportantly, the Proclamation “shall apply only to aliens\nseeking to enter the United States pursuant to an immigrant\nvisa.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 53992.  The Proclamation thus “does\nnot affect the entry of aliens entering the United States\nthrough means other than immigrant visas.”  Id. at 53993. \nThat  includes  persons  seeking  nonimmigrant  visas  or\nrefugees.

Also excepted are business travelers, foreign\nstudents, temporary agricultural workers, and various others. \nId.

Op. 22.  I have elsewhere explained how\na tactical deviation from the normal sequence of the stay\nfactors “waters down the merits analysis.”  See Al Otro Lado\nv. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1022 (9th Cir. 2020) (Bress, J.,\ndissenting).  That is the case here, where the government’s\nasserted harms follow from its strong likelihood of success on\nthe merits.  See id. (“The sequencing of today’s opinion can\nonly reflect the majority’s implicit acknowledgement that the\ngovernment’s case is strongest where it most matters, namely,\nthe likelihood of success on the merits.”).  Inversion of the\nstay factors is a recent trend and one that produces distortion\nin the stay analysis.\nI thus begin, as we usually do, with the merits.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 50 of 97\n50 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nIII\nA\nThe majority  concludes  that the President  has likely\nexceeded his powers on the theory that Proclamation No.\n9945 conflicts with statutes that supposedly forbid it, while\nfailing to fall within 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  This is seriously\nmistaken.\nUnder Trump v. Hawaii, the government has made a\nstrong  showing  that  Proclamation  No.  9945  is  a  lawful\nexercise of the President’s vast constitutional and statutory\npowers in this space.  I address § 1182(f) first because, in\ncombination with his innate powers under the Constitution,\n§ 1182(f) creates the high-water mark for the President’s\nability to place limits on who enters this country.  Under\n§ 1182(f) and the President’s inherent powers, Proclamation\nNo. 9945 is plainly valid.\nSection 1182(f) provides:\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of\nany aliens or of any class of aliens into the\nUnited States would be detrimental to the\ninterests  of  the  United  States,  he  may  by\nproclamation, and for such period as he shall\ndeem  necessary,  suspend  the  entry  of  all\naliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or\nnonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of\naliens any restrictions he may deem to be\nappropriate.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 51 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 51\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  Just two years ago, the Supreme Court in\nTrump v. Hawaii held that § 1182(f) “exudes deference to the\nPresident in every clause” and “grants the President sweeping\nauthority to decide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to\nsuspend, and for how long.”  138 S. Ct. at 2408, 2413.  Based\non this “broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens into\nthe  United  States,”  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  against\nconstitutional  and  statutory  challenges  a  presidential\nproclamation suspending entry of persons from specified\ncountries.  Id. at 2408.\nThe “sweeping authority” that justified the proclamation\nin Trump v. Hawaii clearly allows the President to do what he\ndid here in Proclamation No. 9945.  As the Supreme Court\nhas held, the “sole prerequisite set forth in § 1182(f) is that\nthe President ‘find[]’ that the entry of the covered aliens\n‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.’” \nId. at 2408 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)).  The President made\nthat finding in Proclamation No. 9945.  84 Fed. Reg. at\n53991.  In Trump v. Hawaii, moreover, the plaintiffs argued\nthat the proclamation there conflicted with provisions of the\nINA,  which  the  plaintiffs  believed  “already  specified”\nCongress’s approach to the issue.  Id. at 2411.  But the\nSupreme  Court  expressly  rejected  this  theory  because\n“[f]airly read,” § 1182(f) “vests authority in the President to\nimpose additional limitations on entry beyond the grounds for\nexclusion set forth in the INA.”  Id. at 2412.  Proclamation\nNo. 9945 is another such “additional limitation[] on entry.” \nId.  It is therefore plainly valid under § 1182(f), as interpreted\nby the Supreme Court.\nAgainst all of this, the majority offers two bases for\ndistinguishing Trump v. Hawaii and for concluding that the\nPresident has likely exceeded his powers under § 1182(f). \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 52 of 97\n52 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nBut Trump v. Hawaii considered and squarely rejected the\nvery arguments that the majority credits.\nFirst, the majority concludes that “the Proclamation’s\nfailure  to  explicitly  or  implicitly  establish  any  time\nconstraints  on  the  healthcare  prohibition  raises  serious\nquestions as to whether the Proclamation is a ‘suspension’\naccording to the plain meaning of the term in § 1182(f).” \nMaj. Op. 31–32.  The Supreme Court considered and rejected\nthis same argument in Trump v. Hawaii.  While the majority\nopinion complains that Proclamation No. 9945 “does not\nhave an endpoint,” Maj. Op. 29, Trump v. Hawaii rejected the\nplaintiffs’ argument that a § 1182(f) “suspension” “mean[t]\nthat the President is required to prescribe in advance a fixed\nend date for the entry restrictions.”  138 S. Ct. at 2410. \nCiting past proclamations, Trump v. Hawaii concluded it was\nsufficient  that  the  proclamation  “makes  clear  that  its\n‘conditional restrictions’ will remain in force only so long as\nnecessary to ‘address’ the identified ‘inadequacies and risks’\nwithin the covered nations.”  Id.  In particular, the Supreme\nCourt noted that the proclamation “establishes an ongoing\nprocess to engage covered nations and assess every 180 days\nwhether  the  entry  restrictions  should  be  modified  or\nterminated.”  Id.\nThe majority here claims that Proclamation No. 9945 is\ndifferent because it supposedly “omits any indication that the\nhealth insurance requirement is temporary.”  Maj. Op. 29. \nIndeed, the majority claims the Proclamation lacks “even an\nimplicit” time limitation, “such as a limit measured by the\noccurrence of some future event or condition.”  Id. at 29. \nThat is an uncommonly unfair reading of the Proclamation. \nAn entire section of Proclamation No. 9945 provides for\nongoing  review  of  its  “suspension”  on  entry.    The\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 53 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 53\nProclamation  requires  that  a  report  be  submitted  to  the\nPresident on “the continued necessity of and any adjustments\nthat may be warranted to the suspension and limitation on\nentry.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 53993 (emphasis added).  The first\nreport must be submitted to the President within 180 days of\nthe Proclamation’s effective date, and “annually thereafter.” \nId.    If  “circumstances  no  longer  warrant  the  continued\neffectiveness of the suspension or limitation on entry,” the\nPresident must “immediately” be advised.  Id. (emphases\nadded).  The review process here is not materially different\nfrom the one at issue in Trump v. Hawaii.  The majority\nopinion blinks reality in suggesting otherwise.\nInstead, the majority claims the Proclamation is not a\ntemporary limitation on entry because while agency officials\ncan advise the President that the suspension is no longer\nwarranted, “[t]here is no requirement that the President act on\nthe  advice.”  Maj.  Op.  29.    That  is  a  rather  remarkable\nstatement.  When exercising his vast powers under § 1182(f)\nand  Article  II  of  the  Constitution,  nothing  requires  the\nPresident to bind himself to the mast and pre-commit to the\nrecommendations  of  inferior  officials.    And  like  the\nProclamation here, the proclamation in Trump v. Hawaii also\ndid not require the President uncritically to accept the advice\nof his subordinates.  See Pres. Procl. No. 99645, 82 Fed. Reg.\n45161,  41169–70  (2017)  (describing  inter-agency\n“recommendations  to  the  President”  and  stating  “the\nSecretary  of Homeland  Security  may  recommend to  the\nPresident the removal or modification of any or all such\nrestrictions  and  limitations”)  (emphases  added).    The\nmajority’s insistence that the fatal flaw in the Proclamation is\nthe President’s unwillingness to agree in advance to advice he\nhas not yet received reflects an untenable theory of Executive\npower with no basis in principle or common sense.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 54 of 97\n54 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nEven more unsettling is the majority’s determination that\nProclamation No. 9945 is not a temporary “suspension”\nbecause of its “likely ineffectiveness.” Maj. Op. 31.  The\nmajority asserts that “the likely ineffectiveness of the health\ninsurance  requirement  suggests  that  uncompensated  care\ncosts will remain high,” so that “the perceived ‘necessity’ of\nthe Proclamation could therefore continue in perpetuity.”  Id. \nIn other words, the majority concludes that because the\nProclamation will not successfully “reduce uncompensated\nhealthcare costs,” those costs will remain high, meaning that\nthe Proclamation will continue in effect forever.  Id. at 30.\nThe  majority’s  conclusion  about  the  “likely\nineffectiveness”  of  the  Proclamation  turns  on  plaintiffs’\nexpert’s self-described “not . . . ideal analysis.”  I will have\nmore to say on that later.  What matters here is that the\nmajority’s reasoning again defies Trump v. Hawaii.  The\nplaintiffs  there  similarly  maintained  that  a  proclamation\nwould  not  adequately  resolve  “the  President’s  stated\nconcern.”  138 S. Ct. at 2409.  In rejecting this view, the\nSupreme Court could not have been clearer that “a searching\ninquiry  into  the  persuasiveness  of  the  President’s\njustifications is inconsistent with the broad statutory text [of\n§  1182(f)]  and  the  deference  traditionally  accorded  the\nPresident in this sphere.”  Id.  Indeed, the Supreme Court\nwent  on, “‘[w]hether  the  President’s  chosen  method’  of\naddressing  perceived  risks  is  justified  from  a  policy\nperspective is ‘irrelevant to the scope of his [§ 1182(f)]\nauthority.’”  Id. (quoting Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc.,\n509 U.S. 155, 187–88 (1993)) (emphasis added).\nThe Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii in no uncertain\nterms rebuffed the plaintiffs’ effort to “challenge the entry\nsuspension based on their perception of its effectiveness.”  Id.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 55 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 55\nat  2421.  The  majority’s  armchair  conclusion  about  the\n“likely ineffectiveness” of Proclamation No. 9945 is thus\nprecisely what the Supreme Court told us not to do.  The\nSupreme Court reiterated in Trump v. Hawaii that “we cannot\nsubstitute our own assessment for the Executive’s predictive\njudgments.”  Id.  Yet the majority opinion does just that. \nToday’s decision is therefore a serious affront to the core\nseparation  of  powers  principles  that  Trump  v.  Hawaii\nreaffirms and reinforces.\nThe majority’s suggestion that the outcome might have\nbeen different if the President had engaged in a more “data-\ndriven analysis,” Maj. Op. 30, reflects an equally serious\nmisunderstanding of our role.  Since when does this court\nknow health policy better than the President of the United\nStates and the other Executive Branch officials whom the\nProclamation requires to be involved—the Secretary of State,\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of\nHomeland Security, and “the heads of other appropriate\nagencies”?    84  Fed.  Reg.  at  53993.    The  majority’s\nconclusion that Proclamation No. 9945 is not a time-limited\n“suspension”  on  entry  is  nothing  more  than  a  policy\ndisagreement with the Executive on a matter constitutionally\nand statutorily committed to his authority.\nSecond, the majority concludes that Proclamation No.\n9945 likely exceeds the President’s § 1182(f) powers because\nthe Proclamation “deals with a purely domestic economic\nproblem:  uncompensated  healthcare  costs  in  the  United\nStates.”  Maj. Op. 32.  Once again, the majority opinion\ndisregards Supreme Court precedent, mischaracterizes the\nProclamation,  and  improperly  treads  on  the  President’s\nconstitutional and statutory powers.  Indeed, no court has ever\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 56 of 97\n56 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nadopted the foreign/domestic distinction that the majority\ntries to engraft onto § 1182(f).\nProclamation No. 9945 places restrictions on the entry of\nimmigrants  into  this  country.    For  over  a  century,  the\nSupreme Court has been clear that “[t]he exclusion of aliens\nis a fundamental act of sovereignty” that “is inherent in the\nexecutive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation.”\nUnited States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537,\n542 (1950); see also, e.g., Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2418; INS v.\nAguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425 (1999) (“[W]e have\nrecognized that judicial deference to the Executive Branch is\nespecially  appropriate  in  the  immigration  context  where\nofficials exercise especially sensitive political functions that\nimplicate  questions  of  foreign  relations.”)  (quotations\nomitted); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 588–89\n(1952) (“[A]ny policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately\ninterwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the\nconduct of foreign relations . . . .”).  The majority’s notion\nthat  the  exclusion  of  persons  from  this  country  can  be\nrecharacterized as “a purely domestic economic issue,” Maj.\nOp. 33, thus contradicts settled Supreme Court case law.\nGiven the source of authority that the President invoked,\nit is therefore unsurprising that Proclamation No. 9945 on its\nface has an obvious international valence.  If it ever goes into\neffect, the Proclamation will be implemented by consular\nofficials abroad, who must interview aliens seeking visas. \n84 Fed. Reg. at 53993; Notice of Info. Collection Under OMB\nEmergency Review: Immigrant Health Ins. Coverage, 84 Fed.\nReg. 58199 (2019).  The Proclamation allows the Secretary\nof State to “establish standards and procedures governing\nsuch determinations.”  84 Fed. Reg. 53993.  It enables the\nSecretary of State to exempt aliens from the Proclamation. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 57 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 57\nId.    And  it  entrusts  the  Secretary  of  State  with  lead\nresponsibility for preparing regular reports to the President. \nId.  The idea that the Proclamation concerns matters “purely\ndomestic,” Maj. Op. 33, is clearly belied by the text and\nintended operation of the Proclamation itself.\nThere are also obvious reasons why no court has forced\na foreign/domestic distinction on § 1182(f).  The text of\n§ 1182(f) allows the President to suspend the entry of aliens\nwho “would be detrimental to the interests of the United\nStates”—without defining what those interests may be and\nwithout  distinguishing  between  foreign  and  domestic\ninterests.  Many (if not most) immigration policies naturally\nimplicate domestic interests as well as foreign ones.  This is\nto be expected for a provision that governs entry of persons\n“into the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., Pres. Procl. No. 4865, 46 Fed. Reg.\n48107 (1981) (suspending entry to preserve “law enforcement\nresources”  and  promote  the  “welfare  and  safety  of\ncommunities” in the southeastern United States).\nIn  fact,  many  of  the  INA’s  express  grounds  for\ninadmissibility could be said to involve “domestic” concerns,\nor  even  “purely  domestic”  ones.    See,  e.g.,  8  U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(1)(A)(i) (aliens with communicable diseases); id.\n§ 1182(a)(1)(A)(ii) (aliens who have not been vaccinated); id.\n§  1182(a)(2)(A)  (aliens  with  a  criminal  history);  id.\n§  1182(a)(4)  (aliens  who  are  likely  to  become  public\ncharges); id. § 1182(a)(5) (aliens who would disrupt domestic\nlabor markets or wages).  Since § 1182(f) “vests authority in\nthe  President  to  impose  additional  limitations  on  entry\nbeyond the grounds for exclusion set forth in the INA,”\nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2412, it would be bizarre if § 1182(f)\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 58 of 97\n58 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nreflected a foreign/domestic limitation that appears nowhere\nin the text or structure of the INA as a whole.\nThis manufactured distinction is also inconsistent with\neverything the Supreme Court has told us about § 1182(f). \nThat provision “exudes deference to the President in every\nclause”  and  “grants  the  President  sweeping  authority  to\ndecide whether to suspend entry, whose entry to suspend, and\nfor how long.”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408, 2413.  The\nmajority’s unprecedented effort to recast § 1182(f) wrongly\ndeprives the President of authority that is rightfully his and\nwill lead to endless problems of administration as courts\ndebate whether a given immigration policy is really more\nforeign or domestic in nature.  This is not the § 1182(f) that\nCongress enacted or that the Supreme Court construed in\nTrump v. Hawaii.\nB\nIf Proclamation No. 9945 is a valid exercise of § 1182(f),\nwhat is the problem?  The district court’s primary answer was\nthat § 1182(f) was itself an unconstitutional delegation of\nlegislative power to the President.  In the district court’s\nview, “[t]here is no ‘intelligible principle’ provided as to\nwhat it means to be ‘detrimental,’ what the ‘interests’ of the\nUnited States are, what degree of finding is required, or what\ndegree of detriment is required.”  Doe #1, 418 F. Supp. 3d\nat 590.  The majority opinion tellingly declines to endorse\nthis rationale.  Maj. Op. 34 its description of the district\ncourt’s  non-delegation  analysis  as  “thoughtful”  and\n“forceful,”  id.,  fails  to  acknowledge—and  if  anything,\ncompliments—the district court’s remarkable departure from\nsettled law.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 59 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 59\nI addressed the non-delegation issue at some length in my\nprior dissent at the administrative stay stage.  See Doe #1,\n944 F.3d at 1226–27 (Bress, J., dissenting).  But in brief: the\ndistrict court’s non-delegation holding is clearly incorrect. \nOn  just  two  occasions  in  our  country’s  history  has  the\nSupreme Court struck down a congressional statute under the\nnon-delegation doctrine.  See Gundy v. United States, 139 S.\nCt. 2116, 2129 (2019).  Section 1182(f) does not present just\nthe third occasion for doing so.  That statute “has for decades\nbeen the noted source of statutory authority for presidential\nproclamations  involving  immigration matters.”   Doe #1,\n944 F.3d at 1226–27 (Bress, J., dissenting).  It does not suffer\nfrom a mortal constitutional defect hiding in plain sight.\nFar from lacking an intelligible principle, the Supreme\nCourt  in  Trump  v.  Hawaii  held  that  “the  language  of\n§ 1182(f) is clear” and that § 1182(f) is a “comprehensive\ndelegation” of authority to the President.  138 S. Ct. at 2408,\n2410; see also id. at 2408 (“clear statutory language”); id.\nat 2410 (“clear text”).  Section 1182(f), the Supreme Court\nhas told us, reflects “textual limits.”  Id. at 2409.  This is not\na quarry from which a non-delegation  challenge can be\nmined.\nIndeed, the President’s power in this area does not derive\nsolely from Congress, because “[t]he exclusion of aliens” is\n“inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs\nof the nation.”  Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542; see also Hawaii, 138\nS.

Nor could it, since the President has\ninherent  authority  to  exclude  aliens  from  the  country.”)\n(emphasis in original and citation omitted).  That is why “the\nstrict limitation upon congressional delegations of power to\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 60 of 97\n60 DOE #1 V.

This was, in fact, the Supreme Court’s\nexact explanation when it rejected a non-delegation challenge\nto a precursor to § 1182(f).  See Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542.\nJust last Term, the Supreme Court reiterated that it has\n“almost  never  felt  qualified  to  second-guess  Congress\nregarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can\nbe left to those executing or applying the law.”  Gundy,\n139 S. Ct. at 2129 (quotations omitted).  Engaging in such\nsecond-guessing in the context of a longstanding statute in the\narea  of  foreign  affairs,  as  the  district  court  did,  would\nfundamentally reorder our constitutional system.  I wish the\nmajority had said this instead of implying that the district\ncourt’s ruling warranted further consideration in this court.\nC\nThe majority opinion instead holds that the government\nhas  not  made  a  strong  showing  of  success  because\nProclamation No. 9945 supposedly “conflicts” with: (1) the\nViolence Against Women Act’s (VAWA) amendments to the\nINA, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E); (2) the Affordable Care Act\n(ACA), 42 U.S.C. § 10821, et seq.; and (3) the INA’s public\ncharge provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Maj. Op.\n22–28.  I list these grounds in the order the majority presents\nthem.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 61 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 61\nThe district court, however, devoted only a few sentences\nto VAWA.  See Doe # 1, 418 F. Supp. 3d at 597.  The district\ncourt did not rely at all on any perceived conflict with the\nACA.  See id. at 597 n.6 (“The Court expresses no opinion at\nthis stage of the litigation about whether the Proclamation\nalso contravenes or overrides various healthcare laws.”).  And\nwhile the district court did rely on a claimed conflict with the\npublic charge provision, allegedly rendering the Proclamation\n“unconstitutional under separation of powers,” id. at 593, this\nwas secondary to its central non-delegation theory.\nIt therefore is apparent that the majority justifies the\ndistrict court’s injunction on quite different legal bases than\nthe district court itself.  But any uneasiness with the district\ncourt’s rationales should have led to the injunction being\nstayed, not reliance on new rationales with yet more legal\ndeficiencies.  Regardless, the majority’s central theory that\nCongress in various enactments foreclosed Proclamation No.\n9945, rendering it unconstitutional, is plainly wrong.\n1\nI begin with the INA’s public charge provisions, because\non this point the majority once again flouts Trump v. Hawaii. \nThe INA renders inadmissible any alien who “is likely at any\ntime to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \nConsular officers make this determination using a series of\nnon-exhaustive  “minimum”  factors:  age;  health;  family\nstatus; assets, resources, and financial status; and education\nand skills.  Id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i)(I)–(V).  The majority tells\nus that Proclamation No. 9945 “eviscerates th[is] statutory\nscheme by making the acquisition of designated forms of\nhealth  insurance  the  sole  consideration  of  whether  an\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 62 of 97\n62 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\napplicant should be excluded from consideration for a family\nvisa.”  Maj. Op. 27.\nThe majority’s “evisceration” theory is wrong.  And\nTrump v. Hawaii—which the majority does not mention in\nthis  portion  of  its  opinion—tells  us  why.    Nothing  in\nProclamation  No.  9945  “eviscerates”  the  public  charge\nprovision, for the obvious reason that these are simply two\ndifferent grounds for inadmissibility.  One can meet the\npublic charge provisions but not the Proclamation, and vice\nversa.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 53993 (explaining that the review\nthe Proclamation requires “is separate and independent from\nthe review and determination required by other statutes,\nregulations,  or  proclamations  in  determining  the\ninadmissibility of an alien”).\nIn fact, the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii rejected\nthe very type of argument the majority adopts.  There, the\nplaintiffs argued that a proclamation nullified parts of the\nINA because Congress in that statute had already addressed\n“the problem of aliens seeking entry from countries that do\nnot share sufficient information.”  138 S. Ct. at 2411.  The\nSupreme Court held there was no such conflict with the INA\nbecause § 1182(f) “vests authority in the President to impose\nadditional  limitations  on  entry  beyond  the  grounds  for\nexclusion set forth in the INA.”  Id. at 2412 (emphases\nadded); see also id. at 2408 (“It is therefore unsurprising that\nwe  have  previously  observed  that  §  1182(f)  vests  the\nPresident with ‘ample power’ to impose entry restrictions in\naddition  to  those  elsewhere  enumerated  in  the  INA.”)\n(quoting Sale, 508 U.S. at 187).\nThere is nothing unusual about Proclamation No. 9945\ncreating an independent—and yes, dispositive—ground for\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 63 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 63\ninadmissibility, when that is the whole point of § 1182(f). \nWhat the majority treats as a “violat[ion] of the INA,” Maj.\nOp. 26, is just § 1182(f) of the INA in operation, as Trump v.\nHawaii makes plain.  The majority today simply resurrects\nthe same “cramped” reading of § 1182(f) that Trump v.\nHawaii rejected.  138 S. Ct. at 2412.1\nImplicit in the majority’s reasoning is the view that each\npublic charge factor must be given some weight, so that if any\none consideration is dispositive, it unravels the statutory\nscheme.  This interpretation has no basis in the statute.  The\nINA does not assign the public charge factors any weight\namong themselves or in relation to independent eligibility\nrequirements.  And as we recently explained, the public\ncharge “factors are not exhaustive,” and the Executive “may\nadd to them.”  City & Cty. of S.F., 944 F.3d at 798.  “Other\nfactors  may  be  considered  as  well,  giving  officials\nconsiderable discretion in their decisions.”  Id. at 792; see\nalso id. at 796 (“[D]ifferent factors have been weighted more\nor less heavily at different times.”).\n1 Unsurprisingly, prior proclamations have addressed grounds of\ninadmissibility  that  the  INA  already  provided  for  to  some  extent. \nCompare 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(h) (rendering inadmissible “[a]ny alien\nwho commits or conspires to commit human trafficking offenses”), with\nPres. Procl. No. 8342, 74 Fed. Reg. 4093 (2009) (barring entry of certain\ngovernment officials who have “impeded” or “failed to implement”\nantitrafficking efforts); compare also 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(E) (rendering\ninadmissible Nazi-affiliated aliens who “ordered, incited, assisted, or\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, national origin, or political opinion”), with Pres. Procl. No. 8697,\n76 Fed. Reg. 49277 (2011) (barring entry of any alien who “ordered,\nassisted, aided and abetted, committed or otherwise participated in . . .\nwidespread or systematic violence” based on protected characteristics).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 64 of 97\n64 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nThe majority complains that the public charge statute\n“lists various factors that the consular office can consider”\nand “[h]ealth insurance is not among them.”  Maj. Op. 26. \nBut again, that is the expected result of a statutory scheme\nthat allows the President to impose “additional limitations on\nentry.”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2412.  The majority’s quarrel is\nthus really with § 1182(f) itself, not any actual distortion of\nthe INA.  There is no conflict between a public charge\nprovision that is “flexible” and “ambiguous,” City & Cty. of\nS.F., 944 F.3d at 798, and a Proclamation premised on the\n“clear”  and  “comprehensive  delegation”  that  Congress\nconferred on the President in § 1182(f), Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at\n2408–09.\n2\nUnlike the district court, the majority’s lead point is that\nProclamation No. 9945 “conflicts with the Violence Against\nWomen Act’s (‘VAWA’) amendments to the INA.”  Maj.\nOp. 22.  These amendments provide that the INA’s public\ncharge provisions “shall not apply” to an alien who is the\nvictim of certain crimes.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E); see also\nid. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii)–(vi).  Once again, the majority fails\nin its effort to save the district court’s injunction.\nAs an initial matter, no plaintiff in this case claims that\ntheir relatives are subject to the VAWA exemption.  VAWA\nis thus irrelevant to this litigation and plaintiffs would lack\nstanding to invoke it.  E.g., Easter v. Am. W. Fin., 381 F.3d\n948, 962 (9th Cir. 2004); Halet v. Wend Inv. Co., 672 F.2d\n1305, 1309 n.2 (9th Cir. 1982).  But in any event, the\nProclamation does not conflict with VAWA for the obvious\nreason  that  a  petitioner  who  meets  VAWA’s  eligibility\nrequirements is not thereby entitled to admission into the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 65 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 65\nUnited States.  Rather, that person is merely exempted from\nthe public charge limitations.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(E). \nNothing in VAWA or the INA requires the President to\nimpose  a  VAWA-like  carve-out  on  other  grounds  for\ninadmissibility, and nothing in the INA imposes such a\nrestriction on the President’s broad authority under § 1182(f).\nThe  majority  thus  badly  errs  in  concluding  that  the\nProclamation “contravenes the well-settled principle that the\nPresident’s powers are executive, not legislative in nature,”\nbecause the President cannot “repeal statutes.”  Maj. Op. 23\n(quotations  omitted).    Such  conclusory  statements  of\nconstitutional law have nothing to do with what the President\nhas done here.  VAWA is a limited exception to one ground\nfor  inadmissibility,  not  an  overarching  limit  on  the\nPresident’s  expansive  authority  under  §  1182(f)  or  his\nindependent constitutional powers in this area.2\n3\nThe majority also holds that “[t]he government has not\nsubmitted any evidence” of likely success on the plaintiffs’\n2 I also find unfortunate the majority’s attempt to boost its holding by\nasserting that the government “has made no showing at all” on VAWA\nand “does not respond to the merits of this challenge.”  Maj. Op. 22, 23. \nThe district court, as noted, devoted only a few scant sentences to VAWA. \nEven  so,  the  government  expressly  argued  in  this  court  that  the\nProclamation did not conflict with VAWA because Trump v. Hawaii\n“rejected this argument, holding that ‘§ 1182(f) vests the President with\n‘ample power’ to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere\nenumerated in the INA.’”  Reply Br. 5 (quoting 138 S. Ct. at 2408)\n(emphasis omitted).  Moreover, VAWA is part of the public charge\nprovision and the government has argued at length why the Proclamation\ndoes not conflict with that provision as a whole.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 66 of 97\n66 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nassertion that “the Proclamation violates the” Affordable Care\nAct (ACA).  Maj. Op. 24.  That is rather harsh, considering\nthat the district court did not reach this issue.  Doe #1, 418 F.\nSupp. 3d at 597 n.6.  The plaintiffs devoted less than a page\nof their stay opposition to the ACA, and the government then\naddressed the issue in its reply brief.  All the same, the notion\nthat the Proclamation conflicts with the ACA is manifestly\nincorrect.\nThe ACA authorized the creation of State-based health\ninsurance markets, called “exchanges,” “where people can\nshop for insurance, usually online.”  King v. Burwell, 135 S.\nCt. 2480, 2487 (2015) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 18031(b)(1)). \nUnder  the  ACA,  “individuals  with  household  incomes\nbetween 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty\nline” may purchase subsidized insurance plans with the help\nof  “refundable  tax  credits.”    Id.    These  tax  credits  are\navailable to “lawfully present” aliens whose incomes are less\nthan  100  percent  of  the  poverty  line  and  who  are  also\nineligible for Medicaid.  26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(B).  Neither\nsubsidized insurance nor Medicaid satisfy the Proclamation’s\nrequirements.  Under the ACA, consumers can also purchase\nunsubsidized  insurance  on  State  exchanges.    42  U.S.C.\n§§ 18031(d)(2)(A), 10832(b).  Such unsubsidized plans do\nsatisfy Proclamation No. 9945.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 53392. \nIn  all  cases,  however,  an  immigrant  must  be  “lawfully\npresent” and a resident of a State before he can purchase any\nhealth  insurance  from  that  State’s  exchange,  whether\nsubsidized or not.  26 U.S.C. § 36B(c)(1)(B); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 18032(f)(1)(A)(ii); 45 C.F.R. 155.305(a)(1), (3).\nThe  majority  claims  that  because  the  Proclamation\nexcludes  subsidized  plans  under  State  exchanges,  “an\nimmigrant attempting to legally enter the United States will\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 67 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 67\nnot have access to ACA tax credits as Congress intended.” \nMaj. Op. 25.  That is a non sequitur.  As the majority\nacknowledges,  under  the  ACA,  subsidized  plans  are\nonly  available  to  individuals  “lawfully  present”  in  the\nUnited  States.    26  U.S.C.  §  36B(c)(1)(B);  42  U.S.C.\n§ 18032(f)(1)(A)(ii).  The ACA thus does not cover persons\nwho are subject to the Proclamation, who are not lawfully\npresent here.  Nor does the Proclamation prevent individuals,\nonce they are “lawfully present,” from seeking subsidized\ninsurance under State exchanges.  And the ACA says nothing\nabout who may or may not enter this country.  That Congress\nhas created a benefit for individuals who have “lawfully”\nentered the United States does not then give persons a right\nto enter the country to obtain those benefits.\nThe apparent suggestion in the majority opinion is that the\nProclamation will prevent the entry of all persons who could\nthen later take advantage of the subsidized plans that the\nACA  makes  available  to  immigrants  who  are  “lawfully\npresent.”  But as discussed above, the Proclamation only\ncovers  a  subset  of  immigrants.    There  are  many  other\nimmigrants, including persons already lawfully present in the\nUnited States, who can try to take advantage of subsidized\ninsurance options.  And that is to say nothing of the persons\nwho  are  subject  to  the  Proclamation,  who  can  meet  its\neligibility requirements, and who can then pursue subsidized\nhealth insurance once they arrive.  The suggestion that the\nProclamation somehow drains an aspect of the ACA of all\nfunction is thus obviously not true.\nThe majority next claims that although immigrants can\nsatisfy  the  Proclamation  by  purchasing  unsubsidized\ninsurance on State exchanges, because immigrants must be\n“lawfully present” in the United States to buy such insurance,\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 68 of 97\n68 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nthese immigrants are placed in “a Catch-22.”  Maj. Op. 25. \nBy the majority’s reasoning, such persons “cannot obtain an\n‘approved’ unsubsidized insurance plan unless they have\nbeen legally admitted, but they cannot be legally admitted\nunless they have obtained an ‘approved’ insurance plan.”  Id. \nThis theory collapses because the latter part is not true. \nUnder the Proclamation, the immigrant must only show that\nhe “will be covered by approved health insurance . . . within\n30 days of the alien’s entry into the United States.”  84 Fed.\nReg. 53992 (emphasis added).  The majority’s “Catch-22”\nthus relies entirely on a misreading of the Proclamation.\nIV\nThe government has not only made an overwhelming\nshowing of likely success on the merits, it has also shown that\nit will be irreparably harmed absent a stay of the district\ncourt’s injunction.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 433–34.  The majority’s\ndetermination otherwise depends on it placing plaintiffs’\nexpert  and  an  amicus  brief  on  higher  footing  than  the\nPresident of the United States.\nA\nThe harm that the court’s injunction inflicts is irreparable\nand real—to the interests the Executive seeks to promote\nthrough  the  Proclamation  and  to  the  core  separation  of\npowers principles that make the Proclamation lawful.  The\ninjunction is a severe affront to the President’s authority,\nitself an irreparable injury.  See Maryland v. King, 133 S. Ct.\n1, 3 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (“[A]ny time a State\nis enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by\nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable\ninjury.”) (quotations omitted).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 69 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 69\nThe majority downplays the government’s institutional\ninjury on the theory that the Proclamation’s lawfulness “is at\nthe core of this dispute, to be resolved at the merits stage.” \nMaj. Op. 16.  But by this logic, a court of appeals could never\nstay a district court’s injunction until the merits were finally\nadjudicated, which is not the law.  The merits of a case of\ncourse are at issue at the “merits stage.”  But the merits are\nrelevant now too, because we are required to evaluate the\nlikelihood of success on the merits at the stay stage.  See\nNken, 556 U.S. at 434.  In this case, the “clear statutory\nlanguage” of § 1182(f) reflects a “comprehensive delegation”\nof “sweeping authority” to the Executive, Hawaii, 138 S. Ct.\nat 2408, 2413, who Congress entrusted with the important\nmission of suspending the entry of aliens who “would be\ndetrimental to the interests of the United States.”  8 U.S.C.\n§ 1182(f).  The court’s deprivation of this fundamental power\nis an acute institutional injury that is not made more palatable\nby telling the government it must wait many months, if not\nmuch  longer,  for  a  final  decision  on  the  merits.    See\nMaryland, 133 S. Ct. at 3.\nThe majority discounts the government’s institutional\ninjury on the theory that if such injury were credited, “no act”\nof the President could be enjoined because “the irreparable\nharm standard [would be] satisfied by the fact of executive\naction alone.”  Maj. Op. 16.  That is a mischaracterization. \nThe majority can make this suggestion only because it took\nthe stay factors out of order and addressed the harms before\nthe merits.  Where, as here, the government has shown an\noverwhelming likelihood of success on the merits, enjoining\nit from enforcing its plainly lawful policy is a constitutionally\nsignificant injury.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 70 of 97\n70 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nInstitutional  injury  aside,  the  government  has\ndemonstrated that its inability to enforce the Proclamation\npending appeal will cause irreparable harm.  See City & Cty.\nof S.F., 944 F.3d at 806 (finding irreparable harm where “the\npreliminary injunctions will force DHS to grant status to\nthose not legally entitled to it”).  The President determined in\nProclamation  No.  9945  that  immigrants  “who  have  not\ndemonstrated  any  ability  to  pay  for  their”  medical  care\nimpose significant and unwarranted costs on the American\nhealthcare system.  84 Fed. Reg. 53991.  The Proclamation\ndoes not apply once an immigrant has been admitted to the\nUnited States, so it can never apply to aliens admitted during\nthe  pendency  of  this  litigation.    See  84  Fed.  Reg.\nat 53992–93.  The costs they impose while the injunction\nremains in place are thus unrecoverable, creating irreparable\nharm.  See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir.\n2018).\nThe scope of the injunction here only confirms both the\nfact of irreparable harm and its magnitude.  The injunction\napplies worldwide and, by the majority’s estimation, “would\nnegatively affect approximately 60% of all immigrant visa\napplicants”  and  “375,000  immigrants  each  year.”    Maj.\nOp. 19.  This only “prove[s] [the government’s] point,”\nconfirming  that  the  harm  “is  not  only  irreparable,  but\nsignificant.”  City & Cty. of S.F., 944 F.3d at 806.  Nor is the\nresulting injury limited to “third parties,” as the majority\nsuggests.  Maj. Op. 19.  The government funds considerable\naspects of our healthcare system, and it is undeniable that the\nuninsured would require the government to “incur some\notherwise  avoidable  financial  costs if a stay is denied.” \nGolden Gate Rest. Ass’n v. City & Cty. of S.F., 512 F.3d\n1112, 1125 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Azar, 911 F.3d at 581\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 71 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 71\n(explaining that “economic harm” is “irreparable” when the\ngovernment “will not be able to recover monetary damages”).\nContrary to the majority opinion, the harms here are also\nnot “purely monetary.”  Maj. Op. 18.  The Proclamation\nidentifies non-monetary harms that the uninsured impose,\nsuch as increased strain on “publicly funded programs” and\noverreliance on emergency rooms, “causing overcrowding\nand delays for those who truly need emergency services.” \n84 Fed. Reg. 53991.  These too are irreparable harms that\ncannot be avoided absent a stay of the injunction.  See Golden\nGate Rest. Ass’n, 512 F.3d at 1125 (granting stay because\n“individuals without health coverage are significantly less\nlikely to seek timely medical care than those with health\ncoverage,”  and  consequently  are  more  likely  to  “seek\nemergency treatment” from government-funded hospitals and\nclinics).\nB\nThe  majority  opinion  disbelieves  the  government’s\nasserted harms because while the Proclamation states that\n“immigrants are about three times more likely than United\nStates citizens to lack health insurance,” 84 Fed. Reg 53991,”\nthere  is,  the  majority  complains,  “no  citation  in  the\nProclamation for this statistic.”  Maj. Op.16.  This is of a\npiece with the majority’s criticism that the Proclamation lacks\n“data-driven analysis” or a “further cost quantification” (an\napparently technical requirement that the majority opinion\nleaves undefined).  Id. at 17, 30.  The majority’s failure to\ngive the Executive any deference is clear legal error.\nA presidential proclamation is not a second-grade math\nassignment, where a student must “show his work” to get\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 72 of 97\n72 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ncredit.  In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court found it\n“questionable”  whether  the  President  operating  under\n§ 1182(f) was in any way required to “explain [his] finding[s]\nwith sufficient detail to enable judicial review.”  138 S. Ct.\nat 2409.  But “even assuming that some form of review is\nappropriate,” the Supreme Court still rejected “plaintiffs’\nrequest for a searching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the\nPresident’s justifications,” which would be “inconsistent with\nthe  broad  statutory  text  and  the  deference  traditionally\naccorded the President in this sphere.”  Id.\nThe majority’s demand that the government explain the\nProclamation’s factual findings, Maj. Op. 15–16, is thus\ndirectly contrary to the Supreme Court’s admonition that the\nPresident is “‘not required to conclusively link all of the\npieces in the puzzle before [courts] grant weight to [his]\nempirical conclusions.’”  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (quoting\nHolder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 35 (2010)). \nThe Constitution does not require the President to engage in\nthe  majority’s  preferred  “data-driven  analysis”  or  “cost\nquantification,” nor does § 1182(f).  Maj. Op.  17, 30. The\ncourt  today  thus  shows  a  profound  disrespect  to  the\nExecutive, contrary to precedent.  And the majority’s token\nacknowledgement that § 1182(f) “‘exudes deference to the\nPresident,’”  Maj.  Op.  28  (quoting  Hawaii,  138  S.  Ct.\nat 2408), is no substitute for the actual deference owed to the\nPresident’s findings when those findings are under review.\nThe majority opinion also errs in attempting to distinguish\nTrump v. Hawaii on the ground that the proclamation at issue\nthere  contained  “extensive  findings”  following  a\n“comprehensive”  inter-agency  review.    Maj.  Op.  18\n(quotations omitted).  As discussed above, Trump v. Hawaii\nrejected the premise that these findings were even necessary. \n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 73 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 73\nSee 138 S. Ct. at 2409 (rejecting “plaintiffs’ request for a\nsearching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the President’s\njustifications”).  Nor did the Supreme Court in Trump v.\nHawaii suggest that the quantum of findings at issue there\nrepresented a constitutional or statutory floor.  Instead, Trump\nv. Hawaii referenced prior presidential proclamations that\nwere just several sentences long.  Id.  As was the case with\nthe proclamation in Trump v. Hawaii itself, Proclamation No.\n9945 is “more detailed” than those.  Id.  The notion that\nTrump v. Hawaii somehow supports today’s decision is thus\nplainly incorrect.\nFinally, the majority seriously errs in suggesting that\nbecause the government is seeking a stay of an injunction,\nwhich  is  an  exercise  of  the  court’s  “discretion,”  the\ngovernment is not entitled to the deference that Trump v.\nHawaii commands.  Maj. Op. at 17.  The procedural posture\nof  a  case  is  not  a  license  to  disregard  the  fundamental\nprinciple that “‘it is not the judicial role . . . to probe and test\nthe justifications’ of immigration policies.”  Hawaii, 138 S.\nCt. at 2419 (quoting Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 799 (1977)). \nThe court’s approach loads the dice against the government\nany time a district court enjoins a government policy.  Simply\nput, the deference that § 1182(f) “exudes,” id. at 2408, does\nnot evaporate whenever a single district court has enjoined a\npresidential policy and the government is seeking a stay.\nIn any event, for all the court’s refusal to accept the\nProclamation’s determination that immigrants are three times\nmore  likely  than  citizens  to  lack  health  insurance,  the\nplaintiffs do not even contest this point.  In fact, a report that\nplaintiffs’ own expert authored (which is referenced in his\nexpert  materials  in  this  case)  makes  the  very  same\nobservation: “[A]lmost half of all immigrants—here defined\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 74 of 97\n74 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nas noncitizen immigrants—are uninsured, a level that is about\nthree times higher than for native-born citizens.”  Leighton\nKu, Why Immigrants Lack Adequate Access to Health Care\nand Health Insurance (Migration Policy Inst., Sept. 1, 2006).\nC\nInstead  of  giving  the  President  any  deference,  the\nmajority makes some findings of its own and then treats those\nas authoritative.  Contrary to the Proclamation, the majority\ntells us there is no irreparable harm because, in fact, “the\nimpact of uninsured immigrants on uncompensated healthcare\ncosts is minimal.”  Maj. Op. 18.  For this, the majority relies\non only a single source: the declaration of plaintiffs’ expert,\nDr. Leighton Ku.  See id. at 17.  But exuding deference to\nDr. Ku is not what the law allows.\nDr. Ku is a professor of health policy.  The only prior\nexpert work he discloses is on behalf of plaintiffs who are\nchallenging various immigration policies from the current\npresidential administration.  Without any basis at all, Dr. Ku\nopines that “the President and the State Department, which is\ncharged with implementing the [P]roclamation, failed to\nconduct  a  careful  and  reasoned  analysis  of  the  policy.” \nDr. Ku criticizes the President for acting “without a reasoned\napproach  to  administrative  rulemaking,”  faulting  the\nExecutive for “fail[ing] to carefully consider the ramifications\nof this policy.”  Dr. Ku further maintains that “if the President\nis  concerned  about  reducing  uncompensated  care  as\nexpressed in the [P]roclamation, then it would make more\nsense to . . . expand[] Medicaid or other forms of health\ninsurance, such as the health insurance marketplaces.”  It\nshould go without saying that the Constitution does not\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 75 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 75\nenshrine  the  unsupported  legal  opinions  and  transparent\npolicy preferences of an unelected academic.\nThe majority’s fealty to Dr. Ku is even more remarkable\nwhen one examines his conclusion that uninsured immigrants\ndo not burden the American healthcare system.  Dr. Ku asks\nin his declaration: “[W]hat is the value of uncompensated\ncare provided to legally admitted immigrants who might have\nbeen affected by this [Proclamation]?”  Dr. Ku then admits\nthat “I am not aware of any information that accurately\nanswers this question.”  Id. (emphasis added).  That is enough\nto disregard his opinion.\nDr. Ku then proceeds to come up with an answer to the\nquestion on his own.  But in arriving at the figures that the\nmajority treats as definitive, Maj. Op. 16, Dr. Ku compares\n“recent immigrants” (those “who entered the U.S. within five\nyears” of 2017) to “not recent immigrants” (“U.S. born-\ncitizens and immigrants who have been in the U.S. for five\nyears or more” (emphasis added)).  This comparison does not\neven try to measure the cost of care provided to uninsured\nimmigrants in the United States.  No wonder even Dr. Ku in\nhis own declaration “recognize[s] that this is not an ideal\nanalysis.”\nAn expert who has disqualified himself under Daubert v.\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993),\nthrough his own admissions should not be the basis for\nenjoining a lawful presidential proclamation.  If nothing else\nis clear under the Constitution and Supreme Court case law\ninterpreting § 1182(f), it is that a professor’s self-described\n“not  .  .  .  ideal  analysis”  should  not  win  out  over  the\nconclusions of the President.  The majority’s elevation of\nDr. Ku’s declaration over the Executive’s determinations in\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 76 of 97\n76 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nthe Proclamation is a radical departure from settled law and\na serious threat to the democratic process.\nThe  majority  also  refuses  to  give  deference  to  the\nPresident based on its determination that “immigrants are\nmore likely to represent favorable insurance risk[s] in [ACA]\nmarketplaces because they tend to be relatively healthier than\nthe normal insured population and use fewer healthcare goods\nand  services.”    Maj.  Op.  17  (quotations  omitted).    The\nmajority purports to locate this conclusion in “[t]he record”\nin this case.  Id.\nBut what the majority cites on this point, and what it calls\n“the record,” is really just an amicus brief from twenty-one\nStates, the District of Columbia, and New York City, which\nwas submitted in the district court.  And what that amicus\nbrief cites are the comments these same States submitted in\nresponse to a State Department notice describing how the\nDepartment  would  implement  the  Proclamation.    These\ncomments did not disclose any underlying data or undertake\nany apparent study of immigrant healthcare costs.  See, e.g.,\nCovered Cal. Cmt. On DOS-2019-0039-0001 (Oct. 31, 2019),\navailable at: https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOS-\n2019-0039-0241 (California’s three-and-a-half page letter). \nBut  regardless,  it  is  quite  circular  for  administrative\ncomments that unsuccessfully “urge[d] the withdrawal” of\nProclamation No. 9945, id., to wind up as authoritative when\ncited in the same commenters’ amicus brief challenging that\nvery Proclamation.\nIn short, the majority’s determination that the government\nhas not made a showing of irreparable harm depends on its\nrefusal to give the President any deference at all, contrary to\nprecedent.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 77 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 77\nV\nThe government has shown an overwhelming likelihood\nof success on the merits, as well as irreparable harm. These\nfactors are “the most critical” in the stay analysis, and only\n“[o]nce an applicant satisfies” these factors will the court\nconsider “harm to the opposing party and weighing the public\ninterest.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 434–35.  Considering those third\nand fourth stay factors only confirms that the court should\nhave issued a stay.\nA\nThe majority opinion strives to create the impression that\nthe named plaintiffs’ relatives were on the cusp of entering\nthe United States and that only the Proclamation is holding\nthem back.  The majority thus asserts that “[t]he individual\n[p]laintiffs are seven U.S. citizens” whose “family members\nhave  successfully  completed  the  traditional  steps  for\nobtaining an immigrant visa.”  Maj. Op. 12–13.  But that is\nuntrue: most of plaintiffs’ relatives do not even have visa\ninterviews scheduled and some have not submitted required\ndocumentation.3  The majority further states that plaintiffs’\n“family members had qualified for entry under established\nimmigration policy.”  Id. at 36.  That is also untrue.  Nor is\nthere any basis for the majority’s scaled back assertion that\nthe  named  plaintiffs’  relatives  were  “otherwise  likely\n3 The only exception is the relative of one named plaintiff who\nreceived an immigrant visa after the district court issued its injunction. \nPlfs.’ Notice of Additional Facts, Doe #1 v. Trump, Case No. 3:19-cv-\n01743-SI (D. Or.), ECF No. 123.  But neither the Proclamation nor the\ndistrict court’s injunction now have any bearing on this person.  This\nsection will thus discuss only the plaintiffs with any potential future harm,\neven if that harm is ultimately speculative.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 78 of 97\n78 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nqualified for entry under § 1182(a)” for admission into the\nUnited States.  Id. at 21.  With the one exception noted above,\nsee ante at 77 n.3, it is entirely speculative whether the named\nplaintiffs’  relatives  will  meet  the  numerous  eligibility\nrequirements and would be allowed to enter this country at\nall, regardless of Proclamation No. 9945.\nThe majority fails to disclose that the named plaintiffs\nhave only received approved I-130 petitions.  A United States\ncitizen files an I-130 petition with the U.S. Citizenship and\nImmigration Services (USCIS) or a consular official, on\nbehalf of a relative who is seeking to become a permanent\nresident in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(i);\n8 C.F.R. § 204.1(a)(1).  Approval of an I-130 petition is “only\nthe first step in the process” toward becoming a lawful\npermanent resident.   Montoya v. Holder, 744 F.3d 614,\n616 (9th Cir. 2014); see also Vasquez de Alcantar v. Holder,\n645 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2011).\nOnly then, after the alien proceeds through the queue,\ndoes the alien apply for a visa and the United States begin its\nreview of any request for admission.  Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct.\n2128, 2131 (2015) (plurality op.) (“If and when a petition is\napproved, the alien may apply for a visa by submitting the\nrequired  documents  and  appearing  at  a  United  States\nEmbassy or consulate for an interview with a consular officer. \nBefore issuing a visa, the consular officer must ensure the\nalien is not inadmissible under any provision of the INA.”)\n(citations omitted); Montoya, 744 F.3d at 616.  As we have\nrecognized, “[t]he wait time for these immigrant visas can be\nconsiderable.”  Landin-Molina v. Holder, 580 F.3d 913, 920\nn.8 (9th Cir. 2009); see also Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio,\n573 U.S. 41, 50 (2014) (plurality op.) (“All of this takes\ntime—and  often  a  lot  of  it  .  .  .  .  A  family-sponsored\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 79 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 79\nimmigrant may stand in line for years—or even decades—just\nwaiting for an immigrant visa to become available.”).  There\nare also myriad reasons why a person may ultimately be\ndenied entry.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a); 22 C.F.R. § 42.62.  The\nProclamation,  of  course,  ensures  that  all  these  other\nrequirements for admission remain intact.\nAs the foregoing confirms, approval of an I-130 petition\n“cannot be the equivalent of inspection and authorization to\nenter and remain in the United States.”  Vasquez de Alcantar,\n645 F.3d at 1103.  It “does not confer any change in status.” \nId.; see also Ngongo v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 821, 823 (9th Cir.\n2005).  Instead, we have explained, approval of an I-130\npetition  “does  not  raise  [an]  alien’s  expectations”  for\npermanent residence “above the level of hope.”  Montoya,\n744 F.3d at 617 (quotations omitted).  The majority therefore\nerrs in suggesting that plaintiffs’ relatives were qualified to\nbecome lawful permanent residents or were about to reach\nthat status, but for the Proclamation.\nThe named plaintiffs’ declarations only confirm this. \nWhen the district court issued its injunction, none of the\nplaintiffs’ relatives had consular interview dates scheduled,\nand seven such relatives are still awaiting interview dates. \nDoe #1, 2020 WL 1689727, at *6–7.  Interviews aside,\nvarious plaintiffs were still working to submit the appropriate\npaperwork to apply for a visa when the injunction was issued. \nSee Doe #2 Decl. ¶ 7 (“[W]e are currently working on the\ncollection of information and documents . . . .”); id. ¶ 9 (“I\nwill need a joint sponsor in order to complete the affidavit of\nsupport section of my parents’ immigrant visa.”); Doe #3\nDecl. ¶ 9 (“[M]y husband and I have been working to gather\nthe documents required for consular processing.  Several\ntimes, we thought we had all of the paperwork submitted, but\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 80 of 97\n80 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nthe  government  then  requests  additional,  and  different\ninformation from us.”); Ramos Decl. ¶ 12 (explaining that she\nis “in the process of gathering all the documents required by\nthe consulate”).  And many months later, at least two of\nplaintiffs’  relatives  are  still  “collecting  the  necessary\ninformation.”  Doe #1, 2020 WL 1689727, at *6.  This only\nconfirms that plaintiffs’ relatives are still in the middle of the\nvisa process.\nEqually misplaced is the majority’s emphasis on certain\nfamily  members  who  have  received  provisional  I-601A\nwaivers.  See Maj. Op. 21.  I-601A waivers are available to\naliens in the consular visa process who have been unlawfully\npresent in the United States and who are immediate relatives\nof U.S. citizens.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R.\n§ 212.7(e).  The I-601A waiver was developed to expedite the\ninterview process by allowing applicants “who require a\nwaiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence to apply for\nsuch a waiver in the U.S. before they depart for an immigrant\nvisa  interview  at  a  U.S.  embassy  or  consulate  abroad.” \nRomero v. Barr, 937 F.3d 282, 287 n.2 (4th Cir. 2019)\n(emphasis added).\nThe grant of an I-601A waiver, like the approval of an I-\n130 petition, is thus a prefatory mechanism to facilitate the\nvisa application process.  It does not mean that plaintiffs’\nrelatives were “otherwise likely qualified” for admission to\nthe United States.  Nor can the majority reasonably maintain\nthat the Proclamation will result in family separation for\npersons with I-601A waivers.  Maj. Op. 21.  Once again,\nbecause there is no indication that plaintiffs’ relatives are\notherwise admissible, it is impossible to say that any family\nseparation is due to the Proclamation, as opposed to the\nnumerous  other  requirements  that  our  immigration  laws\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 81 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 81\nimpose.  Given that plaintiffs’ relatives have not completed\nthe visa process, the Proclamation is not the immediate (or\nfuture) cause of any alleged family separation.\nFinally, it also is not apparent that plaintiffs’ family\nmembers will be unable satisfy the Proclamation.  The district\ncourt enjoined the Proclamation before it could take effect,\nallowing no chance for any person to even attempt to satisfy\nthe Proclamation’s requirements.  The Proclamation allowed\nthe Secretary of State to “establish standards and procedures”\nto govern consular officers’ application of the Proclamation,\n84 Fed. Reg. 53993; due to the injunction, we cannot know\nhow  any  such  guidance  would  affect  consular  officers’\ndeterminations.\nAlthough the majority claims the plaintiffs “submitted\nevidence”  that  their  relatives  are  unable  to  meet  the\nProclamation’s requirements, Maj. Op. 19,  many of the\nplaintiffs’ declarations provide no details about their finances,\nthe amount of income they or their relatives have available,\nor the prices of qualifying plans under the Proclamation.  The\nProclamation also gives the Secretary of State or his designee\nthe ability to exempt aliens “whose entry would be in the\nnational interest,” as determined on a “case-by-case basis.” \n84 Fed. Reg. 53993.  For all these reasons, it is entirely\nspeculative how the Proclamation will affect anyone who is\nstill going through the immigration process.\nIn short, the sincere “hope” that plaintiffs’ relatives will\nqualify for legal status is no substitute for actual evidence that\nplaintiffs’  relatives  are  entitled  to  visas  but  for  the\nProclamation.  On that issue, there is no evidence at all.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 82 of 97\n82 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nB\nThe majority creates another misimpression in purporting\nto justify the injunction “based on evidence in the record” that\nthe “Proclamation would cause significant harm to 21 states,\nthe District of Columbia, and New York City if allowed to go\ninto effect there.”  Maj. Op. 37.  The majority tells us that\n“[t]he record demonstrates” the “significant harm” these\njurisdictions would suffer if the Proclamation is allowed to go\ninto effect.  Id. at 34–35 (emphasis added).  And the majority\nopinion further informs us this “evidence [was] credited by\nthe  district  court,  and  that  “[t]he  government  does  not\nseriously contest this evidence.”  Id. at 35 (emphases added).\nThese statements are, regrettably, quite misleading.  The\nonly source for the cited “evidence” is the amicus brief that\ntwenty-one States, the District of Columbia, and New York\nCity filed in the district court.  The Supreme Court has\ninstructed that “the stated desires of amici are no substitute\nfor a class action, are not evidence in the case, and do not\ninfluence our decision; we examine an amicus curiae brief\nsolely for whatever aid it provides in analyzing the legal\nquestions before us.”  Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City\nStudios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 434 n.16 (1984).  The majority\nopinion  violates  these  fundamental  precepts.    But  it  is,\nunfortunately, more problematic than that.\nThe “evidence” of “significant harm” to the jurisdictions\nthat  joined  the  amicus  brief  consists  of  the  following:\nthousands  of  persons  in  these  States  become  lawful\npermanent residents each year, and immigrants “are vital to\nthe economic, civic, and social fabric of our states and city.” \nMaj. Op. 35 (quotations omitted).  These assertions cannot\njustify the district court’s injunction.  It is of course true that\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 83 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 83\nimmigrants are vital to the economic and cultural life of our\nStates and cities.  But by this logic, any federal policy that\nreduces immigration could be enjoined on that basis, giving\nStates and localities the power to negate federal immigration\npolicy.  The acknowledged contributions that immigrants\nmake to our States are thus not grounds for enjoining the\nExecutive Branch from recalibrating immigration rules in line\nwith the President’s lawful policy goals.  And it cannot be\nthat State or local governments that oppose a presidential\npolicy can have the policy enjoined through the commonplace\nact of joining a State-led amicus brief.\nC\nFor all the reasons I have set forth, the public interest also\nstrongly supports staying the injunction.  Nken, 556 U.S.\nat 434.  As we have recognized, the government’s interests\nand the public interest tend to merge since “responsible\npublic officials . . . have already considered” the public\ninterest in enacting the policy at issue. Golden Gate, 512 F.3d\nat  1127.    Our  review  of  the  public  interest  is  thus\n“constrained,” and “it is beyond our province to evaluate the\nwisdom” of the Proclamation that the President chose to put\nin effect. Id.\nThat is the result that the four stay factors require.  The\nmajority, however, adds a new, unauthorized stay factor:\npreservation of the status quo.  Maj. Op. 35–36.  The majority\nreasons that the “public interest lies with maintaining the\nstatus quo while the appeal is pending,” and that the status\nquo is a world without the Proclamation.  Id. at 36.  The\nmajority is wrong on two levels.  Circuit precedent is clear\nthat maintenance of a “status quo” is not among the factors\nthat  courts  consider  in  resolving  a  request  to  stay  an\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 84 of 97\n84 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ninjunction.  And even if it were, the majority is wrong on\nwhat the status quo is.\nIn  Golden  Gate  Restaurant  Association  v.  City  and\nCounty of San Francisco, 512 F.3d 1112 (9th Cir. 2008), we\ngranted a motion to stay pending appeal a district court’s\ninjunction  of  a  San  Francisco  ordinance  that  required\nemployers to make minimum healthcare expenditures to or on\nbehalf of their employees.  The employers argued that the\nCity, in seeking a stay of the injunction and reinstitution of its\nordinance pending appeal, “must meet a higher standard,”\nbecause “in [the employers’] view, a stay would change the\nstatus quo.”  Id. at 1116.  We disagreed.  We held that the\nSupreme Court “did not include preservation of the status quo\namong the factors regulating the issuance of a stay.”  Id.\n(quotations omitted).  And we noted that “several of our sister\ncircuits,  in  reviewing  preliminary  injunctions  enjoining\nimplementation of new legislation, have granted motions for\nstays of those injunctions pending appeal without weighing\nwhether a stay would disturb or preserve the status quo.”  Id. \nat 1117.\nOur decision in Golden Gate also demonstrates that the\nmajority  misperceives  the  status  quo,  even  if  it  were  a\nrelevant consideration.  As we explained in Golden Gate,\n“granting a stay” of the injunction “would, in a real sense,\npreserve rather than change the status quo,” because “[i]n the\nabsence of the district court injunction” the ordinance “would\nnow be part of the status quo.”  Id. at 1116.  The rules\ngoverning stays should be no different for an ordinance that\nrequires employers to confer healthcare benefits (Golden\nGate) than a rule requiring immigrants to demonstrate they\nwill have qualifying health insurance (this case).  As in\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 85 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 85\nGolden Gate, in the absence of the district court’s injunction,\nProclamation No. 9945 would be part of the status quo.\nThe true status quo is thus not a judicially created one. \nAs I previously explained, “while the plaintiffs assume that\nthe  status  quo  is  a  world  without  the  Presidential\nProclamation, . . . the actual status quo is a legal environment\nin which the President possesses ‘sweeping proclamation\npower in § 1182(f),’ Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408 (quotations\nomitted), and in which Proclamation No. 9945 is therefore\nauthorized.”  Doe #1, 944 F.3d at 1229 (Bress, J., dissenting). \nA stay “simply suspend[s] judicial alteration of the status\nquo,” Nken, 556 U.S. at 429, which is all the government is\nrequesting here.\nThe majority is therefore wrong to assert that “[i]n the\ngovernment’s re-imagining of the status quo in this context,\nthis  factor  would  always  tip  in  the  government’s  favor,\neffectively rendering the Court powerless to exercise its\ndiscretion on this factor in such instances.”  Maj. Op. 36. \nThat is not correct, because the government must meet the\ntraditional  Nken  factors  to  earn  a  stay.    See  Planned\nParenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott,\n134 S. Ct. 506, 507 (2013) (Scalia, J., concurring) (explaining\nthat no “accepted standard” “require[s] a court to delay\nenforcement of a state law that the court has determined is\nlikely constitutional on the ground that the law threatens\ndisruption of the status quo”) (quotations omitted).  It is\ninstead the majority that is “re-imagining” the status quo and\ncreating a rule that, contrary to Golden Gate, would require\ndenying a stay of any injunction that blocks new policies\nfrom going into effect, because anything new can always be\ndescribed as changing the status quo.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 86 of 97\n86 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nVI\nWe arrive at last at the scope of the injunction, which\napplies nationwide and to persons around the world seeking\nentry into the United States.  My view, of course, is that there\nshould be no injunction in the first place.  But the extreme\nscope of the district court’s injunction presents new and\ntroubling issues of its own.\nIn a brief section, the court today blesses the district\ncourt’s injunction based on a class certification order entered\nmonths after the fact and the purported need for uniformity in\nimmigration policy.  See Maj. Op. 37–40.  The majority’s\napproach—and the class certification decision it implicitly\nendorses—are  procedurally  and  substantively  flawed. \nNationwide injunctions raise many fundamental questions\nabout the proper use of judicial power.  Perhaps for that\nreason,  the  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  stayed  such\ninjunctions pending appeal.  See Innovation Law Lab, 2020\nWL 1161432, at *1; New York, 140 S. Ct. at 599; E. Bay\nSanctuary Covenant, 140 S. Ct. at 3; Int’l Refugee Assistance\nProject, 138 S. Ct. at 542; Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 542.  We\nshould  have  done  that  ourselves  in  this  case.    Today’s\ndecision unfortunately reflects yet another example of the\nmisuse of universal injunctions and the misunderstanding of\nclass certification on which they are so frequently premised.\nA\nLet’s begin with the sequence of events here, which\nshould be cause for concern.  When the district court issued\nits injunction in November 2019, no class had been certified\nand any putative “class members” were not parties to the\ncase.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S. 299, 313–14\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 87 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 87\n(2011).  Under what I had thought was the law of our circuit,\nnationwide relief is only appropriate where “necessary to give\nprevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”  Azar,\n911  F.3d  at  581  (emphasis  in  original  and  quotations\nomitted); see also New York, 140 S. Ct. at 600 (Gorsuch, J.,\nconcurring) (“Equitable remedies, like remedies in general,\nare meant to redress the injuries sustained by a particular\nplaintiff in a particular lawsuit.”); Zepeda v. INS, 753 F.2d\n719, 728 n.1 (9th Cir. 1983) (“Without a properly certified\nclass, a court cannot grant relief on a class-wide basis.”).\nThe district court’s injunction was thus vastly overbroad\nwhen issued.  At that time, any injunction could at most have\nextended  to  the  named  plaintiffs,  because  no  further\ninjunction would have been necessary to give these plaintiffs\nrelief.  Azar, 911 F.3d at 581.  As I thus wrote many months\nago when we were considering the government’s request for\ntemporary  emergency  relief  pending  appeal,  the  district\ncourt’s universal injunction could not stand because it “short-\ncircuits  the  procedures  for  class  certification  by  giving\nthousands of persons not before the court the relief that the\nclass certification process is designed to evaluate.”  Doe #1,\n944 F.3d at 1228–29 (Bress, J., dissenting).\nNow fast-forward  many months  later.   Months  after\nbriefing and argument in this court on the government’s\nmotion for stay pending appeal—and nearly half a year after\nthe district court first blocked the Proclamation from taking\neffect  nationwide—the  district  court  issued  its  class\ncertification decision, certifying nationwide and worldwide\nclasses.  Doe #1, 2020 WL 1689727, at *17.  The majority\ntoday relies on this later class certification decision to leave\nin place the district court’s earlier universal injunction.  Maj.\nOp. 37.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 88 of 97\n88 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nThis is quite unsettling.  The majority’s reliance on the\ndistrict  court’s  recent  class  certification  decision  is  a\nconcession that until a short time ago, there was no valid\nbasis for the district court to enjoin the Proclamation as to\nanyone  but  the  named  plaintiffs.    Maj.  Op.  37  (“[T]he\ninjunction is appropriate at this juncture, whether or not it\nwas when originally issued.”).  Yet when the issue was\npresented to us four months ago, we refused to stay any\nportion of the nationwide injunction.  See Doe #1, 944 F.3d\nat 1228–29 (Bress, J., dissenting).  That, in turn, allowed the\ndistrict court to catch up to our deliberative process and issue\nthe  class  certification  ruling  that  supposedly  justifies  a\nuniversal injunction and without which the injunction could\nnot stand.\nThe problems with this course of events are innumerable. \nBlocking a presidential policy for many months nationwide,\nwithout justification, is no small thing.  And by ratifying the\nscope of the district court’s injunction, the majority invites\ndistrict courts to issue overbroad injunctions up front, only to\nbe followed some months later by the class certification\ndecisions  that  supposedly  undergird  them.    This  has  it\nbackwards.  The scope of a preliminary injunction should be\nsupported at the time it is issued, not months later and while\nthe injunction is on appeal.  The inversion of operations that\nthe  court tacitly  approves  today  will  only  lead  to  path-\ndependency in the district courts, creating hydraulic pressure\nto certify a class in order to justify a previously issued\nnationwide injunction that is now on appeal.  That is not how\nthis process should work.  Indeed, the government has not\neven yet had the opportunity to appeal the district court’s\nclass certification ruling, which is now, per the majority’s\nopinion, the linchpin of the district court’s injunction.  See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 89 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 89\nThe majority opinion treats the district court’s disordered\napproach as “no harm, no foul” because this is the only case\nchallenging Proclamation No. 9945.  The majority tells us\nthat “[n]o litigation challenging this Proclamation is pending\nelsewhere, alleviating concerns occasionally associated with\nnationwide  injunctions,”  namely,  “that  such  injunctions\ndeprive other courts from offering diverse perspectives on the\nlegal issues while similar litigation is ongoing in multiple\nforums.”  Maj. Op. 38.\nBut why is there no other case challenging Proclamation\nNo. 9945?  The most likely reason is because the district\ncourt in this case blocked the Proclamation before it could\neven take effect.  With an all-encompassing injunction in\nhand, no putative class member had any reason to bring suit\nelsewhere.    Far  from  showing  that  the  district  court’s\ninjunction poses no threat to the percolation of legal issues,\nthe absence of parallel litigation on Proclamation No. 9945\nconfirms that nationwide injunctions can, in fact, stymie the\ndevelopment of legal challenges.  See E. Bay Sanctuary\nCovenant v. Barr, 934 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir. 2019); Azar,\n911 F.3d at 583.  All of this was made possible by the district\ncourt’s decision to enjoin the Proclamation first and certify\nclasses many months after the fact.\nB\nThe district court’s universal injunction fails not only as\na matter of procedure, but on substantive grounds as well. \nNationwide injunctions of federal policies are increasingly\ncommon yet highly controversial.  Some members of the\nSupreme Court have raised important concerns about them. \nSee New York, 140 S. Ct. at 600–01 (Gorsuch, J., concurring);\nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2425–29 (Thomas, J., concurring).  This\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 90 of 97\n90 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ncase  underscores  that  the  problem  with  nationwide\ninjunctions often lies not merely in their equitable excess, see\nNew York, 140 S. Ct. at 600–01 (Gorsuch, J., concurring), but\nwith a failure  to take seriously  the restrictions  on class\ncertification that Rule 23 imposes.  The problem with many\nnationwide  injunctions,  in  other  words,  is  that  they  are\npremised on class certification orders that are themselves\ninfirm.  That is the case here.\nClass certification, “an exception to the usual rule that\nlitigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual\nnamed parties only,” is “proper only if the trial court is\nsatisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of\nRule 23(a) have been satisfied.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349–51 (2011) (quotations omitted). \nMost challenges to federal policies like the one before us seek\ninjunctive  relief  classes  under  Rule  23(b)(2).    But  such\nclasses  are  still  subject  to  the  strictures  of  Rule  23(a),\nincluding the core requirement that a case present “questions\nof law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). \nThat  provision  requires  “not  the  raising  of  common\n‘questions’—even in droves—but rather, the capacity of a\nclass-wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to\ndrive the resolution of the litigation.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S.\nat 350 (emphasis in original and quotations omitted).\nThe majority states without analysis that the universal\ninjunction here “is also based on the certified subclasses,\nwhich eliminates some concern that a nationwide injunction\nis overly burdensome.”  Maj. Op. 38–39.  But even an initial\nglance at the two classes the district court certified shows that\nthe class certification here was anything but proper.  The first\ncertified class, consisting of persons in the United States\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 91 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 91\npetitioning for a family member to receive an immigrant visa,\nwas defined as follows:\n(1) U.S. Petitioner Subclass:\nIndividuals in the United States who currently\nhave or will have an approved or pending\npetition to the United States government to\nsponsor a noncitizen family member for an\nimmigrant visa; and whose sponsored family\nmember is subject to the Proclamation and\nunable to demonstrate to a consular officer’s\nsatisfaction that he or she “will be covered by\napproved health insurance” within 30 days\nafter  entry  or  will  be  able  “to  pay  for\nreasonably foreseeable medical costs”; and\nDoe #1, 2020 WL 1689727, at *17.\nThe central problem with this class definition is that\nwhether the Proclamation will have any effect on putative\nclass members depends on two determinations that are highly\nindividualized: (1) whether the class member’s relative would\nbe  otherwise  qualified  for  an  immigrant  visa  but  for\nProclamation No. 9945; and (2) whether the class member’s\nrelative could satisfy the Proclamation.  Classwide injunctive\nrelief under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate “only when a single\ninjunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to\neach member of the class.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360.  And\ncommonality  under  Rule  23(a)  “requires  the  plaintiff  to\ndemonstrate that the class members have suffered the same\ninjury.”  Id. at 350 (quotations omitted).  “That common\ncontention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is\ncapable  of  classwide  resolution—which  means  that\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 92 of 97\n92 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\ndetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that\nis central to the validity of each one of the claims in one\nstroke.”  Id.\nIn this case, this analysis cannot be done on a classwide\nbasis, turning instead on highly individualized determinations\nabout whether a given person would meet the INA’s various\nrequirements for eligibility and whether, based on a person’s\nfinancial, family, medical, and employment situation, he\nwould be able to satisfy the Proclamation.  Indeed, the class\ndefinition on its face does not even require that the class\nmembers’ relatives be otherwise qualified for immigrant\nvisas, and it ties class membership to the mere filing of a\n“petition,” which (as the district court acknowledged) is just\n“[t]he first step” in the visa application process.  Doe #1,\n2020 WL 1689727, at *3.  Persons in this situation have not\neven submitted the required documentation.  In fact, the class\nis not even limited to persons who have “filed” a petition at\nall, but extends to anyone who “will” file one.\nIt is no answer, as the district court suggested, id. at *12,\nthat plaintiffs in this case are not seeking visa determinations. \nThe  premise  of  this  entire  lawsuit—and  the  asserted\nimmediate need for the injunction—is that Proclamation No.\n9945 is the “but for” cause preventing plaintiffs’ relatives\nfrom obtaining immigrant visas.  That is why the majority\nopinion goes to great lengths to assert, albeit inaccurately,\nthat  plaintiffs’  relatives  were “otherwise  likely  qualified\nunder § 1182(a)” for admission into the United States and had\nfamily  members  who  “had  qualified  for  entry  under\nestablished immigration policy.”  Maj. Op. 21, 36.  Plaintiffs\ncannot make this point in seeking an injunction, but then\nignore it when it comes to class certification.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 93 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 93\nThe district court’s second class of “foreign nationals”\nhas, if possible, even more problems under Rule 23.  That\nclass is defined as follows:\n(2) Visa Applicant Subclass:\nIndividuals who are foreign nationals who\n(i) have applied for or will soon apply to the\nUnited States government for an immigrant\nvisa; (ii) are otherwise eligible to be granted\nthe  visa;  but  (iii)  are  subject  to  the\nProclamation and unable to demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of a consular officer that they\n“will  be  covered  by  approved  health\ninsurance” within 30 days after entry or will\nbe able “to pay for reasonably foreseeable\nmedical costs.”\nDoe #1, 2020 WL 1689727, at *17.\nThe enormity of this class should be apparent: it includes\npersons  in  countries  all  over  the  world.    The  same\nindividualized determinations described above for the U.S.\nclass will be necessary for each member of this foreign\nnationals class, except the determinations will be even more\ndifficult to accomplish when class members applying for\nadmission are located outside this country.  In fact, this class\nis not even limited to persons who have applied for visas, but\nextends to those who “will soon apply”—a term of uncertain\nscope that requires consideration of yet more individualized\nissues.  It is impossible to know today who, if anyone, will\nactually benefit from class certification since we do not know\nwho otherwise qualifies for a visa to the United States or who\nwill be unable to satisfy the Proclamation’s requirements.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 94 of 97\n94 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nIn  short,  the  idea  that  “class  certification”  is  the\nincantation needed for a nationwide injunction misses the\npoint that Rule 23 is designed to impose limits on broad\nrelief, not to grease it.  The above discussion is not intended\nto  exhaust  the  problems  with  the  district  court’s  class\ncertification decision.  But it shows that in this case, the\ninjunction’s extraordinary and improper scope depends on a\nclass certification ruling that does not withstand scrutiny\nunder Rule 23.  One suspects that many of the current issues\nwith nationwide injunctions can be traced to misapplications\nof Rule 23.  That is, at least, the case here.4\nC\nFinally, the majority opinion errs in justifying the district\ncourt’s  universal  injunction  based  on  “the  need  for  a\ncomprehensive and unified immigration policy.”  Maj. Op. 39\n(quotations omitted).  It is of course true that many cases\nfrom  the  Supreme  Court  and  this  court  emphasize  the\nimportance of a uniform immigration policy.  E.g., Arizona\nv. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 401 (2012); Lemus v. Lynch,\n842 F.3d 641, 649 (9th Cir. 2016).  But the original context\nof  these  statements  was  the  interpretation  of  federal\nimmigration law.  That is true of the lead cases the majority\ncites as well.  See Maj. Op. 39 (citing Arizona and Kahn v.\nINS, 36 F.3d 1412, 1414 (9th Cir. 1994)).\n4 The majority suggests that “provisional” class certification is a basis\nfor nationwide relief at the preliminary injunction stage.  Maj. Op. 37. \nDespite its softer-sounding name, provisional class certification is still\ngoverned by the requirements of Rule 23.  E.g., Meyer v. Portfolio\nRecovery  Assocs.,  LLC,  707  F.3d  1036,  1041–42  (9th  Cir.  2012);\nValentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234–35 (9th Cir. 1996). \nIn any event, the district court had not certified a class—provisionally or\notherwise—when it entered the injunction in this case.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 95 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 95\nIn more recent times, however, our circuit has co-opted\nthe  policy  of  promoting  uniform immigration  laws  as  a\njustification  for  courts  issuing  nationwide  injunctions of\nExecutive Branch immigration policies.  See, e.g., East Bay\nSanctuary Covenant, 950 F.3d 1242, 1283–84 (9th Cir. 2020). \nThe fit is not a good one.  That there can be an interest in\nhaving uniform immigration policies does not mean it is the\ncourts that can set those uniform policies.  That is a decidedly\ndifferent question.\nWhether Congress intended a uniform policy in statutes\nlike the INA says nothing about whether—when courts are\nenjoining the immigration policies of democratically elected\nofficials—it is preferable to go big instead of small.  Indeed,\nif uniform immigration policy is the value to be prized above\nall else, nationwide injunctions will always be necessary,\ncontrary to our cases.  See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant,\n934  F.3d  at  1029  (rejecting  the  view  that  a  nationwide\ninjunction is appropriate “any time an enjoined action has\npotential  nationwide  effects,”  which  “would  turn  broad\ninjunctions into the rule rather than the exception”).  Perhaps\nunsurprisingly, when we recently invoked the interest in\nuniform  immigration  laws  in  allowing  a  nationwide\ninjunction, the Supreme Court stepped in and stayed the\ninjunction.  Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, 951 F.3d 1073,\n1094–95 (9th Cir. 2020), stay granted, 2020 WL 1161432,\nat *1.\nIn this case, the majority opinion tells us that “a more\nlimited  injunction  of  the  Proclamation  would  needlessly\ncomplicate” immigration enforcement, whereas a nationwide\ninjunction “promotes uniformity in administering federal\nimmigration  law.”    Maj.  Op.  39–40  (citing  East  Bay\nSanctuary  Covenant,  950  F.3d  at  1284).    But  it  is  the\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 96 of 97\n96 DOE #1 V. TRUMP\nExecutive  Branch, not the courts,  that are charged with\nenforcing the immigration laws.  And in this court, the\ngovernment maintains it is better policy for the injunction to\nbe narrowed, preferring a more limited enforcement of the\nProclamation to none at all.  If the scope of an injunction\nshould turn on which approach is superior for “administering\nfederal immigration law,” Maj. Op. 39–40, why should our\nview on that question prevail?  It is unfortunate that courts\nhave injected themselves into debates such as this, which are\nfar outside our role and competence.\nIt is thus somewhat fitting that the majority opinion\ninvokes  as  authority  for  the  district  court’s  nationwide\ninjunction and the “uniformity of immigration law” rationale\nour circuit’s decision in Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662 (9th\nCir.  2017).    Maj.  Op.  39  (citing  the  decision  for  the\nproposition that “[b]ecause this case implicates immigration\npolicy,  a  nationwide  injunction  was  necessary  to  give\nPlaintiffs a full expression of their rights”).  As the majority\nmust quickly acknowledge, the cited decision was then “rev’d\non other grounds” by the Supreme Court in Trump v. Hawaii,\nMaj. Op. 39—a decision that vacated our court’s nationwide\ninjunction and the very case that confirms Proclamation No.\n9945 is a valid exercise of the President’s authority.  In fact,\nthe referenced decision from this court in the Trump v.\nHawaii litigation, and this court’s discussion of uniformity in\nimmigration law, was handed down after the Supreme Court\nhad already stayed the nationwide injunction in full pending\nappeal.  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 542; Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d\n675, 701 (9th Cir. 2017).\nThe uniformity we should have pursued is the uniformity\nof decision with Trump v. Hawaii.  That would have required\n\nCase 3:19-cv-01743-SI    Document 144    Filed 05/04/20    Page 97 of 97\nDOE #1 V. TRUMP 97\nstaying in full the district court’s improper and overbroad\ninjunction.  Because we do not do so, I respectfully dissent.",
