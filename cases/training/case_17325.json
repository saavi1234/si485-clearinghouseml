    "summary": "<p>On March 23, 2016, a resident of Flint, Michigan filed this class action lawsuit in the Michigan Court of Claims on behalf of her child and all other children in Flint who suffered brain damage from drinking unsafe tap water during the Flint water crisis. The plaintiff sued numerous state officials, including the Governor and Flint emergency managers. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought class certification, declaratory relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants were grossly negligent because they continued to &ldquo;falsely reassure the public&rdquo; that the water was safe despite evidence to the contrary.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that, shortly after Flint officials began using water from the Flint River in 2013, the defendants began to receive complaints from residents about the color, taste, and odor of the water. By August 2014, Flint water tested positive for E. coli. and several &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; advisories were issued by the city of Flint through September 2014. But the water also contained lead, and boiling the water increased its lead concentration. The plaintiffs also emphasized the dangers of children consuming lead. According to the plaintiffs, children absorb forty to fifty percent of an oral dose of lead compared with three to ten percent absorption for adults.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants removed the case on May 31, 2016. They gave two reasons: first, that they acted under color of federal law, 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1442, and second, that the plaintiffs&rsquo; negligence claims required construction of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the EPA&rsquo;s Lead and Copper Rule; these federal questions, they said, justified removal under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1441.</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2017, Judge Gordon J. Quist ruled that the defendants were not &ldquo;acting under any federal officer or agency&rdquo; when they took the actions that formed the basis of the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims, so they were not entitled to removal under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1442. In addition, Judge Quist concluded that the court did not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1441 because their negligence claims did not &ldquo;implicate an important federal interest.&rdquo; Accordingly, the case was remanded to Michigan Court of Claims.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2017, the defendants appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision on April 16, 2018. Judge White described the relationship between the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA as &ldquo;cooperative federalism, not an agency relationship&rdquo; and concluded that the defendants were not eligible for federal-officer removal. The Court of Appeals also determined that federal question jurisdiction did not exist, relying on <a href=\"../../../../case/17170/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mays v. Flint</a>, a similar case also arising from the Flint water crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants against appealed again, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on October 1, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>The case returned to the Michigan Court of Claims. (In fact, litigation in the Court of Claims had already resumed because the federal district court declined to stay its order remanding the case while the federal appeals proceeded.)</p>\r\n<p>The Court of Claims granted summary disposition in favor of some, but not all defendants in a series of orders beginning in 2017. Three governmental employees appealed, claiming governmental immunity. On March 14, 2019, the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that their liability depended on whether the defendants&rsquo; conduct was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs&rsquo; injury, which was not a suitable topic for summary disposition. 2019 WL 1211469. The defendants appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>On July 2, 2019 the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the appeal to be held in abeyance pending the decision in <em>Mays v. Flint</em>, as it could resolve issues raised in this case. 2019 WL 2872282. Subsequently, following the July 29, 2020 decision in <em>Mays v. Flint</em>, the Michigan Supreme Court denied the application for appeal. 2020 WL 6301869.</p>\r\n<p>The case returned once again to the Court of Claims, and on December 3, 2020, the case was stayed pending the finalization of a settlement.</p>\r\n<p>As of February 5, 2021, the case is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

WHITE, Circuit Judge.   \nDefendants-Appellants Stephen Busch, Patrick Cook, Michael Prysby, Liane Shekter \nSmith,  Bradley  Wurfel  and  Daniel  Wyant,  employees  of  the  Michigan  Department  of \nEnvironmental Quality, (“MDEQ Defendants”) appeal the district court’s order remanding this \ncase to the Michigan Court of Claims on the basis that it was improperly removed.  Finding this \ncourt’s  prior  decision  in  Mays  v.  City  of  Flint,  Michigan,  871  F.3d  437  (6th  Cir.  2017) \ncontrolling, we AFFIRM. \nI.  Background \nThis case arises from the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.  Plaintiff Nappier and minor \nT.N. (“Plaintiff”) are residents of Flint.  Seeking to represent a class  \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 84 filed 04/16/18   PageID.7450   Page 4 of 8 (4 of 8)\nNo. 17-1401, Nappier v. Snyder \n \nof all individuals who, from April 25, 2014 through the date of trial, are or were \nminor children (age 17 years and younger) who are or were residing in the City of \nFlint, Michigan and who have been brain damaged as a result of the ingestion of \nlead poisoned water from pipes and service lines that supplied water from the \nFlint River without the use of any corrosion control,   \n(R. 1-3, PID 45; see also id. at PID 55-57), plaintiff filed her class-action complaint in the \nMichigan Court of Claims on March 23, 2016, alleging that Defendants breached various duties \nrelating to the Flint water supply. \nThere are numerous defendants, including various state officials, department heads and \nprogram heads, emergency managers, and the appellant MDEQ employees.  On May 31, MDEQ \nDefendant  Busch  removed  the  case  to  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Western  District  of \nMichigan, asserting federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the federal-officer removal statute, \n28 U.S.C. § 1442, and federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441.  On June 14, 2016, \nseveral other defendants (State Defendants) filed a motion to remand, advancing arguments that \nare no longer relevant.  During the remainder of 2016, various defendants filed a variety of \nmotions, including motions to dismiss and a motion to change venue.   \nAfter the district court scheduled oral argument on State Defendants’ motion to remand, \nit was provided with supplemental authority calling its attention to the decision of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Mays v. City of Flint, No. 5:16-cv-11519-\nJCO-MKM (E.D. Mich. Oct. 6, 2016).  The Plaintiffs in Mays, purporting to represent “a class of \nthousands  of  Flint  water  users,”  sued  numerous  defendants,  including  MDEQ  defendants, \nalleging “gross negligence, fraud, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress.”  (R. 60-1 at PID 6737.)  The MDEQ defendants removed the case to federal court, \ninvoking the same bases for federal jurisdiction as invoked here.  The district court found that \nremoval was improper because the MDEQ defendants had not shown that they were acting under \nfederal officers or were being sued for acts performed under color of federal office, and because \n-2- \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 84 filed 04/16/18   PageID.7451   Page 5 of 8 (5 of 8)\nNo. 17-1401, Nappier v. Snyder \n \nthe plaintiffs’ claims did not raise a federal question.  The supplemental authority also included \nthis court’s order denying the Mays MDEQ defendants’ motion for a stay of the district court’s \nremand order pending appeal, for failure to show “a strong likelihood of success on the merits.”  \n(R. 60-2.)   \nThe district court issued a memorandum and order canceling the scheduled oral argument \nand ordering further briefing on why the court should not remand the case to state court for lack \nof subject-matter jurisdiction in light of Mays.  After reviewing the supplemental briefs, the \ndistrict court issued its opinion finding that removal was improper and remanding the case to \nstate court.  Citing Mays, the district court found that MDEQ Defendants did not qualify for \nfederal-officer removal because of their “independent role as enforcer of Michigan law and the \n[Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)].”  (R. 75 at PID 7399.)  The district court also cited Mays in \nsupport  of  its  conclusion  that  Plaintiff’s  state-law  negligence  claim  did  not  raise  a  federal \nquestion. \nDuring the pendency of this appeal, a divided panel of this court affirmed the district \ncourt’s remand order in Mays, and this court denied rehearing en banc.1   \nII.  Discussion \n“We  review  de  novo  the  district  court’s  determination  that  it  lacked  subject-matter \njurisdiction and its consequent decision to issue a remand order.”  Mays, 871 F.3d at 442 (citing \nSmith v. Nationwide Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 505 F.3d 401, 404 (6th Cir. 2007)).  \n                                                 \n1 On October 10, 2017, the MDEQ appellants in Mays filed a petition for rehearing en banc.  \nThat petition was subsequently denied and, on February 13, 2018, the MDEQ appellants filed a \npetition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.   \n-3- \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 84 filed 04/16/18   PageID.7452   Page 6 of 8 (6 of 8)\nNo. 17-1401, Nappier v. Snyder \n \nA.  Federal-Officer Removal \nThe federal-officer removal statute provides that the following may remove a civil action \nto federal district court:   \nThe United States or any agency thereof or any officer (or any person acting \nunder that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, in an official or \nindividual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such office or on \naccount of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for the \napprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue. \n28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1) (emphasis added).  When the removing party is not a federal officer, we \napply a three-part test to determine whether removal is proper.  The removing party must \ndemonstrate that: (1) it is a “person” within the meaning of the statute who “acted under a federal \nofficer”; (2) “it performed the actions for which it is being sued under color of federal office”; \nand (3) “it raised a colorable federal defense.”  Bennett v. MIS Corp., 607 F.3d 1076, 1085 (6th \nCir. 2010) (alterations, quotations, and citations omitted).  The Supreme Court has defined \n“acting under”: \nIn this context, the word “under” must refer to what has been described as a \nrelationship that involves “acting in a certain capacity, considered in relation to \none holding a superior position or office.”  That relationship typically involves \n“subjection, guidance, or control.”  In addition, precedent and statutory purpose \nmake clear that the private person’s “acting under” must involve an effort to \nassist, or to help carry out, the duties or tasks of the federal superior.    \nWatson v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., 551 U.S. 142, 151–52 (2007) (citations omitted). \nMDEQ Defendants argue that (1) the district court erroneously resolved doubts about the \npropriety of removal in favor of remand rather than in favor of broad federal-officer removal; \n(2) although  they  were  implementing  Michigan’s  SDWA,  they  were  “acting  under”  federal \nofficers at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) because (a) they were \nperforming tasks that the USEPA otherwise would have been required to undertake, (b) the \nUSEPA  retained  authority  to  control  MDEQ’s  actions  and  MDEQ  was  subject  to  USEPA \n-4- \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 84 filed 04/16/18   PageID.7453   Page 7 of 8 (7 of 8)\nNo. 17-1401, Nappier v. Snyder \n \nsupervision, and (c) the USEPA provided federal funding for MDEQ to administer and enforce \nthe  federal  SDWA;  (3)  Michigan’s  SDWA  and  its  decision  to  take  primary  enforcement \nauthority  for  the  federal  SDWA,  and  the  duties  that  Plaintiff  alleges  MDEQ  Defendants \nbreached, only came about because of the federal SDWA; (4) the district court erred when it \nfound that the USEPA was merely assisting MDEQ to perform its duties, and the reverse is true; \n(5) plaintiffs satisfied the “causal nexus” requirement for federal officer removal; and (6) the \nSDWA preempts state tort claims and they are therefore entitled to immunity.   \nIn Mays, this court held that the relationship between the MDEQ and the USEPA “is a \nmodel of cooperative federalism, not an agency relationship,” 871 F.3d at 447, and “MDEQ \nDefendants  were  not  ‘acting  under’  the  EPA  and  thus  are  not  eligible  for  federal-officer \nremoval,” id. at 449.  The MDEQ Defendants do not argue that Mays is not controlling, and it is \nclear that a ruling in the MDEQ Defendants’ favor would be contrary to Mays.  “It is firmly \nestablished that one panel of this court cannot overturn a decision of another panel; only the \ncourt sitting en banc can overturn such a decision.”  United States v. Lanier, 201 F.3d 842, 846 \n(6th Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Smith, 73 F.3d 1414, 1418 (6th Cir. 1996)).  Because \nMays  is  legally  indistinguishable,  we  affirm  the  district  court’s  ruling  that  federal-officer \nremoval was improper. \nB.  Federal-Question Jurisdiction \nMDEQ Defendants also argue that they established federal-question jurisdiction.  A case \nmay be removed to federal district court if the court would have had original jurisdiction.  \n28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).  “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions \narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  Id. § 1331.  In this case, \nplaintiff did not allege any federal claims on the face of her complaint.  “[F]ederal jurisdiction \nover a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, \n-5- \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 84 filed 04/16/18   PageID.7454   Page 8 of 8 (8 of 8)\nNo. 17-1401, Nappier v. Snyder \n \n(3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state \nbalance approved by Congress.”  Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013) (discussing Grable \n&  Sons  Metal  Prod.,  Inc.  v.  Darue  Eng’g  &  Mfg.,  545  U.S.  308,  313-14  (2005)).    “The \nsubstantiality inquiry under Grable looks . . . to the importance of the issue to the federal system \nas a whole.”  Id. at 260.  “[T]he presence of a claimed violation of a federal statute as an element \nof a state cause of action is insufficiently ‘substantial’ to confer federal-question jurisdiction.” \nMays,  871  F.3d  at  449  (internal  alterations  omitted)  (quoting  Merrell  Dow  Pharm.  Inc.  v. \nThompson, 478 U.S. 804, 814 (1986)). \nMDEQ Defendants argue that the district court erred by finding that Plaintiff’s “‘garden-\nvariety’ state-law tort claim . . . does not raise a federal question at the level of importance” \nrequired by Grable, (R. 75, PID 7403), because violations of the SDWA and the Lead Copper \nRule will underpin state tort claims in jurisdictions across the country.  They also assert that \nfederal jurisdiction would not upset the balance of federal and state responsibilities.  \nBut Mays resolved this issue as well, finding that the plaintiffs’ claims did not raise a \nsubstantial  federal  question.    871  F.3d  at  449–50.    Again,  because  Mays  is  legally \nindistinguishable on this issue, we affirm the district court’s determination that § 1441 removal \nwas improper.2  \nIII.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, we AFFIRM. \n                                                 \n2 Appellee State Defendants additionally argue that removal was improper under § 1441 \nfor lack of unanimity.  “[T]here is a rule of unanimity that has been derived from the statutory \nlanguage prescribing the procedure for removing a state action to federal court, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1446.”  Loftis v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 342 F.3d 509, 516 (6th Cir. 2003).  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1446(b)(2)(A) (“When a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all defendants \nwho have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.”).  \nMDEQ Defendants do not dispute that Appellee State Defendants did not consent to removal.  \nThus, § 1441 removal was additionally improper for lack of unanimity. \n-6- \n ",

In support of this Notice of Removal, \nthe Removing Defendant states as follows: \nBACKGROUND \n1.  On  March  23,  2016,  Plaintiffs  filed  this  class  action  against  the  Removing \nDefendant,  and  Patrick  Cook  (“Cook”),  Michael  Prysby  (“Prysby”),  Liane  Shekter  Smith \n(“Shekter  Smith”),  Bradley  Wurfel  (“Wurfel”)  and  Daniel  Wyant  (“Wyant”)  (collectively \n“MDEQ Employee Defendants”), among others, in the Michigan Court of Claims.  Plaintiffs \nhave sued the Removing Defendant and MDEQ Employee Defendants in both their official and \nindividual capacities.  A copy of the Summons to Stephen Busch is attached as Exhibit A and \nComplaint is attached as Exhibit B.   \n2.  Removing Defendant is a current employee of MDEQ on an unpaid leave of \nabsence.    The  MDEQ  Employee  Defendants  are  also  current  or  former  employees  of  the \n1808909_7548.113 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.2   Page 2 of 15\nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”).  All are being sued for alleged \nactions and omissions that occurred during the course and scope of their employment. Defendant \nCook was a Water Treatment Specialist assigned to the MDEQ’s Lansing Community Drinking \nWater Unit. Defendant Prysby was the District 11 Engineer for the MDEQ's Office of Drinking \nWater  and  Municipal  Assistance  (“ODWMA”).    Removing  Defendant  was  the  MDEQ’s \nODWMA  Lansing  District  Supervisor.    Defendant  Shekter-Smith  was  Chief  of  MDEQ’s \nODWMA.  Defendant Wurfel was the MDEQ’s Director of Communications, and Defendant \nWyant was the MDEQ Director.  \n3.  Removing Defendant accepted Service of Process on April 29, 2016, Exhibit C.  \nThis Notice of Removal is filed within thirty (30) days of service upon the Removing Defendant.  \nDue to the running of the thirty (30) day period during the course of the Memorial Day holiday, \nthis Notice of Removal is timely under 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b). \n4.  Only  Count  I  of  the  Complaint  applies  to  the  Removing  Defendant  and  the \nMDEQ Employee Defendants.  Count I alleges that the Removing Defendant and the MDEQ \nEmployee Defendants, during the course and scope of their employment with the MDEQ, were \npurportedly negligent and/or grossly negligent in their alleged decision-making and oversight of \nthe City of Flint’s monitoring, testing, and treatment of Flint’s drinking water under the federal \nSafe  Drinking  Water  Act  (“SDWA”),  42  U.S.C.  300f  et  seq.,  and  the  United  States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA’s”) Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”), 40 C.F.R. Part \n141 Subpart I. Exhibit B, ¶¶ 75-77. \n5.  Plaintiffs have not demanded a jury in this class action. \n6.  As more fully described below, Plaintiffs’ claims are removable to this Court by \nRemoving Defendant (joined in and consented to by the former or current MDEQ employee \n2 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.3   Page 3 of 15\nDefendants) under the federal officer removal statute (28 U.S.C. § 1442), and alternatively under \nthe substantial federal question doctrine (28 U.S.C. § 1441). \n7.  In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d), a notice of filing this Notice of Removal \nand Consent to Removal and a copy of this Notice of Removal are being filed with the Michigan \nCourt of Claims. A copy of both notices will be served upon Plaintiffs. \n8.  Copies of all process, pleadings, and orders received by Removing Defendant \nother than the Complaint are attached, Exhibit D.  The Complaint is attached as Exhibit B. \n9.  By removing this action, Removing Defendant and the joining MDEQ Employee \nDefendants do not waive any defenses, objections, or motions available under state or federal \nlaw.  \nREMOVAL UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1442 \n10.  The federal officer removal statute permits a defendant to remove a state-court \naction brought against “any [federal] agency or any [federal] officer (or any person acting under \nthat officer) . . . for or relating to any act under color of such office . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 1442. \n11.  “The federal officer removal statute is not ‘narrow’ or ‘limited.’  At the very least, \nit is broad enough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising \nout of their duty to enforce federal law.”  Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U.S. 402, 406-07 (1969). \n12.  A defendant who is not a federal officer or federal agency must satisfy three \nelements to remove under the federal officer statute: (1) the defendant is a person acting under a \nfederal officer or agency; (2) the defendant performed the actions for which the defendant is \nbeing sued under the direction of a federal officer or agency; and (3) the defendant has raised a \ncolorable federal defense. See, e.g., Bennett v. MIS Corp., 607 F.3d 1076, 1085 (6th Cir. 2010) \n(citation omitted); Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 138-39 (1989). \n3 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.4   Page 4 of 15\n13.  In this case, the Removing Defendant satisfies all three elements of the federal \nofficer removal statute. \nI.  The Removing Defendant is a Person Acting Under Federal Officers and \nAgencies. \n \n14.  The Removing Defendant is a “person,” 1 U.S.C. § 1, whose authority to regulate \nMichigan’s public drinking water systems is derived from the SDWA, LCR, and other EPA \nregulations, and whose actual regulation of Michigan’s public drinking water systems occurred \nunder the EPA’s direction, control, and close supervision. \n15.  As more thoroughly explained in Section II below, EPA has delegated authority \nto MDEQ’s ODWQMA to act on its behalf and regulate public drinking water systems in the \nState of Michigan.  Removing Defendant’s alleged actions occurred while fulfilling these duties.  \nRemoving Defendant was standing in the shoes of EPA and taking actions which EPA would \notherwise have been required to take, and his alleged actions were taken pursuant to EPA’s \noversight and guidance. \nII.  The  Removing  Defendant’s  Actions  For  Which  He  Is  Being  Sued  Were \nPerformed Under the Direction of a Federal Officer or Agency. \n \n16.  The  SDWA  directs  the  EPA  to  promulgate  national  primary  drinking  water \nstandards and to regulate public water systems. See 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq.  \n17.  Specifically, with respect to the regulation of lead and copper, the EPA, in 1991, \npromulgated national primary drinking water regulations (“NPDWRs”) for controlling lead and \ncopper in public drinking water. 56 Fed. Reg. 26460 (June 7, 1991). These regulations are known \nas the “Lead and Copper Rule” or “LCR” and are found at 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80, et seq. The EPA \nhas since amended the LCR several times, most notably in 2000 and 2007. See, e.g., 65 Fed. \nReg. 1950 (Jan. 12, 2000); 72 Fed. Reg. 57782 (Oct. 10, 2007).  \n4 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.5   Page 5 of 15\n18.  The EPA’s LCR applies to public water systems such as the City of Flint. See 40 \nC.F.R. § 141.80(a). Generally speaking, it requires those water systems to monitor the levels of \nlead and copper at consumers’ taps and, under a number of different circumstances, requires \nthose systems to employ various treatment techniques such as corrosion control treatment, source \nwater treatment, lead service line replacement, and public education. 40 C.F.R. §§ 141.80(b) – \n(h).1 \n19.  The SDWA authorizes the EPA to delegate primary enforcement responsibility \nfor public drinking water systems to states where the EPA determines, inter alia, that the state: \n(1) has adopted drinking water regulations that are no less stringent than the national primary \ndrinking  water  regulations  promulgated  by  the  EPA;  (2)  has  adopted  and  is  implementing \nadequate procedures for the enforcement of such State regulations, including conducting such \nmonitoring and making such inspection as required by the EPA; and (3) will keep such records \nand make such reports with respect to its activities as required by the EPA. See 42 U.S.C. § \n300g-2; see also 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.10, 142.11.2 \n20.  The  SDWA,  however,  reserves  tremendous  oversight  authority  to  the  EPA, \nincluding mandatory EPA intervention in the form of notifications, advice, technical assistance, \nand, failing timely and sufficient state action, enforceable orders and inspections to bring water \nsystems into compliance with federal standards. See 42 U.S.C. § 300g-3; see also 40 C.F.R. §§ \n141.82(i), 141.83(b)(7), 142.19, 142.30, and 142.34. \n                                                 \n1 Numerous scholars and practitioners have characterized the LCR as complex and recognized \nthat many of its provisions are confusing and ambiguous. Most recently, the EPA and its Office \nof General Counsel determined, after several months of review, that “. . . there are differing \npossible interpretations of the LCR with respect to how the rule’s optimal corrosion control \ntreatment procedures [applied] which may have led to some uncertainty with respect to the Flint \nwater system.” Exhibit E. \n2  EPA  first  granted  the  Michigan  Department  of  Public  Health  primary  enforcement \nresponsibility over the regulation of Michigan’s public drinking water systems in 1977. 42 Fed. \nReg. 44835 (Sept. 7, 1977). \n5 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.6   Page 6 of 15\n21.  By  way  of  example,  each  state  with  primary  enforcement  responsibility  is \nrequired to submit to EPA detailed quarterly and annual reports regarding the regulation of \npublic  drinking  water  systems  including  detailed  information  regarding  each  system’s \ncompliance with the treatment techniques for lead and copper. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.15, 142.19. \nAll of these reports are publicly available and the EPA is required to, at least annually, review \neach state’s submittals for compliance with EPA requirements. 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.17(a)(1).  \n22.  If the EPA determines that a state no longer meets its requirements, the EPA is \nrequired to initiate proceedings to withdraw primacy approval. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.17(a)(2). If \nthe EPA believes a state has abused its discretion in making corrosion control or source water \ntreatment determinations in a substantial number of cases or in cases affecting a substantial \npopulation, the EPA may issue an order establishing federal treatment requirements for a public \nwater system. See 40 C.F.R. § 142.19(a) (emphasis added). \n23.  By  way  of  further  example  whenever  a  state  revises  its  approved  primacy \nprogram in response to new or revised federal regulations, including those regulations which \nrelate to lead and copper, the state must submit a request to the Administrator for approval of the \nprogram revision. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.12(a)(1), 142.16(d). And, before approving the revisions, \nthe EPA must publish notice and provide an opportunity for a public hearing. See 40 C.F.R. §§ \n142.13. \n24.  By way of even further example, whenever the EPA finds that a public water \nsystem is not in compliance with any primary drinking water regulation, the EPA “shall provide \nadvice and technical assistance to such State and public water system as may be appropriate to \nbring the system into compliance by the earliest feasible time.” 40 C.F.R. §§ 142.30.  \n25.  Recognizing the complexity and ambiguity of the LCR, the EPA’s commentary to \nits 2007 amendments to the LCR states that the EPA will provide guidance to help systems \n6 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.7   Page 7 of 15\nidentify source water changes that could impact optimal corrosion control. 72 Fed. Reg. 57782, \n57789 (Oct. 10, 2007). The EPA has responded to this mandate by issuing at least eleven major \nguidance documents, directing all aspects of a state’s implementation of the LCR: \n  Lead and Copper Rule Guidance Manual: Volume I:  Monitoring (Sept. 1991); \n  Lead and Copper Rule Guidance Manual:  Volume II:  Corrosion Control \nTreatment (EPA 811-B-92-002) (Sept. 1992); \n  Guidance Manual for Selecting Lead and Copper Control Strategies (Jan. 1997); \n  How to Determine Compliance with Optimal Water Quality Parameters as Revised \nby the Lead and Copper Minor Revisions (EPA 815-R-99-019) (Feb. 2001); \n  Lead and Copper Monitoring and Reporting Guidance for Public Water Systems, \nEPA-816-R-02-009 (Feb. 2002); \n  Lead in Drinking Water Regulation:  Public Education Guidance for Community \nWater Systems, EPA 816-R-02-010 (June 2002);  \n  Revised Guidance Manual for Selecting Lead and Copper Control Strategies \n(March 2003);    \n  Lead and Copper Rule:  2007 Short-Term Regulatory Revisions and Clarifications; \nState Implementation Guidance, EPA 816-R-08-009 (June 2008);   \n  Implementing the Lead Public Education Provision of the Lead and Copper Rule:  \nA Guide for Community Water Systems  (June 2008);  \n  Lead and Copper Rule:  Monitoring and Reporting Guidance for Public Water \nSystems, EPA 816-R-10-004 (March 2010); and \n  Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment Evaluation Technical Recommendations for \nPrimacy Agencies and Public Water Systems (March 2016). \n26.  EPA’s direction and control over the MDEQ’s implementation of the SDWA and \nLCR is further demonstrated by the EPA’s January 21, 2016 emergency order, whereby the EPA \nbegan monitoring and testing the Flint water system and ordered the MDEQ to take specific \nactions related to Flint. Exhibit F. \n27.  The Removing Defendant and the MDEQ Employee Defendants are being sued \nfor allegedly failing to adhere to federal law, due to their alleged lack of compliance with the \nSDWA  and  LCR’s  detailed  monitoring,  testing,  sampling,  and  notification  requirements  in \n7 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.8   Page 8 of 15\noverseeing the Flint water system, as administered by the Removing Defendant and the MDEQ \nEmployee Defendants under the EPA’s direction and control. \n28.  The court in Clio Convalescent Center v. Mich. Dept. of Consumer and Industry \nServices, 66 F. Supp. 2d 875, (E.D. Mich. 1999) (O’Meara, J.), held that a Michigan agency was \nentitled to federal officer removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1442, where the state agency was sued for \n“implementing federal regulations pursuant to its obligation under statutes, regulations, and/or \ncontract, [and] was acting as [the federal agency’s] agent.” Id. at 877. \n29.  Similar to the state agency in Clio, the Removing Defendant is entitled to federal \nofficer removal because the MDEQ functions as an agent of the EPA to implement the SDWA \nand LCR. The MDEQ has entered into an agreement with and been delegated authority by EPA \nto assure compliance with the SDWA and LCR, has the authority to investigate whether federal \nlaw has been violated by a public water system, and is obligated to forward monitoring results, \nconsumer confidence reports, and SDWA and LCR violations to the EPA. Id. at 876; see also \nCity of St. Louis v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 708 F. Supp. 2d 632, 661-662 (E.D. Mich. 2010) \n(holding that federal officer removal was proper where defendant acted under EPA direction and \ncontrol and assisted the EPA in performing tasks the EPA would otherwise be obligated to \nperform). \n30.  The Removing Defendant is, therefore, properly characterized as the EPA’s agent, \nacting under the EPA’s direction and control to assist with implementing and enforcing the \nfederal SDWA and LCR. Furthermore, the Removing Defendant’s alleged actions and inactions \nin this case were not only taken pursuant to EPA’s LCR, guidance documents, training manuals, \nquarterly and annual reviews, but they were also guided by repeated written and verbal dialogue \nand interaction with a number of EPA officers who advised and oversaw the MDEQ’s regulation \nof the City of Flint water system.   \n8 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.9   Page 9 of 15\n  III.  Removing Defendant Has Raised a Colorable Federal Defense. \n \n31.  The Removing Defendant has colorable federal defenses including:  preemption \nof Plaintiffs’ claims by the SDWA (Matoon v. Pittsfield, 980 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1992)); qualified \nimmunity (Phillips v. Roane County, 534 F.3d 531, 538 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that government \nofficials sued in their individual capacity can be shielded from liability by qualified immunity); \nderivative discretionary function immunity (Adkisson v. Jacobs Eng’g Grp., Inc., 790 F.3d 641, \n648-49  (6th Cir. 2015); and a demonstration that he satisfied his delegated obligations to enforce \nthe federal SDWA (Magnin v. Teledyne Continental Motors,  91 F.3d 1424, 1429 (11th Cir. \n1996) (“The scope of our inquiry here is only whether Smith has advanced a colorable federal \ndefense (including an assertion that he  complied with all his federal law obligations), not \nwhether his defense will be successful.”) (citing Mesa v. California, 489 U.S. 121, 133 (1989)). \n32.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a), because this case is \npending in the Michigan Court of Claims District 3 (Grand Rapids), which is located in the \nWestern District of Michigan, Southern Division. \n33.  For all these reasons, removal is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1442. \nREMOVAL UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1441 \n34.  A federal court must generally determine if a claim arises under federal law based \non the well-pleaded complaint, but substantial federal question jurisdiction is an exception to the \nwell-pleaded complaint rule. Mikulski v. Centerior Energy Corp., 501 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir. \n2007). The substantial federal question doctrine provides that “a state law cause of action may \nactually arise under federal law, even though Congress has not created a private right of action, if \nthe vindication of the right under state law depends on the validity, construction, or effect of \nfederal law.” Id. at 565 (internal citations omitted). \n9 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.10   Page 10 of 15\n35.  Under the substantial federal question doctrine, federal jurisdiction exists when a \n“state-law claim necessarily raises a federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a \nfederal forum may entertain without disturbing a congressionally approved balance of federal \nand state judicial responsibilities.” Grable v. Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering \nand Manufacturing, 545 U.S. 308, 314 (2005). \n36.  At  the  heart  of  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  are  allegations  that  the  drinking  water \nprovided to  Flint  residents  was not  safe and did  not  meet  federal  water quality standards, \nspecifically  standards  related  to  lead.  These  and  other  Defendants  were  allegedly  grossly \nnegligent or negligent by failing to require, ensure, implement, and advise the public regarding \ncompliance with federal water quality standards and corrosion control requirements. \n37.  The SDWA governs drinking water quality and provides detailed regulations \nrelated to water quality standards, monitoring, and testing requirements. The LCR specifically \nregulates  lead  in  drinking  water  and  provides  detailed  standards,  monitoring,  and  testing \nprotocols related to lead in drinking water. For additional information on the SDWA and LCR, \nsee above ¶¶ 17-25.  \n38.  Plaintiffs’  Complaint  both  specifically3  and  implicitly4  alleges  that  these \nDefendants had duties to Plaintiffs based on the federal SDWA and LCR standards, regulations, \nmonitoring,  and  testing  requirements  that  were  purportedly  not  followed  and  give  rise  to \nPlaintiffs’ various causes of action. \n39.  Plaintiffs’ claims are inextricably intertwined with the construction, interpretation, \nand effect of the SDWA and the LCR. If the Removing Defendant and former or current MDEQ \n                                                 \n3 Exhibit B ¶¶ 12, 21, 22, 39, 40, 55, 69, 70. \n4 Exhibit B, ¶¶ 1, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 27, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 50, 54, 56, 58, 59, 61, \n68, 73, 75, 81.  \n10 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.11   Page 11 of 15\nEmployee  Defendants  establish  that  these  federal  laws  and  regulations  were  not  violated, \nPlaintiffs’ claim against these Defendants are defeated. \n40.  Plaintiffs’ gross negligence or negligence claims depend on a question of federal \nlaw, primarily whether the Removing Defendant and the other Defendants complied with the \nSDWA and LCR during their oversight of the Flint water system. There are no alternative \ntheories supporting gross negligence or negligence that do not implicate the SDWA and/or LCR, \nas the Removing Defendant is being sued for carrying out the EPA’s duty, as delegated to \nRemoving Defendant, to ensure that public water systems such as Flint comply with the SDWA \nand LCR. \n41.  This is not a garden variety state law tort action that merely references a federal \nlaw or statute. This litigation stems from a unique situation involving individual governmental \ndefendants implementing federal lead regulations, and removal of this action will not open the \ndoor to removal of a vast number of purely state law claims. \n42.  Whether these Defendants violated the SDWA and LCR is disputed. The EPA has \nadmitted  that  the  LCR  is  ambiguous  and  subject  to  different  possible  interpretations  and \nconstructions when applied to this particular situation.  As recently as November 3, 2015, the \nDirector of EPA’s Office of Drinking Water wrote a memo to the EPA’s Regional Water \nDivision Directors stating:  “After reviewing the rule with our Office of General Counsel, it \nappears that there are differing possible interpretations of the LCR with respect to how the rule’s \noptimal corrosion control treatment procedures apply to this situation, which may have led to \nsome uncertainty with respect to the Flint water system.” Exhibit E. \n43.  There is a substantial need for uniform interpretation of the SDWA and LCR as it \napplies to Flint, and the other 155,000 public water systems subject to the SDWA and LCR, that \nprovide water to almost all Americans across the United States. \n11 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.12   Page 12 of 15\n44.  As the Court pointed out in Harding-Wright v. D.C. Water and Sewer Auth., 350 \nF. Supp. 2d 102, 107 (D.D.C. 2005), “federal jurisdiction over a state law claim is appropriate \nwhen necessary to protect against inconsistent interpretation of a federal statutory regime.” There \nis a substantial federal interest in resolving the disputed interpretations and effect of the SDWA \nand LCR to ensure accurate, consistent application of the federal statutes and regulations across \nthe nation and across the various lawsuits relating to Flint's drinking water. \n45.  This  Court’s  exercise  of  jurisdiction  over  this  case  will  not  disturb  a \ncongressionally-approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities. Congress has \nplaced the regulation of drinking water within the federal realm through promulgation of the \nSDWA, and via the EPA’s federal oversight, direction, and authority over the SDWA regulatory \nscheme. \n46.  To the extent some of Plaintiffs’ claims do not involve a substantial federal \nquestion, this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367(a). \n47.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, because this case is \npending in the Michigan Court of Claims District 3 (Grand Rapids) which is located in the \nWestern District of Michigan, Southern Division.  \n48.  A copy of the Notice of Filing of the Notice of Removal is attached hereto as \nExhibit G. \nWHEREFORE,  Removing  Defendant,  Stephen  Busch,  respectfully  requests  that  this \naction proceed in this Court as an action properly removed. \n \n \n \n12 \n1808909 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1 filed 05/31/16   PageID.13   Page 13 of 15\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n   \nKOTZ SANGSTER WYSOCKI, P.C.  \nAttorneys for Stephen Busch \n \nBy: /s/ Philip A.

Additionally, since this Notice of Removal is not \nbased solely on 28 U.S.C. § 1441, consent of all other properly joined and served defendants is \nnot required.

The following Defendants have consented and join in the Removal:   Daniel Wyant, \nLiane Shekter Smith, Patrick Cook, Michael Prysby, and Bradley Wurfel.   \nTherefore,  removal  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1441  is  permitted  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § \n1446(b)(2)(b), because all MDEQ Employee Defendants implicated in Count I that have been \nserved  in  this  lawsuit  consent  and  join  in  Removing  Defendant’s    Notice  of  Removal,  as \nindicated by their signatures below.  \n  WHEREFORE, the below designated Defendants respectfully request that this Court \nexercise jurisdiction over this action and grant such other relief as this Court deems proper. \n \n  Respectfully Submitted,   \n   \nBy: /s/ Philip A.

GORDON J. QUIST\nRICHARD SNYDER, et al.,\nDefendants.\n                                                          /\nOPINION REGARDING JURISDICTION\nPlaintiff filed this putative class action case in the Michigan Court of Claims on March 23,\n2016,  against Richard Snyder, Nick Lyon, Eden Wells, Nancy Peeler, and Robert Scott (collectively\nthe State Defendants); Stephen Busch, Patrick Cook, Michael Prysby, Liane Shekter Smith, and\nBradley Wurfel (collectively the MDEQ Defendants); and Darnell Early and Gerald Ambrose. \nPlaintiff alleged a single substantive count of gross negligence and/or negligence against all\nDefendants arising out of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.\nOn May 31, 2016, Defendant Busch removed the case to this Court, alleging that removal\nwas proper under the federal-officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), and, alternatively,\nunder the substantial federal question doctrine arising from 28 U.S.C. § 1441.  On February 17,\n2017, the Court entered an order cancelling oral argument on Defendants’ motions to dismiss and\ndirecting the parties to address the Court’s concerns regarding subject matter jurisdiction.  Pursuant\nto the February 17, 2017, Order, the MDEQ Defendants, Plaintiff, and the State Defendants have\nfiled responses.  Having read the parties’ responses, the Court concludes that the MDEQ Defendants\n\nwere not “acting under” any federal officer or agency when they took the actions set forth in the\ncomplaint, and thus were not entitled to remove this case under the federal-officer removal statute. \nIn addition, the Court concludes that it does not have jurisdiction under the substantial federal\nquestion doctrine.1  Accordingly, the Court will remand this case to the Michigan Court of Claims.\nI.  BACKGROUND2\nIn 2014, as a cost-saving measure, the City of Flint switched its water source from the City\nof Detroit water system to the Flint River.  (ECF No. 1-3 at PageID.43.)  In connection with the\nswitch, officials discontinued corrosion-control treatments required by the Environmental Protection\nAgency’s (EPA) Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) and added ferric chloride, which increased the\ncorrosivity of the Flint River water, to reduce formation of trihalomethanes from organic matter. \n(Id.)\nPlaintiff, the mother and next friend of T.K., a minor, alleges that Defendants knew that the\nwater pumped from the Flint River was toxic and not fit for consumption, but nonetheless assured\nthe public that it was safe to drink.  (Id.)  Plaintiff further alleges that, in spite of Defendants’\nassurances, T.K. experienced an elevated blood lead level and suffered permanent brain damage as\na result of drinking water from the Flint River.  (Id. at PageID.45.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants\nwere grossly negligent and/or negligent in participating in, or facilitating, the switch to Flint River\nwater as the source of the City of Flint’s water.  Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all individuals\nwho were minors, resided in the City of Flint, and suffered brain damage as a result of ingesting\nwater supplied from the Flint River.  (Id. at PageID.41.) \n1Although the MDEQ Employee Defendants request oral argument, the Court concludes that oral argument will\nnot assist the Court in deciding the issue, which has been fully briefed by the MDEQ Employee Defendants.\n2The following facts are taken from the complaint.\n2\n\nThe MDEQ Defendants are current and former employees of the MDEQ who played a part\nin the City of Flint’s change of water sources.  \nDefendant Shekter Smith was, until October 19, 2015, the Chief of the Office of Drinking\nWater and Municipal Assistance for the MDEQ.  Plaintiff alleges that Shekter Smith “knowingly\nparticipated in, approved of, and caused the decision to transition Flint’s water source to a highly\ncorrosive, inadequately studied and treated alternative,” and made false statements that led to public\nconsumption of the contaminated water.  (Id. at PageID.47, ¶ 38.) \nDefendant Wyant was, until December 29, 2015, the Director of the MDEQ.  Plaintiff alleges\nthat Wyant “participated in, directed, and oversaw the MDEQ’s repeated violations of federal water\nquality laws, the failure to properly study and treat Flint River water, and the MDEQ’s program of\nsystemic denial, lies, and attempts to discredit honest outsiders.”  (Id., ¶ 39.)  Plaintiff alleges that\nDefendant  Wyant  also  made  false  statements  that  led  to  continued  public  consumption  of\ncontaminated water.  (Id.)\nDefendant Busch was and remains the District Supervisor assigned to the Lansing District\nOffice of the MDEQ.  Plaintiff alleges that Busch “participated in MDEQ’s repeated violation of\nfederal water quality laws, the failure to properly study and treat Flint River water, and the MDEQ’s\nprogram of systemic denial, lies, and attempts to discredit honest outsiders.”  (Id. at PageID.47–48,\n¶ 40.)\nDefendant Cook was and remains a Water Treatment Specialist assigned to the Lansing\nCommunity Drinking Water Unit of the MDEQ.  Cook is also the manager of that unit and\n“participated in[,] approved, and/or assented to the decision to allow Flint’s water to be delivered\nto residents without corrosion control or proper study and/or testing.”  (Id. at PageID.48, ¶ 41.)\n3\n\nDefendant Prysby was and remains an Engineer assigned to MDEQ District 11 (Genesee\nCounty).  Prysby “participated in, approved, and/or assented to the decision to switch to the water\nsource, failed to properly monitor and/or test the Flint River water, and provid[ed] assurances . . .\nthat the Flint River water was safe when he knew or should have known those statements to be\nuntrue.”  (Id., ¶ 42.)\nDefendant Wurfel was, until December 29, 2015, the MDEQ’s Director of Communications. \nPlaintiff alleges that Wurfel was “the MDEQ’s principal means of public deception, repeatedly\ndenying the increasingly obvious disaster as it unfolded.”  (Id. at PageID.49, ¶ 43.)\nII.  REMOVAL BURDEN\nMDEQ Defendant Busch removed the case to this Court pursuant to the federal-officer\nremoval statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), alleging that pursuant to the federal Safe Water Drinking\nAct (SDWA), 42 U.S.C. § 300f et seq. and the EPA’s LCR, the EPA has delegated authority to the\nMDEQ to act on its behalf and regulate public water drinking systems and that Defendant Busch\ntook the actions alleged by Plaintiff in the course of fulfilling his duties delegated by the EPA to the\nMDEQ.  (ECF No. 1 at PageID.4.)  Defendant Busch alleged that he “was standing in the shoes of\nthe EPA and taking actions which EPA would have otherwise been required to take, and his alleged\nactions were taken pursuant to EPA’s oversight and guidance.”  (Id.)  Defendant Busch also alleged\nthat this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 because “Plaintiffs’ [sic] claims are\ninextricably intertwined with the construction, interpretation, and effect of the SDWA and the LCR.” \n(Id. at PageID.10.)  The remaining MDEQ Defendants join in Busch’s notice of removal.\nAs the removing parties, the MDEQ Defendants have the burden of establishing this Court’s\njurisdiction.  Jerome-Duncan, Inc. v. Auto-By-Tel, LLC, 176 F.3d 904, 907 (6th Cir. 1999).  Any\n4\n\ndoubts regarding “the propriety of removal are resolved in favor of remand.”3  Smith v. Nationwide\nProp. & Cas. Ins. Co., 505 F.3d 401, 405 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Jacada, Ltd. v. Int’l Mktg.\nStrategies, Inc., 401 F.3d 701, 704 (6th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIII.  DISCUSSION\nA. Removal Under § 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1)\nThe federal-officer removal statute provides as follows:\n(a) A civil action or criminal prosecution that is commenced in a State court\nand that is against or directed to any of the following may be removed by them to the \ndistrict court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place\nwherein it is pending:\n(1) The United States or any agency thereof or any officer (or any person\nacting under that officer) of the United States or of any agency thereof, in an\nofficial or individual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such\noffice or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any act of\nCongress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection \nof the revenue.\n28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1). \nThe purpose of the statute is to protect federal officers from being subjected to legal\nproceedings in hostile state courts based on the enforcement of federal laws “by providing these\nfederal officials with an unbiased federal forum.”  Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Wigand,\n913 F. Supp. 530, 533–34 (W.D. Ky. 1996); see also N. Colo. Water Conservancy Dist. v. Bd. of\nCnty. Comm’rs of the Cnty. of Grand, 482 F. Supp. 1115, 1117 (D. Colo. 1980) (“The purpose of\n28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1) is to protect federal officers from state interference with the exercise of\n3Suggesting that the answer to the instant jurisdictional question is obvious, the MDEQ Defendants state that\n“[i]t is telling that Plaintiffs [sic] did not object to removal, given the authority that MDEQ Defendants presented.”  (ECF\nno. 72 at PageID.6815.)  But Plaintiff’s failure to object does not relieve this Court of its obligation to examine its\njurisdiction in this case.  See Kusens v. Pascal Co., 448 F.3d 349, 359 (6th Cir. 2006) (“It is well-established that the\nfederal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction.”).  Moreover, in her response,\nPlaintiff states that “she is not in a position to opine regarding the MDEQ Defendants’ factual basis for removal.”  (ECF\nNo. 73 at PageID.7387.)  Thus, the Court infers nothing from Plaintiff’s failure to object. \n5\n\nfederal authority.”).  As the Supreme Court has explained, the history of the federal-officer removal\nstatute is rooted in customs and revenue statutes that met with fierce opposition from the States. \nWillingham v. Morgan, 395 U.S. 402, 405, 89 S. Ct. 1813, 1815 (1969).  The Willingham Court\nnoted that the first such removal provision was included in an 1815 customs statute aimed at\n“enforc[ing] an embargo on trade with England over the opposition of the New Englant [sic] States,\nwhere the War of 1812 was quite unpopular.”  Id.  The removal provision prevented States from\ninterfering with enforcement of the customs statute by allowing federal officers to remove to federal\ncourt any civil or criminal proceeding against them based on “any act done ‘under colour’ of the\nstatute.”  Id.  Similar removal provisions were included in Civil War-era revenue laws, and Congress\nsubsequently extended the protection to all federal officers when it enacted the current provision in\n1948.  Id. at 405–06, 89 S. Ct. at 1815.\nIt is true, as the MDEQ Defendants note, that the Supreme Court has observed that “[t]he\nfederal officer removal statute is not ‘narrow’ or ‘limited[,]’ . . . [and] [a]t the very least, it is broad\nenough to cover all cases where federal officers can raise a colorable defense arising out of their\nduty to enforce federal law.”  Id. at 406–07, 89 S. Ct. at 1816 (citation omitted).  But, Willingham\ncited Colorado v. Symes, 286 U.S. 510, 52 S. Ct. 635 (1932), for the quoted proposition, which, the\nSixth Circuit has observed, considered a narrower removal statute that “protected only those ‘acting\nunder or by authority of’ federal officers who were themselves ‘acting by authority of any revenue\nlaw of the United States.”  Ohio State Chiropractic Ass’n v. Humana Health Plan, Inc., 647 F.\nApp’x 619, 622 (6th Cir. 2016).  The Sixth Circuit further observed in Humana that “each of the\nbroad interpretations that Humana emphasizes traces to earlier versions of § 1442 that granted the\nremoval power only to individuals enforcing federal customs and revenue laws.”  Id. (citing, among\nothers, Arizona v. Manypenny, 451 U.S. 232, 101 S. Ct. 1657 (1981), and Willingham).  Thus, the\n6\n\ncourt reasoned, “proper context” showed that the liberal construction recognized in Symes was of\nlimited use in determining whether a private health insurance contractor was entitled to remove\nunder § 1442(a)(1).  Id.4  \nRemoving parties, such as the MDEQ Defendants, who are not federal officers must satisfy\na three-part test to establish proper removal under § 1442(a)(1).  Bennett v. MIS Corp., 607 F.3d\n1076, 1085 (6th Cir. 2010).  First, the removing party must show that “it is a ‘person’ within the\nmeaning of the statute who ‘act[ed] under [a federal] officer.’” Id. (quoting § 1442(a)(1)).  Second,\nthe party “must demonstrate that it performed the actions for which it is being sued ‘under color of\n[federal] office[.]’” Id. (quoting § 1442(a)(1)).  Finally, the party must “raise[] a colorable federal\ndefense.”  Id.  (citing Jefferson Cnty. v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423, 431, 119 S. Ct. 2069 (1999)).\nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Watson v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., 551 U.S. 142,\n127 S. Ct. 2301 (2007), provides the most useful guide in determining the circumstances under\nwhich  a  non-federal  officer will  be  deemed to  satisfy  the  “acting  under” a  federal officer\nrequirement.  In Watson, the plaintiffs sued the defendants, cigarette manufacturers, alleging that\nthe defendants violated state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices by advertising\ncertain cigarette brands as “light,” when, in fact, the manufacturers manipulated testing results by\ndesigning cigarettes and using techniques that caused the cigarettes to have lower levels of tar and\nnicotine than the cigarettes actually sold to customers.  Id. at 146, 127 S. Ct. at 2304.  The\ndefendants invoked the federal-officer removal statute to remove, and both the district court and the\n4Some courts have recognized a distinction in the application of the removal statute depending on the status\nof the removing party.  Those courts note that while “federal officer jurisdiction is read expansively in suits involving\nfederal officials, it is read narrowly where . . . only the liability of a private company purportedly acting at the direction\nof a federal officer is at issue.”  Mills v. Martin & Bayley, Inc., No. 05-888-GPM, 2007 WL 2789431, at *5 (S.D. Ill.\nSept. 21, 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n7\n\nEighth Circuit concluded that removal was proper because the plaintiffs’ complaint attacked the\ndefendants’ use of the federal government’s method of testing cigarettes.  Id.  The Court held that\nremoval was improper because the federal government’s heavy regulation of the defendants’ product\ntesting did not satisfy the statute’s “acting under” requirement.  Id. at152–53, 127 S. Ct. at 2308.\nWatson emphasized several important principles that bear on whether a private person  acted\nunder a federal officer.  First, the “acting under” relationship “typically involves subjection,\nguidance, or control,” id. at 151, 127 S. Ct. at 2307, and “must involve an effort to assist, or to help\ncarry out, the duties or tasks of the federal superior.”  Id. at 152, 127 S. Ct. at 2307.  Mere\ncompliance with the law does not constitute “help or assistance necessary to bring a private person\nwithin the scope of the statute.”  Id.  Second, the fact that a company (or a State) is subject to, and\ncomplies with, a federal order does not ordinarily create the type of state-court “prejudice” at which\nthe removal statute is directed.  Id.  Finally, the fact that an entity is  “highly regulated . . . even if\nthe regulation is highly detailed and even if the [entity’s] activities are highly supervised and\nmonitored,” will not provide a basis for removal under § 1442(a)(1).  Id. at 153, 127 S. Ct. at 2308.\nThe MDEQ Defendants offer essentially three bases to support their contention that they\nwere acting at the direction, and with the authorization, of the EPA, such that they should be deemed\nto have “acted under” the EPA.  First, the MDEQ Defendants note that after Flint’s water source was\nswitched to the Flint River and water quality issues arose, the EPA directed the MDEQ’s response \nand ultimately issued an Emergency Administrative Order addressing the steps the MDEQ and the\nCity of Flint were required to take to protect the public health.  Second, the MDEQ Defendants\nargue that Plaintiff’s allegations regarding their involvement in the process of switching the source\nof  Flint’s  water  system  to  the  Flint  River  necessarily  implicate  the  MDEQ  Defendants’\nadministration, application, and enforcement of the federal LCR, demonstrating that the MDEQ\n8\n\nDefendants acted on behalf of the EPA and not simply as an instrumentality of the State.  Finally,\nthey argue that, although their administration and enforcement of the federal LCR was accomplished\nthrough the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, they acted at the direction, and on behalf of, the\nEPA, and thus are actually being sued for actions that the EPA would have taken in the absence of\nthe EPA’s formal delegation of authority to the MDEQ.\nWhile this Court believes that Mays, et al v. City of Flint, et al., No. 16-11519 (E.D. Mich.\nOct. 6, 2016), correctly concluded that the MDEQ Defendants are not entitled to remove under §\n1442(a)(1), the analysis, in this Court’s judgment, begins and ends with the State of Michigan’s (and\nby extension the MDEQ’s) independent role as enforcer of Michigan law and the SDWA.\nCongress enacted the SDWA in 1974 ‘to ensure that public water supply systems meet\nminimum national standards for the protection of public health.”  Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. EPA, 980 \nF.2d 765, 768 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  The SDWA provides that the EPA’s drinking water regulations\n“shall apply to each public water system in each State.”  42 U.S.C. § 300g.  The SDWA also\nrecognizes that the States may play an important part in administering and enforcing drinking water\nstandards.  See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 806 F. Supp. 275, 277 (D.D.C. 1992) (noting that “it\nis clear from the plain language of the Safe Drinking Water Act that the states play a critical and\nindependent  role  of  implementation”).    In  fact,  a  State  may  obtain  “primary  enforcement\nresponsibility for public water systems” if the EPA determines that the State meets certain\nrequirements.  42 U.S.C. § 300g-2.  To obtain such authority, a State must:   (1) adopt its own\n“drinking water regulations that are no less stringent than the . . . [EPA’s] regulations,”; (2) adopt\nand implement adequate procedures to enforce such regulations; and (3) keep records and make\nreports required by the EPA.  42 U.S.C. § 300g-2(a).  See also 40 C.F.R. § 142.10 (setting forth the\nrequirements for determination of primary enforcement responsibility).  Thus, while the SDWA “is\n9\n\nadministered by the EPA[,] . . . [it] establishes a joint federal-state system for assuring compliance\nwith national standards.”  Manufactured Hous. Inst. v. EPA, 467 F.3d 391, 401 (4th Cir. 2006); see\nalso United States v. Cnty. of Westchester, No. 13-cv-5475 (NSR), 2014 WL 1759798, at *4\n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 28, 2014) (stating that the SDWA “authorized the EPA to establish Federal standards\nthat would be applicable to all public water systems and to establish a joint Federal–State system\nfor assuring compliance with these standards and for protecting underground sources of drinking\nwater”); Nat. Res. Def. Council, 806 F. Supp. at 277–78 (concluding that the members of a\nGovernors’ Forum on Environmental Management were not mere advisors to the EPA because,\nunder the SDWA,  governors “act operationally as independent chief executives in partnership with\nthe federal agency,” and a contrary conclusion “would ignore the responsibilities the states maintain\nin complying with the [SDWA]”). \nAs the MDEQ Defendants concede, the Michigan legislature passed its own Safe Drinking\nWater Act in 1976, see M.C.L.A. § 325.1001, et seq., and the MDEQ’s predecessor assumed\nprimary enforcement responsibility to administer and enforce the SDWA in 1978.  (ECF No. 72-2.) \nAnd, pursuant to Michigan’s Safe Drinking Water Act, the MDEQ has “power and control over\npublic water supplies and suppliers of water.”  M.C.L.A. § 325.1003.\nIn  light  of  the  SDWA’s  “joint  federal-state  system”  that,  as  here,  assigns  primary\nenforcement responsibility to the States, the MDEQ Defendants were not “acting under” the EPA\nat all, in the sense of assisting or helping the EPA to perform its duties or tasks.  See Watson, 551\nU.S. at 2307.  Rather, it is clear that at all times, the MDEQ Defendants were acting for and on\nbehalf of the MDEQ to fulfill its own duties under the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act.  Cf. N.\nColo. Water Conservancy Dist., 482 F. Supp. at 1118 (concluding that the removing parties were\n“not acting as federal entities or as agents of the [EPA]” pursuant to the Clean Water Act, but\n10\n\ninstead were acting as political subdivisions of Colorado).  Such remains true notwithstanding that\nthe MDEQ Defendants consulted and interacted extensively with the EPA when water quality issues\narose after the switch to the Flint River.  After all, consultation and interaction are consistent with\nany joint undertaking.  Thus, if anything, this is not a case of the MDEQ assisting the EPA to\nperform its duties, but of EPA personnel assisting the MDEQ in performing its duties.\nThe EPA’s Emergency Administrative Order issued on January 21, 2016, does not alter the\nanalysis.  The order itself confirms that, rather than acting for the EPA, the MDEQ was “an\ninstrumentality of the State.”  (ECF No. 1-7 at PageID.93.)  Moreover, even if the order directed\nMDEQ to follow or apply the LCR or other regulations in a particular manner, Watson says that\ncompliance with federal law does not constitute the type of “help or assistance” required under §\n1442(a)(1), and compliance with a regulatory order is unlikely to “create a significant risk of state-\ncourt ‘prejudice.’” 551 U.S. at 152, 127 S. Ct. at 2307.  \nAccordingly, the MDEQ Defendants have not shown that removal is proper under §\n1442(a)(1).\nB. Removal Under 28 U.S.C. § 1441\nThe MDEQ Defendants’ also argue that removal was proper because Plaintiff’s state-law\ngross negligence/negligence claim raises a substantial federal question, namely construction and\ninterpretation of the SDWA and the LCR.  (ECF No. 1 at PageID.10.)  The substantial federal\nquestion doctrine applies “where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turn[s] on\nsome construction of federal law.”  Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S.\n1, 9, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 2846 (1983).  However, “[t]he mere presence of a federal issue in a state law\ncause of action does not automatically confer federal question jurisdiction, either originally or on\nremoval.”  Mikulski v. Centerior Energy Corp., 501 F.3d 555, 565  (6th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \n11\n\nApplication of the doctrine requires that: “(1) the state-law claim must necessarily raise a disputed\nfederal issue; (2) the federal interest in the issue must be substantial; and (3) the exercise of\njurisdiction must not disturb any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial\nresponsibilities.”  Id. (citing Grable & Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng’g & Mfg., 545 U.S.\n308, 314, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 2368 (2005)).  The Supreme Court has emphasized that the substantial\nfederal question doctrine is limited to “a ‘special and small category’ of cases.”  Gunn v. Minton,\n__ U.S. __ 133 S. Ct. 1059, 1064–65 (2013) (quoting Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v.\nMcVeigh, 547 U.S. 677, 701, 126 S. Ct. 2121, 2137 (2006)).\nIn Grable & Sons Metal Products v. Darue Engineering & Manufacturing, 545 U.S. 308,\n125 S. Ct. 2363 (2005), the plaintiff filed a quiet title action in Michigan state court, alleging that\nthe defendant’s title to certain property was invalid.  545 U.S. at 311, 125 S. Ct. at 2366.  Pursuant\nto  a Michigan court rule, the Plaintiff specifically alleged that its title was superior to the\ndefendant’s title because the Internal Revenue Service failed to give adequate notice, as required by\na federal statute.  Id. at 314–15, 125 S. Ct. at 2368.   The Court concluded that the Defendant\nproperly removed the case based on federal question jurisdiction because whether the plaintiff “was\ngiven notice within the meaning of the federal statute [was] . . . an essential element of its quiet title\nclaim, and the meaning of the federal statute [was] actually in dispute.”  Id. at 315, 125 S. Ct. at\n2368.  In fact, the Court observed, because the proper interpretation of the federal statute was “the\nonly legal or factual issue contested in the case,” its meaning was “an important issue of federal law\nthat sensibly belongs in a federal court.”  Id.\nIn contrast to Grable, the MDEQ Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff’s state-law\nnegligence-based claims implicate an important federal interest.  As the Court wrote in Gunn:\n12\n\nit is not enough that the federal issue be significant to the particular parties in the\nimmediate suit; that will always be true when the state claim necessarily raises a\ndisputed issue, as Grable separately requires.  The substantiality inquiry under\nGrable looks instead to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole.\n133 S. Ct. at 1066 (internal quotation marks and bracket omitted).  In short, the state-law claim at\nissue in this case is a “garden-variety” state-law tort claim that does not raise a federal question at\nthe level of importance of that raised in Grable.  See Mikulski, 501 F.3d at 571; see also Mays, slip\nop. at 13.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will remand this case to the Michigan Court of claims\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\nAn Order consistent with this Opinion will enter.\n  \nDated:  March 31, 2017               /s/ Gordon J.

There is No Safe Level of Lead Exposure for Children \n1.  This is a class action case filed on behalf of all individuals who, from April 25, \n2014 through the date of trial, are or were minor children (age 17 years and younger) who are or \nwere residing in the City of Flint, Michigan and who have been brain damaged as a result of the \ningestion of lead-poisoned water from pipes and service lines that supplied water from the Flint \nRiver without the use of any corrosion control (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plaintiff Class\"). \n2.  The dangers of lead exposure have been have been recognized for millennia. In \nthe first century, Dioscorides observed in his De Materia Medica that \"lead makes the mind give \nway.\" \n3.  Environmentalist  Rene  Dubos  warned  that  the  problem  of childhood  lead \npoisoning \"is so well-defined, so neatly packaged, with both causes and cures known, that if we \n2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.42   Page 4 of 20\ndon't eliminate this social crime, our society deserves all the disasters that have been forecast for \nit\" \n4.  It is now established that there is no safe level oflead for children. \n5.  Children are more vulnerable to lead than adults because of their greater fractional \nabsorption of ingested lead, because their greater lead intake on a bodyweight basis, and because \ndevelopment of a child's central nervous system is easily derailed in ways that result in cognitive \nand behavioral abnormalities. \n6.  Lead is a potent neurotoxin; childhood lead poisoning has an impact on many \n~  developmental and biological processes, most notably intelligence, behavior, and overall life \nI \nachievement. \nI>) \ni \n7.  Children can absorb 40 percent to 50 percent of an oral dose of water-soluble lead \nI>) \n· ~  compared with 3 percent to 10 percent for adults. In a dose-response relationship for children \n~ \n~  aged 1 to 5 years, for every i part-per-billion (\"ppb\") increase in water lead, blood lead increases \n.....:! \n35 percent. \n8.  The greatest risk of lead in water may be to infants on reconstituted formula. \nAmong infants  drinking formula made from tap water at  10 ppb,  about 25  percent would \nexperience a blood lead level above 56 micrograms per deciliter, which the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention has defined as an elevated level. \n9.  Tap water may account for more than 85 percent o~ total lead exposure among \ninfants consuming reconstituted formula. A lmown abortifacient, lead has also been impiicated in \nincreased fetal deaths and reduced birth weights. \n10.  With estimated societal costs in the billions, lead poisoning has a disproportionate \nimpact on low-income and minority children. \n3 \n\n-1 \nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.43   Page 5 of 20\n~._: __________ ...:.:..l __~  _________ _ \nI\" \n' \nB.  Children in Flint Have Been Exposed to Lead Due to a Change in Flint's Water \nSupply. \n11.  As a soluble metal, lead leaches into drinking water via lead-based plumbing or \nlead particles that detach from degrading plumbing components (the word \"plumbing\" is derived \nfrom the Latin word for lead, \"plumbum.\"). \n12.  In 2014, ·as a cost-saving measure, the City of Flint began taking its water from \nI \nthe Flint River rather than Lake Huron via the City of Detroit Water System. The corrosion-\ncontrol treatments required by the Environmental Protection Agency's Lead and Copper Ru1e \nwere discontinued. \n0 \np., \ni  13.  In further exacerbation of the problem, ferric chloride was added to reduce the \nformation of trihalomethanes from organic matter thereby increasing the corrosivity of the Flint \nrn \nN  I' \nt2 \ngj \nRiver water. The water reaching Takarie and the Plaintiff Class was therefore  19 times as \n~-~ \n~ \ncorrosive as it had been when the source was Lake Huron. \n0~   I \n~ \n.....  14.   The more corrosive water is, the more readily it can dissolve metals such as lead. \nI \n15.  The Defendants had knowledge that the water pumped from the Flint River was \ntoxic and not fit for use and consumption and exposed the Plaintiff Class to extreme and unsafe \nlevels of lead. \n16.  Notwithstanding the Defendants' knowledge regarding the toxicity of the water, \nDefendants advised  the Plaintiff Class to  believe that the water was  safe to drink, use for \ncooking, bathing, brushing teeth, and other personal uses. \n17.  As minor children, Takarie and the members of the Plaintiff Class did not know, \ncould not know, and had no duty to know of the toxicity of the water they were drinking. \n18.  Defendants assured the Plaintiff Class that the water supplied from the Flint River \nwas properly treated, monitored, tested, and was safe for use and consumption. \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.44   Page 6 of 20\n19.  Defendants knew and expected that the Plaintiff Class would rely upon their \nrepresentations regarding the safety of the water. \n20.  The  Plaintiff Class  took  comfort  and  reasonably  relied  upon  Defendants' \nassurances  and representations  regarding  the  alleged  safety  and fitness· of the  water  and \nconsumed and used it for all purposes. \n21.  After changing its water source to the Flint River, the lead concentration in Flint's \nwater began to rise. In six of nine city wards, the water in 20 to 32 percent of the homes had a \nlead concentration above 15 11g per liter, a concentration that triggers remedial action under the \n~  Lead and Copper Rule. \n~ \n22.  The 90th percentile was 25 11g per liter, and in some samples the concentration \niIZl  \nN \nexceeded 1000 11g per liter. \nrn \n~  23.  This contamination had consequences. Published medical .and scientific research \n~ \n~ reports that among  children in Flint, the incidence of blood lead concentrations  above the \n,...:! \nreference value of 5 11g per deciliter rose from 2.4 percent to 4.9 percent between 2013 and 2015. \nThe increase was greatest, from 4.0 percent to 10.6 percent, among children in neighborhoods \nwith the highest lead concentrations in water. \n24.  There is no safe level of lead consumption for children. \n25.  Irrespective  of blood lead concentrations,  any  amount of lead consumed by \nchildren (ages 17 and under), including the Plaintiff Class, is unsafe, toxic, and causes damage to \nbrain cells upon consumption. \n26.  Upon consumption oflead-contaminated water, children suffer concomitant brain \ndamage that is permanent and without cure. \n5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.45   Page 7 of 20\n27.  The  Plaintiff  Class  consumed  lead  contaminated  water  as  a  result  of the \nDefendants' grossly negligent and/or negligent actions as alleged herein, and its members have \nsuffered current, present, and permanent brain damage, and will continue to suffer injuries and \ndamages as a result thereof. \nJURISDICTION \n28.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to MCL 600.6419 because \nthe Defendants to the claims alleged herein are agents and officers of the State of Michigan. \n29.  The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limit of this Court. \nu....   PLAINTIFF AND THE PLAINTIFF CLASS \nI \n30.  Plaintiff is the mother and next friend of Takarie.

Shortly  after  switching  to  the  Flint  River  water supply,  Defendants  began \nreceiving concerns and complaints from residents about the color, taste and odor of the water. \n50.  By August, 2014, Flint water tested positive for E. coli. and several \"boil water\" \nadvisories were issued by the City of Flint through September, 2014. \nI' \nI \nI \n51.  These \"boil water\" instructions were relied upon and followed by Plaintiff and \nother Plaintiff Class members. \n52.  Unbeknownst to the Plaintiff Class, including Plaintiff, boiling water worsens \n() \np., \n~lead concentrations in the water thereby making it more dangerous to consume. \n~  53.  For the next several months  after the water supply change, resident protests \ni;2 \n~  regarding the water increased, but were disregarded by the Defendants in a grossly negligent \n~ \n~  and/or negligent manner despite their knowledge of the  dangers and dire consequences of \n~ \n....:~  continuing to use the water. \n54.  Defendants continued to falsely reassure the public, including Plaintiff and the  .·,i  \nil \n\"! \nPlaintiff Class members, and insisted that the water was safe despite their knowledge that the \nfoul taste, odor and appearance was highly likely the result of using the corrosive Flint River \n1:. \nwater,  untreated  with  the  proper  anti-corrosive  agents,  which  caused  particulate  lead to  ·,,r1.. ; ··.    \ncontaminate the water. \n,(. ~ \n;;? \n55.  After the Flint River became the primary source of water for the Flint users, \nDefendants were also on actual notice of that the levels of Trihalmomethanes (\"TfHM''), a \ndisinfectant byproduct that can cause liver and kidney problems, had exceeded federal limits .. \n56.  In June 24, 2015, EPA representative Miguel Del Toral wrote a detailed memo \noutlining numerous  dangerous problems with the water being pumped from the Flint River \n12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.52   Page 14 of 20\nincluding unacceptable levels of lead. This report was shared with, among others, Shekter-Smith, \nCook, Busch, and Prysby. \n57.  Nonetheless, Defendants failed to undertake any measures to effectively address \nany of the dangers identified by EPA Agent Del Toral. \n58.  By July 2015, Defendants had actual notice of high lead exposure in the Flint \nwater. \n59.  Yet, Wurfel appeared on public radio on July 10, 2015, and advised listeners that \nFlint water was safe and that it was not causing \"any broad problem\" with lead leaching into \n~  residential water. \n~ \n60.  On July 22, 2015, Snyder's Chief of Staff, Dennis Muchmore, admitted in an \nrn \nN \n~  email to MDHHS officials that \"I'm frustrated by the water issue in Flint ... I really don't think \n!il \n\"' \n~  people are getting the benefit of the doubt. Now they are concerned and rightfully so about the \n~ \n~  lead level studies they are receiving . . . These folks are scared and worried about the health \n...:1 \nimpacts and they are basically getting blown off by us (as a state we're not sympathizing with \ntheir plight.)\" \n61.  On July 24, 2015, Wurfel responded to Mr. Muchmore's concerns, saying, \"In \nterms of near-future issues, the bottom line is that residents of Flint do not need to worry about \nlead in their water supply, and DEQ's recent sampling does not indicate an imminent health \nthreat :from lead or copper.\" \n62.  By late 2014 or early 2015, the MDHHS was aware from its own data that there \nwas dramatic increase in the percentage of Flint children with elevated blood lead level readings \nfrom blood drawn during the second and third quarters of2014. \n13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.53   Page 15 of 20\n63.  The MDHHS  knew that these elevated blood lead levels  correlated with the \nintroduction of the corrosive Flint River water into the Flint water distribution system. \n64.  These conditions created a Health Emergency. The MDilliS failed to report to the \nMDEQ,  Governor's Office,  EPA,  or the Flint community that it had discovered  a  Health \nEmergency in its own data \n65.  In the summer of 2015, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha MD, (\"Dr. Hanna-Attisha\"), a \npediatrician :from Hurley Hospital in Flint, using data available to her from Hurley Hospital, \nobserved an increase in the percentage of Flint children with elevated blood lead levels from \n~  blood drawn in the second and third quarter of 2014. She published her study in an effort to alert \nI \nthe community about the health risks associated with drinking Flint River water. \ntil \n~  66.  Defendants were aware of Dr.  Hanna-Attisha's findings,  but rejected them as \n~ \n~  false and inaccurate. \n~  67.  The MDHHS re-evaluated its own data and ultimately admitted that Dr. Hanna-\n'\"\"' \nAttisha's data and conclusions were correct and that its own data confirmed Dr. Hanna-Attisha's \nconclusion. \n68.  By  early 2015,  Defendants knew that Flint residents were being exposed to \nparticulate lead on a daily basis and were on actual notice that inaccurate test results were \nI\" \nproviding false assurance to residents, including Plaintiff and the Plaintiff Class, about the true \nlead levels in the water. \n69.  On March 30, 2015, MDEQ notified the Flint Water Treatment Plant (\"FWTP\") \nof the first of two consecutive six-month lead/copper sampling results showing that the lead \naction levels were unacceptably elevated. \n14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00636-GJQ-PJG   ECF No. 1-3 filed 05/31/16   PageID.54   Page 16 of 20\n70.  These lead levels, according to the first round of the six-month sampling results, \nwere above 5 ppb and therefore exceeded acceptable and safe levels. \nI \n71.  On October I, 2015, faced with overwhelming evidence that the water waS unsafe \nI \n! \nto use and a source of lead poisoning for the children of Flint, including Plaintiff and the Plaintiff \nI \nClass members, Genesee County Health Officials issued a public health emergency advising \nFlint residents not to drink the tap water. \n72.  On October 16, 2015, Detroit City Water began to flow to Flint water users once \na gam. \nu  73.  However, based on. information and belief, due to the prolonged exposure of \nll< \n~ \ncontaminated water without adequate anti-corrosive agents, Plaintiff and Plaintiff Class members \n!Zl \nN \ni;2  were further exposed to toxic water, which exposure continues until such time that pipes and \n~ \n~  services lines that were damaged by corrosive water from the Flint River can be replaced. \n~ \n~  CoUNTI \n>-l  GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND/OR NEGLIGENCE \n74.
