The plaintiffs alleged that the President&rsquo;s September 26, 2019, Executive Order violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551 et seq.), and principles of federalism. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Order. The case was assigned to Judge Peter J. Messitte.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 13888 made an unprecedented change to the refugee resettlement process by mandating that refugees not be resettled in the United States unless the state and locality where they are to be resettled take the affirmative step of providing written consent. As national refugee resettlement agencies, the plaintiffs were then charged by the federal government with the responsibility of soliciting and obtaining written consent from all states and localities where refugees they assist could be resettled. The plaintiffs claimed that such a change would provide individual states and local governments with effective veto power over refugee resettlement.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2019. Judge Messitte granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion on January 15. 415 F.Supp.3d 669. Judge Messitte concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they faced irreparable harm, and that the Executive Order was not in the public interest. Consequently, he issued a nationwide injunction enjoining the Executive Order.</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed the injunction to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 12, 2020 (Do. 20-1160), and Judge Messitte stayed the proceedings in the district court pending resolution of that appeal on February 14, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On January 8, 2021, Circuit Judge Barbara Milano Keenan upheld the preliminary injunction. 985 F.3d 309. The court held that the plaintiffs demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on their claim that the order and notice violated the Refugee Act. The court also determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction because the refugee resettlement programs were, by their nature. located throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

For fiscal year 2020, President Trump set the maximum number of refugees at 18,000. \n \n2  The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, within the two \n  departments respectively, are responsible for administering the program. \n \n3  As relevant here, the INA defines “refugees” eligible for the resettlement program as persons who are “persecuted \n  or who [have] a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). The resettlement program does not apply to \npersons who seek asylum upon their arrival in the United States. \n \n4  The district court also held that the plaintiffs had raised “several valid concerns” under the APA. With respect to the \n  plaintiffs’ constitutional claim, the district court concluded that the consent requirement raised the possibility of \n“federal pre-emption under the Constitution.” Because we conclude that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \nstatutory claim, we do not reach these additional bases for the district court’s injunction. \n \n5  Although the Act grants authority to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, located within the \n  Department of Health and Human Services, the Act also authorizes the President to delegate administration of the \nrefugee  resettlement  program  to  another  federal  officer.  8  U.S.C.  §§  1521,  1522(b)(1)(B).  Since  1981,  the \nDepartment of State has overseen the program. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer throughout this opinion to \nthe Secretary of State, rather than to the Director. \n \n6  In amending the Act in 1986, Congress explained that the consultation requirement is “not intended to give States \n  and localities any veto power over refugee placement decisions, but rather to ensure their input into the process and \nto improve their resettlement planning capacity.” See H.R. Rep. 99-132, at 19 (emphasis added). \n \n7  This problem persists irrespective of the Notice’s statement that before seeking federal funding, local resettlement \n  agency affiliates “will have consulted with state governors’ offices, state refugee coordinators, local governments, \nand resettlement partners in their communities in order to seek the consents of state and local governments and \nensure that the placement plans and sites are reasonable and appropriate” (emphasis added). As discussed below, \nthis provision does nothing more than impose on resettlement agencies the obligation to lobby local and state \ngovernments to obtain their consent. \n \n8  To the extent the government suggests that it will continue to consult with states and localities irrespective of the \n  jurisdictions’ consent, such an assertion strains credulity. The intent of the Order is patently clear, namely, to avoid \nsettling refugees in non-consenting jurisdictions. We thus fail to see how or why the government would engage in a \ndialogue with jurisdictions where refugees will not be resettled. \n \n9  The Notice clarifies that state and local consent “may not be conditioned on acceptance of certain refugees or on \n  any other factor, such as refugees’ race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin.” \n \n10  We reject the government’s assertion that the consent requirement is supported by the requirement of Section \n  1522(a)(2)(D) that the federal government consider a state’s views “to the maximum extent possible.” By its plain \nterms, that provision applies to the placement of refugees within the state’s borders, not to whether refugees will \n  12 \n \n\n \nHias, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309 (2021)   \n \n \nbe resettled in the state at all. \n \n11  We disagree with the government’s assertion at oral argument that the consent of the states and localities is just \n  one factor the Secretary would consider when making resettlement decisions. That position is belied by the text of \nthe Order, which plainly establishes an opt-in system, and requires the Secretary to defer to a jurisdiction’s \nwithholding of consent “to the maximum extent consistent with law.” Order § 2(b). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  13 \n ",

This lawsuit challenges the President’s unprecedented attempt to condition the \nresettlement of refugees on state and local governments providing advance written consent to \nrefugee resettlement in their jurisdictions, which directly conflicts with the statutory scheme \nenacted by Congress and core principles of federalism. The President’s order and resulting \nagency actions threaten to deprive thousands of refugees of their best chance to successfully \nbuild a new life and to burden thousands of U.S. families who are waiting to reunite with their \nparents, children, and other relatives fleeing persecution. They threaten to deprive local \ncommunities that want to welcome refugees of the opportunity to do so. And they threaten to \nsystematically dismantle the organizations—including Plaintiffs—that have spent decades \ndeveloping networks, expertise, and resources to carry out the American ideal of welcoming \nrefugees. Accordingly, and in order to stop ongoing irreparable harm and to prevent greater \nirreparably injury in the future, Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief on an emergency \nbasis. \n2.  On September 26, 2019, the President issued an Executive Order entitled “Enhancing \nState and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement” (“Executive Order” or “Order”). \nExecutive Order 13888, 84 Fed. Reg. 52,355 (Sept. 26, 2019). The Order directs that the \nplacement of refugees for resettlement within the United States be preconditioned on written \nconsent from both the state and locality. The Order thus establishes a default whereby refugees \nwill not be resettled unless the state and locality take the affirmative step of providing written \nconsent—never before required—to such resettlement. In doing so, the Executive Order \ncontravenes the Refugee Act, exceeds the scope of the Administration’s statutory authority, and \nviolates constitutional federalism principles. \n1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 3 of 29\n3.  In implementing the Executive Order, the U.S. Department of State (“State Department”) \nannounced that in order to continue resettling refugees in the next fiscal year, Plaintiffs must \nsubmit a proposal by January 21, 2020, that includes written consent from states and localities \nwhere refugees could be resettled. The State Department has charged Plaintiffs with soliciting \nand obtaining such written consent. \n4.  The State Department further announced that starting on June 1, 2020, states and \nlocalities must both provide written consent for refugee resettlement to continue in their \njurisdictions.   \n5.  The Order creates but does not resolve any number of practical problems; for example, it \ndoes not define “locality” or specify the local government office or entity required to provide \nwritten consent where there are overlapping sub-state jurisdictions. Rather than resolve the many \npractical concerns raised by the Order, the agencies responsible for implementing it have ignored \nthose issues and shifted the burden for resolving them onto the Plaintiffs, by requiring them to \nobtain the written consents dictated by the Order if they wish to secure an agreement to continue \nassisting refugees in resettlement.  \n6.  Plaintiffs HIAS, Church World Service, and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service \nare three faith-based national resettlement agencies that hold agreements with the federal \ngovernment to assist refugees admitted to the United States in their resettlement. Together with \ncommunity partners and local, affiliated resettlement agencies throughout the country, Plaintiffs \nstand ready to welcome refugees as they have done for more than half a century. Plaintiffs and \nthe six other national resettlement agencies provide critical support for newly admitted refugee \nfamilies, including preparing a home with basic necessities before the family’s arrival; \norganizing donations of clothing, home supplies, and other items based on the family’s unique \n2 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 4 of 29\nneeds; and even traveling to the airport to welcome the family as they arrive in the United States. \nAfter a refugee family is initially resettled, these resettlement agencies provide continued support \ndesigned to help refugees adjust to life in America. \n7.  Plaintiffs and their affiliated organizations have been doing this work for decades.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs have nearly 300 years of combined experience resettling refugees in the United \nStates, as they were doing so well before the Refugee Act of 1980 statutorily codified their \nlongstanding role. Never in all that time has the resettlement of refugees been contingent on the \nprior written consent of government officials in the jurisdiction where the refugee is to be \nresettled. Rather, through the enactment of the Refugee Act, Congress has specified that state \nand local governments are to be consulted in decisions regarding refugee placement. The \nRefugee Act, moreover, expressly reflects Congress’s considered judgment that refugees be \nresettled with their families, that they have the resources and opportunities necessary to thrive in \ntheir new communities, and that while states and localities should be consulted about \nresettlement, they should not get to decide where or whether refugees are resettled. Neither the \nfederal statutory scheme nor the Constitution leaves room for a state or local veto over refugee \nresettlement. \n8.  As a result of the Executive Order and its implementation, Plaintiffs must either seek to \nsatisfy the prior written consent condition—causing a significant diversion of their resources and \nrisk to their nonprofit tax status with uncertain prospects of success—or lose out entirely on \nsecuring an agreement that enables Plaintiffs to carry out their missions. Faced with this \ndecision, Plaintiffs are also mindful that the lives of thousands of refugees and the families with \nwhom they hope to reunite in the United States hang in the balance. \n9.  The Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enjoin the Executive Order and its \n3 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 5 of 29\nimplementation, including Defendants’ conditioning of refugee placement on the prior written \nconsent of state and local governments.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 over Plaintiffs’ claims \nunder the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes. The Court has additional remedial authority \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. \n11. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) and Local Rule 501.4.b. Plaintiff HIAS \nresides in the Southern Division of this District. No real property is involved in this action. \nPARTIES \n12. Plaintiff HIAS, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) faith-based organization and the world’s oldest refugee \nresettlement agency. HIAS is the American Jewish community’s global refugee organization and \nis one of the nine national refugee resettlement agencies that has an agreement with the State \nDepartment to assist with the initial placement and resettlement of refugees. HIAS works \ntowards a world in which all refugees find welcome, safety, and freedom.  Founded as the \nHebrew Emigrant Aid Society in 1881 to assist Jews fleeing pogroms in Russia and Eastern \nEurope (and later renamed the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), HIAS now serves refugees and \npersecuted people of all faiths and nationalities around the globe. Since HIAS’s founding, the \norganization has helped more than 4.5 million refugees start new lives. HIAS has offices in 15 \ncountries worldwide, including its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which is its principal \nplace of business. HIAS provides resettlement services in the United States through 15 affiliates \nin 11 states.   \n13. Plaintiff Church World Service, Inc.

CWS is one of the nine national refugee \nresettlement agencies that has an agreement with the State Department to assist with the initial \nplacement and resettlement of refugees.  Since its founding in 1946 in the aftermath of the \nSecond World War, CWS has provided assistance and resettlement services to those displaced by \nviolence and discrimination. Within the United States, CWS works to build welcoming \ncommunities that support refugees on a path toward self-sufficiency, full integration, and \nsecuring a bright future for their families. To date, CWS has helped to resettle more than 860,000 \nrefugees, parolees, and other entrants across the United States. CWS has offices in 8 countries \nworldwide, including its headquarters in New York City and other domestic offices in Elkhart, \nIndiana and Washington, D.C.

The United States Constitution assigns the federal government the exclusive authority to \nestablish law and policy regarding the admission or exclusion of noncitizens, including the \nexclusive authority to regulate immigration. This authority “derives from various sources, \nincluding the Federal Government’s power ‘[t]o establish [a] uniform Rule of Naturalization,’ its \npower ‘[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,’ and its broad authority over foreign \naffairs.” Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10 (1982) (citations omitted).  \n20. Pursuant to this authority, Congress has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to \nregulate immigration—the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq.—\n6 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 8 of 29\nwhich empowers various federal agencies to enforce and administer immigration law.  \n21. Congress amended the INA in 1980 by enacting the Refugee Act, which embodies the \nU.S. commitment to humanitarian assistance for those fleeing persecution. Refugee Act of 1980 \n(“Refugee Act”), Pub. L. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980). \n22. In enacting the Refugee Act, Congress sought to “provide a permanent and systematic \nprocedure for the admission … of refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States, \nand to provide comprehensive and uniform provisions for the effective resettlement and \nabsorption of those refugees who are admitted.” Id. § 101(b).  \n23. Through the Refugee Act, Congress declared that “it is the historic policy of the United \nStates to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands,” \nincluding through resettlement of such persons to this country. Id. § 101(a).  \n24. The Refugee Act sets out detailed policies and procedures that govern the admission and \nresettlement of refugees in the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1157, et seq.  \n25. Under U.S. law, and with limited exceptions, a “refugee” is a person fleeing his or her \ncountry because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. See 8 U.S.C. § \n1101(a)(42).  \n26. Per the Refugee Act, each year the President determines, after consultation with \nCongress, the number of refugees whose resettlement in the United States in the upcoming fiscal \nyear is “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” 8 U.S.C. § \n1157(a)(2)-(3). \n27. The Refugee Act also established the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), which \nsits within the Department of Health and Human Services. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1521(a), 1522(b).  \n7 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 9 of 29\nORR is responsible for funding and administering federal cash and medical assistance programs \nfor refugees beyond the initial resettlement period. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1521(b), 1522(e)(1). \n28. The Refugee Act sets out detailed instructions regarding how it should be determined \nwhere admitted refugees are to be resettled within the United States.  \n29. Congress identified specific factors that federal agencies charged with making initial \nplacement decisions must consider in administering the program. These include: (1) the \nproportion of refugees to the general population in the area; (2) the availability of employment \nopportunities, affordable housing, and public and private resources; (3) the likelihood of refugees \nin the area becoming self-sufficient; (4) the likelihood of secondary migration of refugees from \nthe area; and (5) the views of the nonprofit organizations (including Plaintiffs) who provide \nresettlement services to refugees. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1522(a)(2)(C)(iii)(I)-(IV), 1522(a)(2)(A). \n30. The Refugee Act also requires federal agencies1 to consult with relevant stakeholders \nabout the refugee placement process. This includes the Resettlement Agencies and their affiliates \nas well as state and local governments. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1522(a)(2)(A), (D).  \n31. For example, the Act provides that the agencies “shall consult regularly (not less than \nquarterly) with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning \nthe sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the States and localities \nbefore their placement in those States and localities.” Id. § 1522(a)(2)(A). \n \n1 The Refugee Act permits the President to reassign the statutory authority of the Director of the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement to administer the Reception and Placement Program to another \noffice.  8 U.S.C. § 1522(b)(1)(B).  President Carter determined that the Department of State \nshould exercise that authority; ever since, the Department of State’s Bureau of Populations, \nRefugees, and Migration has administered the Reception and Placement Program.  Accordingly, \nthis Complaint refers to the State Department’s responsibility to make grants or contracts with \nResettlement Agencies “consistent with the objectives of [8 U.S.C. § 1522].” Id. \n§ 1522(b)(1)(A). \n8 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 10 of 29\n32. The Act also provides that “[w]ith respect to the location of placement of refugees within \na State”—but only within a State—“the [agencies] shall, consistent with such policies and \nstrategies and to the maximum extent possible, take into account recommendations of the State.” \nId. § 1522(a)(2)(D) (emphasis added). \n33. The legislative history of these statutory provisions confirms that this consultation \nrequirement was “not intended to give States and localities any veto power over refugee \nplacement decisions, but rather to ensure their input into the process and to improve their \nresettlement planning capacity.” H.R. Rep. No. 99-132, at 19 (1985). \n34. Congress has provided that assistance and services are to be provided to refugees \n“without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(5). \nORR’s regulations also incorporate this prohibition. See 45 C.F.R. § 400.5(g). Similarly, under \ntheir agreements with the State Department, Plaintiffs must carry out their refugee resettlement \nservices in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n35. The United States has also ratified the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, \n19 U.S.T. 6223, which bound the United States to respect Articles 2 through 34 of the 1951 \nInternational Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Under the Protocol, the United \nStates must respect a series of international obligations concerning the treatment and resettlement \nof refugees, including honoring the rights of refugees to choose their place of residence within \ntheir host country and to move freely within that country. See Art. 26 of the 1951 Convention \nRelating to the Rights of Refugees, 19 U.S.T. 6223. \nThe U.S. Refugee Admissions Program  \n36. The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is managed by the State Department with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services.  \n9 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 11 of 29\n37. The State Department, through its cooperating agencies around the world, is responsible \nfor facilitating the overall refugee application process, while the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has responsibility for determining an applicant’s eligibility for refugee status under U.S. \nlaw. \n38. Once the Department of Homeland Security conditionally approves an applicant for \nresettlement, the refugee receives a “sponsorship assurance” from one of the nine resettlement \nagencies (“Resettlement Agencies”), of which Plaintiffs are three.   \n39. The Resettlement Agencies enter into agreements with the State Department to \nparticipate in a congressionally created program that assists refugees after their resettlement. The \nagreements are called “cooperative agreements.”  \n40. A refugee must receive a “sponsorship assurance” from a Resettlement Agency before \nshe can travel to the United States. The Resettlement Agency assumes responsibility for placing \nthe refugee with one of its affiliates, and for providing the refugee with initial services during her \nfirst 30 to 90 days in the United States. \n41. In providing sponsorship assurances, Resettlement Agencies and their affiliates take \nresponsibility for providing refugees with basic necessities and core services during their initial \nperiod of resettlement and—in coordination with publicly supported refugee service and \nassistance programs—assisting refugees in achieving economic self-sufficiency as soon as \npossible after their arrival in the United States. \n42. Resettlement Agencies, directly and through affiliates, develop a close relationship with \nthe refugee or refugee families they resettle, as they provide critical support during this \nvulnerable and challenging time.  \n43. For example, local resettlement offices provide many services that a refugee family is \n10 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 12 of 29\nlikely to require immediately upon their arrival, including finding housing and furnishing it, \nstocking the pantry, and making the family a welcome meal for their first night. When the \nrefugees arrive, staff often greet them at the airport, along with needed translators and \ncaseworkers.   \n44. After the refugees arrive, staff help with transportation and facilitate conversation while \nthe refugees learn English. Affiliates even provide babysitting services so that the refugees can \nundertake the necessary steps to transition to life in America, like taking an English placement \ntest or getting social security cards. \n45. In the past, it took refugees 18 to 24 months from application for admission as a refugee \nto resettlement in the United States. In recent years, however, it has taken far longer.  \nConsultation and Placement  \n46. Part of the sponsorship assurance process involves determining where in the United \nStates a refugee will be resettled. This happens in two basic stages. \n47. First, the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (“PRM”) \nenters yearly into “cooperative agreements” with the nine Resettlement Agencies. Each \ncooperative agreement specifies both the number of refugees that the federal government and \nResettlement Agency expect that the Agency will sponsor in the year ahead and their distribution \namong the jurisdictions in which the Resettlement Agency and/or its affiliates operate. The result \nis an overall annual placement plan that generally sets out the number of refugees to be placed in \neach location around the country. \n48. In the second stage, PRM meets regularly—typically weekly—with the nine \nResettlement Agencies to review individual refugee applicant case records and match the \nparticular needs of each incoming refugee with the specific resources available in a local \n11 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 13 of 29\ncommunity.  \n49. If a refugee has a relative or someone else designated as a “U.S. tie,” then she must be \nplaced in the location where that family member or friend resides, with limited exceptions. \nOtherwise, PRM and the relevant Resettlement Agency agree to resettle the refugee in the \ncommunity whose resources best match the refugee’s needs.  \n50. These decisions take considerable time and care and require weighing multiple factors.  \n51. Plaintiff HIAS, for example, has worked with outside researchers to develop software to \nenable it to improve its process of matching a newly admitted refugee with one of its local \naffiliates. \n52. After a Resettlement Agency agrees to sponsor a refugee for resettlement, it notifies its \nlocal office or affiliate that it will receive the refugee for resettlement.  \n53. Upon receiving a notification of resettlement from a Resettlement Agency, the affiliate \nworks to prepare for the refugee’s arrival. \nFederal Funding for Refugee Assistance \n54. Federal funding for refugee resettlement and assistance falls into two main categories.  \n55. First, the State Department provides funding through the Reception and Placement \nProgram, which covers up to the first 90 days a refugee is in the United States.  \n56. The Reception and Placement Program is administered through the cooperative \nagreements between the State Department and the Resettlement Agencies.  \n57. Resettlement Agencies use this funding to provide housing, essential furnishings, food, \nclothing, orientation, and assistance with access to other social, medical, and employment \nservices. Under the cooperative agreements, Resettlement Agencies are reimbursed $2,175 per \nrefugee they sponsor (at least $1,175 of which must be in direct assistance to the refugee, and up \n12 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 14 of 29\nto $1,000 of which may offset the cost of the affiliate’s services and overhead supporting the \nrefugee). This support is intended as a supplement to private resources the Resettlement \nAgencies and their affiliates are able to mobilize for the benefit of their refugee clients. \n58. Second, ORR provides longer-term assistance to refugees, primarily through state \ngovernments. See 8 U.S.C. § 1522. ORR funds, among other things, transitional and medical \nservices, as well as social services to help refugees become socially and economically self-\nsufficient. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1521, 1522.  \n59. Additionally, ORR fully reimburses states for cash and medical assistance that they \nprovide to refugees and their families. See 8 U.S.C. § 1522(e)(1). \n60. The majority of refugee resettlement programs funded by ORR are administered by \nstates. In order to receive these federal funds, a state must submit a state plan, which is approved \nby ORR. The state plan describes how the state will coordinate cash and medical assistance and \notherwise meet the requirements imposed by the Refugee Act. See id. § 1522(a)(6); 45 C.F.R. §§ \n400.4(a), 400.5(b).  \n61. If a state chooses to withdraw from the refugee resettlement program, it may do so with \nproper notice to ORR. See 45 C.F.R. § 400.301(a).  \n62. The Refugee Act does not condition the resettlement of refugees in a state on that state’s \nparticipation in the refugee resettlement program.  \n63. If a state chooses to withdraw from the program, refugee resettlement continues in that \nstate pursuant to alternative arrangements established by Congress and federal agencies. See, \ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1522(e)(7); 45 C.F.R. § 400.301(c). \nThe Success of the Refugee Program \n64. Since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980, this congressionally established process for \n13 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 15 of 29\nrefugee placement and resettlement has proved enormously successful, with the United States \nserving as a world leader in humanitarian efforts to respond to the global refugee crisis. Refugees \nfrom all over the world have been resettled in hundreds of locations across the country. \n65. The following map reflects the total number of refugees resettled in the United States per \nstate over the last five fiscal years, according to data from PRM.  \n \n66. Since the passage of the Refugee Act in 1980, Plaintiffs and other Resettlement Agencies \nhave grown their networks of volunteers, drawing in large part from their various faith \ncommunities, who are eager to welcome refugees.  \n67. Cities across the country have also sought to welcome refugees, recognizing the immense \nvalue refugees bring to local communities. Cities with declining populations, for instance, have \nbeen revived by the influx of newly admitted refugees. Refugees have invigorated local \neconomies, brought innovation, and made communities stronger through their contributions to \npublic life and cultural institutions.  \n14 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 16 of 29\nPresident Trump’s Targeting of Refugees and Efforts to Dismantle the Refugee \nResettlement Infrastructure \n \n68. In response to the global refugee crisis and the Syrian civil war, the United States began \nto accept more refugees. The United States raised the annual goal for refugee admissions from \n70,000 to 85,000 in fiscal year 2016, and then to 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 in response to the \nscale of the current global refugee crisis. \n69. Some politicians responded to this increase by encouraging and exploiting anti-refugee \nresentment. Then-Governor of Indiana Mike Pence was one of numerous state officials who \nattempted to block the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states based on fearmongering that \nSyrian refugees represented a “Trojan horse” through which radical Islamic terrorists would \nenter the United States.  \n70. These state attempts to prevent refugee resettlement were uniformly blocked by the \nfederal courts. See, e.g., Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc. v. Pence, 838 F.3d 902, 903-04 (7th \nCir. 2016); Tex. Health and Human Servs. Comm. v. United States, 193 F. Supp. 3d 733, 745 \n(N.D. Tex. 2016); Alabama v. United States, 198 F. Supp. 3d 1263, 1278 (N.D. Ala. 2016). The \nSeventh Circuit found then-Governor Pence’s actions to be discriminatory and based on nothing \nother than “nightmare speculation” of ISIS terrorists posing as refugees. Exodus Refugee \nImmigration, 838 F.3d at 903.  \n71. Amid this wave of anti-refugee sentiment, then-candidate Trump campaigned on a \npromise to exclude Muslim refugees, whom he vilified as “radical Islamic terrorists,” from \nentering the United States. Within his first week in office, President Trump made good on his \npromise by signing Executive Order 13769, which, among other things, called for a 120-day \nsuspension of the U.S. refugee admissions program and an indefinite ban on the resettlement of \nSyrian refugees. See Exec. Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry \n15 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 17 of 29\nInto the United States, 82 Fed. Reg. 8977 (Jan. 27, 2017). Executive Order 13769 also \ndramatically slashed the annual goal for refugee admissions set by President Obama by more \nthan half. Federal courts immediately blocked certain provisions of Executive Order 13769, but \nthe Trump Administration was undeterred. It continued with an onslaught of policies aimed at \ndriving down refugee admission rates and dismantling the refugee resettlement infrastructure.  \n72. As a result of these efforts, the United States did not come close to meeting the annual \nrefugee admissions goal for fiscal year 2018, which was already the lowest in the history of the \nUnited States’ refugee resettlement program. Of the 45,000 admissions slots created by the \nPresidential Determination for fiscal year 2018, 82 Fed. Reg. 49,083 (Sept. 29, 2017), less than \nhalf that number of refugees were in fact admitted. Processing times for refugees seeking to be \nreunited with family members through the follow-to-join program also slowed to a near \nstandstill. \n73. As the end of fiscal year 2019 approached, the Administration announced it would \npropose yet another record-low refugee admissions goal of only 18,000. This represents less than \none-fifth of the average (95,000) of all annual refugee admission goals set by previous presidents \nsince the enactment of the Refugee Act in 1980.  \n74. Although the statute requires the President to set the annual refugee admissions goal \nbefore the beginning of the new fiscal year (that is, before October 1), see 8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2), \nPresident Trump delayed signing the Presidential Determination setting the Fiscal Year 2020 \nadmissions goal for more than four weeks.  \n75. During that four-week delay, refugee admissions were yet again suspended. As a result, \nhundreds of refugees, many of whom have been waiting years to be resettled to safety in the \nUnited States, had their travel canceled during this period.  \n16 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 18 of 29\n76. All of these actions—the suspensions of refugee admissions, the slashing of the annual \nrefugee admissions goal, the failure to meet even slashed goals, and the delay in making the \nstatutorily required determination—have not just harmed refugees waiting to come to the United \nStates. They have also devastated refugees already here and the organizations that seek to help \nthem.  \n77. The sharp drop in refugee admissions has forced Resettlement Agencies and their \naffiliates to make significant budget cuts. That, in turn, has reduced their ability to help refugees \nalready resettled in the United States who continue to rely on Resettlement Agencies for support, \nincluding after their initial government-funded benefits run out. It has also meant the loss of \ncommunity support critical to the United States’ ability to resettle refugees in the future.  \nThe Refugee Veto Executive Order \n78. On September 26, 2019, President Trump signed Executive Order 13888, entitled \n“Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement” (“Executive Order” or \n“Order”). See 84 Fed. Reg. 52,355 (Sept. 26, 2019). \n79. The Order is similar to a provision included within President Trump’s first two Muslim \nban executive orders, both of which directed the Secretary of State to give states and localities \nthe maximum possible role in determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their \njurisdictions.   \n80. Despite being in effect since the first week of President Trump’s time in office, this \ndirective did not materially change the limited, statutorily defined role states and localities have \nlong played in making such determinations. \n81. Thus, the Order challenged here is far more prescriptive: it requires the Secretary of State \nand the Secretary of HHS to “[w]ithin 90 days . . . develop and implement a process to determine \n17 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 19 of 29\nwhether the State and locality both consent, in writing, to the resettlement of refugees within the \nState and locality, before refugees are resettled within that State and locality . . . .”  Exec. Order \n§ 2(a). The Order also requires the Secretary of State to “publicly release any written consents of \nStates and localities to resettlement of refugees.” Id.  \n82. The Order does not define “locality,” nor does it identify who within the State or \n“locality” is authorized to provide the written consent it requires. \n83. It further directs the Secretaries of State and HHS to develop and implement a process by \nwhich “if either a State or locality has not provided consent to receive refugees under the \nProgram, then refugees should not be resettled within that State or locality unless the Secretary \nof State concludes, following consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, that failing to resettle refugees within that State or locality \nwould be inconsistent with the policies and strategies established under 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(2)(B) \nand (C) or other applicable law.”  Exec. Order § 2(b).   \n84. The Order exempts refugees seeking to reunite with certain family members in the United \nStates pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A) from the operation of section 2(b). See Exec. Order \n§ 2(c).  \n85. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A), spouses and unmarried children under age twenty-one  \nof already resettled refugees are entitled to admission to the United States in the same status as \ntheir spouse or parent so long as they are not inadmissible. See 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(2)(A). \nRefugees seeking admission under this statute are sometimes referred to as “follow-to-join \nrefugees.”  \n86. The Order does not exempt follow-to-join refugees from the operation of section 2(a). \n87. Refugees resettled to the United States outside of the follow-to-join process are also \n18 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 20 of 29\nfrequently reuniting with family members already here; yet family reunification outside of the \nfollow-to-join process is not exempted from any of the Order’s provisions. \nDefendants’ Implementation of the Executive Order  \n88. Defendants have already begun implementing the Executive Order. \n89. Pursuant to that implementation, Defendants have decided that, as of June 1, 2020, \nrefugees may not be resettled in a particular location unless the governments of both the \n“locality” and the encompassing state have affirmatively provided written consent for refugees to \nbe resettled there.  \n90. Instead of soliciting those consents themselves, Defendants have decided to require the \nResettlement Agencies, including Plaintiffs, to do so.   \n91. These decisions are reflected in the Notice of Funding Opportunity (“Funding Notice”) \nPRM issued on November 6, 2019 for its Reception and Placement Program for Fiscal Year \n2020, which will run from June 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. \n92. To be considered for the Reception and Placement Program for the 2020 fiscal year, a \nResettlement Agency must submit an application according to the instructions in the Funding \nNotice by January 21, 2020 at 12:00 p.m. EST. \n93. As stated in the Funding Notice, PRM is requiring applicants to “seek written consent for \nresettlement of refugees for FY 2020 from the state governor’s office and the chief executive \nofficer of the local government (county or county equivalent).”  \n94. The requirement to seek written consent applies not only to those applicants proposing to \nmanage resettlement for adult refugees and refugee children traveling with their families, but \nalso to those applicants proposing to assist with placing unaccompanied refugee minors into \nfoster care. \n19 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 21 of 29\n95. The requirement to seek consent does not depend on whether the refugee to be resettled is \na follow-to-join refugee.  \n96. The Funding Notice requires that applicants provide in their proposal a “list of state and \nlocal government consents.”  \n97. For each listed state, the Resettlement Agency must also include supporting \ndocumentation in the form of “a letter of consent from the state governor’s office” or, if consent \nis “unavailable,” a “note [of] the date [the applicant] sought the consent and that it is \nunavailable.” \n98. For each listed locality, the Resettlement Agency must also include supporting \ndocumentation in the form of “a letter of consent from the chief executive officer of the local \ngovernment (county or county equivalent)” or, if consent is “unavailable,” a “note [of] the date \nthe [applicant] sought the consent and that it is unavailable.” \n99. The Funding Notice instructs that “PRM will not permit placement in states or localities \nthat lack such documentation.” \n100.  PRM will treat consents as a prerequisite to resettlement.  \n101.  This is evident, for example, from the Funding Notice’s instructions regarding \nplacement of refugees outside of PRM’s prescribed ordinary resettlement radius of 50- or 100-\nmiles within the state of a particular local office. Applicants proposing to manage placement of \nrefugees outside that placement radius must propose a model that “include[s] an approach that \nensures refugees are placed only in states and localities that have consented to receive refugees.”  \n102.  The Funding Notice also advises applicants that “state and local consents are not \nrequired for refugee resettlement before the award period.” (emphasis added). \n103.  Moreover, although section 2(b) of the Executive Order suggests the possibility \n20 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 22 of 29\nthat the lack of consent from a particular state or local government might not preclude refugee \nresettlement there, the implementation of the Order, as evidenced by the Funding Notice, does \nnot provide for such a possibility. \nThe Executive Order and Its Implementation Irreparably Harm Plaintiffs \n104.  Plaintiffs are three of the nine national Resettlement Agencies with current \ncooperative agreements with the State Department to resettle refugees through the Reception and \nPlacement Program.  \n105.  Refugee resettlement lies at the heart of the Plaintiffs’ work in the United States. \nThe Plaintiffs share a mission to stand with and advocate on behalf of refugees and other \npersecuted people and engage their respective faith communities in welcoming refugees and \nnewcomers.  Plaintiffs’ missions and work are the product of sincerely held religious beliefs. \n106.  Plaintiffs collectively have resettled millions of refugees.   \n107.  Plaintiffs’ current cooperative agreements end on May 31, 2020. Starting on June \n1, 2020, Plaintiffs must have a new cooperative agreement in order to continue assisting newly \nadmitted refugees with their resettlement in the United States. \n108.  Per the Funding Notice’s requirements, Plaintiffs must submit their proposals for \nrefugee resettlement by January 21, 2020 in order to be considered for a new cooperative \nagreement. \n109.  For clients assigned to them through the State Department’s process, Plaintiffs \nprovide direct resettlement services or partner with other organizations across the country to do \nso.  \n110.  HIAS currently provides refugee resettlement support through its various affiliate \noffices in 11 states: California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North \n21 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 23 of 29\nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin.   \n111.  Either directly or through its affiliates, CWS currently maintains resettlement \noffices in 19 locations in 16 states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, \nMichigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, and Virginia. \n112.  LIRS provides resettlement services for adult refugees and families through \naffiliates in 30 locations. LIRS also resettles unaccompanied refugee children through affiliates \nin 15 locations. In all, LIRS provides services in the District of Columbia and 23 states: \nArkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. \n113.  Some of LIRS’s affiliates resettle both unaccompanied refugee children and other \nrefugees, but most of its affiliates only resettle one or the other group. \n114.  Plaintiffs’ success as Resettlement Agencies depends on their broad network of \naffiliates and offices around the country. In order to carry out their work effectively, Plaintiffs \nand their affiliates invest considerably in a network of individuals and entities whose cooperation \nis both useful and necessary to successfully resettle refugees, including landlords, medical \nproviders, employers, government agencies, congregations, civic organizations, and foster care \nproviders. \n115.  Plaintiffs also rely heavily on the work of their volunteers, often drawing upon \ntheir faith communities that believe—as Plaintiffs do—that refugee resettlement is a fulfillment \nof the religious calling to welcome the stranger. In turn, Plaintiffs serve as a conduit, providing \nthese faith communities with an opportunity to express this sense of calling. \n22 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 24 of 29\n116.  As a result of the Executive Order and its implementation, Plaintiffs must seek the \nwritten consent of all relevant state and local governments in every location where they propose \nto resettle refugees in the current fiscal year.  \n117.  Plaintiffs must document these consents before January 21, 2020, when their \nproposal in response to the Funding Notice is due.  \n118.  If Plaintiffs do not document the relevant consents by this deadline, they will be \nunable to continue resettling refugees in those locations.  \n119.  If Plaintiffs or their affiliates are not permitted to continue resettling refugees, \nthey may be unable to sustain their operations and be forced to close local resettlement offices. \nThis would frustrate Plaintiffs’ missions and harm their overall operations.  \n120.  The relationships and goodwill that Plaintiffs and their affiliates have cultivated \nover the course of several decades is difficult to rebuild once lost and cannot be transferred to \nnew localities and states. \n121.  Moreover, if Plaintiffs are forced to close certain of their affiliates, their ability to \ncontinue to provide services under the Reception and Placement Program itself may be \nthreatened. This is so because in awarding cooperative agreements, the State Department \nconsiders a Resettlement Agency’s geographic reach and whether it has demonstrated low rates \nof “secondary migration,” a term referring to the phenomenon in which a refugee quickly \ndecides to move away from his or her initial placement.  \n122.  More generally, secondary migration creates inefficiencies and burdens because \nthe initial Resettlement Agency affiliate must coordinate with the receiving Resettlement Agency \naffiliate to transfer services for the refugee who has moved. Moreover, the initial affiliate loses \nits investment in the refugee’s initial resettlement, and the refugee must expend time and \n23 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 25 of 29\nresources to relocate.  \n123.  In order to try to avoid these harms, Plaintiffs must engage in considerable \nlobbying activities to solicit written consents from state and local governments, as required by \nthe Executive Order. Plaintiffs and their affiliates expect to spend thousands of hours lobbying \nscores of state and local governments if the Executive Order remains in effect.  \n124.  Lobbying on this scale will result in the diversion of Plaintiffs’ resources, which \nwill threaten their ability to engage in work in furtherance of their missions. \n125.  The burdens imposed by being required to document written consents are \nespecially severe because of uncertainty around the precise locations where refugees may have \nU.S. ties or otherwise wish to resettle. Moreover, because refugees ordinarily may be placed \nanywhere within a 50- or 100-mile in-state radius of an affiliate office, Plaintiffs’ affiliates \ngenerally must solicit consents from well beyond the counties in which they reside.   \n126.  For Plaintiff LIRS, this issue is compounded by the fact that in addition to the \nservices that it provides to refugees through the Reception and Placement Program, it is one of \nonly two national Resettlement Agencies that participates in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor \n(“URM”) program. Under this program, LIRS works with the State Department and HHS to \nprovide child welfare services to refugee children who are resettled in the United States without \na parent or custodian.  \n127.  This work includes identifying, screening and educating potential foster families, \nand placing refugee children with those families. An appropriate foster family can be located \nanywhere within a participating state, which means that maintaining the ability to operate the \nURM program will require LIRS to obtain the written consent of every “county or county \nequivalent” in every state where the program operates. \n24 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 26 of 29\n128.  Plaintiffs are concerned that time spent lobbying state and local officials for \nconsent could expose it or its affiliates—all of whom are non-profit organizations—to liability \nunder state or federal laws regulating lobbying, particularly by non-profits. \n129.  The process for obtaining consents has been made more difficult as a result of \nDefendants’ failure to provide sufficient guidance clarifying what the Executive Order requires. \nFor example, the Funding Notice fails to explain its use of “county equivalent” so as to enable \nPlaintiffs and their affiliates to solicit consent from such an entity. As a result, Plaintiffs have \nbeen forced to divert significant resources to address questions from their affiliates about the \nOrder. \n130.  The Executive Order and its implementation burden and threaten Plaintiffs’ \nability to fulfill their missions in accordance with their religious values.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Violation of the Refugee Act) \n131.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein.  \n132.  The Refugee Act sets out the conditions and considerations for the domestic \nresettlement of refugees, including the placement of refugees among and within the states. See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1522(a).  \n133.  The Refugee Act also specifies that the President must “determine[]” the total \nnumber of refugees to be admitted within a given fiscal year, after consultation with Congress. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2) & (e).  \n134.  Within this congressionally created scheme, the state and local governments’ role \nin decisions regarding placement of admitted refugees is well-defined—they are to be consulted. \n25 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 27 of 29\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(2)(A)-(D). \n135.  Under the Refugee Act, refugee placement and/or resettlement may not be \nconditioned on either the state or the local government’s approval, much less both.  \n136.  The Executive Order and the Defendants’ implementation of it violate the \nRefugee Act.  \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act) \n137.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n138.  Defendants’ actions taken to implement the Executive Order, including but not \nlimited to Defendants’ conditioning of refugee placement and resettlement on prior state and \nlocal written consent, are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in \naccordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; and in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right. \n139.  Defendants’ actions taken to implement the Executive Order were arbitrary and \ncapricious because they failed to follow their own policies, procedures, and regulations. \n140.  Defendants’ actions taken to implement the Executive Order, including \nDefendants’ conditioning of refugee placement on prior state and local written consent, \nconstitute a legislative rule issued without observance of the notice and comment procedure \nrequired by 5 U.S.C. § 553.  \n141.  Defendants’ implementation of the Executive Order must therefore be set aside \npursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(D). \n   \n26 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 28 of 29\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the U.S. Constitution – Federalism) \n142.  The foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n143.  Under the U.S. Constitution, the federal government has the exclusive authority to \ndetermine law and policy regarding noncitizens and immigration, including the exclusive \nauthority to determine the admission and exclusion of refugees. \n144.  The Executive Order and Defendants’ implementation of it seek to delegate to \nstate and local governments authority that the Constitution vested exclusively with the federal \ngovernment. \n145.  The Executive Order and Defendants’ implementation of it are therefore \npreempted by the principle of federalism on which the Constitution is structured. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \nA.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants, their officials, agents, \nemployees, assigns, and all persons acting in concert or participating with them from \nimplementing or enforcing any portion of the Executive Order; \nB.  A declaration that the Executive Order is unlawful and invalid; \nC.  A declaration that conditioning refugee placement on the written consent from state and \nlocal governments is unlawful and invalid; \nD.  An order awarding Plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses \npursuant to any applicable law; \nE.  Such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable, just, and proper. \n \n27 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-03346-PJM   Document 1   Filed 11/21/19   Page 29 of 29\nDated: November 21, 2019         Respectfully submitted, \n \nMelissa S.

All amici are in agreement with Plaintiffs that \nOrder 13888 is unlawful. \n \n3  In contrast to a “refugee” as defined herein, an “asylum-seeker” also seeks protection from persecution in his or her home \ncountry, but their claim for refugee status has not been legally determined. Asylum-seekers must apply for protection in the \n \ncountry of their destination – meaning that they must be within the country of their destination in order to apply. An \n“immigrant” may also be distinguished; he or she is a person who merely desires to leave one country and settle in another. The \nperson’s immigration into a given country, including the U.S., typically involves extensive vetting. Many immigrants are \neventually able to obtain lawful immigration status and some in time may become citizens. A “migrant” is simply someone who \nmoves from one place to another (within his or her country or across borders) – seasonal workers are a good example – but they \ndo not assert fear of persecution or violence, and, with certain restrictions, may come and go or go between given countries. \nInternational  Rescue  Committee  (IRC),  Migrants,  asylum  seekers,  refugees  and  immigrants:  What’s  the  difference?, \n10 \n \n\n \n \nHIAS, Inc. v.

As will be shown, Plaintiffs’ prospective loss of their \n \nstatutory right to be consulted in the resettlement process and their consequent financial losses and prospective loss of good will \nare “concrete” and “particularized” and “actual and imminent, not conjectural or political” and are of the type “traditionally \nthought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.” In other words, Plaintiffs have established injury-in-fact, \ntraceable to Executive Order 13888, that could be favorably addressed by enjoining the enforcement of the Order in whole or \npart. This means Plaintiffs have satisfied each of the elements required for Article III standing. See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, ––– U.S. \n––––, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016); Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997). \nPlaintiffs also satisfy any requirement for prudential standing since they are clearly within the zone of interest contemplated by 8 \nU.S.C. § 1522. See Bank Am. Corp v. City of Miami, ––– U.S. ––––, 137 S. Ct. 1296, 1302-03, 197 L.Ed.2d 678 (2017). \n \n11  Defendants argue that the Order does not give veto power to the State and Local Governments, suggesting that instead the \npurpose of the Order “is to enhance the consultation between the Government and States and localities”. ECF No. 54, p. 22. This \n \nborders on Orwellian Newspeak. Giving States and Local Governments authority to block resettlement unless they consent in \nwriting more than “enhances” their authority. It grants them veto power. Period. \nDefendants’ suggestion that the Secretary of State can theoretically require a non-consenting State or Local Government to \naccept refugees is not only extremely unlikely to occur; neither the Executive Order nor the Funding Notice disclose how the \nmatter might be presented to the Secretary to decide. Defense counsel, at oral argument, was unable to elaborate. But, insofar \nas Defendants rely upon a “savings clause” in the Order, viz. that the Secretary can direct a non-consenting State or locality to \naccept refugees if the Secretary concludes that “failing to resettle refugees within [a non-consenting] State or locality would be \ninconsistent with the policies and strategies established under 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2)(B) and (C) or other applicable law”, Order § \n2(b), the clause is essentially meaningless. Section 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(2)(B) requires that “[t]he Director shall develop and \nimplement, in consultation with representatives of voluntary agencies and State and local governments, policies and strategies \nfor the placement and resettlement of refugees within the United States”. While subsection (C) refers to the traditional factors \nfor resettlement, “other applicable law” includes, among other things, all of the rest of § 1522. But that is precisely the point of \nPlaintiffs’ claim. The Order, they say, is “inconsistent” with 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(2)(B) and (C) because the “voluntary agencies”, i.e. \nPlaintiffs, would have their consultative role with non-consenting States taken away by the Order. Cf. City and County of San \nFrancisco v. Trump et al., 897 F.3d 1225, 1239 (9th Cir. 2018) (“Savings clauses are read in their context, and they cannot be given \n11 \n \n\n \n \nHIAS, Inc. v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2020)   \n \n \neffect when the Court... would override clear and specific language”). \n \n12  Defendants state that Plaintiffs will actually be able to submit consents until June 1, 2020 when the grant period begins. \n \n \n13  It has been argued that, even though the APA does not apply to the President, many cases ostensibly proceeding on the basis of \nthe rationality test of the President’s authority have in fact tacitly applied an arbitrary and capricious standard. See Driesen. op. \n \ncit., 1018 et seq. The Court need not probe this argument, however, since insofar as the Order is unlawful, as the Court believes \nPlaintiffs have preliminarily shown, it would fail both the rationality and arbitrary and capricious tests. \n \n14  The States and Cities and Mayors, in their amici briefs, have declared their willingness to receive refugees, stressing the positive \nimpacts the refugees have on economic conditions, as well as the social and cultural contributions they make in their respective \n \nlocales. \n \n15  At oral argument, defense counsel was unable to articulate why or how consultations and meetings with the Resettlement \nAgencies might continue if a State’s consent to resettlement is not forthcoming. See Transcript of Oral Argument at 77, 79-80 \n \n(Jan. 8, 2020) (Civ. No. PJM-19-3346). \n \n16  See also 8 U.S.C. § 1522 (a)(4)(c) (“The Director may not delegate to a State or political subdivision the authority to review or \napprove grants or contracts under this chapter or the terms under which such grants or contracts are made”). \n \n \n17  Relying principally on the Texas and Alabama cases, Defendants devote a considerable portion of their Opposition Brief to \narguing that Plaintiffs have no private right of action under the Refugee Act of 1980. See ECF No. 18, p. 17. It is true that those \n \ntwo cases discussed the right to a private cause of action in the context of the Refugee Act of 1980, but notably, as indicated in \nthe text, supra, both cases effectively held that State Governments had no right to block federal enforcement of the Act in their \nrespective States. Neither case, moreover, involved an attempt by the Executive, potentially unconstitutionally, to abolish \naltogether any role the States might have in consulting with respect to the resettlement of refugees, determining only that the \nFederal Government was not obliged to provide information demanded by the States relating to the proposed resettlement of \nrefugees. In any event, whether it was necessary or even appropriate to delve into the existence vel non of the private right of \naction issue in those two cases, it is clear that that issue has not even been raised much less discussed in the most recent \nchallenges to Presidential authority in regard to immigration issues. See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 passim. That is \nbecause no specific cause of action is required. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 \n(1983) (executive action “is always subject to check by the terms of the legislation that authorized it; and if that authority is \nexceeded it is open to judicial review”). \n \n18  Defendants argue that there has been no final agency decision regarding the Order, which they say will not occur until the grant \nperiod beginning June 1, 2020. See ECF No. 54, p. 14. They cite Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d \n \n281 (1997), which establishes two elements for there to be finality: (1) The action must be outcome-determinative, not merely \ntentative or interlocutory in nature and (2) rights and obligations must have been determined, from which legal consequences \nwill flow. Continuing, Defendants say, a “mere request for funding applications... does not satisfy [these] criteria”. ECF No. 54, p. \n18. Plaintiffs accept Bennett as controlling. See ECF No. 60, p. 14. But the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they have in fact \ndemonstrated the finality of the Order and Funding Notice. Applying a pragmatic rather than a formulaic analysis, see U.S. Army \nof Eng’rs. v. Hawkes Co., ––– U.S. ––––, 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1815, 195 L.Ed.2d 77 (2016), Plaintiffs point out that the Order and \nFunding Notice are most definitely outcome-determinative because they determine eligibility for funding in certain jurisdictions \nin the first place. ECF No. 60, p. 15. Rights and consequences clearly flow from both the Order and Funding Notice for the same \nreason. Absent consents, there is no eligibility for a grant to provide resettlement services in a non-consenting State or locality. \n \n19  Defendants, in their Opposition Brief, rely heavily on a declaration from Andrew M. Veprek, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \nin the Bureau of Population, Refuges, and Migration (PRM) of the Department of State, who oversees the Department’s functions \n \nin the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (RAP) under the Refugee Act of 1980. Plaintiffs have moved to strike the declaration as \nbeing post-hoc rationalizations as to why and how Executive Order 13888 came into being. See, e.g., Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, \n142, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973) (per curiam) (“In applying [the APA’s arbitrary and capricious standard], the focal point \nfor judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing \ncourt.”). That said, much of the affidavit, as Plaintiffs concede, is merely explanatory and unobjectionable. Plaintiffs’ objection, as \nclarified by their counsel at oral argument, is that, whether or not they were entitled to prior notice and an opportunity to \n12 \n \n\n \n \nHIAS, Inc. v. Trump, --- F.Supp.3d ---- (2020)   \n \n \ncomment (on either the Order or Funding Notice), the record leading up to the promulgation of the Order and Funding Notice is \nbare. See Transcript of Oral Argument at 7 (Jan. 8, 2020) (Civ. No. PJM-19-3346). Yet, Plaintiffs submit, Defendants do not \ncontend there was no record at the time of promulgation; they deem it irrelevant and simply decline to disclose it. Id. Apart from \nwhat in fact do appear to be post-hoc rationalizations, the Court sees nothing in the affidavit that runs counter to the \nGovernment’s apparently unilateral, unexplained, and unalterable decision that, unless State or Local Governments consent in \nwriting by a date certain – for any reason or no reason – there will be no resettlement of refugees in that State or local \ncommunity. With these observations in mind, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, ECF No. 56, is DENIED. \n \n20  See 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(5) (“Assistance and services funded under this section shall be provided to refugees without regard to race, \nreligion, nationality, sex, or political opinion”); see also Exodus Refugee Immigration, Inc., 838 F.3d at 904-05 (holding that then \n \nIndiana Governor Pence’s attempt to prevent resettlement of Syrian refugees based on “security concerns” amounted to \ndiscrimination based on nationality). \n \n21  Defendants concede that the Governor of a State, appealing to some constituents, could block resettlement in a city that in fact \ndeclares itself wholly disposed to welcome the refugees. The reverse situation is also problematic. As the States argue in their \n \namicus brief, see ECF No. 36, p. 10, if a State consents to resettlement, but a county (or city) objects, allowing the localities to \nveto resettlement in their jurisdictions would appear to interfere with the sovereign prerogative of the State to set statewide \npolicy. \n \n22  Plaintiffs also raise a not implausible concern over whether their solicitation of written consents from State and Local \nGovernments might constitute lobbying activities affecting their status or tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status. See Treas. Reg. § \n \n1.501(c)(3)-1(c)(3)(ii). While Defendants suggest that this is an unfounded fear, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider the \nmerits of this argument. \n \n23  Defendants suggest that “[t]he requirement to seek State and local consents harms Plaintiffs only insofar as it puts Plaintiffs to a \nchoice: obtain the consents or forego receiving grant funding”. ECF No. 54, p. 31. This is a Hobson’s choice. It implies that the \n \nResettlement Agencies have freedom to decide, but in fact the only options the Order and Funding Notice offer are obtaining the \nconsents or taking nothing. But, as Plaintiffs point out, by foregoing grant funding in a given jurisdiction they would essentially be \nout of the business of resettling refugees in the jurisdiction altogether, a core part of their mission. See ECF No. 60, p. 20. And \neven if private funding were available, Plaintiffs could, presumably, still not go into those States or localities that refuse to \nconsent to resettlement. \n \n24  Defendants ask, if the Court is inclined to issue a Preliminary Injunction, that it be limited to the three named Plaintiffs. ECF No. \n54, p. 36. Defense counsel, at oral argument, conceded that this would “create potential difficulties” and could not describe how \n \nthe distinction between the three Resettlement Agencies that are Plaintiffs and the six which are not might work in practice. \nTranscript of Oral Argument at 105 (Jan. 8, 2020) (Civ. No. PJM-19-3346). Presumably the three Plaintiff Resettlement Agencies \ncould continue to exercise the right to consult and meet with State and Local Governments that might otherwise not want to \nconsent to the presence of refugees, whereas the six non-plaintiff Resettlement Agencies would be completely cut off from \nengaging with those same State and Local Governments. With impractical, unfair consequences such as this, Defendants’ request \nfalls of its own weight. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n13 \n ",
