    "summary": "<p>On April 23, 2018, Disability Rights Washington—the state protection and advocacy organization—filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The plaintiff sued Governor Jay Inslee, the Secretary of the Department of Corrections, and the Superintendent of the State Penitentiary under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act on behalf of its constituents who are inmates with mental illness held in overly restrictive conditions due to their disability. The plaintiff, represented by Disability Rights Washington and private counsel sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys fees. The plaintiff claimed that defendants’ policy and practice of housing all inmates in need of mental health services in a more restrictive close custody setting irrespective of their actual custody classifications denies them the benefit of DOC’s services, program, and activities. Additionally, the plaintiffs claim that this practice subjects them to discrimination on the basis of their disability. </p><p>The case was assigned to Judge Rosanna M. Peterson. The defendants filed their answer on May 21, 2018 and the parties then entered discovery. On February 13, 2019, the court granted the parties joint motion to stay proceedings to finalize a possible settlement, which was contingent on legislative funding. The Department of Corrections received approximately $5 million in requested funding from the Washington Legislature conditioned on the money being used to resolve this litigation. </p><p>On June 27, 2019, the parties jointly stipulated and moved to dismiss all claims against Governor Inslee. The same day, the parties jointly moved for approval of their Final Settlement Agreement. </p><p>The proposed settlement agreement required the defendants to review the custody score, assigned custody, and housing assignment for each person in the Residential Treatment Center at the Baker, Adams, and Rainer (Bar) Units at the Washington State Penitentiary. For those inmates whose behavioral or mental health needs dictate a higher custodial setting than their custody score under other DOC policy, they will be reviewed individually. If a more restrictive setting is required, reducing behaviors or symptoms associated with the more restrictive placement would be included as a treatment goal along with specific, objective, and individualized benchmarks in the treatment plan. The settlement also called for one designated medium security BAR unit with at least two mods designated as residential treatment units, and for physical retrofits to the new unit. The defendants would ensure that people housed in the new medium security mods have comparable out-of-cell time, program, and activities as are provided to people housed in other units. </p><p>The proposed agreement called for defendants to develop a work plan, ideally within two months of execution of the agreement, including interim benchmarks, and for the parties to meet quarterly to discuss defendants’ progress. The plaintiff is entitled to reasonable monitoring and will visit the new unit twice per year. </p><p>The parties intended to work in good faith to achieve substantial compliance within two years of court approval, but also requested that the court incorporate the agreement into an order and retain jurisdiction to enforce the substantive terms of the agreement for 30 months following approval.</p><p>The defendants agreed to pay plaintiff $185,000 in attorneys’ fees and $25,000 annually as compensation for monitoring while the agreement remains in effect. </p><p>On July 1, 2019 Judge Peterson granted the stipulated motion for approval of the settlement and terminated Governor Inslee as a defendant with prejudice. The court will retain jurisdiction for 30 months and then dismiss the case with prejudice absent an extension. </p>",

COMPLAINT \n   \n14 \nJAY INSLEE, Governor, State of   \nWashington; STEPHEN SINCLAIR,   \n15 \nSecretary, Washington State Department \nof Corrections; DONALD HOLBROOK, \n16 \nSuperintendent, Washington State \nPenitentiary  \n17 \n \n      Defendants. \n18 \n \n19    Plaintiff alleges the following based on information and belief, and \n20  investigation of counsel.  \nCOMPLAINT - 1  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.2   Page 2 of 18\n \n1  I.  Preliminary Statement \n2  1.  This litigation is brought by Disability Rights Washington as \n3  organizational plaintiff on behalf of its constituents who are inmates with mental \n4  illness held in overly restrictive conditions due to their disability. \n5  2.  Specifically, inmates with mental illness who are classified as \n6  minimum or medium custody by the Washington State Department of Corrections \n7  (DOC) are being confined in a more restrictive close custody setting in parts of \n8  Washington State Penitentiary’s Baker, Adams, and Rainier (BAR) units, in order \n9  to receive mental health services.1   \n10  3.  DOC confines these minimum and medium security inmates in close \n11  custody mental health housing units, irrespective of an inmate’s individual custody \n12  level. Some inmates are housed in these restrictive conditions for years solely due \n13  to their disability, despite being eligible for a far less restrictive setting. This \n14 \n                                                 \n15  1 The BAR units serve only adult men and are comprised of three separate \n16  units, all of which are run as close custody. Inmates in protective custody are also \n17  held on these units. Baker is comprised mostly of inmates with mental health \n18  needs; Adams is a mix of inmates on protective custody and those in need of \n19  mental health services, or both, while Rainier is almost entirely inmates in \n20  protective custody.  \nCOMPLAINT - 2  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.3   Page 3 of 18\n \n1  restrictive placement limits inmates’ abilities to engage in programming and \n2  recreational opportunities, for which they would otherwise be eligible. \n3  4.  DOC’s discriminatory policy and practice of housing inmates with \n4  mental illness in close custody conditions in the BAR units irrespective of their \n5  actual custody classification violates title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n6  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-34 (“ADA” or “Title II”), and section 504 of the \n7  Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 504”).   \n8  II.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n9  5.  This court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action \n10  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1343 \n11  (civil rights jurisdiction).  \n12  6.  Venue in this court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), as a \n13  substantial part of the events giving rise these claims occurred in this judicial \n14  district, where Washington State Penitentiary is located.  \n15  III.  Parties \n16  7.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Washington (DRW), a nonprofit \n17  corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Washington, is the \n18  statewide protection and advocacy system designated by the Governor of the State \n19  of Washington to protect and advocate for the legal and civil rights of those \n20  residents of this state who have disabilities, pursuant to the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ \nCOMPLAINT - 3  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.4   Page 4 of 18\n \n1  15041-45, the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-51, the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n2  794e, the PATBI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300d-53, and RCW 71A.10.080(2). As such, \n3  DRW fulfills its federal mandate by providing an array of protection and advocacy \n4  services to people with disabilities across Washington, including the inmate \n5  constituents in this case. DRW is governed by a board of directors comprised \n6  predominantly of people with disabilities and their family members. This board is \n7  advised by two advisory councils, the Disability Advisory Council and the \n8  statutorily mandated Mental Health Advisory Council, also primarily comprised of \n9  people with disabilities and their family members. \n10  8.  As the protection and advocacy system, DRW has engaged in \n11  advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities for over forty years, and over the \n12  past twenty years, DRW has undertaken significant systemic litigation to protect \n13  the rights of individuals with mental illness and ensure they receive individualized \n14  and appropriate care in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs.  \n15  9.  DRW’s Amplifying Voices of Inmates with Disabilities (AVID) \nProgram specifically focuses on advocating for people with disabilities in jails and \n16 \nprisons. The AVID Program has been recognized across the state and nationally, \n17 \nand has been asked to present at events for the White House, U.S. Senate, the \n18 \nnational Center on Disability, and at multiple conferences for corrections advocates \n19 \nand administrators across the country. \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 4  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.5   Page 5 of 18\n \n1  10.  Through what has become its AVID Program, DRW has conducted \n2  numerous monitoring visits to all twelve state prisons and has undertaken \n3  investigations into potential abuse or neglect of prison inmates with disabilities for \n4  over eight years. The AVID Program has received and responded to thousands of \n5  inmate calls during that time and has engaged in advocacy on behalf of dozens of \n6  individual inmates with disabilities, addressing issues such as inappropriate or long \n7  term segregation, access to accommodations, access to adequate medical and \n8  mental health care, and access to programming.  \n9  11.  In 2016, BAR units inmates with mental illness contacted DRW’s \n10  AVID Program and reported that they were being improperly held in the units \n11  under close custody status, even if classified as a minimum or medium custody \n12  inmate.  In response to these constituent calls, in May 2016, DRW’s AVID \n13  Program conducted an investigation and verified these reports through an extensive \n14  document review. In August 2016, DRW sent a letter to Assistant Secretary Robert \n15  Herzog, outlining its concerns. Since that time DRW has met with the DOC to \n16  attempt to resolve this issue on multiple occasions, but has been unsuccessful.  \n17  12.  DRW brings this action as an organizational plaintiff on behalf of its \n18  constituents, DOC inmates with mental illness, who are qualified individuals with \n19  disabilities under Title II and Section 504.  \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 5  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.6   Page 6 of 18\n \n1  13.  Courts have regularly found that DRW has associational standing to \n2  represent the interests of people with disabilities, including people held in \n3  correctional facilities. Trueblood v. Washington State Dep't of Soc. & Health \n4  Servs., 101 F. Supp.3d 1010, 1020 (W.D. Wash. 2015), modified, No. C14-1178 \n5  MJP, 2016 WL 4533611 (W.D. Wash. 2016), vacated and remanded on other \n6  grounds, 822 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2016) (recognizing DRW’s associational \n7  standing); K.M. v. Regence Blueshield, No. C13-1214 RAJ, 2014 WL 801204, at \n8  *7 (W.D. Wash. 2014) (holding “DRW has constitutional standing to represent its \n9  constituents-individuals with physical, mental and developmental disabilities in \n10  Washington State.”); see also Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, \n11  1109-16 (9th Cir. 2003) (outlining associational standing requirements for a \n12  protection and advocacy system). Because DRW’s constituency includes DOC \n13  inmates who have a mental illness, the interests of DRW and the affected \n14  individuals in this case are aligned.  \n15  14.  Defendant Jay Inslee is the Governor of the State of Washington. The \n16  Governor must supervise the conduct of all executive offices and appoint the \n17  Secretary of the Department of Corrections and is therefore vested with the \n18  ultimate authority and responsibility over the state corrections system. RCW \n19  43.06.010(1); RCW 72.09.030. At all times relevant to this action Defendant Inslee \n20  was acting under color of state law and is being sued in his official capacity.   \nCOMPLAINT - 6  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.7   Page 7 of 18\n \n1  15.  Defendant Stephen Sinclair is the current Secretary of the Department \n2  of Corrections and is responsible for the operation of all adult state correctional \n3  institutions, including the Washington State Penitentiary where the BAR units are \n4  located. See RCW 72.09.050. In that capacity, he is required to exercise all powers \n5  and perform all duties prescribed by law with respect to the administration of \n6  Washington’s prisons, including adopting, implementing, and enforcing policies \n7  and procedures that ensure that inmates with disabilities are not discriminated \n8  against while in DOC’s custody. He has the authority to direct activities of \n9  subordinate officers and other DOC employees, as well as the authority to identify \n10  capital needs and submit budget requests to the state legislature. DOC has custody \n11  of DRW’s constituents. At all times relevant to this action Defendant Sinclair was \n12  acting under color of state law and is being sued in his official capacity.  \n13  16.  Defendant Donald Holbrook is the Superintendent of the Washington \n14  State Penitentiary and is responsible for the day to day operation and management \n15  of that prison, including the operation and management of the BAR units. At all \n16  times relevant to this action Defendant Holbrook was acting under color of state \n17  law and is being sued in his official capacity.  \n18  IV.  Statement of Facts Entitling Plaintiffs to Relief \n19  17.  The Department of Corrections uses a custody classification system to \n20  assign inmates to the least restrictive custody level appropriate.

The Department of Corrections has six custody levels.  \n4  19.  Maximum custody is segregation and is the most restrictive custody \n5  level. Upon information and belief, inmates in maximum custody are housed alone, \n6  are generally limited to five hours of recreation per week, and do not have access \n7  to most prison programs and services. Maximum custody is generally reserved for \n8  inmates with substantial behavioral issues or those awaiting, or serving time for, a \n9  disciplinary sanction.  \n10  20.  Close custody is the second most restrictive custody status. Inmates in \n11  close custody are unable to leave their cell at will and access to the dayroom is \n12  controlled by correctional officers in a central control booth. Inmates in close \n13  custody are generally locked in their cells for sixteen hours of the day. They may \n14  access the main yard and gym for approximately ten hours per week; access to the \n15  dayroom is limited to approximately sixteen hours per week. Inmates in close \n16  custody have less access to educational programming, recreational programming, \n17  and have fewer job opportunities than inmates at lower custody levels. By statute, \n18  inmates who have been sentenced to the death penalty or life without parole are \n19  generally assigned to close custody. Inmates with known gang affiliations or recent \n20  infractions may also be placed in close custody.   \nCOMPLAINT - 8  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.9   Page 9 of 18\n \n1  21.  The BAR units, which are close custody, are in many ways even more \n2  restrictive than other close custody units at Washington State Penitentiary. While \n3  other close custody units at Washington State Penitentiary have access to the dog \n4  training program, the BAR units do not. BAR units inmates also do not have \n5  access to chemical dependency programming, unlike both close and medium \n6  custody inmates located elsewhere in the facility. The educational programming \n7  available in the BAR units is limited to GED preparation, while inmates in other \n8  close custody units at Washington State Penitentiary may access various education \n9  programs, including vocational programs and higher education. BAR units inmates \n10  also have more restrictions on dayroom activities, with limitations on what can be \n11  brought into the general area that are not applied on other close custody units. \n12  22.  Medium Custody is far less restrictive than either general close \n13  custody or the version of close custody found on the BAR units. Inmates in \n14  medium custody have a key to their cell and can generally come and go \n15  independently. Medium custody inmates are able to access the main yard and gym \n16  almost forty hours per week; they may access the dayroom approximately fifty-six \n17  hours per week.  Inmates in medium custody have access to a range of educational \n18  programming and vocational training, meals with the general population, and \n19  increased access to jobs and work training programs.   \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 9  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.10   Page 10 of 18\n \n1  23.  Minimum custody is the lowest level of custody and is subdivided \n2  into three levels, MI3, MI2, or MI1, with MI1 being the least restrictive custody \n3  status. Inmates at these custody levels have access to increased programming and \n4  may be eligible for a work camp or work release in the community.   \n5  24.  During initial classification, DOC intake staff conduct an assessment \n6  that includes the inmate’s sentence, criminal history, infraction and institutional \n7  history, and programming needs, resulting in a numerical risk assessment and \n8  corresponding custody level.   \n9  25.  After this initial classification, inmates are reassessed at least annually \n10  through the classification review process.  \n11  26.  During each classification reassessment, an inmate’s infraction \n12  history, programming needs, and release plan are considered.  \n13  27.  An inmate’s mental health is also evaluated as part of the \n14  classification process.  \n15  28.  Male inmates who are assessed as requiring placement in a Mental \n16  Health Residential Treatment Unit are assigned to either the Special Offender Unit \n17  (SOU) at the Monroe Correctional Complex, in Monroe, Washington, or the BAR \n18  units at the Washington State Penitentiary, in Walla Walla, Washington. These \n19  units provide a higher level of mental health services than other DOC facilities.  \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 10  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.11   Page 11 of 18\n \n1  29.  The SOU has two maximum custody units, two close custody units, \n2  and two medium/minimum custody units.  \n3  30.  Thus, all custody levels are available to inmates deemed in need of \n4  residential mental health treatment at the SOU and inmates are generally placed in \n5  the SOU unit that corresponds with their assigned custody level.  \n6  31.  The BAR units are all close custody.   \n7  32.  Inmates deemed in need of residential mental health treatment at the \n8  BAR units are housed in a close custody unit, irrespective of their actual custody \n9  classification.  \n10  33.  Inmates with mental illness who have been classified as medium or \n11  minimum custody are regularly assigned to the BAR units and placed in a close \n12  custody setting, solely in order to receive mental health services.   \n13  34.  Custody facility plans for inmates with mental illness routinely state \n14  that the inmate is to be retained in the BAR units for mental health treatment. \n15  35.  Upon information and belief, in November 2017 there were \n16  approximately 164 inmates in the two BAR units that house inmates with mental \n17  illness.  \n18  36.  In November 2017, 51 of these inmates were classified as minimum \n19  custody and 19 were classified as medium. Despite these official custody \n20  classifications, all 70 inmates were housed in restrictive, close custody conditions.  \nCOMPLAINT - 11  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.12   Page 12 of 18\n \n1  37.  Due to their need for mental health services, these inmates are not in \n2  the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and are housed in a more \n3  restrictive setting than necessary. Solely due to their disability, these inmates have \n4  limited access to yard, dayroom, educational programming, and job assignments, \n5  all prison programs that they are otherwise qualified to access.  \n6  38.  For example, multiple inmates in the BAR units are under the \n7  jurisdiction of the indeterminate sentence review board and in need of sex offender \n8  treatment before being deemed eligible for release. Sex offender treatment is not \n9  offered to inmates in the BAR units.  \n10  39.  Some inmates in the BAR units are in need of chemical dependency \n11  programming, which is not offered in the BAR units. \n12  40.  Other BAR units inmates have not been placed in jobs or other \n13  programming that would be available if they were housed at their appropriate \n14  custody level.   \n15  41.  DOC records indicate that one of DRW’s constituents, B.S., who has \n16  more than 25 years remaining on his sentence, is currently classified as minimum \n17  custody but is housed in the BAR units under close custody. He reported that he \n18  does not have a job and is locked in his cell for most of the day. He reported that if \n19  he were housed in a minimum custody unit he would have increased access to \n20  JPay, the email and media system used by the DOC, and more access to \nCOMPLAINT - 12  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.13   Page 13 of 18\n \n1  programming. This inmate has family in Western Washington and would like to be \n2  closer to them. This constituent has been designated as being in need of residential \n3  mental health services and is therefore being housed in the BAR unit.   \n4  42.  F.G., another DRW constituent, is currently classified as medium \n5  custody but according to DOC records, is nevertheless housed in the BAR units \n6  under close custody status “for mental health services.” This inmate reported that \n7  he would like to be placed in a medium custody unit because he would have more \n8  time out of cell and increased access to programming.  \n9  43.  A third DRW constituent, M.N., has been infraction free since 2009 \n10  and has been classified as long-term minimum custody. Despite that classification, \n11  he has been housed at the BAR units under close custody status “for mental health \n12  concerns.” This inmate has requested housing at his appropriate custody level but \n13  remains under restrictive conditions, with limited out of cell time and access to \n14  programming, despite his almost decade of infraction-free behavior.   \n15  44.  In a November 2017 interview with DRW, B.T., a BAR units inmate \n16  classified as minimum custody who was previously incarcerated in the \n17  medium/minimum custody units at the SOU, compared the units, noting that in the \n18  SOU’s medium custody unit he had a key to his cell and could come and go freely. \n19  He reported vastly increased access to fresh air and outdoor space while in the \n20  SOU and noted that he had been closer to family and friends, who had visited him \nCOMPLAINT - 13  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.14   Page 14 of 18\n \n1  almost every weekend. Now at the BAR units, this DRW constituent reports that \n2  he is mainly confined to his room. Notably, while DOC records indicate that this \n3  inmate is in need of sex offender treatment, that programming is not offered at the \n4  BAR units. After more than a year of being confined in the BAR units, upon \n5  information and belief this constituent was finally transferred to the SOU in early \n6  2018. Though he is currently at the SOU, as an inmate with mental illness in need \n7  of residential mental health services, he remains at risk of being placed back into \n8  the BAR units as he has in the past.  \n9  45.  A fifth constituent, D.D., who is currently medium custody reported \n10  that he has been housed in close custody in the BAR units for almost two years. \n11  Like B.T., he had previously been housed in the medium/minimum units at the \n12  SOU and noted the increased freedom available on that unit. Specifically, in the \n13  SOU he reported that inmates ate in the main dining area, unlike the BAR units, \n14  which restricts inmates to their unit even for meals.  The inmate reported that due \n15  to the close custody conditions of the unit he spends few hours per day out of his \n16  cell. This inmate was scheduled for release from this restrictive setting in \n17  December 2017 and expected to be placed on a Greyhound bus to Seattle upon \n18  release. Thus, upon information and belief, rather than being provided with the \n19  opportunity to live under fewer restrictions at his assigned custody level, this \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 14  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.15   Page 15 of 18\n \n1  inmate was released to the community, via bus, straight from the BAR units’ \n2  restrictive close custody setting.  \n3  46.  The classification practices that DRW identified in November 2017 \n4  persist today, despite DRW’s repeated efforts to work with Defendants to address \n5  this issue.   \n6  47.  Due to their disability, DRW’s constituents with mental illness in the \n7  BAR units are held in more restrictive conditions than necessary, in violation of \n8  federal law.  \n9  48.  Defendants’ policy and practice of placing inmates with mental illness \n10  in the close custody BAR units, irrespective of their individual custody \n11  classification, discriminates against DRW’s constituents.  \n12  V.  Federal Financial Funding \n13  49.  The DOC receives federal financial assistance, including grants from \n14  the U.S. Department of Justice.  \n15  Claims for Relief \n16  Count I:  \n \n17  Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act \n18   \n50.  The allegations of the paragraphs above are incorporated herein.  \n19 \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 15  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.16   Page 16 of 18\n \n1  51.  Plaintiff DRW’s constituents are all inmates with a mental illness and \n2  are therefore “qualified individual[s] with a disability” within the meaning of 42 \n3  U.S.C. § 12131(2) and are “otherwise qualified individual[s] with a disability” \n4  within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.    \n5  52.  The Defendants’ policy and practice of housing all inmates in need of \n6  mental health services in the BAR units under close custody conditions, \n7  irrespective of their actual custody classification, denies them the benefit of DOC’s \n8  services, programs, and/or activities and/or subjects them to discrimination on the \n9  basis of disability, in violation of Section 504 and Title II and its implementing \n10  regulations. Such discrimination against Plaintiff’s constituents includes, but is not \n11  limited to:  \n12  a)  Failing to administer services, programs, and activities in the most \n13  integrated and least restrictive setting appropriate to the needs of \n14  qualified inmates with mental illness, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § \n15  35.152(b).  \n16  b)  Placing inmates in inappropriate security classifications due to \n17  disability, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2)(i).   \n18  c)  Confining inmates with disabilities in facilities that do not offer the \n19  same programming as facilities in which they would otherwise be \n20  housed. 28 C.F.R. § 35.152(b)(2)(iii).  \nCOMPLAINT - 16  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.17   Page 17 of 18\n \n1  d)  Separating inmates with disabilities from their families by placing \n2  them in distant facilities where they would not otherwise be housed, \n3  in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 152(b)(2)(iv).  \n4  e)  Denying inmates with disabilities the equal opportunity to \n5  participate or benefit from services, facilities, privileges, and \n6  advantages, for which they are qualified, including yard time, \n7  dayroom, congregate dining, commissary, programming, JPay, and \n8  overall out of cell time, because they have a mental illness. \n9  f)  Failing to make reasonable accommodations in policies, practices, \n10  and procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \n11  discrimination on the basis of disability. \n12  VI.  Prayer for Relief \n13  53.  Wherefore, Plaintiff requests that this Court:  \n14  a.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the conduct, conditions, and \n15  treatment described in the complaint violate Plaintiff’s \n16  constituents’ rights in the manner identified in this complaint;  \n17  b.  Issue a permanent injunction restraining Defendants from engaging \n18  in classification and housing practices in the BAR units that violate \n19  Title II, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act;  \n20 \nCOMPLAINT - 17  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 4:18-cv-05071-RMP    ECF No. 1    filed 04/23/18    PageID.18   Page 18 of 18\n \n1  c.  Issue an award for Plaintiff’s costs, litigation expenses, and \n2  reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205 and 29 \n3  U.S.C. § 794a,  and other applicable law;  \n4  d.
