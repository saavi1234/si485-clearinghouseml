Executive Office of the President, 196 F.R.D. 201, 202 (D.D.C. 2000) (Calendar Committee three-judge panel). A plaintiff that seeks to depart from that general rule \"bears the burden of demonstrating that the case is a related case under an applicable subsection of Rule 40.5.\" Tripp v. Executive Office of the President, 194 F.R.D. 340, 342 (D.D.C. 2000). The two cases at issue here, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center V. Wolf et al., 19-cv-3640, and L.M.-M. et al. v. Cuccinelli et al., 19-cv-2676, challenge different policies, implemented by different component-agencies, and turn on different legal theories. Moreover, it is not sufficient that the two cases touch on the same general subject matter; that is, that the two cases challenge policies that allegedly restrict asylum seekers' access to counsel during the credible fear process. The Court, accordingly, concludes that Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of showing that the cases are related for the purposes of Local Rule 40.5(a)(3). Thus, it is hereby ORDERED that this case shall be randomly reassigned pursuant to Local Rule 40.3(a). Signed by Judge Randolph D. Moss on 12/23/2019. (lcrdm2, )"

Mar. 1, 2020), Judge Randolph Moss set aside the USCIS directive that instituted a 24-hour consultation window prior to an asylum applicant's credible-fear interview. Given that the complaint in the instant case implicates, among other things, the 24-hour consultation period that has allegedly been implemented by USCIS in the context of the Prompt Asylum Claim Review and Humanitarian Asylum Review Process programs, this Court requires supplemental briefing regarding the relationship between the policy that was vacated in the L.M.-M. case and the one that is at issue here. Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that, on or before May 4, 2020, Defendants shall file a brief of no more than 10 pages that addresses whether and to what extent the policies that Plaintiffs challenge in the instant case and those addressed in L.M.-M overlap. Any response by Plaintiffs to Defendants' supplemental brief shall be no more than 10 pages, and shall be filed on or before May 13, 2020. Signed by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on 04/23/2020.

    "summary": "<p>On October 7, 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security implemented two new asylum processes to expedite applicants&rsquo; credible fear interviews: the Prompt Asylum Claim Review program and the Humanitarian Asylum Review Process. Under these programs, asylum seekers subject to credible fear interviews would be kept in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, called &ldquo;ice boxes&rdquo; due to their cold temperatures, rather than U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers.</p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2019, the Las Americas Advocacy Center filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The plaintiff, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, claimed that the new programs for expedited removal violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1101 <em>et seq.</em>), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551 <em>et seq.</em>), the Convention against Torture, and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that Customs and Border Protection facilities only allowed them to contact attorneys by phone and otherwise limited their access to legal counsel. The plaintiffs alleged that this deprived them of opportunities to meaningfully participate in credible fear interviews, which determined whether they could pursue a claim for asylum or other protection.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding as plaintiffs asylum seekers who had been sent back to their home countries after receiving a negative evaluation for their credible fear interviews under the new programs. On December 20, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. The case was assigned to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on December 20, 2019. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on January 27, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2020, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, but granted the defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. 507 F. Supp. 3d 1. In finding in favor of the defendants, the court reasoned that Congress granted DHS considerable discretion to enact policies for the purpose of efficiently distinguishing meritorious claims for protection from meritless claims. The court further reasoned that the fact that DHS had previously afforded asylum seekers greater access to legal counsel than required by law did not mean that it was unlawful for DHS to scale back such access in light of the congressional determination that expeditious removal of certain noncitizens was warranted.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the court's order on December 28, 2020. Two days later, they appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>\r\n<p>After Judge Jackson was elevated to the D.C. Circuit in mid-2021, the case was reassigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb. As of March 27, 2022, the appeal was being held in abeyance pending a decision by the lower court on the motion for reconsideration.</p>",

Due to Defendants’ new policy under PACR and \nHARP, the Individual Plaintiffs were unable to meaningfully access counsel during their credible \nfear proceedings or meaningfully access the credible fear process.  Without any meaningful \naccess to this process mandated by statute, they have been removed to the countries they fled.  \nLas Americas is diverting significant resources to its efforts to represent asylum seekers detained \nin CBP custody on an ongoing basis yet is nevertheless losing opportunities to represent such \nindividuals due to the obstacles posed by PACR and HARP.   \nFor the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum, Defendants’ new policy \nunder PACR and HARP violates the Immigration and Nationality Act and implementing \nregulations, the Convention Against Torture and its implementing regulations, and the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  It violates statutory rights of access to counsel and the \nright to representation in agency proceedings under the APA. It is arbitrary and capricious and \ncontrary to law in violation of the APA.  It also violates the statutory right to apply for asylum \nand statutory and regulatory entitlements to statutory withholding of removal and relief from \nremoval under the Convention Against Torture.  A preliminary injunction is warranted to prevent \nongoing severe and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n  In support of this Motion, Plaintiffs rely upon the accompanying Memorandum, \ndeclarations, and exhibits.

See Kiakombua v. Wolf, No. 19-cv-1872, \n2020 WL 6392824, at *3 (D.D.C. Oct. 31, 2020).  In the instant case, the Court has \nbeen similarly called upon to determine the lawfulness of certain other written policies \nthat the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has crafted to implement the \nfederal government’s statutory process for the evaluation of asylum requests made by \nnoncitizens who arrive at the U.S. border.1  In October of 2019, DHS issued two \n                                                 \n1 This Memorandum Opinion uses the term “noncitizen” in lieu of the term “alien” to refer to “any \nperson who is not a citizen or national of the United States.”  Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105, 2110 \nn.1 (2018).  The latter is commonly used in immigration-related statutes and regulations.  See, e.g., 8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 2 of 60\nguidance memoranda that instituted new programs for faster processing of the asylum \nrequests of individuals who are subject to expedited removal and who have either \ntraveled through another country on their way to the United States or are Mexican \nnationals.  Pursuant to the “Prompt Asylum Claim Review” (“PACR”) process and the \n“Humanitarian Asylum Review Process” (“HARP”), such asylum seekers are afforded \nonly one full calendar day to prepare for the initial screening stage of the statutory \nasylum application process, known as the credible fear interview.  Cf. Kiakombua, 2020 \nWL 6392824, at *4–5 (describing the statutory and regulatory scheme that governs the \ninterview and credible fear evaluation).  Moreover, under both PACR and HARP, that \none-day timeframe encompasses the statutorily required opportunity to consult with a \nperson of the asylum seeker’s choosing, such as an attorney. \nSignificantly for present purposes, PACR and HARP further establish that \nnoncitizens who are awaiting credible fear interviews, as well as those who have \nrequested an immigration judge’s review of a negative credible fear determination, will \nbe detained in facilities that are run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), \nrather than in facilities that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) \noperates, as used to be the case.  Plaintiffs Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center \nand ten pseudonymous individuals (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) have filed the instant \naction against DHS, USCIS, CBP, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and various \nleaders of those agencies, in their official capacities (collectively, “Defendants”) to \nchallenge this detention-placement policy on the grounds that, due to institution-related \nconstraints, persons who are detained in CBP custody have restricted opportunities to \n                                                 \nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(3). \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 3 of 60\nconsult with a person of their choosing during the credible fear interview process, as the \nimmigration statutes require.  (See Am. Compl. (“Compl.”), ECF No. 2, ¶ 1.)  \nPlaintiffs’ six-count complaint primarily alleges that there is an unlawful inconsistency \nbetween the PACR and HARP mandate that such persons be detained in a facility that is \nnot equipped to facilitate interactions between such detained persons and their counsel, \non the one hand, and the statutory and regulatory requirement that detained asylum \nseekers “may consult with a person or persons of [their] choosing prior to” a credible \nfear interview, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4), and the fact that \nsuch persons have a right to counsel during full removal proceedings, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1362, on the other.  Plaintiffs also maintain that Defendants’ new detention-placement \npolicy was adopted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion in violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and that it deprives asylum seekers of not only \nthe procedural safeguards conferred by the INA and the Convention Against Torture but \nalso their Fifth Amendment due process rights. \nBefore this Court at present are the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  (Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 35; Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF \nNo. 49.)  Plaintiffs’ motion reiterates their core arguments that DHS’s policy of placing \nasylum seekers in CBP custody prior to their credible fear interview violates various \nstatutory rights (see Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (“Pls.’ Mot.”), \nECF No. 35-1, at 10); that the agency’s decision making process with respect to the \nchanged detention-placement policy was arbitrary and capricious under the APA (see \nid. at 9); and that the resulting asylum-review procedure violates the Due Process \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 4 of 60\nClause (id. at 10).2  Defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment contends, as a \nthreshold matter, that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, \nthat Plaintiffs lack standing, and that Plaintiffs’ claims have become moot.  (See Defs.’ \nMem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J. and in Supp. of Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. \nJ. (“Defs.’ Mot.”), ECF No. 49-1, at 11–12; Defs.’ Notice of Suppl. Authority, ECF No. \n71, at 1.)  Defendants also argue that the detention-placement policy does not violate \nany statutory or constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, and that the policy resulted from \ndecision making procedures that are consistent with the APA.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 12.) \nAs explained below, this Court concludes that Defendants’ threshold arguments \nabout the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, Plaintiffs’ standing, and the mootness of \nthe claims in this legal action are baseless, largely for the reasons that the D.C. Circuit \nrecently articulated in Make the Rd. New York v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(“MTRNY II”), and Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  However, this Court \ncannot find that the detention-placement policy at issue here transgresses the INA’s \nprescriptions regarding the initial stage of the asylum application process or any other \nstatute or regulation, nor can it conclude that the detention-placement policy was \nadopted in an arbitrary or capricious manner in violation of the APA.  Moreover, given \nbinding case law, the Court must also find that the detention-placement policy at issue \nhere does not violate the Constitution’s Due Process Clause.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for summary judgment must be DENIED, and Defendants’ cross-motion for \n                                                 \n2 Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the \nCourt’s electronic filing system automatically assigns. \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 5 of 60\nsummary judgment must be GRANTED.  A separate Order consistent with this \nMemorandum Opinion will follow. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Overview Of The Procedures Afforded To Asylum Applicants Under \nFederal Law \n \nThe statutory and regulatory scheme that governs the United States government’s \nconsideration of asylum applications is described in detail in this Court’s Memorandum \nOpinions in Kiakombua, see 2020 WL 6392824, at *4–5, and Make the Rd. New York v. \nMcAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1, 12–21 (D.D.C. 2019) (“MTRNY I”), rev’d on other \ngrounds, 962 F.3d 612 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  Those descriptions are incorporated into the \ninstant opinion by reference, and the Court will assume general familiarity with their \ndiscussion of the applicable legal framework. \nAs relevant here, the reader is reminded that, as part of the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, \n§ 302, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-579 (1996), Congress created the process of “expedited \nremoval[,]” which “enables federal immigration officers to slate certain undocumented \nnoncitizens for rapid deportation ‘without further hearing or review[.]’”  MTRNY I, 405 \nF. Supp. 3d at 10 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)).  Congress determined that \n“rapid removal procedures were ‘necessary’ because ‘thousands of aliens arrive in the \nU.S. at airports each year without valid documents and attempt to illegally enter the \nU.S.[,]’” id. at 15 (citation omitted), and “[e]xisting procedures to deny entry to and to \nremove illegal aliens from the United States” were too “cumbersome and duplicative” \nto address this influx at the nation’s borders, see id. at 13 (citation omitted).  \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 6 of 60\nConsequently, Congress “adopted IIRIRA’s expedited removal scheme to substantially \nshorten and speed up the removal process.”  MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 618. \nWith the addition of expedited removal, Congress effectively established a \nbifurcated set of procedures for determining whether an asylum seeker will be granted \nauthorization to remain in the United States or will be removed.  Per the pre-existing \nformal removal pathway (which applies to most noncitizens who are not already \nauthorized to remain in the United States), the government provides a number of \nprocedural guarantees as an asylum application is being processed, including the right \nto written notice of the charge of removability, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1); to a hearing \nbefore an immigration judge, see id. § 1229a(a)(1); to representation by counsel, see id. \n§ 1229a(b)(4)(A); to examine and cross-examine witnesses and present evidence, id. \n§ 1229a(b)(4)(B); to appeal an adverse decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, \nsee 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b)(3), 1240.15; and to seek judicial review, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(1).  Under the expedited removal pathway—which applies to certain limited \ncategories of noncitizens3—DHS may remove the individual from the United States \n“without further hearing or review[,] unless the alien indicates either an intention to \n                                                 \n3 As this Court explained in Kiakombua, by statute, DHS “has ‘sole and unreviewable discretion’ to \n‘designate[]’ for expedited removal ‘any or all’ noncitizens who are deemed inadmissible (as defined \nby sections 1182(a)(6)(C) and (a)(7) of the INA) and who have ‘not affirmatively shown’ that they have \n‘been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to \nthe date of the determination of inadmissibility[.]’”  Kiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *4 n.3 (quoting \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)–(II)).  Until recently, the agency “opted to designate for expedited \nremoval only those inadmissible noncitizens who were encountered near the border and had been in the \ncountry for no longer than 14 days”; however, “[i]n July of 2019, DHS issued a notice that expands the \ncategories of individuals who are subject to expedited removal, to include all inadmissible noncitizens \nlocated ‘anywhere in the United States’ who have ‘not been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously for the [preceding] two-year period[.]’”  Id. (quoting Designating Aliens for Expedited \nRemoval, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409, 35,414 (July 23, 2019)). \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 7 of 60\napply for asylum under [8 U.S.C. § 1158] or a fear of persecution” in her home country, \nsupporting a claim to withholding of removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).4 \nThe instant case involves this second pathway—i.e., the circumstance in which a \nnoncitizen is deemed presumptively removable without additional process unless the \nperson expresses an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution.  Once such a \nnoncitizen “indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of \npersecution, the [immigration] officer [is required to] refer the alien for an interview by \nan asylum officer[,]” who must determine whether the individual has a credible “fear of \npersecution[.]”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B).  This credible fear interview allows the \ngovernment to “quickly identify potentially meritorious claims to protection” while \n“resolv[ing] frivolous ones with dispatch[,]” Kiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *4 \n(citation omitted), and it is the first stage of a two-stage process for establishing the \nasylum eligibility of such noncitizens, see id. at *23 (explaining that the expedited \nremoval scheme subjects noncitizens to “(1) an initial screening to determine whether \nor not the noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country \n(if she does not, she is slated for expedited removal without an additional hearing), and \n(2) full removal proceedings, during which the noncitizen bears the burden of \nestablishing her eligibility for asylum”).  Moreover, making the credible fear \ndetermination requires the asylum officer to assess whether “there is a significant \n                                                 \n4 Although the language of IIRIRA vests authority in “the Attorney General,” Congress primarily \ntransferred the INA enforcement functions to the Secretary of Homeland Security in 2002, when DHS \nwas created.  See Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, § 105, 117 Stat. \n11, 531 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1103); Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 441, 116 \nStat. 2135, 2192 (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 251); see also 6 U.S.C. § 251 (as amended by Pub. L. No. 114-\n125, § 802(g)(1)(B)(v)(I), 130 Stat. 122, 212 (2016)); 8 C.F.R. § 2.1.  However, the Attorney General \nretains authority “with respect to all questions of law[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1). \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 8 of 60\npossibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in \nsupport of the alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the \nalien could establish eligibility for asylum[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), which the \nSupreme Court has characterized as a “low bar[,]” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. \nThuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. 1959, 1967 (2020).  By regulation, this credible fear \nassessment is typically made based solely upon the statements and representations that \nthe noncitizen makes during the interview concerning her experiences in her home \ncountry.  Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) (providing that a noncitizen “may present other \nevidence” only “if available”). \nIn addition, and most relevant to the instant case, the governing statute expressly \nprovides that a noncitizen who is eligible for a credible fear interview must be held in \ndetention leading up to and throughout that assessment process, see 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV), and “may consult with a person or persons of [his] choosing \nprior to the interview or any review thereof, according to regulations prescribed by the \nAttorney General[,]” id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv).  The implementing regulations state that \n“[s]uch consultation shall be made available in accordance with the policies and \nprocedures of the detention facility where the alien is detained,” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(4)(ii), and that “[a]ny person or persons with whom the alien chooses to \nconsult may be present at the interview and may be permitted, in the discretion of the \nasylum officer, to present a statement at the end of the interview[,]” id. § 208.30(d)(4). \nB.  Prompt Asylum Claim Review (“PACR”) And The Humanitarian \nAsylum Review Process (“HARP”) \nUntil the summer of 2019, if certain noncitizens—namely, those who arrived at a \npoint of entry at the U.S. border, or those who were encountered within 100 miles of the \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 9 of 60\nborder after recently entering the United States without inspection—expressed a fear of \npersecution or an intent to apply for asylum, they were placed in ICE custody pending \ntheir credible fear interviews, and they remained in ICE detention up to, and through, \nthe credible fear interview and any review of the asylum officer’s negative credible fear \ndetermination by an immigration judge.  (See Compl. ¶ 64.)  The facilities that ICE uses \nto detain asylum seekers allegedly provide detainees with unrestricted access to \ntelephones for contacting legal counsel, private meeting spaces for attorneys to meet \nwith their clients, and an online system for attorneys and others to locate detainees in \nICE custody.  (See id. ¶¶ 74–76, 79.)  According to Plaintiffs, such unfettered access to \ncounsel “can assist an asylum seeker in preparing for their [credible fear] interview or \n[immigration judge] review.”  (See id. ¶ 93.) \nIn July and October of 2019, DHS made two significant changes to its asylum-\nrelated policies that allegedly affect an asylum-seeker’s ability to prepare for the \ncredible fear interview and her chances of being deemed to have successfully cleared \nthat hurdle.  First, on July 16, 2019, the agency promulgated a rule—known as the \n“Transit Rule”—that prohibited asylum officers from seriously entertaining the asylum \nrequests of noncitizens who had passed through another country en route to the U.S. \nborder if they did not apply for asylum in the pass-through countries before reaching \nthe United States.  (See id. ¶ 55 n.5; see also Admin. R., ECF No. 35-3, at AR370–86.)  \nPursuant to the Transit Rule, if an asylum seeker who is subject to expedited removal \nhas not first applied for asylum in a country through which he had traveled prior to his \narrival in the United States, the asylum officer is required to make a negative credible \nfear determination with respect to that person’s asylum application.  (Compl. ¶ 55 n.5; \n9 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 10 of 60\nsee also Admin. R. at AR376–78.)5  Mexican nationals are not subject to the Transit \nRule, given that they do not pass through another country prior to entering the United \nStates. \nSecond, in October of 2019, DHS issued the two guidance documents at issue in \nthe instant case in order to implement, inter alia, the challenged new policy concerning \nthe circumstances of a noncitizen’s pre-interview detention.  The first document, which \nDHS issued on October 7, 2019, instituted PACR as a pilot program in El Paso, Texas, \nwith the purported goal of achieving “more effective processing” of noncitizens who \nare subject to the Transit Rule.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 19; Admin. R. at AR640–41.)  \nAsylum seekers identified as “Single Adults” and “Family Unit Aliens” are eligible for \nPACR, and immigration officers retain discretion as to whether such persons should be \nplaced in the program or be subjected to standard expedited-removal procedures.  (See \nid. at AR641, AR644.)  For noncitizens who are placed into the PACR program, there is \na total timeline of five to seven days for removal, and such persons are required to be \ndetained at CBP facilities during the pendency of the credible fear screening process.  \n(See id. at AR641.)  In addition, as mentioned above, an asylum seeker in PACR is \nafforded one full calendar day to prepare for a credible fear interview, to include the \ntime that must be afforded for consultation with a person of the asylum seeker’s \n                                                 \n5 Asylum consideration is effectively precluded through this mechanism, but such a noncitizen may still \nbe eligible for statutory withholding, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or for protection under the Convention \nAgainst Torture (“CAT”), id. § 1231 note; 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16–208.18, 1208.16–1208.18, both of which \nrequire a finding of “reasonable fear” rather than “credible fear” of persecution, 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.30(e)(5)(iii).  “Reasonable fear” is a significantly higher burden than credible fear; it requires a \n“reasonable possibility that [an asylum seeker] would be persecuted on account of his or her race, \nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, or a reasonable \npossibility that [the alien] would be tortured in the country of removal.”  Id. § 208.31(c). \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 11 of 60\nchoosing.  (Id.)6  USCIS also undertakes to conduct the credible fear interview \n“immediately” after the 24-hour period, in a private location within the CBP facility, \nallowing the person with whom the noncitizen has consulted (including his or her \nattorney) to “participate in the interview telephonically.”  (Id. at AR642.)   \nThe second guidance document, which DHS issued on October 28, 2019, \ninstituted HARP, which is a policy that is substantially similar to PACR but applies \nonly to Mexican nationals.  (Defs.’ Mot. at 20; see also Admin. R. at AR645–47.)  \nNoncitizens who have been “[i]dentified as HARP amenable”—i.e., “Mexican \nnationals” who “have been processed for Expedited Removal and have claimed fear of \nreturn to their native country”—are “[t]ransferred” to CBP custody, where a “24-[hour] \nconsult period begins[.]”  (Admin. R. at AR645.)  During that consultation period, \nasylum seekers in HARP are “given [an] opportunity to contact an attorney . . . via [a] \nphone supplied” by the detention facility, for “initial[ly] 1 hour[,]” with “30-minute \nfollow-up as needed[.]”  (Id.)  And after the “24-hour consult clock” has elapsed, the \nnoncitizen “attend[s] [a] scheduled telephonic USCIS [credible fear] interview.”  (Id.)  \nDHS has now expanded PACR beyond El Paso, Texas—it is currently also in effect in \nRio Grande Valley, Texas, and Yuma, Arizona—but HARP remains limited to El Paso.  \n(See Defs.’ Mot. at 21.) \nNotably, there is no dispute that CBP facilities are designed for short-term \n                                                 \n6 The 24-hour, or one full day, window has been challenged independently, in the context of a different \nlawsuit filed in this jurisdiction.  See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, 442 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8–9 (D.D.C. 2020).  The \ncourt in L.M.-M. found that the Acting Director of USCIS “was not lawfully appointed to that position \nunder the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998] and thus lacked the authority to issue the \nDirective[]” that implemented the 24-hour window.  Id. at 23.  The defendants in L.M.-M. initially \nappealed the district court’s judgment, but later stipulated to dismiss the appeal voluntarily.  See L.M.-\nM. v. Cuccinelli, No. 20-5141, 2020 WL 5358686, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 25, 2020). \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 12 of 60\ndetention—they are set up to hold asylum seekers for up to 72 hours.  (See Admin. R. at \nAR618.)  As a result, CBP facilities generally lack beds and other living amenities (see \nid. at AR444), and the holding-cell lights are kept on 24 hours a day, seven days a week \n(see id. at AR447).  According to Plaintiffs’ complaint, CBP facilities also do not \npermit “in-person” visits with detainees (Compl. ¶¶ 7, 9), and the detained individuals \nonly have access to telephones for “approximately 30 minutes to one hour to call family \nmembers or retained counsel, or to call prospective attorneys from a limited list \nprovided by CBP” (id. ¶ 8).  Plaintiffs allege that “[t]here is no callback number or \nother means” to return a phone call (see id.), and that CBP does not provide a \nmechanism for attorneys to locate, or otherwise verify the location of, a client detained \nin CBP custody (see id. ¶ 7). \nC.  Factual Background \nThe organizational plaintiff in this case, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy \nCenter (“Las Americas”), is a non-profit legal aid organization with a mission that \n“includes providing consultation and legal services to noncitizens detained by the \nfederal government in the El Paso area, including by representing individuals through \nthe credible fear interview process through a staff of four attorneys and three legal \nassistants.”  (Id. ¶ 30.)  Las Americas contends that PACR and HARP have frustrated \nthis mission because the organization’s attorneys have been “unable to communicate \nwith prospective clients in PACR and HARP, whether telephonically or in person, prior \nto their credible fear interview or immigration judge review.”  (Id. ¶ 114.)  The ten \nindividual Plaintiffs (four adults and their six children) are asylum seekers who were \ndetained in CBP custody and placed into the PACR or HARP programs during the \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 13 of 60\ncredible fear process; each was removed from the United States after an asylum officer \nfound that he or she lacked a credible fear of persecution.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 18.) \nThe individual Plaintiffs have submitted a series of declarations that recount the \nalleged circumstances of their experiences during the asylum application process, \nincluding the difficulties each Plaintiff, or family, allegedly encountered in trying to \ncontact an attorney in order to prepare for the credible fear interview.  For example, \nPlaintiff A.R.R.D.—who avers that she fled El Salvador with her minor son, Plaintiff \nL.E.R.D., and arrived in the United States on October 8, 2019—was allegedly given a \nlist of attorneys’ phone numbers and thirty minutes to use a phone on October 11, 2019, \nprior to her credible fear interview.  (See Decl. of A.R.R.D., Ex. B to Pls.’ Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., ECF No. 21-5, ¶¶ 10–11, 13.)  When no attorneys answered her calls, \nA.R.R.D. called her sister-in-law.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  A.R.R.D. talked to an asylum officer for \nfour hours over the phone to conduct the credible fear interview on October 13, 2019, \nwhile she was still detained in a CBP facility.  (See id. ¶ 14.)  A.R.R.D. avers that she \nfelt she was not prepared for the interview, and that she did not have “a fair chance to \nexplain the danger [she] was fleeing[.]”  (Id. ¶ 16.)  A.R.R.D. further maintains that she \nhad no opportunity to recover from her “grueling trip” and was forced “to sleep on the \nfreezing floor in horrible conditions” prior to her interview.  (Id.)  A.R.R.D. also \nallegedly had to hold her crying baby during the interview itself, because there was no \nplace to set her baby down or anyone who could help by holding the child.  (Id. ¶ 17.)  \nA.R.R.D. learned the day after she spoke with the asylum officer that she “had not \npassed the interview” (id. ¶ 19), and she then sought review of her negative credible \nfear determination from an immigration judge, which was held over the phone on \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 14 of 60\nOctober 17, 2019 (see id. ¶ 20).  On October 18, 2019, A.R.R.D. was told that she and \nher son were going to be deported.  (See id. ¶¶ 25–26.)  \nPlaintiff A.S.C.R.—A.R.R.D.’s sister, who also fled from El Salvador with her \nimmediate family members—had an allegedly similar experience.  (See Compl. ¶ 20.)  \nA.S.C.R., Plaintiff K.M.V. (A.S.C.R.’s husband), and their child, Plaintiff F.B.G.C., \nentered the United States on October 8, 2019.  (See Suppl. Decl. of A.S.C.R. (“A.S.C.R. \nDecl.”), Ex. S to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 35-6, ¶ 9; Decl. of K.M.V., Ex. E to \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 21-8, ¶ 9.)  The family was immediately detained in \na CBP facility, where A.S.C.R. and F.B.G.C. were separated from K.M.V.  (See \nA.S.C.R. Decl. ¶ 11.)  On October 10, 2019, A.S.C.R. was allegedly taken to a room \nwith a phone and given a list of attorneys and 30 minutes in which to make any calls.  \n(See id. ¶ 13.)  A.S.C.R. contends that after trying to call two attorneys on the list and \nreceiving no response, she instead called her sister-in-law.  (See id. ¶ 15.)  The next \nday, an asylum officer conducted a five-hour interview with the family over the phone.  \n(See id. ¶ 17.)  A.S.C.R. describes the interview as “very confusing” because she \nthought she would have the opportunity to present her case in person; she had trouble \nunderstanding the interpreter’s Spanish; and her baby “would not stop crying” which \n“made it very difficult to concentrate[.]”  (Id. ¶¶ 17–19.)  A.S.C.R. also avers that she \n“was not adequately prepared” for the interview.  (Id. ¶ 19.)  When A.S.C.R. and \nK.M.V. learned that they “had not passed the [credible] fear interview[,]” they \nrequested a review of the negative credible fear determination by an immigration judge.  \n(Id. ¶ 21.)  On October 18, 2019, the family had a call with an immigration judge that \nlasted approximately “five minutes[,]” at the conclusion of which the judge informed \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 15 of 60\nthe family that he was affirming the asylum officer’s determination.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  \nThereafter, the family learned that they would be deported.  (See id. ¶ 30.) \nPlaintiff B.G.R. and her four children—Plaintiffs B.C.F.G., D.M.F.G., J.M.F.G., \nand S.F.G.—left Mexico and entered the United States on November 20, 2019, to seek \nasylum.  (See Decl. of B.G.R., Ex. C to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 21-6, ¶ 10.)  \nUpon entry, B.G.R. and her children were detained in a CBP facility pursuant to the \nHARP program.  (See id. ¶¶ 10, 14.)  The next day, B.G.R. was given a phone and a list \nof attorneys’ phone numbers, and was told that she had an hour to make calls.  (See id. \n¶ 15.)  B.G.R. attempted to call “several” of the phone numbers, but “no one answered \n[her] calls[,]” and after being unable to reach any family members, she left the room \nafter “approximately 15 minutes[.]”  (Id.)  On November 22, 2019, B.G.R. had a \ncredible fear interview with an asylum officer, which was conducted over the phone and \nlasted approximately two hours.  (See id. ¶¶ 16–17.)  B.G.R. was informed that she had \n“failed [her] interview” the following day (id. ¶ 19), and although she was informed \nthat she could appeal to an immigration judge, she was also told that she would have to \nremain detained during the pendency of her appeal (id.).  B.G.R. declined to appeal \nallegedly due to a concern over her children’s health in light of the conditions of their \ndetention.  (See id.) \nThe individual Plaintiffs contend that by virtue of the detention facilities’ \nconstraints on their access to counsel, they were not able to get assistance in preparing \nfor their credible fear interviews, and as a result, they were erroneously found not to \nhave a credible fear of persecution and were removed back to their home countries.  \n(See Pls.’ Mot. at 19–20.) \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 16 of 60\nD.  Procedural Background \nPlaintiffs filed the complaint in the instant case on December 5, 2019, exactly 59 \ndays after DHS issued the PACR memorandum.  As noted above, the complaint makes \nsix claims concerning the alleged unlawfulness of PACR and HARP.  Claim One, Claim \nTwo, and Claim Three allege that PACR and HARP violate statutory or regulatory \nprovisions that provide either a right to consult with a person of an asylum seeker’s \nchoosing or an affirmative right to counsel.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 200–06 (alleging violations \nof 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), 1362; 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4); and 5 U.S.C. \n§ 555(b)).)  Claim Four alleges that, in promulgating PACR and HARP, Defendants \nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA.  (See id. ¶¶ 207–08.)  Claim \nFive asserts that PACR and HARP unlawfully frustrate asylum seekers’ ability to secure \nasylum, withholding of removal, or protections under the Convention Against Torture \n(see id. ¶ 209), and Claim Six alleges that PACR and HARP violate asylum seekers’ \nrights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution (see id. ¶¶ 210–13).  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, \nincluding an order vacating the individual Plaintiffs’ removal orders and an injunction \nagainst any application of the PACR and HARP programs.  (See id., Prayer for Relief, \n¶¶ 1–5.)  Plaintiffs also seek relief broadly on behalf of persons who have been subject \nto PACR and HARP, including an order enjoining Defendants to provide people \npreviously subject to PACR and HARP new credible fear evaluations and requiring that \nsuch persons be returned to the United States at no expense.  (See id. ¶¶ 6–7.) \nPlaintiffs originally filed a motion for a preliminary injunction (see Pls.’ Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 21), which the Court converted into an expedited cross-motion \nfor summary judgment by consent of the parties (see Joint Proposed Briefing Schedule, \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 17 of 60\nECF No. 25; Min. Order of Jan. 7, 2020).  The parties then proceeded to briefing, and \ntheir summary judgment motions ripened on February 15, 2020.  (See Pls.’ Mot.; Defs.’ \nMot.; Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and Reply in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. \nfor Summ. J. (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. 57; Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of Defs.’ Cross-Mot. \nfor Summ. J. (“Defs.’ Reply”), ECF No. 59.)7  Along with their cross-motion for \nsummary judgment, Defendants also filed a motion to strike the attachments to \nPlaintiffs’ motions for a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment, contending \nthat much of the material was extra-record evidence outside of the administrative \nrecord.  (See Defs.’ Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 51.)8  Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in \nopposition to the motion to strike on February 13, 2020 (see Pls.’ Opp’n to Mot. to \nStrike, ECF No. 56), and Defendants filed a reply on February 15, 2020 (see Defs.’ \nReply to Opp’n to Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 58).  The Court held a hearing on the \n                                                 \n7 Three organizations and one U.S. Senator filed amicus briefs in support of Plaintiffs: Innovation Law \nLab (see ECF No. 45); American Immigration Council and American Immigration Lawyers Association \n(see ECF No. 46); and Senator Ron Wyden (see ECF No. 48).   \n \n8 The parties’ briefs regarding the motion to strike concern the fact that Plaintiffs have submitted \nadditional materials outside of the administrative record, including declarations from the individual \nPlaintiffs and documents prescribing standards for ICE detention facilities, in support of their motions \nfor a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment.  (See generally Exs. A–R to Pls.’ Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., ECF Nos. 21-2–21-21; Exs. A–C to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Under Seal, ECF Nos. 22-\n1–22-3; Exs. S–W to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF Nos. 35-5–35-9.)  Plaintiffs assert that this extra-\nrecord evidence “is necessary to evaluate Plaintiffs’ argument that failing to acknowledge or consider \nthese prior policies and important factors” involving detention in ICE custody “is arbitrary and \ncapricious” under the APA.  (Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 56, at 9.)  Plaintiffs also \nargue that “extra-record evidence is also relevant to numerous issues that are independent of APA \nanalysis[,]” such as “to establish standing, in support of their due process claim, and to show their \nentitlement to injunctive relief beyond vacatur of the challenged policy.”  (Id.)  Defendants have moved \nto strike these documents because, “[u]nder the APA, the district court’s review of merits issues must \nbe based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to \nStrike Evidence Outside of Admin. R., ECF No. 51-1, at 4 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).)  Ultimately, the Court relies only on the individual Plaintiffs’ declarations, in conjunction \nwith its analysis of the individual Plaintiffs’ Article III standing, which is entirely permissible.  See \nSierra Club v. E.P.A., 292 F.3d 895, 899 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Moreover, the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs’ extra-record evidence does not advance their arbitrary-and-capricious claim under the APA, \nfor the reasons explained in footnote 16 (Part III.C.2, infra), and thus it has not relied on any such \nevidence in connection with its evaluation of that argument.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to strike \nevidence outside of the administrative record is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 18 of 60\nparties’ motions on February 18, 2020.  (See Min. Entry of Feb. 18, 2020.)  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \nIn the normal course, summary judgment may be granted “if the pleadings, the \ndiscovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits [or declarations] show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a \njudgment as matter of law.”  Air Transp. Ass’n. of Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 719 \nF. Supp. 2d 26, 31–32 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 56), aff’d, 663 F.3d 476 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011).  A factual dispute is not alone sufficient to bar summary judgment, \nsee Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986); instead, a dispute \nmust be both material, in that it “might affect the outcome of the suit[,]” id. at 248, and \ngenuine, in that “the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission \nto a jury[,]” id. at 251–52.   \nWhen a plaintiff invokes the APA to seek review of an administrative agency’s \ndecision, however, she ordinarily presents a pure question of law, and thus, the standard \narticulated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is inapplicable.  See Wilhelmus v. \nGeren, 796 F. Supp. 2d 157, 160 (D.D.C. 2011).  Rather, in the APA context, “it is the \nrole of the agency to resolve factual issues to arrive at a decision that is supported by \nthe administrative record, whereas the function of the district court is to determine \nwhether or not as a matter of law the evidence in the administrative record permitted \nthe agency to make the decision it did.”  Catholic Health Initiatives v. Sebelius, 658 F. \nSupp. 2d 113, 117 (D.D.C. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n“Summary judgment thus serves as the mechanism for deciding, as a matter of law, \nwhether the agency action is supported by the administrative record and otherwise \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 19 of 60\nconsistent with the APA standard of review.”  Wilhelmus, 796 F. Supp. 2d at 160 \n(citation omitted).   \nSummary judgment is also the means by which a district court resolves the \ndispute “if a plaintiff alleges that an agency has engaged in conduct that directly \ncontravenes a substantive statute that has a cause of action for that violation—such as \nclaims brought under section 1252(e)(3) of the INA for agency conduct that is ‘not \nconsistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter [of the INA] or is otherwise in \nviolation of law[.]’”  Kiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *12 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)).  In that circumstance, the “legal authorities are binding on both the \ncourt and the agency, and the court will analyze them to determine which party, if any, \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to the plaintiff's challenge to the \nagency's administrative action.”  Id. \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nThe clear gravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that Defendants’ policy of \ndetaining noncitizens in facilities run by CBP prior to their credible fear interviews \nviolates the INA, the APA, and the Due Process Clause, because persons detained in \nCBP custody have limited opportunities to consult with a person of their choosing \nduring the credible fear interview process.  (See Compl. ¶ 1.)  This Court has no doubt \nthat asylum seekers who are faced with difficult detention circumstances such as those \nthat the individual Plaintiffs have recounted are severely limited in their ability to \nlocate and communicate with counsel, and it might well be next to impossible for them \nto otherwise prepare for the critical credible fear assessment.  Unfortunately for \nPlaintiffs, however, the only question for the Court at this juncture is whether \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 20 of 60\nDefendants’ decision to place noncitizens who have been designated for expedited \nremoval in such challenging straits contradicts the will of Congress as expressed in \napplicable statutes or the Constitution?  And this Court cannot conclude as much, for \nthe reasons explained fully below. \nThe short version is that, as this Court has explained elsewhere, when Congress \namended the INA to establish expedited removal, it unquestionably intended to permit \nthe government to remove certain noncitizens from the United States expeditiously.  See \nKiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *4–5; MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 13–15; see also \nMTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 618.  And under the procedures that Congress adopted for the \nnew expedited removal process, persons who are properly designated for such treatment \nare distinguishable precisely because persons who fit within the designated expedited \nremoval categories and who lack a credible fear of persecution can be removed from the \nUnited States “without further hearing or review” or any other pre-removal process.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); see also id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I).  It is also clear that \nCongress intended for the credible fear interview to be a mere initial screening \nassessment, see Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1965, and although interviewees have the \nright to consult with a person of their choosing prior to being questioned, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), established law plainly provides that “[s]uch consultation shall be \nmade available in accordance with the policies and procedures of the detention facility \nwhere the alien is detained,” 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4)(ii). \nAs such, in this Court’s view, the statutory scheme that Congress has enacted \ndoes not guarantee or necessarily facilitate extensive pre-interview preparation by \nnoncitizens who are subject to expedited removal.  Thus, it is not inconsistent with the \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 21 of 60\nINA, its regulations, or any other authority that Plaintiffs have identified for DHS to \nimplement a detention-placement policy that indirectly impacts a noncitizen’s ability to \nreach or retain legal counsel prior to the credible fear interview, nor is it arbitrary for \nthe agency to prioritize efficient processing of the asylum requests of noncitizens \nsubject to expedited removal, at the expense of such individuals’ ability to build a case \nfor asylum during the initial stage of the process.  Moreover, the Supreme Court has \nlong held that noncitizens seeking initial entry to the United States lack due process \nrights regarding their applications—a conclusion that is binding on the parties and this \nCourt.  Consequently, although the Court rejects Defendants’ threshold arguments \nconcerning the non-justiciability of Plaintiffs’ legal claims, it concludes that Plaintiffs’ \nstatutory and constitutional contentions fail on the merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Not Non-Justiciable \nDefendants argue, as a threshold matter, that this Court lacks the power to reach \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ claims for three reasons: (1) because Plaintiffs’ challenge to \nPACR and HARP does not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of section 1252(e)(3) \n(see Defs.’ Mot. at 25), (2) because no Plaintiff has Article III standing (see id. at 27–\n33), and/or (3) because all of the complaint’s claims are now moot (see Defs.’ Notice of \nSuppl. Authority at 1).  The Court disagrees with each of Defendants’ contentions for \nthe reasons that follow. \n1.  The INA Preserves This Court’s Subject-Matter Jurisdiction Over \nPlaintiffs’ Challenge  \nFirst of all, the weight of authority in this judicial circuit now strongly supports \nthe conclusion that section 1252(e)(3) of the INA preserves this Court’s subject-matter \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under section 1331.  Specifically, relying on the \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 22 of 60\nexpress terms of section 1252(e)(3), courts in this circuit have found that if a plaintiff is \nchallenging a written policy or procedure that implements the expedited removal statute \n(section 1225(b)) and brings such challenge in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia within the 60-day window that section 1252(e)(3) establishes, there is subject \nmatter jurisdiction to review the plaintiff’s claims.  See, e.g., Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d \n883, 891–94 (D.C. Cir. 2020); MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 623–31; Kiakombua, 2020 WL \n6392824, at *17–20; see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)–(B). \nThat is precisely the kind of challenge that Plaintiffs have brought in the instant \ncase.  The complaint clearly assails written policy directives of DHS—both PACR and \nHARP are memorialized in writing (see Admin. R. at AR636–47)—and those directives \nprovide instructions for the implementation of the credible fear process with respect to \ncertain noncitizens detained within CBP facilities.  In addition, Plaintiffs filed the \ninstant lawsuit within 60 days of the first implementation of PACR, and they did so in \nthe District Court for the District of Columbia, thereby satisfying all of the statutory \ncriteria.9   \nMoreover, and notably, the D.C. Circuit has now considered—and rejected—\neach of the primary arguments concerning the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction \nthat Defendants make here.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 24–27.)  Indeed, it is by now well \nestablished that there is no legal basis for Defendants’ contention that section 1252(e) \nauthorizes judicial review only in a circumstance in which the plaintiff has undergone a \n                                                 \n9 In response to Defendants’ concern that certain aspects of the PACR and HARP program for  \nexpedited removals were in place prior to 60 days before the initiation of the lawsuit (see Defs.’ Mot. at \n26), Plaintiffs have clarified that they are not challenging the conditions of confinement or the 24-hour \nperiod of consultation prior to the credible fear interview, both of which were implemented prior to the \n60-day window (see Pls.’ Reply at 13). \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 23 of 60\n“determination” in addition to DHS’s implementation of a policy or procedure \nconcerning the expedited removal system.  See MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 625–27.  The \nD.C. Circuit has also confirmed that section 1252(a)(2)(A) does not strip the district \ncourts of jurisdiction under section 1331 under the circumstances presented in this case.  \nSee MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 624–28; Grace, 965 F.3d at 894.   \nTo the extent that Defendants further maintain that PACR and HARP do not \nqualify as the types of written policies that give rise to subject-matter jurisdiction under \nsection 1252(e)(3) because they “implement” section 1231(g) of Title 8 rather than \nsection 1225(b) (see Defs.’ Mot. at 26–27), that argument mischaracterizes those \npolicies, and is, therefore, unpersuasive.  In section 1231(g) of Title 8, Congress \ninstructs the agency to “arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens detained \npending removal or a decision on removal[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1), but it is clear \nbeyond cavil that DHS was undertaking to do much more than that when it crafted \nPACR and HARP.  The memoranda that establish those programs explicitly express the \nagency’s intent to address “the implementation of each removal pathway” that federal \nlaw identifies (Admin. R. at AR637), including “outlin[ing] a proof of concept on the \nmore effective processing of aliens amendable [sic] to the [Transit Rule] as a pilot” (id. \nat AR640).  What is more, DHS generally clarified that “[i]n order for this pilot to be \nsuccessful,” various DHS sub-agencies must “commit to providing the appropriate \nresources and guidance necessary to implement the processes” described.  (Id.)   \nThus, the documents that establish these pilot programs unquestionably “outline \nthe . . . steps for implementing streamlined procedures” for the efficient processing of \nnoncitizens who are subject to expedited removal (id. at AR641) in a manner that \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 24 of 60\nrelates to section 1225’s pre-credible fear interview detention requirement and that \ntherefore gives rise to this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction under section 1252(e)(3).  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV).  And to the particular point that Defendants have \nraised: the fact that PACR and HARP also arguably pertain to section 1231(g) does not \ndivest the Court of the authority to consider Plaintiffs’ challenge to these written \npolicies under section 1252(e)(3), as Defendants maintain.  Cf. Grace, 965 F.3d at 892 \n(rejecting a similar argument that a guidance document did not “implement” section \n1225(b) because it pertained to section 1158). \n2.  The Individual Plaintiffs Have Article III Standing \nDefendants’ standing argument primarily focuses on refuting Las Americas’ \nclaim that it has organizational or third-party standing.  (See Defs.’ Reply at 9–13.)  But \nonly one plaintiff needs Article III standing in order for a claim to be justiciable.  See \nLittle Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, \n2379 n.6 (2020) (concluding that the Third Circuit had “erred by inquiring into [one of \nthe plaintiff’s] independent Article III standing[,]” where another plaintiff “clearly had \nstanding to invoke the Third Circuit’s appellate jurisdiction, and both [plaintiffs] asked \nthe court” for the same relief).  And this Court has little doubt that the individual \nPlaintiffs here—each of whom was previously detained in CBP custody pursuant to \nPACR or HARP, and was removed to his or her home country after an asylum officer \nfound that he or she lacked a credible fear of persecution in the wake of a credible fear \ninterview—have standing to sue, largely for the reasons that the Court explained in \nKiakombua.  See Kiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *13–15. \nIn sum, “it is well established that a plaintiff has standing to bring a claim \nconcerning a procedural injury if she can show that the agency failed to abide by a \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 25 of 60\nprocedural requirement that was ‘designed to protect some threatened concrete interest’ \nof the plaintiff.”  Id. at *13 (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 573 n.8 \n(1992)).  The individual Plaintiffs aver that their unlawful placement in CBP custody \npursuant to PACR or HARP prevented them from consulting with an attorney and \nadequately preparing for their credible fear interviews, which purportedly contributed \nto their negative credible fear determinations and subsequent deportations.  (See, e.g., \nA.R.R.D. Decl. ¶¶ 11–20; A.S.C.R. Decl. ¶¶ 9–22; B.G.R. Decl. ¶¶ 10–19.)  Thus, \nassuming arguendo that the INA and its implementing regulations required the \nindividual Plaintiffs to be detained in a facility that permitted them greater access to \ncounsel, as Plaintiffs maintain (see Compl. ¶¶ 200–06), the alleged circumstances of the \nindividual Plaintiffs’ detention was a procedural violation that provides a sufficient \nbasis to ground their subsequent deportation harm, because there is a substantial \nconnection between the claimed violation and the individual Plaintiffs’ removal.  See \nKiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *14 (noting that “[a] plaintiff who alleges a \ndeprivation of a procedural protection to which he is entitled” need only “show that the \nprocedural step was connected to the substantive result” (quoting Sugar Cane Growers \nCo-op. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 94–95 (D.C. Cir. 2002))). \nAccordingly, Defendants are mistaken to suggest that there must be “evidence \nthat an attorney could have helped the specific individual Plaintiffs here[.]”  (Defs.’ \nReply at 14 (emphasis in original); see also id. (insisting that both the individual \nPlaintiffs from El Salvador and Mexico lacked Article III standing, because the \nSalvadorans “were categorically ineligible for asylum” and the Mexicans “waived \nimmigration-judge review of their negative credible-fear determination”).)  This line of \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 26 of 60\nreasoning, which sounds in lack of traceability and/or redressability (see Defs.’ Mot. at \n32–33; see also Defs.’ Reply at 16 (asserting that “Plaintiffs . . . must show that but for \nPACR and HARP, their credible-fear interview results would be different”)), ignores \nthe alleged procedural violation at issue, insofar as it evaluates the injury by assessing \nwhether any of the individual Plaintiffs could have successfully established that they \nhad a credible fear.  Instead, it suffices under the circumstances presented here that \nasylum seekers have a procedural right to consult with a person of their choosing, see, \ne.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), and that such right pertains to Plaintiffs’ concrete \ninterest in avoiding removal and potential persecution in their home countries, see, e.g., \nH.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 158 (1996) (explaining that, under the credible fear \nprocess, “there should be no danger that an alien with a genuine asylum claim will be \nreturned to persecution”); L.M.-M., 442 F. Supp. 3d at 20 (“It is difficult to imagine an \ninterest more ‘particularized’ than a person’s interest in seeking asylum and avoiding \nthe risk of deportation.”).  Plaintiffs have alleged that, as a result of being held in CBP \ncustody, they were denied this procedural right, which resulted in a negative credible \nfear determination and deportation.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 14.)  Therefore, they have \nsufficiently identified an alleged procedural violation that relates to their concrete \ninterest in obtaining asylum such that it qualifies as a cognizable injury-in fact.10   \nThe Court also finds that, in addition to demonstrating a connection between the \nprocedural requirement and the substantive result, see L.M.-M., 442 F. Supp. 3d at 20–\n                                                 \n10 Defendants’ insistence that Plaintiffs suffered no procedural injury for standing purposes given that \nthere is no statutory or constitutional right to counsel (see Defs.’ Reply at 15–16) is unavailing, both \nbecause it is does not address the alleged violation of the Plaintiffs’ statutory right to consult with a \nperson of their choosing, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), and because denying the alleged procedural \nviolation begs the question of the merits of Plaintiffs’ legal claims, which must be assumed at the \nstanding analysis juncture, see City of Waukesha v. E.P.A., 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003). \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 27 of 60\n21, Plaintiffs have done enough to fulfill the traceability requirement of showing a \n“substantial probability” that the agency action caused the alleged injury, Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. E.P.A., 861 F.3d 174, 184 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citation omitted).  \nThe adult individual Plaintiffs aver that, because they were unable to consult with a \nperson of their choosing (an attorney) prior to their credible fear interviews, they felt \nunprepared for and confused by the interview that was the basis for their negative \ncredible fear determinations.  (See A.R.R.D. Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16, 18; A.S.C.R. Decl. ¶¶ 15, \n17, 19; B.G.R. Decl. ¶¶ 15, 17.)  In addition, the complaint cites statistics that establish \nthat there is a significant reduction in removal outcomes when asylum seekers are \nafforded counsel (see Compl. ¶ 102), which provides support for the conclusion that \nthere is a substantial probability that DHS’s violation of the consultation right in these \nPlaintiffs’ individual cases contributed to the negative credible fear determinations that \nled to their subsequent expedited removal.  (See also Pls.’ Mot. at 20–22 (describing \nhow counsel aid asylum seekers in preparing for credible fear interviews).) \nIt is also reasonably clear that, under the “relaxed redressability requirement[,]” \nPlaintiffs need only show that the agency’s decision could be altered as a result of \ncompliance with the procedural requirement.  Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 861 F.3d at \n185 (citation omitted).  The individual Plaintiffs’ declarations explain the challenges \neach of them endured when asylum officers interviewed them, including, in particular, \ntheir inability to communicate effectively, their confusion that the interview was not \nbeing held in person, and their belief that evidence they had brought with them was not \nbefore the asylum officer during their interview.  (See, e.g., A.R.R.D. Decl. ¶¶ 15–16; \nA.S.C.R. Decl. ¶¶ 17, 19; B.G.R. Decl. ¶ 17.)  Thus, it is at least possible that, if the \n27 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 28 of 60\nindividual Plaintiffs had been able to communicate with counsel ahead of their credible \nfear interviews, they would have altered their approaches such that the outcome of the \ninterview might have been different, which is all that is required to satisfy the \n“undemanding” redressability requirement in the context of a legal claim that is brought \nby a plaintiff whose Article III standing is predicated on a procedural injury.  L.M.-M., \n442 F. Supp. 3d at 21. \n3.  Defendants Have Not Shown That Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Moot \nDefendants’ mootness argument fares no better.  “The initial ‘heavy burden’ of \nestablishing mootness lies with the party asserting a case is moot,” Honeywell Int’l, Inc. \nv. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 628 F.3d 568, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2010), and the mootness \ncontention that Defendants make here hinges on the fact that one aspect of the PACR \nand HARP programs—the 24-hour consultation policy—has already been set aside, see \nL.M.-M., 442 F. Supp. 3d at 37, and that DHS has both voluntarily dismissed its appeal \nin that case and reverted to the prior consultation period of at least 48 hours.  (See \nDefs.’ Notice of Suppl. Authority at 1.)  Defendants argue that, because “the 24-hour \nconsultation policy [that] was a central part of the PACR and HARP programs” is no \nlonger in effect, it is “impossible for this Court to assess the lawfulness of PACR and \nHARP as challenged in the complaint and presented to the Court in the government’s \nadministrative record.”  (Id.; see also Defs.’ Resp. to Ct.’s Apr. 23, 2020 Min. Order, \nECF No. 63, at 5–10.)  But Defendants do not adequately explain why that is so. \nIndeed, Defendants provide no authority for the suggestion that the invalidation \nof one aspect of an agency’s new policy renders challenges to other non-invalidated \nparts of that agency action moot.  And, here, according to Plaintiffs, the 24-hour \nconsultation policy was not the “fundamental problem” with PACR and HARP; instead, \n28 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 29 of 60\nthe core issue is that, “by keeping asylum seekers in CBP facilities, where \ncommunication with the outside world is nearly impossible and inside which no \nattorney can ever step foot,” Defendants have deprived noncitizens of “any meaningful \nopportunity for consultation[,]” allegedly in violation of the law.  (Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ \nSuppl. Br. Pursuant to Ct.’s Apr. 23, 2020 Min. Order, ECF No. 65, at 2–3 (emphasis \nadded).)  Thus, in Plaintiffs’ view, whether the uncounseled consultation period lasts 24 \nor 48 hours simply “does not matter” for purposes of Plaintiffs’ claim.  (Id. at 3.) \nFrom the standpoint of evaluating Defendants’ mootness argument, this Court \nagrees.  Regardless of the L.M.-M. litigation and the agency’s voluntary cessation of \nPACR and HARP’s 24-hour consultation requirement, Defendants are apparently still \nhousing certain noncitizens in CBP facilities during the credible fear review process, \nand Plaintiffs’ complaint is challenging that detention-related policy on the grounds \nthat it allegedly has detrimental ramifications with respect to access to counsel.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 73–102.)  Consequently, Defendants have not carried their burden of \nshowing that Plaintiffs’ claims are moot.   \nB.  DHS’s New Detention-Placement Policy Is Not Inconsistent With Any \nProvision Of The INA Or Its Implementing Regulations, Nor Does It \nViolate Any Other Statute Or Convention Concerning Asylum \nFinding no threshold impediment to considering Plaintiffs’ legal claims, the \nCourt now turns to an evaluation of the merits of the claims that Plaintiffs have brought \nin this case.  To start, it is important to reiterate that the policy decision that Plaintiffs \nare challenging pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) is Defendants’ determination that \ncertain noncitizens awaiting credible fear interviews will be detained in CBP custody \nrather than ICE custody, per the requirements of the pilot programs known as PACR \nand HARP, and to emphasize that, according to Plaintiffs, this detention-placement \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 30 of 60\ndecision violates the law in several respects.11  In this section of the instant  \nMemorandum Opinion, the Court addresses Plaintiffs’ claims that housing noncitizens \nin CBP custody conflicts with the INA and its implementing regulations, as well as \nother provisions of law concerning the granting of asylum, including the Convention \nAgainst Torture.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 200–06 (First, Second, and Third Claims); id. ¶ 209 \n(Fifth Claim).)   \nTo evaluate these claims properly, the Court must apply two related doctrines of \ndeference to agencies’ interpretations of the law.  First, to the extent that Plaintiffs are \nchallenging Defendants’ interpretation of certain statutory provisions, the Court asks \n“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue[,] . . . for the \ncourt, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of \nCongress[,]” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 \nU.S. 837, 842–43 (1984), and “if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the \nspecific issue, the question for the court [becomes] whether the agency’s answer is \nbased on a permissible construction of the statute[,]” id. at 843.  If, instead, Plaintiffs \nare challenging the Defendants’ interpretation of the DHS regulations that implement \ncertain statutes, then the Court asks whether the regulation is “genuinely” or “truly” \nambiguous, “even after a court has resorted to all the standard tools of interpretation[,]” \n                                                 \n11 This clarification is crucial, because Plaintiffs spend a significant portion of their briefing discussing \nthe allegedly superior conditions that detainees are afforded when they are housed in ICE facilities \n(see, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. at 13–17, 24–28); yet, notwithstanding the relative virtues of the ICE housing \nsystem, the legal question raised by the claims in Plaintiffs’ complaint is whether Defendants’ decision \nto detain noncitizens in CBP custody pending their credible fear review is unlawful.  This Court’s \nanalysis must be confined to that determination, despite the perceived benefits of detaining such \nindividuals elsewhere.  Cf. U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. F.C.C., 825 F.3d 674, 697 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(observing that courts “do not inquire as to whether the agency’s decision is wise as a policy matter” \nand “are forbidden from substituting [their] judgment for that of the agency” (internal quotation marks \nand citation omitted)). \n30 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 31 of 60\nKisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2414–15 (2019), and if it is, then the general question \nfor the Court becomes whether the agency’s interpretation is “reasonable” or “within \nthe zone of ambiguity the court has identified after employing all its interpretive \ntools[,]” id. at 2415–16.  If so, the Court must also inquire “into whether the character \nand context of the agency interpretation entitles it to controlling weight[,]” id. at 2416, \nincluding whether the agency’s interpretation reflects the agency’s “fair and considered \njudgment” or whether it creates “unfair surprise to regulated parties” by “substitut[ing] \none view of a rule for another[,]” id. at 2417–18 (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted). \nAs explained herein, this Court finds that Congress has not spoken to the \ndetention-placement policy that PACR and HARP adopt, such that there is no direct \nconflict between that policy and either the text of the INA itself or its implementing \nregulations.  Moreover, given Congress’s clear intentions when it established the \nexpedited removal scheme, the Court further concludes that the challenged detention-\nplacement policy relies upon a reasonable interpretation of the applicable statutory and \nregulatory provisions.  The Court also finds that the detention-placement determination \ndoes not violate any of the provisions of law that “entitle individuals to a meaningful \nopportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief[.]”  (Compl. \n¶ 209.)  Therefore, summary judgment must be granted in Defendants’ favor with \nrespect to the Complaint’s First, Second, Third, and Fifth Claims. \n1.  The INA And Its Implementing Regulations Require That \nNoncitizens Who Are Subject To Expedited Removal Be Detained, \nAnd Congress Has Otherwise Limited Pre-Removal Process With \nRespect To Such Individuals \nAs previously explained, the INA and its implementing regulations set out a \n31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 32 of 60\ncomprehensive scheme that governs the detention of noncitizens subject to expedited \nremoval and prescribes certain procedural rights to such individuals.  First, section \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV) requires the “[m]andatory detention” of “[a]ny alien subject to \n[expedited removal] . . . pending a final determination of [a] credible fear of \npersecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV); see also 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4)(ii) (“Pending the credible fear \ndetermination by an asylum officer and any review of that determination by an \nimmigration judge, the alien shall be detained.”).  Second, section 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) \nprovides that “[a]n alien who is eligible for [a credible fear] interview may consult with \na person or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the interview or any review thereof, \naccording to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General[,]” though “[s]uch \nconsultation shall be at no expense to the Government and shall not unreasonably delay \nthe process.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(d)(4) (“The \nalien may consult with a person or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the interview \nor any review thereof,” and “[a]ny person or persons with whom the alien chooses to \nconsult may be present at the interview and may be permitted, in the discretion of the \nasylum officer, to present a statement at the end of the interview.”), 235.3(b)(4)(ii) \n(“Prior to the interview, the alien shall be given time to contact and consult with any \nperson or persons of his or her choosing.”)  The regulations that implement expedited \nremoval, as referenced in section 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), further clarify that “[s]uch \nconsultation shall be made available in accordance with the policies and procedures of \nthe detention facility where the alien is detained[.]”  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4)(ii).  Read \ntogether, the text of these provisions provide noncitizens with a right to consultation \n32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 33 of 60\nwhile they are detained pending expedited removal, but also plainly establish that the \nconsultation right is subordinate to the expedition that this removal process is designed \nto facilitate, and that the scope of the right to consult is determined by the facility in \nwhich these noncitizens are detained. \nCritically, this limited right to consultation in accordance with the policy and \nprocedures of the detention facility also arises only during the threshold credible fear \nscreening phase of the expedited removal process.  As explained in Part I.A above, \n“federal immigration law plainly establishes that, for those noncitizens who are \ndesignated for expedited removal[,] . . . applying for asylum is a two-stage process[,]” \nKiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *4, the first of which is specifically intended to \nallow for the rapid identification and removal of noncitizens who do not have credible \nclaims for asylum.  At the time that it crafted the expedited removal scheme, Congress \nwas unquestionably concerned about the “thousands of aliens [who were] arriv[ing] in \nthe U.S. at airports each year without valid documents and attempt[ing] to illegally \nenter the U.S.[,]” and it observed, in particular, that “[e]xisting procedures to deny \nentry to and to remove illegal aliens from the United States [were] cumbersome and \nduplicative[.]”  MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 13, 15 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at \n107, 158 (1996)) (alterations in original).  Consequently, the IIRIRA’s expedited \nremoval provisions require certain noncitizens to make a preliminary showing of their \npotential eligibility for asylum before being placed in full removal proceedings, which \n“expedite[s] the removal from the United States of aliens who indisputably have no \nauthorization to be admitted to the United States, while providing an opportunity for \nsuch an alien who claims asylum to have the merits of his or her claim promptly \n33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 34 of 60\nassessed by officers with full professional training in adjudicating asylum claims.”  Id. \nat 15 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 209 (1996) (Conf. Rep.)). \nThe result of this two-step expedited removal system is that noncitizens at the \ninitial screening stage are necessarily granted fewer procedural protections than \nnoncitizens undergoing full removal proceedings.  For instance, during formal removal \nproceedings, noncitizens are given at least 10 days before their first hearing date to \nsecure counsel, see 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(E), (b)(1), and they “have the privilege of \nbeing represented” during those proceedings “by counsel of the alien’s choosing[,]” see \nid. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362.  And the text, structure, and legislative history of \nIIRIRA’s expedited removal provisions make clear that Congress did not intend for \nsuch procedural safeguards to apply during the initial credible fear stage of the \nexpedited removal process.  See O.A. v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 119 (D.D.C. 2019) \n(noting that expedited removal “affords considerably less process” than formal removal \nproceedings). \n2.  The INA Is Silent Regarding Detention Placement With Respect To \nNoncitizens Who Are Subject To Expedited Removal, And Is At \nMost Ambiguous With Respect To Consultation, But There Is No \nRight To Counsel At The Credible Fear Stage \nThe Court must evaluate Plaintiffs’ claim that it violates the INA and its \nimplementing regulations for DHS to place noncitizens who are subject to expedited \nremoval in CBP-run facilities that are not equipped for counsel visits during the \ncredible fear evaluation process with this statutory and regulatory framework in mind.  \n(See Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 1 (challenging those aspects of PACR and HARP that \n“requir[e] that individuals and families remain in CBP custody for the duration of their \ncredible fear proceedings”).)  Thus, “the precise question at issue” for purposes of the \n34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 35 of 60\nagency-deference doctrines, see Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, is whether “Congress has \ndirectly spoken to” where noncitizens subject to expedited removal are to be detained, \nsee id. at 842–43.  And there can be no dispute that, despite mandating detention, see 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV), the statute is silent as to the placement issue.  Neither \nPlaintiffs nor Defendants have identified any statutory text, nor has the Court identified \nany, that would evince a congressional intent to ensure asylum seekers are detained in \nany particular facility. \nInstead, the statute merely entrusts DHS with specific authority to “arrange for \nappropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision on \nremoval[,]” id. § 1231(g)(1), and if government-run detention facilities “are \nunavailable[,]” or if other facilities that may be “adapted” for detention or “suitably \nlocated for detention” are “unavailable for rental,” DHS is authorized to “expend” from \nspecified appropriations “amounts necessary to acquire land and to acquire, build, \nremodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living quarters for immigration \nofficers if not otherwise available) necessary for detention[,]” id.  This statutory \nprovision evidently relates to “the government’s brick and mortar obligations for \nobtaining facilities in which to detain aliens[,]” Reyna ex rel. J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d \n204, 209 (4th Cir. 2019), and it plainly falls short of unambiguously requiring asylum \nseekers to be detained in ICE facilities, rather than CBP facilities.  Indeed, if anything, \nit suggests that Congress was well aware that such noncitizens might be detained in \ndifferent kinds of facilities, either government owned or otherwise, depending on need \nand availability. \n35 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 36 of 60\nIt appears to be precisely because the INA is silent about detention placement \nthat Plaintiffs have grounded their challenge in another provision of that statute: the \nrequirement that noncitizens who are subject to expedited removal “may consult with a \nperson or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the [credible fear] interview or any \nreview thereof[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv).  Plaintiffs contend that this “right to \naccess counsel in credible fear proceedings is a right of meaningful opportunity to \nmeaningfully access counsel” (Pls.’ Mot. at 41; see also Pls.’ Reply at 44–45), which \nthey say requires “in-person access to attorneys or others and regular telephonic access” \nto counsel (see Pls.’ Mot. at 46).  But after employing the “traditional tools of statutory \nconstruction,” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9, the Court finds that the statute’s right to \nconsult provision is ambiguous, or at least does not unambiguously mandate the specific \nmeans of consultation that Plaintiffs propose. \nBeginning with the text itself, the INA does not define “consult” or provide any \nstatutory boundaries on what consultation entails.  To the extent that divining whether a \nterm is ambiguous comes from the possibility of multiple interpretations, it is clear that \n“consult” is susceptible to different meanings—that is, consult might mean an in-person \nmeeting between two people, but it might also mean one or more phone calls.  The \nstatute’s statement that a noncitizen who is eligible for a credible fear interview “may” \nconsult with a person of her choosing is also seemingly ambiguous insofar as it could \nmean that providing such noncitizen an opportunity for such consultation (such as \ngiving her access to a phone and a list of numbers) suffices, or it could indicate that the \nnoncitizen must be placed in a circumstance in which actual contact with a person of \nher choosing is assured, as Plaintiffs maintain.  And while it is important to “read” the \n36 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 37 of 60\ncontested provision of a statute, it is crucial to “read on.”  MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 625 \n(internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).  Congress did not just \nprovide a right to consultation, it provided a right to “consult with a person or persons \nof the alien’s choosing . . . according to regulations prescribed by the Attorney \nGeneral.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) (emphasis added).  This additional caveat \nstrongly suggests that Congress intended the agency itself to utilize its expertise to \ndetermine the scope of the right to consult that the statute prescribes. \nUndaunted, Plaintiffs point to two other statutory mandates that they say \nunambiguously eliminate DHS’s prerogative to detain noncitizens who are awaiting \nexpedited removal in facilities that limit their ability to consult with counsel: (1) the \nstatement in the INA that, “[i]n any removal proceedings before an immigration judge \n. . . , the person concerned shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense \nto the Government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he \nshall choose[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1362, and (2) the APA’s requirement that “[a] person \ncompelled to appear in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to \nbe accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel[,]” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b).  (See Pls.’ \nMot. at 40–41.)  These provisions are plainly inapposite during the credible fear stage \nof expedited removal proceedings, for several reasons. \nFirst of all, section 1362 of the INA expressly pertains only to “removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge,” 8 U.S.C. § 1362, and it is clear from the text \nof the statute that expedited removal proceedings under section 1225(b) are not \n“removal proceedings” within the meaning of section 1362 of the INA.  Indeed, section \n1229a of the INA is specifically titled “Removal proceedings[,]” and that section \n37 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 38 of 60\nestablishes various procedures that are applicable to such a proceeding, including that \nan immigration judge “shall administer oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate, \nexamine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses[,]” id. § 1229a(b)(1), and that \nthe noncitizen has the “opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present \nevidence on the alien’s own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses[,]” id. \n§ 1229a(b)(4)(B).  None of those procedures are available when an immigration judge is \nreviewing an asylum officer’s negative credible fear determination in the context of the \nexpedited removal scheme.  See id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) (providing that “[s]uch \nreview shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the \nimmigration judge”).  Furthermore, nowhere in section 1225(b)—the statutory provision \ngoverning expedited removal and the credible fear process—does Congress refer to an \nimmigration judge’s review of a negative credible fear determination as a “removal \nproceeding,” even though that phrase is otherwise used liberally throughout the INA.  \nIts conspicuous absence in section 1225(b) is plainly indicative of Congress’s intent to \ndistinguish expedited removal processes.  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 \n(1983) (“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but \nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts \nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (citation omitted)). \nThe text of section 1362 itself further undermines any inference that Congress \nintended that provision’s right to counsel to apply to an immigration judge’s review of a \nnegative credible fear determination.  Section 1362 provides a right to counsel in \n“removal proceedings” and in “appeal proceedings before the Attorney General from \nany such removal proceedings,” 8 U.S.C. § 1362, but, in the expedited removal context, \n38 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 39 of 60\nthere is no right to appeal from an immigration judge’s affirmance of a negative \ncredible fear determination, see id. § 1225(b)(1)(C).  Thus, an immigration judge’s \nreview of a negative credible fear determination (which has no appeal mechanism) \ncannot be the kind of removal proceeding contemplated by section 1362 (which \nenvisions an appeal from the removal proceeding).  See McDonnell v. United States, \n136 S. Ct. 2355, 2368 (2016) (“Under the familiar interpretive canon noscitur a sociis, \na word is known by the company it keeps.” (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)). \nPlaintiffs’ invocation of the right to counsel in section 555(b) of the APA is \nsimilarly unavailing.  In Ardestani v. I.N.S., 502 U.S. 129 (1991), the Supreme Court \nreaffirmed its prior holding in Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302 (1955), that, in enacting \nthe INA, Congress “‘expressly supersede[d]’ the hearing provisions of the APA[.]”  \nArdestani, 502 U.S. at 133 (quoting Marcello, 349 U.S. at 310).  Although those cases \nassessed the applicability of the APA to traditional removal proceedings, as they were \ndecided before the expedited removal system was introduced (see Pls.’ Reply at 48), the \nreasoning of Ardestani and Marcello is not limited to proceedings in the traditional \nremoval process; instead, Ardestani generally explains that “immigration proceedings \n. . . are not governed by the APA[,]” and again, as relevant here, “that the INA \n‘expressly supersedes’ the hearing provisions of the APA[.]”  Ardestani, 502 U.S. at \n133 (quoting Marcello, 349 U.S. at 310).  Because section 1225(b) is a part of the INA, \nand because proceedings related to expedited removal under section 1225(b) qualify as \nimmigration proceedings, Ardestani’s holding precludes application of the APA’s \ncounsel provision in the context of the credible fear evaluation process. \n39 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 40 of 60\nThe bottom line is this: despite mandating that noncitizens who are awaiting \ncredible fear assessment must be detained and may consult with a person of their \nchoosing during that detention, the INA does not speak to the issue of where such \npersons are to be housed, nor does it establish that such noncitizens have a right to \naccess counsel prior to the credible fear interview.  Therefore, the Court cannot accept \nPlaintiffs’ argument that PACR and HARP’s detention-placement policy (which \neffectively limits access to counsel by housing noncitizens in CBP facilities) conflicts \nwith the INA and the unambiguous will of Congress as expressed in that statute. \n3.  The PACR And HARP Detention-Placement Policy Is Both \nReasonable And Entitled To Deference  \nBecause the applicable provisions of the INA are silent as to where an asylum \nseeker subject to expedited removal may be detained, and are at most ambiguous as to \nthe scope of the consultation right during the credible fear screening process, the Court \nnext considers whether PACR and HARP’s detention-placement policy “is based on a \npermissible construction of the statute.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.  As explained \nbelow, in this Court’s view, Defendants’ interpretation of the statute to authorize \nplacement in CBP facilities is not unreasonable in light of Congress’s clear intent that \nthe expedited removal process be highly truncated and subject to fewer procedural \nguarantees than formal removal proceedings. \nWhere the relevant statute is ambiguous or silent on the relevant issue, as is the \ncase with the INA here, the Court looks to the “agency regulations, which are entitled \nto deference if they resolve the ambiguity in a reasonable manner[,]” and if they, too, \nare ambiguous, the Court then looks “to the agencies’ subsequent interpretation of those \nregulations.”  Coeur Alaska, Inc. v. Se. Alaska Conservation Council, 557 U.S. 261, \n40 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 41 of 60\n277–78 (2009).  “No matter how it is framed, the question a court faces when \nconfronted with an agency’s interpretation of a statute it administers is always, simply, \nwhether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.”  District of \nColumbia v. Dep’t of Labor, 819 F.3d 444, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting City of Arlington v. F.C.C., 569 U.S. 290, 297 (2013)); see also Kisor, 139 \nS. Ct. at 2414–15 (interpretations of regulations).   \nHere, the implementing regulations provide that “the alien shall be given time to \ncontact and consult with any person or persons of his or her choosing” and that “[s]uch \nconsultation shall be made available in accordance with the policies and procedures of \nthe detention facility where the alien is detained, shall be at no expense to the \ngovernment, and shall not unreasonably delay the process.”  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4)(ii).  \nUnder PACR and HARP, an asylum seeker’s consultation with a person of his or her \nchoosing is available in accordance with the policies and procedures of the CBP \nfacilities where noncitizens who are subject to those programs are detained, and while \nCBP facilities do not allow in-person visitation, consultation is available telephonically.  \n(See Admin. R. at AR641 (concerning PACR), AR645 (concerning HARP).)  The PACR \nguidance document specifically states that asylum seekers shall have access to \ntelephones “as often as operationally feasible” to “consult with any person of their \nchoosing, including an attorney” (id. at AR641), and that “[t]he alien’s consultant or \nattorney may participate in the interview telephonically” (id. at AR642).  Similarly, the \nHARP guidance document requires that asylum seekers have an “opportunity to contact \nan attorney” through an initial one-hour period for telephonic consultation, with “30-\nminute follow-up as needed[,]” and instructs that “[t]he location for consultation calls \n41 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 42 of 60\nmust allow sufficient privacy to allow for discussion of confidential matters.”  (Id. at \nAR645.)  Given the latitude that the INA and its implementing regulations provide, it \nwas reasonable for DHS to conclude that the means of communication with counsel or \nprospective counsel that are established with the PACR and HARP pilot programs \nprovide noncitizens with a legally sufficient opportunity to consult with others, \nincluding a lawyer, before their credible fear interviews or immigration judge review. \nCongress’s intent in creating the expedited removal system further underscores \nthe reasonableness of the agency’s interpretation.  Again, Congress imposed the \nthreshold credible fear “screening interview[,]” Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1965, to \npermit the agency to “quickly identify potentially meritorious claims to protection and \nto resolve frivolous ones with dispatch[,]” Kiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *4 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The credible fear interview is intended \nto pose a “low bar” for asylum applicants, Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1967; thus, the \nnoncitizen need only demonstrate “a significant possibility” that he or she “could \nestablish eligibility for asylum[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), not that “he or she is in \nfact eligible for asylum[,]” Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1965.  Accordingly, Congress \nprovided for “considerably less process” in expedited removal proceedings than in full \nremoval proceedings, see O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 119, as exemplified by the fact that \nthe statute provides only a limited right during expedited removal to “consult with a \nperson or persons of the alien’s choosing prior to the [credible fear] interview or any \nreview thereof,” see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) (emphasis added), whereas \nnoncitizens in full removal proceedings “shall have the privilege of being represented \n. . . by counsel of the alien’s choosing” at all stages of the removal proceedings, see id. \n42 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 43 of 60\n§ 1229a(b)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  And this clear congressional purpose belies the \ncontention that DHS has exceeded the bounds of its statutory authority in deciding that \nin-person counsel visits are not statutorily mandated and that the telephone access \navailable at CBP facilities satisfies asylum seekers’ limited consultation rights under \nsection 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv). \nIn addition to the substantive reasonableness of the agency’s interpretation, the \nother factors for determining that deference to the agency’s interpretation is proper, see \nKisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2416–18, support deference here.  The heads of the DHS \nsubcomponent agencies have attached their names to the PACR and HARP guidance \ndocuments, which means that these programs have now been implemented by the \nrelevant subcomponent agencies and qualify as the authoritative position of DHS \nconcerning the detention placement of persons who are selected for those programs.  \nSee id. at 2416 (“[T]he regulatory interpretation must be . . . the agency’s \n‘authoritative’ or ‘official position[.]’” (citation omitted)).  Similarly, PACR and HARP \nplainly implicate DHS’s “substantive expertise” in the enforcement of the immigration \nlaws, id. at 2417, particularly in light of Congress’s mandate that asylum seekers be \ndetained pending the credible fear process.  The PACR and HARP detention-placement \npolicy also reflects DHS’s “fair and considered judgment”—it is not a “convenient \nlitigating position” or “post hoc rationalization[,]” nor is it based on a “new \ninterpretation” of the governing regulations, see id. at 2417–18 (citations and alteration \nomitted); indeed, the agency has held the view that an asylum seeker’s ability to consult \nis determined based upon the policies and procedures of the detention facility since at \nleast 1997, see Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens, 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, \n43 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 44 of 60\n10,356 (Mar. 6, 1997).  To be sure, the detention facility for noncitizens who are \nsubject to expedited removal has changed, and thus the scope of the consultation right \nof such detainees has changed, but DHS has consistently interpreted the agency’s \nstatutory and regulatory authority to decide the circumstances under which consultation \nis to be achieved with respect to noncitizens facing expedited removal.  Therefore, \nunder the circumstances presented here, the agency is owed deference with respect to its \ndetermination that PACR and HARP satisfy all statutory and regulatory requirements.  \nSee Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2418; see also United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229–\n31 (2001) (discussing similar factors in context of agency interpretations of statutes). \nPlaintiffs raise only one other argument as to why PACR and HARP are \ninconsistent with the INA that requires a brief discussion here.  Plaintiffs point out that \nPACR and HARP do not prescribe a period of consultation after a negative credible fear \ndetermination and prior to any immigration judge review thereof, and they assert that \nthe INA requires such a period.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 46–47.  But see Hr’g Tr., ECF No. \n62, at 75:8–21 (defense counsel explaining that PACR and HARP both require Form M-\n444 to be provided to asylum seekers, and that Form M-444 informs asylum seekers of \ntheir right to consult prior to any immigration judge review).)  The Court observes that \nthe statute does require that asylum seekers have the opportunity to consult with a \nperson of their choosing “prior to the [credible fear] interview or any review thereof,” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), and that neither PACR nor HARP expressly mandates a \nconsultation period before the immigration judge review.  But it cannot read the \nabsence of an express reference to such a consultation period in PACR and HARP as a \nprohibition of such consultation, and only the latter would qualify as a true conflict for \n44 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 45 of 60\nthe purpose of this Court’s review.  This is because the Court only has the statutory \nauthority to determine whether a written policy or procedure is inconsistent with the \nINA and its implementing regulations, see id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii), and to the extent \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to find the absence of any particular language to be \ninconsistent with the applicable statutory or regulatory schemes, it appears that the \nCourt lacks jurisdiction to do so, cf. Am. Immigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno, 18 F. Supp. 2d \n38, 58 (D.D.C. 1998) (“AILA I”) (holding that “unwritten” policies are unreviewable), \naff’d, 199 F.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000).12 \nThus, although Plaintiffs ask this Court to engraft their conception of \n“meaningful” consultation onto the statutory text (see Pls.’ Mot. at 41–44), Congress \nhas broadly entrusted DHS with the operation of the expedited removal system, and has \nlimited the Court’s review to a determination of whether any of the agency’s written \npolicies that implement the system is inconsistent with the INA.  In the absence of any \nindication in the INA that the meaning of the word “consult” entails more than the \navailability of a phone and a period of time to make phone calls, the Court discerns no \nsuch conflict.  Furthermore, given Congress’s clear intent to afford noncitizens who are \nsubject to expedited removal fewer procedural rights in order to facilitate the \nexpeditious processing of their asylum claims, the Court cannot find that DHS acted \nunreasonably when it adopted detention-placement policies that have the effect of \nrestricting counsel access.  Cf. AILA I, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 56 (noting that the court \n                                                 \n12 Nor can any such conflict determination be made based on the alleged experiences of the individual \nPlaintiffs who were not provided with an opportunity to consult with anyone prior to the immigration \njudge’s review of the asylum officer’s negative credible fear decision (see Hr’g Tr. at 80:25–81:2), \nbecause, again, in this context, the scope of the Court’s authority is limited to the agency’s written \npolicies and procedures, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). \n45 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 46 of 60\n“cannot impose upon the Attorney General any obligation to afford more procedures \nthan the governing statute explicitly requires” (citing Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power \nCorp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 435 U.S. 519, 524–25 (1978))). \n4.  The PACR And HARP Detention-Placement Policy Does Not \nViolate Any Other Provision Of Law The Plaintiffs Have Identified \nThe Court is also not persuaded that PACR and HARP’s policy of detaining \nasylum seekers in CBP custody during the credible fear process violates the rights of \nsuch individuals to seek relief under the asylum laws, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158, statutory \nwithholding of removal, id. § 1231(b)(3)(A), and the Convention Against Torture \n(“CAT”).  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 46–47.)13  In this regard, Plaintiffs maintain that when \nCongress created statutory rights to these protections, “it intend[ed] that they be \nmeaningful—with a fair process” (id. at 46), and Plaintiffs insist that detention in CBP \ncustody, and its constraints on consultation with counsel, deprive asylum seekers of a \nmeaningful opportunity to seek refuge in violation of these provisions of law. \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that a grant of asylum under the INA and the \n“withholding of removal” or CAT “protection against removal” are different legal \nconstructs, and, on its face, the limited process available in the expedited removal \nscheme appears to “refer[] only to proceedings to establish eligibility for an affirmative \ngrant of asylum[.]”  (Admin. R. at 377 (Transit Rule)); see also 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (requiring a credible fear screening interview when a noncitizen \n“indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158” or “a fear of \npersecution”).  DHS’s regulations suggest that noncitizens in expedited removal \n                                                 \n13 CAT is codified through the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-\n277, div. G., tit. XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681 (see 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note), and is implemented through \nvarious regulations, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16–208.18, 1208.16–1208.18. \n46 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 47 of 60\nproceedings may still raise claims for statutory withholding or CAT protection, \nregardless of whether they are eligible for asylum, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.13(c)(1), \n208.30(e)(2)–(4), 1208.13(c)(1), 1208.16(a), and Defendants here do not argue \notherwise (see Defs.’ Mot. at 39–41).  Therefore, this Court assumes without deciding \nthat noncitizens subject to expedited removal retain the right to apply for statutory \nwithholding of removal and CAT protection, and that finding is tantamount to a \nconclusion that Plaintiffs’ claim that PACR and HARP deprive individuals of “a \nmeaningful opportunity to apply for . . . withholding of removal, and CAT relief” \n(Compl. ¶ 209 (Fifth Claim)) fails as a matter of law. \nIn any event, Plaintiffs do not illuminate the contours of the alleged deprivation \nof the “meaningful opportunity” to apply for asylum, withholding, and CAT protection \n(see id.), and their claim in this regard otherwise appears to be entirely derivative of \nPlaintiffs’ consultation claims, which the Court has already rejected.  That is, other than \nthe right to consult, Plaintiffs have not assailed any DHS actions pursuant to PACR and \nHARP as a violation of some specified procedural requirement of any of these statutory \nschemes.14  And having already provided a lengthy explanation of both why the law \ndoes not grant asylum seekers any particular right to access counsel during the credible \nfear process, and also why PACR and HARP do not violate the right to consult \ngenerally, the Court cannot conclude that asylum seekers are nevertheless being \n                                                 \n14 Plaintiffs’ briefs do assert that the “inhumane conditions” of CBP confinement deprive asylum \nseekers of “meaningful access” to the protections of the asylum laws, statutory withholding of removal, \nand CAT.  (Pls.’ Mot. at 47.)  But this contention, too, is entirely undeveloped, and Plaintiffs concede \nthat they are not challenging the conditions of confinement.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 13.)  Thus, this Court \nhas not considered any such argument. \n47 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 48 of 60\neffectively denied the right to seek relief under any of these other statutory mechanisms \nas a result of PACR and HARP. \nC.  PACR And HARP Do Not Violate The APA’s Reasoned \nDecisionmaking Requirements \nWith respect to the claim that the detention-placement policies in PACR and \nHARP were promulgated in an arbitrary and capricious fashion in violation of the APA \n(see Compl. ¶¶ 207–08 (Fourth Claim)), Plaintiffs argue, inter alia, that Defendants \nfailed to “provide any reason for their shift to keeping asylum seekers in CBP custody \nthroughout the credible fear process” (Pls.’ Mot. at 23), and did not “acknowledge or \nexplain their departure from keeping asylum seekers in ICE facilities—subject to ICE \nstandards—during that process” (id. at 23–24).  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants also \nignored “the flaws with this plan, namely how it would obliterate asylum seekers’ \nability to adequately prepare for the credible fear process and effectively prohibit them \nfrom meaningfully accessing counsel[.]”  (Id. at 24).  In support of these arguments \nconcerning the alleged unreasonableness of the agency’s decision making, Plaintiffs \noffer evidence outside of the administrative record concerning the conditions of \ndetention in CBP facilities, as well as evidence about the policies and procedures for \nconducting the credible fear process in ICE detention.  (See Index of Exs. \nAccompanying Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 35-4.)  Plaintiffs further maintain that \nthe challenged detention-placement decision “is illogical in light of the evidence in the \n[administrative record]” (Pls.’ Mot. at 24), because “the new policy fundamentally \nmisunderstands the purpose of the credible fear process and makes it meaningless” (id.).   \nThis Court rejects Defendants’ threshold argument that the detention-placement \npolicy is not subject to judicial review under the APA, for the reasons that follow, but \n48 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 49 of 60\nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ arbitrariness claim fails on the merits.  And, notably, the \nCourt reached the latter conclusion without relying on Plaintiffs’ extra-record evidence, \nwhich is not relevant to the legal challenge over administrative action that Plaintiffs are \nbringing in this case. \n1.  PACR And HARP Are Reviewable Under The APA \nDefendants argue that “if [the INA’s] section 1252(e)(3) is what provides \nPlaintiffs’ cause of action, then they cannot separately allege that PACR and HARP are \narbitrary and capricious” under the APA.  (Defs.’ Reply at 25.)  This contention fails to \naccount for the well-established principle that there must be a cause of action for each \nlegal claim that is asserted in a complaint, and as this Court explained in Kiakombua, \n“section 1252(e)(3) creates a cause of action to review the [challenged policy’s] \nconsistency with the INA (as amended) and its implementing regulations[,]” \nKiakombua, 2020 WL 6392824, at *22 n.13, while an entirely different claim—one that \npertains to the alleged unlawfulness of the agency’s decision making process—exists, \nwhere applicable, under the APA, see MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 38–39.   \nIt is certainly true that section 704 of the APA provides a cause of action to \nchallenge only “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” and/or “final agency \naction for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court[,]” 5 U.S.C. § 704, and \nthat, if a statute otherwise “define[s] the specific procedures to be followed in \nreviewing a particular agency’s action[,]” the APA should not be construed to create a \nduplicative cause of action, see Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988) \n(explaining that Congress did not intend the APA to “duplicate existing procedures for \nreview of agency action” or “provide additional judicial remedies in situations where \nthe Congress has provided special and adequate review procedures”).  But the INA \n49 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 50 of 60\nitself creates only a limited cause of action—one that permits a plaintiff to claim that an \nagency’s “written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure” \nconcerning the implementation of the expedited removal scheme “is not consistent with \napplicable provisions of” the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)—and under the \ncircumstances presented here, there is no “clear and convincing evidence” of any \n“legislative intent” to preclude non-duplicative legal claims that would otherwise be \navailable under the APA or any other statute that expressly creates a cause of action, \nsee Garcia v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 519, 523 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  Indeed, section 1252(e)(3) specifically authorizes claims that an \nagency policy directive, guideline, or procedure concerning expedited removal is \n“otherwise in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii); cf. MTRNY II, 962 F.3d \nat 631–34 (holding that APA review of DHS’s designation decision pursuant to \nsection 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) is precluded based on Congress’s expressed intent to \nconfer to the agency “sole and unreviewable discretion” over that determination, but not \nindicating that section 1252(e)(3) itself generally precludes all claims brought under the \nAPA).  Thus, section 1252(e)(3) of the INA appears to make the detention-placement \npolicy in PACR and HARP “reviewable by statute” within the meaning of section 704 \nof the APA, such that the APA’s cause of action to claim unlawful arbitrary decision \nmaking is available to Plaintiffs under the circumstances presented here.  See Lujan v. \nNat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 882 (1990) (suggesting that “[a]gency action made \nreviewable by statute” encompasses when review is sought “pursuant to specific \nauthorization in the substantive statute” rather than “the general review provisions of \nthe APA”); see also MTRNY I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 42 (distinguishing between “a \n50 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 51 of 60\nchallenge to the substantive decision that the agency has made” and a challenge to the \nagency’s “decision making process” (emphasis omitted)).   \nDefendants’ alternative contention that Plaintiffs cannot rely upon the APA \ncause of action because there is no “final” agency action when it comes to PACR and \nHARP (Defs.’ Mot. at 42) also fails, because section 704’s finality requirement is \nplainly met here.  To be final, an agency action (i) “must mark the ‘consummation’ of \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process” such that it is not of “a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature”; and (ii) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations \nhave been determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (citations omitted).  Defendants are correct to \nobserve that PACR and HARP are “pilot program[s]” (Defs.’ Mot. at 42), and that DHS \nagencies will be required to “work together” to assess these policies’ effectiveness, to \n“adjust resources and procedures as necessary[,]” and to evaluate where a noncitizen \nshould be detained based on “resource and space constraints” (id.).  But the D.C. \nCircuit has been clear that “the issuance of a [mere] guideline or guidance may \nconstitute final agency action[,]” Barrick Goldstrike Mines Inc. v. Browner, 215 F.3d \n45, 48 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and there is no question that the “impact” of PACR and HARP \nis “sufficiently direct and immediate” that they “directly affect the parties” in this case, \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796–97 (1992) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  In fact, it is undisputed that the individual Plaintiffs were directly \nand immediately affected by PACR and HARP: they were detained in CBP custody \ninstead of ICE custody, and were subjected to an expedited timeframe of five to seven \ndays for the completion of their credible fear process.  Thus, PACR and HARP \n51 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 52 of 60\nunquestionably qualify as “final agency action” for the purpose of section 704 of the \nAPA. \nTo the extent that Defendants further contend that this Court may not review \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims concerning the detention-placement policy because the PACR \nand HARP programs constitute “agency action” that is “committed to agency discretion \nby law” (Defs.’ Mot. at 42 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2))), the Court is not persuaded \nthat is so.  Because “immigration officers have discretion on whether to place an alien \nin PACR and HARP” as a general matter, there is a sense in which the detention-\nplacement policy is committed to agency discretion within the context of each \napplication.  (Id. at 43.)  But the narrow question that arises under that APA exception \nis whether the “relevant statute” that confers discretion to the agency provides so much \ndiscretion that a court “would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the \nagency’s exercise of discretion.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2568 (2019) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  And \nDefendants have made no argument that the INA itself provides so much discretion to \nDHS concerning the placement of detained noncitizens that PACR and HARP are \nshielded from arbitrary and capricious review.  Cf. MTRNY II, 962 F.3d at 632 (finding \nthat Congress’s grant of authority to the Secretary to designate populations amenable to \nexpedited removal, where “[s]uch designation shall be in the sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion of the [Secretary][,]” fell into the discretionary exception to the APA \n(quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I))).  Therefore, this Court sees no good \nargument for invoking here the exceedingly narrow exception to APA review for agency \nactions that are committed to agency discretion by law. \n52 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 53 of 60\n2.  DHS Did Not Issue PACR And HARP In An Arbitrary And \nCapricious Manner  \nThat said, this Court cannot conclude that Defendants undertook to adopt the \nchallenged detention-placement policy in a manner that violates the APA’s reasoned \ndecision making standards, as Plaintiffs claim.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 23 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)).)  To buttress the contention that PACR and HARP resulted from arbitrary \nand capricious decision making, Plaintiffs point to various alleged deficiencies in \nDHS’s decision making process—they say, for example, that the agency did not \nadequately explain the change in its detention policy (see id. at 24); Defendants failed \nto consider the consequences of detaining asylum seekers in CBP custody rather than \nICE custody (see id. at 24–25), or the particular needs of individuals undergoing the \ncredible fear process (see id. at 28–34); PACR and HARP are inconsistent with the \nrecord evidence (see id. at 36); and these programs are incompatible with the credible \nfear process itself (see id. at 37).  This Court finds that these contentions are not \nsupported by the record for the following reasons, and it concludes, to the contrary, that \nDefendants’ new policies were sufficiently reasoned to meet the procedural \nrequirements of the APA. \nFirst of all, the administrative record amply demonstrates that, when determining \nwhether or not a new protocol for expediting the removal of certain noncitizens should \nbe established, “DHS considered the migration crisis along the southwest border, the \nincrease in asylum claims, and the limited resources of ICE detention.”  (Defs.’ Mot. at \n44 (citing record evidence of the statistical increase in the number of persons entering \nthe United States along the Southwest border, as well as statistics on the number of \npersons seeking asylum).)  In particular, the record reflects that DHS was seeking to \n53 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 54 of 60\n“effectuate removals of amenable aliens” in order to “address the migration crisis along \nthe Southwest Border” (Admin. R. at AR636), and that, because ICE facilities are \nsubject to significant “resource constraints,” the agency determined that “detention in \nan ICE facility” was a “limited tool” for expeditiously processing aliens amenable to \nremoval (id. at AR639).15  The agency also noted that it was “extremely challenging to \ndetain family units in an ICE Family Residential Center” because of “a 2015 judicial \nreinterpretation of” a consent decree (id.), which prohibited ICE from detaining family \nunits for longer than 20 days at facilities that are not licensed under state law (see id. at \nAR212–13). \nIt also appears that PACR was implemented to process the asylum prospects of \nnoncitizens who were subject to the Transit Rule, and that DHS decided that it could do \nso expeditiously, given that such individuals are barred from asylum eligibility and \nmust meet the higher bar for statutory withholding of removal and CAT protections.  \n(See id. at AR640; see also supra note 5.)  DHS also explained that the goal of PACR \nand HARP was to expedite the credible fear process for certain asylum seekers and \nsimultaneously reduce resource constraints at ICE facilities.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 44; see \nalso Admin. R. at AR640 (asserting that CBP and ICE can “leverage cross-component \nfield discretion, flexibility, and coordination to account for local conditions and \navailable resources and infrastructure”), AR641 (noting that the El Paso location where \nPACR was piloted “has a significant volume[,]” and discussing “streamlined \n                                                 \n15 DHS’s invocation of “resource constraints” is somewhat oblique, but apparently refers to the greater \ncost of detaining noncitizens, particularly family units, in ICE detention facilities, and the limited \ncapacity of such facilities.  (See, e.g., Admin. R. at AR14 (noting “record increases in particular types \nof migrants, such as family units, travelling to the border who require significantly more resources to \ndetain and remove”); id. at AR211, AR218 (stating that “ICE has finite resources and bed space at” \nfamily residential centers, which are “more akin to a dormitory setting[,]” including “suites where each \nfamily is housed separately”). \n54 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 55 of 60\nprocedures” for processing noncitizens subject to PACR).)  In this Court’s considered \njudgment, these and other observations are sufficient to demonstrate that DHS \n“examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action \nincluding a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ primary response is that Defendants have nonetheless failed to \n“acknowledge the significance of their shift away from detaining individuals in ICE \ncustody[.]”  (Pls.’ Mot. at 24 (emphasis added).)  In this regard, Plaintiffs insist that \nICE facilities have more favorable practices with respect to detained noncitizens—as if \nit is the ICE procedures from which the agency is now departing (thereby necessitating \nan explanation as to why DHS is no longer providing those processes).  (See id. at 25–\n27.)  But as far as this Court can tell, there has been no change concerning the policies \nand procedures that pertain to persons detained in ICE facilities; instead, as Defendants \nnote, what has changed is the agency’s decision to keep some asylum seekers in CBP \ncustody during an accelerated credible fear review process.  (See Defs.’ Mot. at 46.)  \nAnd, in this Court’s view, DHS has provided a rational explanation for that change, \ngiven the volume of asylum seekers, the agency’s resource needs, and the fact that \ncertain noncitizens are not eligible for positive credible fear determinations under the \nTransit Rule, as explained above.  It is also clear that, to the extent that the memoranda \nthat establish PACR and HARP also provide guidance as to how the credible fear \nprocess will operate under the institutional constraints of CBP facilities, those appear to \nbe entirely new policies—CBP did not previously have any policies with respect to \n55 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 56 of 60\ncredible fear interviewees detained in their facilities—so there is no argument that, with \nrespect to these policies, Defendants have departed from prior policies without a \nsufficiently reasoned explanation.   \nThus, when the policy at issue is identified properly, it appears that what \nDefendants have said about the perceived need to detain certain noncitizens in CBP \ncustody, when such persons were previously placed in ICE detention facilities, is \nsufficient to demonstrate the agency’s “awareness that it is changing position[,]” which \nis the minimum that reasoned decision making requires.  F.C.C. v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  Furthermore, the impact of the changed \ndetention-placement policy on the noncitizens who are placed in the PACR and HARP \nprograms is self-evident under the circumstances presented here—i.e., the agency \nrationally concluded that detaining certain noncitizens in CBP custody would mean that \nfewer procedural protections would have to be provided, which, in turn, would result in \nthe faster processing of noncitizens who are slated for expedited removal in the context \nof a resource-constrained immigration system.  (See Admin. R. at AR639–40.)  The \nagency nevertheless specifically acknowledged that asylum seekers must be provided \nboth an opportunity to consult with a person of their choosing and a list of attorneys to \ncontact, and it explained that noncitizens in CBP custody would have access to \ntelephones for that purpose (see Admin. R. at AR641, AR645).  And, unlike prior cases \nin which agencies were found to have engaged in arbitrary decision making, there is no \nevidence here that shifting away from the prior policy of detaining such individuals in a \nfacility that provided more and better access to counsel “engendered serious reliance \n56 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 57 of 60\ninterests[,]” Fox Television, 556 U.S. at 515, at least as far as asylum seekers who are \nslated for expedited removal are concerned. \nThus, this Court cannot find that Defendants failed to consider the relevant \nconsequences of the detention-placement policy when it promulgated PACR and HARP.  \n(See Pls.’ Mot. at 24–27.)  To the contrary, it appears that more efficient processing of \ncertain noncitizens who are subject to expedited removal was the entire goal of the \nchallenged policy, and the agency not only fully articulated that goal, but its objective \nwas consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, as explained in \nPart III.B.3, supra.  Consequently, PACR and HARP’s detention-placement policy \ncannot be deemed arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.16 \nD.  PACR And HARP Do Not Violate Any Due Process Rights Of These \nParticular Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs’ final claim is that PACR and HARP violate noncitizens’ “Fifth \nAmendment procedural due process right to petition the government” for asylum, \nstatutory withholding, and CAT protection.  (Pls.’ Mot. at 47 (quoting Maldonado-\nPerez v. I.N.S., 865 F.2d 328, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1989)); see also Compl. ¶¶ 210–13 (Sixth \nClaim).)  Claims of constitutional violations have a cause of action that derives directly \nfrom the Constitution itself, see McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 539 F.3d \n                                                 \n16 The Court has reached this conclusion without relying on the extra-record evidence that Plaintiffs \nhave submitted concerning the policies and procedures for conducting the credible fear process in ICE \ndetention, and the conditions of confinement in ICE detention. (See, e.g., Exs. A–R to Pls.’ Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj., ECF Nos. 21-2–21-21; Exs. A–C to Pls.’ Mot. for Leave to File Under Seal, ECF Nos. 22-\n1–22-3; Exs. S–W to Pls.’ Mot. for Summ. J., ECF Nos. 35-5–35-9).)  As the above discussion \ndemonstrates, the detention policies and procedures applicable to ICE facilities are not themselves \nrelevant to this Court’s determination of whether PACR and HARP’s decision to place noncitizens in \nCBP custody was the product of arbitrary and capricious decision making, and “it is black-letter \nadministrative law that in an APA case, a reviewing court should have before it neither more nor less \ninformation than did the agency when it made its decision.”  Cf. Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. v. F.D.A., \n709 F.3d 44, 47 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n57 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 58 of 60\n485, 490 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (“Inferring a cause of action from the Constitution squares \nwith the ‘presum[ption] that justiciable constitutional rights are to be enforced through \nthe courts.’” (citation omitted)), but such a cause of action is not always fully available \nto every claimant.  As relevant here, the Supreme Court recently clarified that, for a \nnoncitizen who is undergoing the credible fear process and has not yet “effected an \nentry” within the territory of the United States, “the Due Process Clause provides \nnothing more” than the right, provided under section 1225(b) of the INA, to a \n“‘determination’ [of] whether he had ‘a significant possibility’ of ‘establishing \neligibility for asylum[.]’”  Thuraissigiam, 140 S. Ct. at 1982–83 (original alterations \nincorporated) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), (v)).  In Thuraissigiam, the Court \nfurther held that—regardless of whether a noncitizen is “detained shortly after unlawful \nentry” (for example, “25 yards into U.S. territory”), or is detained “at a port of entry” \nsuch as an international airport (which is, technically, U.S. soil), or is first detained at \nthe border and then paroled into the country pending removal—noncitizens who have \nnot “effected an entry” into the United States are only entitled to the process that \nCongress has afforded them by statute.  Id.; see also id. at 1982 (citing numerous \nprecedents for the proposition that, for aliens seeking entry, due process is what \nCongress provides, such as Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 660 (1892), United \nStates ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950), Shaughnessy v. United \nStates ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953), and Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, \n32 (1982)).  \nThis means that the only process that was due to the individual Plaintiffs in this \ncase under the Constitution was the process that Congress has afforded by statute.  And \n58 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 59 of 60\nthat contention brings us back to Plaintiffs’ primary claim that PACR and HARP \nprevent an asylum seeker from meaningful access to counsel in violation of the INA and \nsimilar statutes.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 50.)  But this Court has already found that PACR \nand HARP conform with the statutory requirement that asylum seekers have the right to \nconsult, and that Defendants did not unlawfully deprive these Plaintiffs of the requisite \nevaluation process by detaining them in a facility with limited access to counsel.  (See \nsupra Parts III.B.2–4.)  Accordingly, PACR and HARP do not violate the Fifth \nAmendment rights of the individual Plaintiffs in the instant case (each of whom was \ndetained upon arrival pending a credible fear assessment pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)).17 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThis Court has reviewed the record and the declarations of the individual \nPlaintiffs, and is cognizant of the hardships that certain noncitizens who arrive at the \nsouthern border seeking asylum face.  But Plaintiffs’ arguments about the detention-\nplacement policy that DHS has adopted cannot be squared with the manifest purpose of \nthe expedited removal scheme, which is to authorize the agency that administers the \nfederal government’s immigration laws to make efficient distinctions between \nnoncitizens who have potentially meritorious claims to protection and those who do not.  \nCongress has also given considerable discretion to DHS to implement the expedited \nremoval process, and the fact that DHS previously afforded asylum seekers greater \n                                                 \n17 The organizational Plaintiff, Las Americas, concedes that it does not have “direct organizational \nstanding” to assert a Fifth Amendment due process claim.  (See Pls.’ Mot. at 48 n.9); see also Am. \nImmigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno, 199 F.3d 1352, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“[P]laintiff organizations do not \nhave standing to raise claims, whether statutory or constitutional, on behalf of aliens subjected to \nIIRIRA’s expedited removal system.”). \n59 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 11/30/20   Page 60 of 60\naccess to counsel than the law requires does not demonstrate that it is unlawful for the \nagency to scale back such practices in a resource-constrained environment and in the \ncontext of a congressional determination that expeditious removal of certain noncitizens \nis warranted.  Thus, as explained herein, this Court cannot find that the detention-\nplacement policy of the PACR and HARP programs is inconsistent with statutory, \nregulatory, or constitutional requirements, or that it was adopted in an arbitrary and \ncapricious manner in violation of the APA.  Accordingly, as set forth in the \naccompanying Order, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 35) will be \nDENIED, and Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 49) will be \nGRANTED. \n \nDATE:  November 30, 2020    Ketanji Brown Jackson \nKETANJI BROWN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n60 ",

Customs  and  Border  Protection  (“CBP”)  facilities  are  legal  black  holes.  This  case \nchallenges the federal government’s drastic change in policy to—for the first time—detain asylum \nseekers effectively incommunicado and in appalling conditions in those facilities throughout their \nasylum screening process, without any opportunity to meet in person, or even by telephone, with \nan attorney to obtain the assistance to which they are entitled by law. \n2. Congress  has  mandated  that  asylum  seekers,  including  those  subject  to  “expedited \nremoval” proceedings, have the opportunity to access and confer with counsel and third parties \nwhile they prepare for an initial screening for asylum and other protection from removal and for a \nreview of that screening determination by an immigration judge.  These screenings, known as \n“credible fear interviews,” are the critical first step for many asylum seekers because they \ndetermine  whether  these  individuals  and  families  may  pursue  a  claim  for  asylum  or  other \nprotection or, instead, will be summarily sent back to the countries they are fleeing. \n3. Defendants’ new programs effectively deny all access to counsel and third parties, and \ntherefore, all but guarantee that many asylum seekers will be erroneously sent back to countries \nwhere they face danger and that, as a result, some of them will be killed or endure horrific violence. \nThis case seeks to ensure that those fleeing persecution and torture in their home countries have a \nfair opportunity to apply for asylum and other protection in the United States. \n4. Prior to either October 7 or 8, 2019, noncitizens in expedited removal proceedings who \nexpressed a fear of removal were transferred from CBP detention to Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) detention centers before their credible fear screenings. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 4 of 36\n5. Defendants are now implementing what they have termed the Prompt Asylum Claim \nReview program (“PACR”) and the Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (“HARP”).1  Under \nPACR, asylum seekers from countries other than Mexico who are in credible fear proceedings are \nkept in CBP facilities instead of being transferred to ICE detention centers. HARP applies the same \npolicy as PACR to Mexican asylum seekers in credible fear proceedings. \n6. This change, from Defendants transferring asylum seekers to ICE custody for credible fear \nscreenings to keeping them in CBP custody, is pivotal. In ICE custody, these asylum seekers were \nafforded more time and opportunity to contact counsel2 or prospective counsel or others to aid \nthem in their credible fear proceedings. They could also meet with attorneys, both in person and \ntelephonically, prior to the credible fear interview with an asylum officer and again prior to an \nimmigration judge’s review of any negative credible fear determination. \n7. CBP allows none of this to meaningfully occur for those in its custody, and CBP facilities \nare not set up to facilitate such access. CBP facilities do not afford in-person or telephonic access \nto counsel or, in fact, any meaningful communication with the outside world. CBP, unlike ICE, \nprovides no system to locate people in its custody. Its facilities were designed for short-term \ndetention and not for asylum seekers going through a credible fear process. \n8. Under PACR and HARP, an asylum seeker in CBP custody is given only one window of \napproximately 30 minutes to one hour to call family members or retained counsel, or to call \nprospective attorneys from a limited list provided by CBP. There is no callback number or other \n \n1 Defendants have also referred to the PACR program as the Prompt Asylum Screening Review \nprogram or “PASR.” \n2 Individuals in expedited removal may have been able to retain counsel because they did so \nprior to crossing into the United States; because their family members retained counsel on their \nbehalf; because they retained counsel while in ICE custody; or through other means.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 5 of 36\nmeans by which lawyers may attempt to reach clients or prospective clients. The result is that it is \nfunctionally impossible for an asylum seeker in one of these programs to contact an attorney. \n9. Even when an asylum seeker does manage to contact an attorney, PACR and HARP ensure \nthat the asylum seeker does not have a meaningful opportunity to consult with that attorney. CBP \ndenies attorneys physical access to its facilities, precluding all in-person meetings. CBP also does \nnot provide for any regular telephonic access and provides no guarantee that the consultation will \nbe confidential. \n10. Even when CBP has been aware that an attorney is attempting to reach an individual prior \nto their interview or hearing before an immigration judge, CBP has forced that individual to \nproceed with their credible fear interview or hearing without any opportunity to consult with that \nattorney. \n11. Consequently, under PACR and HARP, asylum seekers functionally have no opportunity \nto access counsel or prospective counsel or other individuals during their credible fear screening \nas mandated by Congress. Moreover, the terrible conditions of confinement in CBP facilities \n(known as “hieleras”—Spanish for “ice boxes”—due to their freezing temperatures) hinder asylum \nseekers’ ability to meaningfully participate in their credible fear proceedings. \n12. Defendants have to date implemented PACR and HARP in CBP’s El Paso sector. As of \nNovember 26, 2019, 392 asylum cases had been processed through PACR. As of November 27, \n2019, the government had placed at least 137 asylum seekers in HARP. \n13. CBP has stated its intent to expand PACR and HARP to other parts of the border. \n14. PACR and HARP systematically undermine the procedural safeguards guaranteed to those \nseeking asylum by rocketing asylum seekers through the credible fear process with no access to \ncounsel. Congress provided for protections for people in credible fear proceedings in order to \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 6 of 36\nprevent the United States government from erroneously sending asylum seekers back to places \nwhere they face persecution, torture, and possibly death. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). Jurisdiction is also proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1361 and 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702 and 706.  \n16. Venue is proper in the District of the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause Defendants are officers and employees of the United States, at least one defendant resides \nin the district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims alleged \nherein occurred in this district. Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district. Finally, \nvenue is proper here because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) requires that all § 1252(e)(3) actions be brought \nin this district. \nPARTIES \n17. Plaintiff Las Americas Immigration Advocacy Center (“Las Americas”) is a nonprofit \norganization based in El Paso, Texas that provides free and low-cost direct legal services to \nnoncitizens, including asylum seekers, in West Texas and New Mexico. Its mission includes \nproviding consultation and legal services to noncitizens detained by the federal government in the \nEl Paso area, including by representing individuals through the credible fear interview process \nthrough a staff of four attorneys and three legal assistants. Las Americas has expended significant \nresources attempting to locate and represent individuals in the PACR and HARP programs. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 7 of 36\n18.

U.S. Immigration Law’s Protections for Individuals Fleeing Threatened Harm \n29. Under U.S. law, every noncitizen “who is physically present in the United States or who \narrives in the United States” has the right to apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n30. Individuals are eligible for asylum if they experienced past persecution or have a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion” and if they are “unable or unwilling to return to, and \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 9 of 36\n. . . unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of” their country of origin \nbecause of that persecution or fear. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). \n31. U.S. law also protects noncitizens who are not eligible for asylum but nevertheless face \npotential severe harm if they are returned to their home countries. The U.S. government cannot \nreturn individuals to a country where it is more likely than not that their “life or freedom would be \nthreatened . . . because of [their] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, \nor political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A) (“statutory withholding of removal”).  \n32. The government also cannot remove individuals to a country where they are more likely \nthan not to be tortured. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.19 (regulations implementing the United \nStates’ obligations under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”)). \n33. “Asylum  seekers,”  as  used  in  this  complaint,  refers  to  individuals  who  are  seeking \nprotection from removal to their home country based on the dangers they would face there. These \nindividuals may be eligible for asylum, entitled to statutory withholding of removal, and/or entitled \nto withholding or deferral of removal pursuant to CAT. \nII.  The Expedited Removal System \n34. Ordinarily, people whom the executive branch seeks to remove from the United States are \nplaced in immigration removal proceedings under Section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (“INA”) (8 U.S.C. § 1229a). In these proceedings, they have a full hearing on the merits of \ntheir case before an immigration judge. During proceedings under § 1229a, an individual generally \nhas a meaningful opportunity to develop claims for asylum or other forms of relief. \n35. Removal proceedings under § 1229a provide for multiple layers of review. Following a \nhearing before an immigration judge, a person can appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 10 of 36\n(“BIA”). A noncitizen who receives an adverse ruling from the BIA can then file a petition for \nreview in a federal court of appeals. \n36. In 1996, as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, \nCongress created a highly truncated removal process called “expedited removal” for certain \nnoncitizens who present at a port of entry or who have recently entered the country without \ninspection.  The  expedited  removal  process  is  an  alternative  to  full  immigration  removal \nproceedings under § 1229a. People placed in expedited removal will not go through full removal \nproceedings unless they are taken out of the expedited removal track. Those subject to expedited \nremoval are ordered removed by an immigration officer “without further hearing or review.” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I). \n37. Since the expedited removal process lacks many of the procedural protections of full \nremoval proceedings, Congress sought to ensure that those who may have valid claims to asylum \nor other protection will not be erroneously removed. \n38. Consequently, individuals in expedited removal who indicate a fear of return to their \ncountry of origin, or an intent to apply for asylum, must be referred for an interview with an asylum \nofficer.  The asylum officer then makes a determination whether the person has a credible fear—\nthat is, whether there is “a significant possibility . . . that the alien could establish eligibility for”: \n(1) asylum; (2) for withholding under § 1231(b)(3); or (3) for relief from removal under CAT. 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.42(d)(1). \n39. Individuals who are found to have a credible or reasonable fear that could make them \neligible for protection must be taken out of expedited removal and placed into full immigration \nremoval proceedings under § 1229a. They will accordingly have the opportunity to fully develop \na case for asylum or relief from removal under the ordinary structure of immigration proceedings. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 11 of 36\n40. If the person receives a negative credible fear determination at the interview stage, the \nasylum officer must “provide . . . a written notice of decision” and ask whether the individual \nwants review of the negative determination by an immigration judge.3 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1); id. \n§ 1208.30(g)(2)(ii). Unless the individual affirmatively waives review by an immigration judge, \nthe agency must provide for such review. Id. § 1208.30(g)(2)(i). \n41. If the immigration judge vacates the negative determination, the individual will then be \nplaced into ordinary removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, just as they would have been if \nthe asylum officer had made a positive determination. If the immigration judge upholds the \nnegative  determination,  the  individual  will  be  removed  without  further  legal  process.  The \nimmigration judge’s decision on review is administratively “final and may not be appealed.” 8 \nC.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A).4 \n42. Consistent with Congress’s concern for preventing noncitizens’ erroneous removal to \nplaces where they may face harm, the threshold for a noncitizen to successfully establish a credible \nfear in expedited removal proceedings is much lower than the threshold to establish eligibility for \nactual asylum or entitlement to other protection in full removal proceedings. The “significant \npossibility” of eligibility for relief that a person must establish at a credible fear interview is a \nfraction of the chance of persecution or torture that they must ultimately establish to prevail.5 \n \n3 Immigration judges and immigration courts are under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review, which is overseen and administered by Defendant Attorney General \nBarr. \n4 USCIS may, but need not, reconsider a negative credible fear finding that has been affirmed by \nan immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A). The immigration judge’s decision is \nconsidered by the Executive Branch not to be subject to judicial review.  \n5 Under regulatory provisions that are the subject of ongoing litigation, individuals are \ndetermined ineligible for asylum if they have transited through another country en route to the \nUnited States without first seeking asylum in that other country, absent certain exceptions. See E. \nBay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 19-16487 (9th Cir.); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(4). Nevertheless, \nsuch individuals will be placed in full immigration proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a on \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 12 of 36\n43. The credible fear process is a critical phase in determining who ought to be placed in full \nremoval proceedings under § 1229a and given the opportunity to build a full case showing that \nthey merit asylum or other protection, rather than be issued an expedited removal order. \nIII.  Access to Counsel in the Expedited Removal System’s Credible Fear Process \n44. In furtherance of Congress’s intent to ensure that individuals in expedited removal \nproceedings are afforded a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum, withholding from removal, or \nprotection under CAT, Congress has provided for access to and consultation with counsel and \nothers prior to both the credible fear interview and the immigration judge’s review of that \ninterview for those in expedited removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) (providing \nthat a noncitizen “may consult with a person or persons of [their] choosing prior to the interview \nor any review thereof”). \n45. During the credible fear interview itself, federal regulation also provides for the presence \nof an individual consulted—which includes an attorney. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) (“Any person or \npersons with whom the alien chooses to consult may be present at the interview . . . .”). The \nattorney or other consulted individual “may be permitted, in the discretion of the asylum officer, \nto present a statement at the end of the interview.” Id. \n \na showing of a “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture during their initial screening with an \nasylum officer. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(iii). Showing a reasonable fear of persecution or torture \nrequires establishing a “reasonable possibility” of eligibility for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c). This \n“reasonable possibility” standard is the same as the standard required for establishing “a well-\nfounded fear of persecution” for asylum—at least as low as a one-in-ten chance. See I.N.S. v. \nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(i)(B). It therefore remains \na fraction of a chance of establishing ultimate eligibility for relief, far below the 50.1% chance \nnecessary to ultimately gain relief from removal under statutory withholding or CAT. \nImplementation of similar regulatory provisions that would apply to individuals who have \ncrossed the border at a place other than a port of entry is likewise the subject of ongoing \nlitigation and is currently preliminarily enjoined. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(ii); E. Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1121 (N.D. Cal. 2018); stay pending appeal denied, \n932 F.3d 742, 780 (9th Cir. 2018). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 13 of 36\n46. Further, an individual “[i]n any removal proceedings before an immigration judge” has a \nright to representation by counsel at no expense to the government. 8 U.S.C. § 1362. Moreover, \n“[a] person compelled to appear in person before an agency or representative thereof” has the \nright “to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n47. Fundamentally, individuals seeking asylum have a constitutionally protected interest \nunder the Fifth Amendment in applying to the U.S. government for asylum, withholding of \nremoval, and/or relief under CAT, and therefore are entitled to procedural due process in their \nproceedings on those claims. See, e.g., Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, 676 F.2d 1023, 1037-38 \n(5th Cir. 1982); Maldonado-Perez v. I.N.S., 865 F.2d 328, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Asylum seekers \nalso have constitutionally protected interests in avoiding persecution, torture, and death. \n48. Because neither the right to apply for asylum and other protections from removal nor the \nright of access to counsel is an empty formality, noncitizens must have the opportunity to \nmeaningfully effectuate them. They must have a reasonable opportunity to retain and work with \ncounsel in their removal proceedings. And they must have a meaningful opportunity to apply for \nasylum and other protections from removal, consistent with the procedures established by \nCongress. \n49. Accordingly, the government may not create obstacles to access to counsel, the \ncumulative effect of which is to prevent access. It also may not interfere with established \nattorney-client relationships. And for those in its custody, the government must put in place \npolicies and practices that ensure these individuals may meaningfully effectuate their right to \naccess counsel. Similarly, the government may not create numerous obstacles, the cumulative \neffect of which is to prevent meaningful access to the process of applying for asylum or other \nprotections from removal. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 14 of 36\n \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nI.  Before PACR and HARP, Individuals Were Transferred from CBP Custody to ICE \n  Custody for Credible Fear Proceedings in Expedited Removal, Where They Could \n  Access Counsel. \n \n50. People who present themselves at a port of entry without proper documentation or who are \napprehended at or near the southern border are supposed to be placed in CBP custody only for \ninitial processing and for a short period of time (less than 72 hours).  CBP’s National Standards \non Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (“TEDS”) specify that “Detainees should generally \nnot be held for longer than 72 hours in CBP hold rooms or holding facilities,” and “every effort \nmust be made to hold detainees for the least amount of time required.”6   \n51. Before the implementation of the PACR and HARP programs, members of this group who \nwere placed in expedited removal and expressed a fear of return to their country of origin were \nthen transferred from CBP detention to an ICE detention facility for their credible fear proceedings. \n52. At the ICE detention facility following transfer, these individuals had greater time and \nopportunity to access counsel. They could contact counsel or prospective counsel telephonically \nand also meet with counsel or prospective counsel in person. They also could contact family \nmembers or others by phone. \n53. The credible fear interview did not occur until after a specific period of time—prior to July \n2019, at least 48 hours, and starting in July 2019, at least one full calendar day—in ICE custody.7 \n \n6 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search, U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, (Oct. 2015) 14, available at \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-\nSep/CBP%20TEDS%20Policy%20Oct2015.pdf. \n7 The policy change from a 48-hour waiting period to one calendar day is currently the subject of \nlitigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the caption, L.M.-M v. \nCuccinelli, No. 1:19-cv-2676 (RDM).  Plaintiff agrees that one calendar day is not a sufficient \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 15 of 36\nThis time gave individuals some opportunity to contact counsel, family members, or others and \nalso to recuperate from their journeys. \nII.  PACR and HARP Now Require that Credible Fear Proceedings Be Conducted \nWhile in CBP Custody, Where Asylum Seekers Cannot Access Counsel. \n \n54. On or after October 7, 2019, DHS and DOJ began implementing PACR—a new expedited \nremoval program, established by written policy directives, guidelines, and procedures. Also in \nOctober 2019, subsequent to initial implementation of the PACR program, DHS and DOJ began \nimplementing  HARP,  a  similar  expedited  removal  program  established  by  written  policy \ndirectives, guidelines, and procedures. PACR and HARP are the same, except that HARP applies \nto Mexican nationals seeking asylum in the United States while PACR applies to nationals from \nother countries.8 \n55. Currently, DHS and DOJ have implemented PACR and HARP as pilot programs in CBP’s \nEl Paso sector.  Individuals and families whom DHS has apprehended in or near the El Paso area \nor who have arrived and presented at a port of entry in the El Paso area are eligible to be placed in \nPACR or HARP. \n56. PACR and HARP drastically change the credible fear process by requiring that asylum \nseekers go through the entirety of their credible fear proceedings—including the credible fear \ninterview and any review by an immigration judge—while in CBP detention, without any transfer \nto an ICE detention facility. \n \ntime period to prepare for a credible fear interview, even in ICE detention, but that policy change \nis not at issue here.  \n8 Although Defendants have labeled PACR and HARP as separate programs, there appears to be \nno meaningful difference between the two, except for the nationality of the asylum seekers \nsubject to each program.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 16 of 36\n57. PACR and HARP also seek to conduct credible fear interviews within 24 hours, and any \nfurther review within 10 days.  \n58. CBP facilities are designed for “short-term” detention. Unlike those held in ICE detention \ncenters, individuals detained in CBP facilities have essentially no opportunity to communicate \nwith the outside world. \n59. PACR and HARP create major obstacles to asylum seekers accessing the process of \napplying for protection in the United States. \nIII.  PACR and HARP Effectively Deny Those in Credible Fear Proceedings Meaningful \n  Access to Counsel. \n \n60. PACR and HARP’s policy change to mandate that the credible fear process occur entirely \nwhile an individual is detained in CBP facilities, not ICE detention facilities, effectively denies \nasylum seekers the opportunity to meaningfully access counsel and prevents asylum seekers from \ncommunicating with anyone else in the outside world, including people with whom they might \nconsult regarding the credible fear interview. They also force asylum seekers to remain in crowded, \nunsanitary, and inhospitable conditions of confinement that are unconducive to meaningfully \nparticipating in a credible fear interview or other aspects of the credible fear process. \n  A.  While ICE detention facilities provide for access to counsel, CBP facilities do  \n    not. \n \n61. At ICE detention facilities, ICE standards require that the agency provide those in credible \nfear proceedings the opportunity to access counsel confidentially, both telephonically and in \nperson. ICE detention centers generally provide telephones for access to legal representation and \nmeeting spaces for attorneys to meet with clients and prospective clients.  \n62. ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) specifically require \nthat those in expedited removal proceedings shall have the opportunity to telephonically contact \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 17 of 36\nboth counsel and prospective counsel. PBNDS 5.6(V)(E) (providing that ICE detention centers \n“shall” grant “[f]ull telephone access” in order for a detainee to contact “legal representatives”; \n“to obtain legal representation”; to access “legal services providers or organizations” on the \nprovided list; and, specifically, “for consultation when subject to expedited removal” and requiring \nthat “when a detainee is under an expedited removal order, his/her ability to contact pro bono \nlegal representatives shall not be restricted” (emphasis added)). The PBNDS also bar “limit[ing] \na detainee’s attempt to obtain legal representation,” beyond “reasonable restrictions” on call hours, \ntime, and frequency. Id. 5.6(V)(F)(1); see also id. 5.6(II)(7) (“Detainees shall be able to make free \ncalls to the ICE/ERO-provided list of free legal services providers for the purpose of obtaining \ninitial legal representation.”). \n63. The PBNDS also require ICE detention facilities to provide in-person attorney access. \nAttorneys must have physical access to ICE facilities, every single day, for at least eight hours a \nday during the work week and four hours a day on weekends and holidays. PBNDS 5.7(J)(2). The \nPBNDS  requires  that  “each  detainee  may  meet  privately  with  current  or  prospective  legal \nrepresentatives and their legal assistants.” Id. 5.7(J)(1). \n64. CBP facilities, by contrast, provide no meaningful opportunity to access counsel either \ntelephonically or in person—whether confidentially or otherwise. Those detained in CBP custody \nare held essentially incommunicado, with no meaningful opportunity to communicate with the \noutside world.  \n65. CBP categorically denies attorneys in-person meetings with clients or prospective clients.  \nCBP asserts that its facilities are not designed to allow attorneys to meet in person with detained \nnoncitizens. CBP facilities do not have confidential attorney-client meeting areas, nor do they have \nany space dedicated to in-person visitation by attorneys or others.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 18 of 36\n66. Moreover, unlike for those in ICE custody, there is no way for attorneys to easily verify \nwhether a client or prospective client is in CBP custody and, if so, where that individual is located. \nFor ICE detainees, an attorney or other interested person may use ICE’s Online Detainee Locator \nSystem to look up an individual’s location of detention using the individual’s name, country of \nbirth, and birthdate or alternatively name and A-number.9 There is no such system for CBP \ndetainees. \n67. CBP’s national standards, unlike ICE’s, contain no provisions guaranteeing telephonic or \nin-person communication with attorneys or others in the outside world. \n  B.  Asylum seekers in PACR and HARP cannot meaningfully access counsel or  \n    otherwise communicate with the outside world. \n \n68. Individuals subject to PACR and HARP are provided with effectively no telephonic \ncommunication with the outside world. Once a credible fear interview is scheduled, individuals \nare provided a single window of approximately 30 minutes to one hour in which to attempt to \nreach a family member or attorney by telephone. \n69. Even for an asylum seeker able to reach an attorney by telephone, this single window is \ninsufficient for meaningful communication and consultation with counsel during the credible fear \nprocess. \n70. During the time in which asylum seekers may use the telephone, the conversation is not \nconfidential. Agents monitor phone calls by standing within earshot outside the door. \n71. Critically, there is no opportunity for asylum seekers to leave a call-back number or \notherwise provide for their call to be returned. If an asylum seeker in the PACR or HARP program \n \n9 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Online Detainee Locator System, \nhttps://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/index.  An A-number is a unique registration number issued by \nUSCIS to many noncitizens.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 19 of 36\ncannot reach a particular person or entity—or anyone at all—during the time frame provided for \ncalls, they have no other opportunity to do so. \n72. Like all CBP facilities, Border Patrol Station 1 in El Paso does not permit detainees to \nreceive any visitors. There is therefore no opportunity for asylum seekers in the PACR and HARP \nprograms to meet in person with anyone prior to or during their credible fear proceedings. \n73. As described below, Las Americas has been functionally unable to communicate with \nindividuals in CBP detention with whom it wishes to consult and for whom it may wish to serve \nas counsel. \n74. Moreover, the list of attorneys that detainees in the PACR and HARP programs have \nreceived is independently insufficient for any meaningful communication or consultation with \nprospective counsel. Detainees have called the list they are provided “the list of ghosts” because \nof their inability to contact any person by calling the number on the list. Although Las Americas \nis on the ordinary list of free and low-fee attorneys provided by ICE to those with pending credible \nfear proceedings, it is not receiving calls from individuals in PACR and HARP based on the list \nthat CBP provides.  Other legal services providers report similar experiences. \n75. Those detained in CBP facilities also generally lack the ability to communicate with family \nor friends. Frequently, the loved ones of CBP detainees do not know where they are or even that \nthey have been detained. CBP has said that, for those in its custody, it has “no obligation to notify \nfamily or counsel.”10 For PACR and HARP, the only exception to this rule is the single brief \nwindow during which asylum seekers may make outside calls—and hope those whom they call \nanswer the phone.  \n \n10 Max Rivlin-Nadler, Asylum-Seeker Held Incommunicado for Three Weeks by Border Patrol, \nKPBS, Nov. 26, 2019, https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/nov/26/asylum-seeker-held-\nincommunicado-three-weeks-borde/ (quoting CBP statement). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 20 of 36\n76. Accordingly, asylum seekers in PACR and HARP are unable to meaningfully access \ncounsel or anyone else with whom they may wish to consult, despite express statutory and \nregulatory right to do so. \nC.  Access to counsel is critically important in the credible fear process. \n \n77. Access to counsel is a critical protection for those in credible fear proceedings.  \n78. The interview and review can often require a detailed explanation from asylum seekers \nabout extremely traumatic events and implicate complex legal determinations. \n79. Asylum seekers have often traveled long distances and with children. They are frequently \naffected by mental health issues present in those fleeing violence, as well as by exhaustion and \nnumerous other physical health challenges.  At the same time, they are expected to immediately \ndefend their rights during accelerated removal proceedings in which their lives and futures—and \nthose of their children—are at stake. \n80. The vast majority of asylum seekers are fleeing serious violence or threats of serious \nviolence or death. An attorney can assist an asylum seeker in preparing for their interview or \nreview. \n81. The ability to confidentially consult with a lawyer prior to the interview and review allows \nthe asylum seeker to be better prepared to present all relevant information. \n82. Attorneys are able to elicit information about why clients left their home countries and why \nthey are afraid to return and to help determine whether a client’s child may have separate or \nadditional claims.  Attorneys can also assist clients in presenting their full stories in chronological \norder and fully explaining why they are going to be harmed if they are returned. \n83. Attorneys are also able to advise clients about the interview process, including that clients \ncan ask for a question to be repeated or clarified, can advise that the interpreter is inadequate, and \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 21 of 36\ncan say they do not know the answer to a question.  Attorneys can also inform clients that their \ntestimony will be recorded. This knowledge is especially critical for individuals who will need to \nbe prepared to recount traumatic experiences during their interview. \n84. Further, an attorney may review documents or evidence in person and help clients prepare \nto present corroborating evidence of their claims. \n85. Meaningful and confidential communication with an attorney assists an asylum seeker in \npresenting all of the relevant information concerning their personal and traumatic experiences and \nin ensuring they understand the standard under which their fear will be judged, whether they may \nvolunteer additional information, and what information may be relevant to volunteer. \n86. The presence of the asylum seeker’s attorney during the credible fear interview is also \nnecessary for the attorney to understand what occurred during the interview and to best prepare \ntheir client for the immigration judge’s review of any adverse determination by an asylum officer. \n87. In an asylum seeker’s preparation for review of a negative credible fear determination by \nan immigration judge, an attorney is able to help evaluate why the credible fear interview was \nunsuccessful, better develop the asylum seeker’s claims, and prepare for the hearing before the \nimmigration judge. \n88. Case outcomes demonstrate that attorney access is essential for noncitizens in immigration \nproceedings. Detained noncitizens with representation in immigration proceedings are more than \ntwice as likely to receive relief from removal as those without representation.11 \n89. Attorney access has been particularly critical for asylum seekers in expedited removal. In \n2014, advocates established a pro bono attorney project at a remote detention center in Artesia, \n \n11 Ingrid V. Eagly & Steven Shafer, A National Study of Access to Counsel in Immigration \nCourt, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 51 (2015). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 22 of 36\nNew Mexico, which held Central American mothers and children seeking asylum and in expedited \nremoval proceedings. After one month, removals decreased by 80%, and within two months, \nremovals had decreased by 97%.12 Likewise, a pro bono project at a detention center for families \nin expedited removal proceedings had, as of 2018, secured relief from expedited removal for more \nthan 99.9% of those represented.13 And in 2018, after asylum seekers held incommunicado at a \nfederal prison pending their credible fear interviews secured access to counsel via court order, all \n74 represented between the issuance of the temporary restraining order and the issuance of the \npreliminary injunction were determined to have a credible or reasonable fear of persecution. \nInnovation Law Lab v. Nielsen, 342 F. Supp. 3d 1067, 1073-75 (D. Or. 2018). \nIV.  PACR and HARP Require Asylum Seekers to Remain in Conditions of Confinement \n  Incompatible with a Meaningful Credible Fear Interview. \n \n90. CBP’s facilities are commonly called hieleras for their freezing temperatures and are \nnotoriously inhumane.  \n91. These facilities were designed for “short term” detention and not to hold people through \nthe full duration of credible fear proceedings.   \n92. Individuals are often detained in small, concrete cells with concrete or metal benches. \nCBP’s internal guidance states that the cells are neither designed nor equipped for overnight \nsleeping. It specifies that such cells shall have “no beds.”14 \n93. In many CBP facilities, including Border Patrol Station 1, the lights are left on all night.  \n \n12 Innovation Law Lab, The Artesia Report, https://innovationlawlab.org/the-artesia-report/the-\nartesia-report/. \n13 Kari E. Hong and Stephen Manning, Getting it Righted: Access to Counsel in Rapid Removals, \n101 Marquette L. Rev. 673, 699-700 (2018). \n14 See U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Office of Internal Affairs Security Management Division, \nCBP Security Policy and Procedures Handbook, HB1400-02B (2009), 494, available at \nhttps://info.publicintelligence.net/CBPSecurityHandbook.pdf (“No beds; a hold room is not \ndesigned for sleeping.”). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 23 of 36\n94. CBP holding facilities do not include regular access to basic hygiene, including showers \nand the means for detainees to brush their teeth.  \n95. A May 2019 report by DHS’s own inspector general detailed extreme overcrowding and \nhorrible conditions of confinement at a CBP holding facilities in the El Paso area, including \ndetaining single adults in standing-room-only conditions for a week and holding approximately \n900 detainees at a facility with a capacity of 125.15 \n96. Individuals and families in credible fear proceedings in the PACR and HARP programs \nhave been held in El Paso’s Border Patrol Station 1. Many detainees there are held in tents where \npeople sleep on mats on the floor. Others are held in freezing hielera cells, which lack even mats.   \n97. Detainees have reported to members of Congress severely deficient detention conditions \nat El Paso Station 1, including that detainees were told to drink from toilets; were forced to sleep \nin extremely cramped conditions; and were denied access to medication.16 \n98. Asylum seekers are frequently exhausted and often ill from their long journeys. Detention \nin CBP facilities that lack such basic necessities as beds and basic hygiene materials does not allow \nasylum seekers to recuperate prior to the credible fear interview.  \n99. These conditions inhibit asylum seekers’ ability to accurately or fully recount traumatic \npast events.    \n \n15 DHS Office of Inspector General, Management Alert-DHS Needs to Address Dangerous \nOvercrowding Among Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (Redacted) 3 (May \n30, 2019), https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-05/OIG-19-46-May19.pdf. \n16 Ryan Bort, Drinking Out of Toilets: The Conditions in Border Patrol Facilities Are Beyond \nHorrifying, Rolling Stone (July 2, 2019), https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-\nnews/border-patrol-facilities-conditions-aoc-democrats-854586/.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 24 of 36\n100. The  conditions  of  confinement  in  CBP  facilities  hinder  asylum  seekers’  ability  to \nmeaningfully participate in their credible fear interviews and in the credible fear process more \nbroadly. \nV.  Las  Americas’  Experiences  Demonstrate  that  PACR  and  HARP  Deny  Asylum \nSeekers the Opportunity to Meaningfully Access the Credible Fear Process and Seek \nProtection. \n \n101. Las Americas’ experiences in attempting to represent asylum seekers in PACR and HARP \ndemonstrate that it is impossible for such individuals to obtain meaningful access to counsel. Las \nAmericas has been unable to communicate with prospective clients in PACR and HARP, whether \ntelephonically or in person, prior to their credible fear interview or immigration judge review. \n102. In light of the approximately 30-minute to 1-hour window that the PACR and HARP pilot \nprograms provide for asylum seekers to contact counsel, Las Americas faces severe obstacles to \ndirectly connecting telephonically with any prospective client. One of Las Americas’ attorneys \nmust be on call and available in order to serve the prospective client immediately. This is especially \nburdensome because many of Las Americas’ attorneys are frequently inside detention facilities \nproviding legal representation. Moreover, PACR and HARP require Las Americas to have a staff \nmember available to answer every single phone call before it goes to voicemail, since there is no \nmeans for the organization to call back an individual in one of the programs. \n103. As a result, Las Americas has not yet received a phone call from an individual in PACR \nand HARP and has to date not been able to connect a person in PACR or HARP with an attorney \nin order to provide legal advice to the asylum seeker upon direct outreach. \n104. Las Americas has been unable to meet in person with individuals in PACR and HARP. Las \nAmericas’ legal director requested an in-person meeting with a prospective client in PACR in order \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 25 of 36\nto conduct an intake. A Border Patrol officer informed her, “We are not equipped to facilitate in-\nperson meetings.” \n105. Historically, CBP has consistently denied Las Americas attorneys in-person access to CBP \nfacilities, including El Paso’s Border Patrol Station 1. It has told Las Americas that it cannot \naccommodate attorneys at Border Patrol Station 1. \n106. In contrast, most individuals that Las Americas represents in the El Paso area are in ICE \ndetention  at  the  El  Paso  Processing  Center  and  other  ICE  facilities.  After  confirming  the \nprospective client’s location through their assigned A-number in ICE’s online detainee locator, \nLas Americas is able to send an attorney or paralegal to meet with the individual. Locating an \nindividual in ICE detention takes no more than a few minutes. The entire process of locating and \nmeeting with the person to conduct a screening interview can typically take place in a single \nmorning or afternoon. \n107. Las Americas has been functionally unable to track down individuals in CBP custody in \nthe PACR and HARP programs within the compressed time frame necessary to meaningfully \ncommunicate with them. \n108. Instead, Las Americas staff have been forced to expend significant amounts of time \nattempting to track down prospective clients in CBP custody. In trying to find and then speak \ntelephonically to one person detained in CBP custody and subject to PACR, Las Americas staff \nexchanged at least 18 emails and 4 phone calls with various CBP officials over a period of 2 days. \n109. For this prospective client, Las Americas first contacted CBP via email around 10:19 AM \non November 20, 2019, requesting access to the prospective client in PACR. A Border Patrol \nofficer requested that Las Americas “send . . . a proposed date and time” for the conversation. At \nno point did the Border Patrol officer indicate where the prospective client was in the credible fear \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 26 of 36\nproceedings. The Las Americas legal director provided windows of availability for a telephone \nconversation that day and also requested an extension so that she could prepare her client. Border \nPatrol did not provide for a conversation that day. \n110. The next day, November 21, at around 2:40 PM Border Patrol informed Las Americas that \nit “ha[d] not confirmed their [the prospective client’s] location yet” and asked that Las Americas \ndouble check the spelling of her name. At roughly 4:59 PM on November 21, Border Patrol \nconfirmed that it had located the prospective client “at the El Paso Station”—over 30 hours after \nLas Americas first sought to locate her. \n111. On the following day, November 22, at around 2:48 PM, Border Patrol informed Las \nAmericas that the prospective client had in fact gone through the immigration judge review process \nsometime on November 20. The immigration judge had already affirmed the adverse credible fear \ndetermination and had ordered Las Americas’ prospective client removed. \n112. Las Americas has to date been unable to connect with any individual in PACR or HARP \nprior to the completion of their credible fear proceedings. In contrast, Las Americas regularly \nconnects with and represents individuals in ICE custody in their credible fear proceedings, \nincluding prior to the credible fear interview itself. \nVI.  PACR and HARP Erroneously Return Asylum Seekers to Places Where They Face \nPotential Harm. \n \n113. PACR and HARP set asylum seekers up for failure in the credible fear process—no matter \nhow strong their claims for protection. By forcing asylum seekers to proceed through the credible \nfear process while essentially incommunicado in CBP custody, without access to counsel, in \nconditions  that  significantly  interfere  with  their  ability  to  have  a  meaningful  credible  fear \ninterview, and on a rushed timeline, PACR and HARP result in the erroneous removal of people \nwho are at risk of persecution, torture, and death. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 27 of 36\n114. PACR and HARP also have kept Las Americas from accessing prospective clients in the \ncredible fear process. Las Americas has sought to make contact with prospective clients in PACR \nand HARP without success. \n115. If PACR and HARP remain in place, people who have claims for asylum or other forms of \nrelief and protection that require that they be placed in full immigration proceedings will be \nerroneously sent back to danger, persecution, or even death.  \n116. Congress specifically implemented procedural safeguards to prevent this kind of erroneous \ndeprivation of the right to apply for asylum, in requiring that individuals in the credible fear process \nhave access to counsel to ensure a meaningful opportunity to seek relief. With PACR and HARP, \nthe executive branch is attempting to effectuate an end run around the procedural safeguard of \naccess to counsel, by implementing policies that are not in accordance with the duly enacted laws \nof the United States, with the executive branch’s own regulations, and with the fundamental goals \nof the asylum system: protecting those at risk of persecution or torture, and ensuring that all those \nwho may be eligible for protection have a full day in court. \nVII.  PACR and HARP Harm Las Americas. \n \n117. PACR and HARP have disrupted Las Americas’ operations in the El Paso area and forced \nthe organization to divert resources to attempt to provide legal and other assistance to asylum \nseekers in CBP detention. In doing so, they have greatly impaired Las Americas’ ability to \nrepresent asylum seekers detained in the El Paso area—which is critical to Las Americas’ mission. \nThese harms are exacerbated every day that PACR and HARP remain in effect. \n118. Las Americas seeks to provide direct legal services to individuals in PACR and HARP due \nto its long history of responding to urgent direct services needs for noncitizens in West Texas. If \nLas Americas is able to connect with individuals in PACR and HARP, it will seek to provide legal \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 28 of 36\nservices to those individuals. Las Americas has attempted to connect with such individuals in order \nto provide legal services and has been unable to do so. \n119. In response to the extraordinarily narrow windows of time that individuals in PACR and \nHARP have to speak with an attorney, Las Americas has re-trained its intake staff to attempt to \nidentify and elevate calls from or on behalf of individuals in PACR and HARP—for example, calls \nin which the individual expresses a particularly urgent need to speak with an attorney or a third \nparty says they are unable to further contact an individual in immigration proceedings. Las \nAmericas intake staff has created a separate tracker for calls from individuals who are in either \nPACR or HARP and now attempts to immediately contact an attorney while the caller is still on \nthe line.  Las Americas will now staff a separate phone line with a dedicated legal assistant in order \nto free up a line solely for the purpose of providing representation to asylum seekers in the PACR \nand HARP programs. \n120. PACR and HARP require Las Americas’ director of legal services to divert time from Las \nAmericas’ docket working with individuals detained in ICE custody in anticipation of possible \ncalls from asylum seekers in PACR and HARP. The director of legal services now is on call, ready \nto respond within hours to prepare those asylum seekers for the interview and to otherwise engage \nwith asylum seekers in the credible fear process. From November 20, 2019 to December 3, 2019, \nLas Americas’ director of legal services devoted approximately 60% of her time to attempting to \nlocate and consult with individuals in PACR and HARP. The time that the legal services director \nhas expended attempting to locate prospective clients in PACR and HARP is time that she has not \ndevoted to supervising attorneys, working on behalf of asylum seekers, preparing for upcoming \nlitigation on behalf of asylum seekers, and doing additional advocacy work regarding detention \nconditions at ICE facilities where her clients are detained. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 29 of 36\n121. In an attempt to account for the obstacles to access imposed by PACR and HARP, Las \nAmericas sent a paralegal to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico to screen and sign up for representation \nMexican asylum seekers who could be subject to the HARP program.  CBP has not been able to \nlocate the five clients signed up through this method in their systems.  \n122. As a result of CBP’s failure to provide timely information concerning and access to clients \nand potential clients, Las Americas is implementing plans to conduct CFI and RFI preparations in \nCiudad Juárez. Pro bono counsel often assist Las Americas in providing CFI and RFI preparation \nand  representation  for  clients  detained  in  ICE  custody.    However,  pro  bono  counsel  are \nsignificantly less likely to cross into Mexico to assist in these efforts. Las Americas therefore will \nbe forced to extend resources beyond those required in similar cases where clients are in the United \nStates or in ICE custody. \n123. If PACR and HARP continue, Las Americas will be forced to hire additional staff. Las \nAmericas will divert funds that it would have put into communications as well as previously \nplanned staff raises designed to encourage retention. Hiring the additional staff member will \nresult in additional costs, in terms of time invested in the hiring process and time invested in on-\nboarding and training. If PACR and HARP continue and Las Americas were to choose not to \nhire an additional staff member, it would need to decrease its representation for adult detainees in \nother settings—scaling back its representation in bond, parole, and full asylum proceedings—due \nto resource constraints.  \n124. Las Americas is working to develop a rapid response intake system for detained individuals \nthat includes rapid intakes, preparation for the credible fear interview, and the ability to engage in \nfull asylum legal representation. It has a grant contingent on this work to serve detained adults in \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 30 of 36\nICE custody. Las Americas will have to work to attempt to rearrange the grant if PACR and HARP \ncontinue. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n125. All of the foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference in each of the following \nclaims. \nFIRST CLAIM \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv)) \n126. The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), provides that a \nnoncitizen in credible fear proceedings within the expedited removal process “may consult with a \nperson or persons of [their] choosing prior to” a credible fear “interview or any review thereof, \naccording to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.” \n127. Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel or otherwise consulting with \nindividuals of their choosing during the credible fear process.  \nSECOND CLAIM \n(Violation of 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4)) \n128. Federal regulations governing credible fear proceedings for those in expedited removal \nprovide that a noncitizen “may consult with a person or persons of [their] choosing prior to” a \ncredible fear “interview or any review thereof.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4). Under the regulation, \n“Any person or persons with whom the alien chooses to consult may be present at the interview \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 31 of 36\nand may be permitted, in the discretion of the asylum officer, to present a statement at the end of \nthe interview.” Id. \n129.   Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.30(d)(4) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel or otherwise consulting with \nindividuals of their choosing during the credible fear process. Defendants’ acts also violate 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) by preventing counsel and other individuals that asylum seekers choose to \nconsult from being present at the credible fear interview. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362; Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b)) \n \n130. The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362, provides that “[i]n any removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such \nproceedings, as he shall choose.”  \n131. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides that “[a] person compelled \nto appear in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, \nrepresented,  and  advised  by  counsel  or,  if  permitted  by  the  agency,  by  other  qualified \nrepresentative. A party is entitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified \nrepresentative in an agency proceeding.” Individuals subject to expedited removal procedures are \ncompelled  to  appear  in  person  before  agency  representatives.  Congress  has  not  exempted \nexpedited removal proceedings from the procedural protections provided in § 555(b). \n132. Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 U.S.C. § 1362 \nand 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel during the credible fear \nprocess, including in the credible fear interview itself. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 32 of 36\nFOURTH CLAIM \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n133. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, provides that a Court “shall hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an \nabuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law”  and  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \n134. The PACR and HARP programs are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \ncontrary to law. Among other reasons, the programs are arbitrary and capricious because they \nentirely failed to consider important aspects of the problem, including that the programs deny \nasylum seekers the ability to consult with counsel and other persons of their own choosing and to \nhave those representatives present at the credible fear interviews and immigration judge review \nand that the programs do not take into account the effect of the conditions of confinement in CBP \nfacilities on asylum seekers’ credible fear interviews; the programs depart from prior policies \nwithout acknowledgment of or a reasoned explanation for the departure; and the programs are \nillogical and irrational. The programs are also contrary to law allowing asylum seekers to consult \nwith persons of their own choosing, including counsel, prior to credible fear interviews and to \nreview by an immigration judge and to have those individuals present at credible fear interviews. \nFIFTH CLAIM \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Convention Against Torture, the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, and Implementing Regulations) \n135. The Immigration and Nationality Act and implementing regulations, including 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1), 8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(4), 208.30, and 1003.42 (expedited removal); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 \n(asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (withholding of removal); and CAT, implemented in the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title \nXXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note) entitle \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 33 of 36\nindividuals to a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT \nrelief,  as  well  as  numerous  procedural  safeguards  in  connection  with  those  applications. \nDefendants, through their implementation of the PACR and HARP programs, have violated these \nstatutory and regulatory rights in multiple respects, including by: \na.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to consult with and be assisted by \nattorneys or others prior to and during the credible fear process and the immigration \njudge review process, and to have attorneys or others present at the credible fear \ninterview; and \nb.  Maintaining  conditions  that  hinder  the  ability  to  meaningfully  participate  in \ncredible fear proceedings, including the credible fear interview. \n \nSIXTH CLAIM \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution) \n \n136. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides \nthat “[n]o person shall . . .  be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.” \n137. Asylum seekers have protected interests in applying for asylum, withholding of removal, \nand CAT relief, in obtaining withholding of removal and CAT relief upon a showing that meets \nthe applicable standards, and in not being removed to a country where they face serious danger \nand potential loss of life.   \n138. Asylum seekers are entitled under the Due Process Clause to a fair hearing as to their \neligibility for asylum and other relief from removal, including at a minimum a procedure that is in \ncompliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards.   \n139. Defendants, through their implementation of HARP and PACR, have violated asylum \nseekers’ rights to due process, including by: \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 34 of 36\na.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to consult with and be assisted by \nattorneys or others prior to and during the credible fear process and the immigration \njudge review process, and to have attorneys or others present at the credible fear \ninterview; and \nb.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of \nremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and relief from removal under CAT. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief: \n1.  Declare Defendants’ policies requiring that individuals and families remain in CBP custody \nfor  the  duration  of  their  credible  fear  proceedings  and  the  actions  and  practices  of \nDefendants described above contrary to law; \n2.  Enter an order vacating the programs keeping individuals and families in CBP custody for \nthe duration of their credible fear proceedings, including but not limited to all written \npolicies and guidance issued by DHS and DOJ regarding PACR and HARP; \n3.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendants and their directors, officers, agents, and \nemployees from continuing to apply the new programs to individuals and families who are \nplaced in credible fear proceedings;  \n4.  Enter an order staying the credible fear proceedings of persons currently subject to PACR \nand HARP in the El Paso sector until they have been either paroled or transferred to ICE \ncustody and have had an adequate opportunity to access counsel; and, for those who have \nalready received an adverse determination in a credible fear interview, vacating any \nnegative finding and/or removal order and enjoining Defendants from removing them until \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 35 of 36\nthey have been provided with a new credible fear process fully compliant with law or, in \nthe alternative, full immigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; \n5.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants to provide those previously subject to PACR and \nHARP with a new credible fear process fully compliant with law or, in the alternative, full \nimmigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; to return them to the \nUnited States at no expense; and to parole them into the United States for the duration of \nthose credible fear and/or removal proceedings; \n6.  Award Plaintiff’s counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, \nand any other applicable statute or regulation; and \n7.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n   \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640   Document 1   Filed 12/05/19   Page 36 of 36\nDated: December 5, 2019             Respectfully submitted, \n  /s/ Arthur B.

Customs  and  Border  Protection  (“CBP”)  facilities  are  legal  black  holes.  This  case \nchallenges the federal government’s drastic change in policy to—for the first time—detain asylum \nseekers effectively incommunicado and in appalling conditions in those facilities throughout their \nasylum screening process, without any opportunity to meet in person, or even by telephone, with \nan attorney to obtain the assistance to which they are entitled by law. \n2. Congress  has  mandated  that  asylum  seekers,  including  those  subject  to  “expedited \nremoval” proceedings, have the opportunity to access and confer with counsel and third parties \nwhile they prepare for an initial screening for asylum and other protection from removal and for a \nreview of that screening determination by an immigration judge.  These screenings, known as \n“credible fear interviews,” are the critical first step for many asylum seekers because they \ndetermine  whether  these  individuals  and  families  may  pursue  a  claim  for  asylum  or  other \nprotection or, instead, will be summarily sent back to the countries they are fleeing. \n3. Defendants’ new programs effectively deny all access to counsel and third parties, and \ntherefore, all but guarantee that many asylum seekers will be erroneously sent back to countries \nwhere they face danger and that, as a result, some of them will be killed or endure horrific violence. \nThis case seeks to ensure that those fleeing persecution and torture in their home countries have a \nfair opportunity to apply for asylum and other protection in the United States. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 4 of 48\n4. Prior to either October 7 or 8, 2019, noncitizens in expedited removal proceedings who \nexpressed a fear of removal were transferred from CBP detention to Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) detention centers before their credible fear screenings. \n5. Defendants are now implementing what they have termed the Prompt Asylum Claim \nReview program (“PACR”) and the Humanitarian Asylum Review Process (“HARP”).1  Under \nPACR, asylum seekers from countries other than Mexico who are in credible fear proceedings are \nkept in CBP facilities instead of being transferred to ICE detention centers. HARP applies the same \npolicy as PACR to Mexican asylum seekers in credible fear proceedings. \n6. This change, from Defendants transferring asylum seekers to ICE custody for credible fear \nscreenings to keeping them in CBP custody, is pivotal. In ICE custody, these asylum seekers were \nafforded more time and opportunity to contact counsel2 or prospective counsel or others to aid \nthem in their credible fear proceedings. They could also meet with attorneys, both in person and \ntelephonically, prior to the credible fear interview with an asylum officer and again prior to an \nimmigration judge’s review of any negative credible fear determination. \n7. CBP allows none of this to meaningfully occur for those in its custody, and CBP facilities \nare not set up to facilitate such access. CBP facilities do not afford in-person or telephonic access \nto counsel or, in fact, any meaningful communication with the outside world. CBP, unlike ICE, \nprovides no system to locate people in its custody. Its facilities were designed for short-term \ndetention and not for asylum seekers going through a credible fear process. \n \n1 Defendants have also referred to the PACR program as the Prompt Asylum Screening Review \nprogram or “PASR.” \n2 Individuals in expedited removal may have been able to retain counsel because they did so \nprior to crossing into the United States; because their family members retained counsel on their \nbehalf; because they retained counsel while in ICE custody; or through other means.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 5 of 48\n8. Under PACR and HARP, an asylum seeker in CBP custody is given only one window of \napproximately 30 minutes to one hour to call family members or retained counsel, or to call \nprospective attorneys from a limited list provided by CBP. There is no callback number or other \nmeans by which lawyers may attempt to reach clients or prospective clients. The result is that it is \nfunctionally impossible for an asylum seeker in one of these programs to contact an attorney. \n9. Even when an asylum seeker does manage to contact an attorney, PACR and HARP ensure \nthat the asylum seeker does not have a meaningful opportunity to consult with that attorney. CBP \ndenies attorneys physical access to its facilities, precluding all in-person meetings. CBP also does \nnot provide for any regular telephonic access and provides no guarantee that the consultation will \nbe confidential. \n10. Even when CBP has been aware that an attorney is attempting to reach an individual prior \nto their interview or hearing before an immigration judge, CBP has forced that individual to \nproceed with their credible fear interview or hearing without any opportunity to consult with that \nattorney. \n11. Consequently, under PACR and HARP, asylum seekers functionally have no opportunity \nto access counsel or prospective counsel or other individuals during their credible fear screening \nas mandated by Congress. Moreover, the terrible conditions of confinement in CBP facilities \n(known as “hieleras”—Spanish for “ice boxes”—due to their freezing temperatures) hinder asylum \nseekers’ ability to meaningfully participate in their credible fear proceedings. \n12. Defendants have to date implemented PACR and HARP in CBP’s El Paso sector. As of \nNovember 26, 2019, 392 asylum cases had been processed through PACR. As of November 27, \n2019, the government had placed at least 137 asylum seekers in HARP. \n13. CBP has stated its intent to expand PACR and HARP to other parts of the border. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 6 of 48\n14. PACR and HARP systematically undermine the procedural safeguards guaranteed to those \nseeking asylum by rocketing asylum seekers through the credible fear process with no access to \ncounsel. Congress provided for protections for people in credible fear proceedings in order to \nprevent the United States government from erroneously sending asylum seekers back to places \nwhere they face persecution, torture, and possibly death. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). Jurisdiction is also proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1361 and 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702 and 706.  \n16. Venue is proper in the District of the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause Defendants are officers and employees of the United States, at least one defendant resides \nin the district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims alleged \nherein occurred in this district. Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district. Finally, \nvenue is proper here because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) requires that all § 1252(e)(3) actions be brought \nin this district. \nPARTIES \n17.

Plaintiffs B.R.G., D.M.F.G., B.C.F.G., J.M.F.G., and S.F.G. fled Michoacán, Mexico, after \nB.R.G.’s father was disappeared and a cartel threatened B.R.G.’s life and the lives of her children \nmultiple times if they did not pay extortion fees. These threats included detailing where her \nchildren went to school, where the family lived, and what places they tended to frequent.  During \ntheir time in HARP, B.R.G. and her children had no meaningful opportunity to consult with \ncounsel prior to her credible fear screening. After being removed to Mexico, B.R.G. and her \nchildren are now living in a tent encampment in Ciudad Juárez and fear for their lives for as long \nas they remain Mexico. \n30. Plaintiff Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center (“Las Americas”) is a nonprofit \norganization based in El Paso, Texas that provides free and low-cost direct legal services to \nnoncitizens, including asylum seekers, in West Texas and New Mexico. Its mission includes \nproviding consultation and legal services to noncitizens detained by the federal government in the \nEl Paso area, including by representing individuals through the credible fear interview process \nthrough a staff of four attorneys and three legal assistants.

U.S. Immigration Law’s Protections for Individuals Fleeing Threatened Harm \n42. Under U.S. law, every noncitizen “who is physically present in the United States or who \narrives in the United States” has the right to apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). \n43. Individuals are eligible for asylum if they experienced past persecution or have a well-\nfounded fear of future persecution “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion” and if they are “unable or unwilling to return to, and \n. . . unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of” their country of origin \nbecause of that persecution or fear. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). \n44. U.S. law also protects noncitizens who are not eligible for asylum but nevertheless face \npotential severe harm if they are returned to their home countries. The U.S. government cannot \nreturn individuals to a country where it is more likely than not that their “life or freedom would be \nthreatened . . . because of [their] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, \nor political opinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A) (“statutory withholding of removal”).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 11 of 48\n45. The government also cannot remove individuals to a country where they are more likely \nthan not to be tortured. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.19 (regulations implementing the United \nStates’ obligations under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). \n46. “Asylum  seekers,”  as  used  in  this  complaint,  refers  to  individuals  who  are  seeking \nprotection from removal to their home country based on the dangers they would face there. These \nindividuals may be eligible for asylum, entitled to statutory withholding of removal, and/or entitled \nto withholding or deferral of removal pursuant to CAT. \nII.  The Expedited Removal System \n47. Ordinarily, people whom the executive branch seeks to remove from the United States are \nplaced in immigration removal proceedings under Section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct (“INA”) (8 U.S.C. § 1229a). In these proceedings, they have a full hearing on the merits of \ntheir case before an immigration judge. During proceedings under § 1229a, an individual generally \nhas a meaningful opportunity to develop claims for asylum or other forms of relief. \n48. Removal proceedings under § 1229a provide for multiple layers of review. Following a \nhearing before an immigration judge, a person can appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals \n(“BIA”). A noncitizen who receives an adverse ruling from the BIA can then file a petition for \nreview in a federal court of appeals. \n49. In 1996, as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, \nCongress created a highly truncated removal process called “expedited removal” for certain \nnoncitizens who present at a port of entry or who have recently entered the country without \ninspection.  The  expedited  removal  process  is  an  alternative  to  full  immigration  removal \nproceedings under § 1229a. People placed in expedited removal will not go through full removal \nproceedings unless they are taken out of the expedited removal track. Those subject to expedited \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 12 of 48\nremoval are ordered removed by an immigration officer “without further hearing or review.” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I). \n50. Since the expedited removal process lacks many of the procedural protections of full \nremoval proceedings, Congress sought to ensure that those who may have valid claims to asylum \nor other protection will not be erroneously removed. \n51. Consequently, individuals in expedited removal who indicate a fear of return to their \ncountry of origin, or an intent to apply for asylum, must be referred for an interview with an asylum \nofficer.  The asylum officer then makes a determination whether the person has a credible fear—\nthat is, whether there is “a significant possibility . . . that the alien could establish eligibility for”: \n(1) asylum; (2) for withholding under § 1231(b)(3); and/or (3) for relief from removal under CAT. \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.42(d)(1). \n52. Individuals who are found to have a credible or reasonable fear that could make them \neligible for protection must be taken out of expedited removal and placed into full immigration \nremoval proceedings under § 1229a. They will accordingly have the opportunity to fully develop \na case for asylum or relief from removal under the ordinary structure of immigration proceedings. \n53. If the person receives a negative credible fear determination at the interview stage, the \nasylum officer must “provide . . . a written notice of decision” and ask whether the individual \nwants review of the negative determination by an immigration judge.3 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1); id. \n§ 1208.30(g)(2)(ii). Unless the individual affirmatively waives review by an immigration judge, \nthe agency must provide for such review. Id. § 1208.30(g)(2)(i). \n \n3 Immigration judges and immigration courts are under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office \nfor Immigration Review, which is overseen and administered by Defendant Attorney General \nBarr. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 13 of 48\n54. If the immigration judge vacates the negative determination, the individual will then be \nplaced into ordinary removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, just as they would have been if \nthe asylum officer had made a positive determination. If the immigration judge upholds the \nnegative  determination,  the  individual  will  be  removed  without  further  legal  process.  The \nimmigration judge’s decision on review is administratively “final and may not be appealed.” 8 \nC.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A).4 \n55. Consistent with Congress’s concern for preventing noncitizens’ erroneous removal to \nplaces where they may face harm, the threshold for a noncitizen to successfully establish a credible \nfear in expedited removal proceedings is much lower than the threshold to establish eligibility for \nactual asylum or entitlement to other protection in full removal proceedings. The “significant \npossibility” of eligibility for relief that a person must establish at a credible fear interview is a \nfraction of the chance of persecution or torture that they must ultimately establish to prevail.5 \n \n4 USCIS may, but need not, reconsider a negative credible fear finding that has been affirmed by \nan immigration judge.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(A). The immigration judge’s decision is \nconsidered by the Executive Branch not to be subject to judicial review.  \n5 Under regulatory provisions that are the subject of ongoing litigation, individuals are \ndetermined ineligible for asylum if they have transited through another country en route to the \nUnited States without first seeking asylum in that other country, absent certain exceptions. See E. \nBay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 19-16487 (9th Cir.); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c)(4). Nevertheless, \nsuch individuals will be placed in full immigration proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a on \na showing of a “reasonable fear” of persecution or torture during their initial screening with an \nasylum officer. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(iii). Showing a reasonable fear of persecution or torture \nrequires establishing a “reasonable possibility” of eligibility for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c). This \n“reasonable possibility” standard is the same as the standard required for establishing “a well-\nfounded fear of persecution” for asylum—at least as low as a one-in-ten chance. See I.N.S. v. \nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2)(i)(B). It therefore remains \na fraction of a chance of establishing ultimate eligibility for relief, far below the 50.1% chance \nnecessary to ultimately gain relief from removal under statutory withholding or CAT. \nImplementation of similar regulatory provisions that would apply to individuals who have \ncrossed the border at a place other than a port of entry is likewise the subject of ongoing \nlitigation and is currently preliminarily enjoined. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(5)(ii); E. Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1121 (N.D. Cal. 2018); stay pending appeal denied, \n932 F.3d 742, 780 (9th Cir. 2018). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 14 of 48\n56. The credible fear process is a critical phase in determining who ought to be placed in full \nremoval proceedings under § 1229a and given the opportunity to build a full case showing that \nthey merit asylum or other protection, rather than be issued an expedited removal order. \nIII.  Access to Counsel in the Expedited Removal System’s Credible Fear Process \n57. In furtherance of Congress’s intent to ensure that individuals in expedited removal \nproceedings are afforded a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum, withholding from removal, or \nprotection under CAT, Congress has provided for access to and consultation with counsel and \nothers prior to both the credible fear interview and the immigration judge’s review of that \ninterview for those in expedited removal proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) (providing \nthat a noncitizen “may consult with a person or persons of [their] choosing prior to the interview \nor any review thereof”). \n58. During the credible fear interview itself, federal regulation also provides for the presence \nof an individual consulted—which includes an attorney. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) (“Any person or \npersons with whom the alien chooses to consult may be present at the interview . . . .”). The \nattorney or other consulted individual “may be permitted, in the discretion of the asylum officer, \nto present a statement at the end of the interview.” Id. \n59. Further, an individual “[i]n any removal proceedings before an immigration judge” has a \nright to representation by counsel at no expense to the government. 8 U.S.C. § 1362. Moreover, \n“[a] person compelled to appear in person before an agency or representative thereof” has the \nright “to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n60. Fundamentally, individuals seeking asylum have a constitutionally protected interest \nunder the Fifth Amendment in applying to the U.S. government for asylum, withholding of \nremoval, and/or relief under CAT, and therefore are entitled to procedural due process in their \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 15 of 48\nproceedings on those claims. See, e.g., Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, 676 F.2d 1023, 1037-38 \n(5th Cir. 1982); Maldonado-Perez v. I.N.S., 865 F.2d 328, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  Asylum seekers \nalso have constitutionally protected interests in avoiding persecution, torture, and death. \n61. Because neither the right to apply for asylum and other protections from removal nor the \nright of access to counsel is an empty formality, noncitizens must have the opportunity to \nmeaningfully effectuate them. They must have a reasonable opportunity to retain and work with \ncounsel in their removal proceedings. And they must have a meaningful opportunity to apply for \nasylum and other protections from removal, consistent with the procedures established by \nCongress. \n62. Accordingly, the government may not create obstacles to access to counsel, the \ncumulative effect of which is to prevent access. It also may not interfere with established \nattorney-client relationships. And for those in its custody, the government must put in place \npolicies and practices that ensure these individuals may meaningfully effectuate their right to \naccess counsel. Similarly, the government may not create numerous obstacles, the cumulative \neffect of which is to prevent meaningful access to the process of applying for asylum or other \nprotections from removal. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Before PACR and HARP, Individuals Were Transferred from CBP Custody to ICE \n  Custody for Credible Fear Proceedings in Expedited Removal, Where They Could \n  Access Counsel. \n \n63. People who present themselves at a port of entry without proper documentation or who are \napprehended at or near the southern border are supposed to be placed in CBP custody only for \ninitial processing and for a short period of time (less than 72 hours).  CBP’s National Standards \non Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (“TEDS”) specify that “Detainees should generally \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 16 of 48\nnot be held for longer than 72 hours in CBP hold rooms or holding facilities,” and “every effort \nmust be made to hold detainees for the least amount of time required.”6   \n64. Before the implementation of the PACR and HARP programs, members of this group who \nwere placed in expedited removal and expressed a fear of return to their country of origin were \nthen transferred from CBP detention to an ICE detention facility for their credible fear proceedings. \n65. At the ICE detention facility following transfer, these individuals had greater time and \nopportunity to access counsel. They could contact counsel or prospective counsel telephonically \nand also meet with counsel or prospective counsel in person. They also could contact family \nmembers or others by phone. \n66. The credible fear interview did not occur until after a specific period of time—prior to July \n2019, at least 48 hours, and starting in July 2019, at least one full calendar day—in ICE custody.7 \nThis time gave individuals some opportunity to contact counsel, family members, or others and \nalso to recuperate from their journeys. \nII.  PACR and HARP Now Require that Credible Fear Proceedings Be Conducted \nWhile in CBP Custody, Where Asylum Seekers Cannot Access Counsel. \n \n67. On or after October 7, 2019, DHS and DOJ began implementing PACR—a new expedited \nremoval program, established by written policy directives, guidelines, and procedures. Also in \nOctober 2019, subsequent to initial implementation of the PACR program, DHS and DOJ began \n \n6 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search, U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, (Oct. 2015) 14, available at \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-\nSep/CBP%20TEDS%20Policy%20Oct2015.pdf. \n7 The policy change from a 48-hour waiting period to one calendar day is currently the subject of \nlitigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under the caption, L.M.-M v. \nCuccinelli, No. 1:19-cv-2676 (RDM).  Plaintiffs agree that one calendar day is not a sufficient \ntime period to prepare for a credible fear interview, even in ICE detention, but that policy change \nis not at issue here.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 17 of 48\nimplementing  HARP,  a  similar  expedited  removal  program  established  by  written  policy \ndirectives, guidelines, and procedures. PACR and HARP are the same, except that HARP applies \nto Mexican nationals seeking asylum in the United States while PACR applies to nationals from \nother countries.8 \n68. Currently, DHS and DOJ have implemented PACR and HARP as pilot programs in CBP’s \nEl Paso sector.  Individuals and families whom DHS has apprehended in or near the El Paso area \nor who have arrived and presented at a port of entry in the El Paso area are eligible to be placed in \nPACR or HARP. \n69. PACR and HARP drastically change the credible fear process by requiring that asylum \nseekers go through the entirety of their credible fear proceedings—including the credible fear \ninterview and any review by an immigration judge—while in CBP detention, without any transfer \nto an ICE detention facility. \n70. PACR and HARP also seek to conduct credible fear interviews within 24 hours, and any \nfurther review within 10 days.  \n71. CBP facilities designed for “short-term” detention. Unlike those held in ICE detention \ncenters, individuals detained in CBP facilities have essentially no opportunity to communicate \nwith the outside world. \n72. PACR and HARP create major obstacles to asylum seekers accessing the process of \napplying for protection in the United States. \n \n8 Although Defendants have labeled PACR and HARP as separate programs, there appears to be \nno meaningful difference between the two, except for the nationality of the asylum seekers \nsubject to each program.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 18 of 48\nIII.  PACR and HARP Effectively Deny Those in Credible Fear Proceedings Meaningful \n  Access to Counsel. \n \n73. PACR and HARP’s policy change to mandate that the credible fear process occur entirely \nwhile an individual is detained in CBP facilities, not ICE detention facilities, effectively denies \nasylum seekers the opportunity to meaningfully access counsel and prevents asylum seekers from \ncommunicating with anyone else in the outside world, including people with whom they might \nconsult regarding the credible fear interview. They also force asylum seekers to remain in crowded, \nunsanitary, and inhospitable conditions of confinement that are unconducive to meaningfully \nparticipating in a credible fear interview or other aspects of the credible fear process. \n  A.  While ICE detention facilities provide for access to counsel, CBP facilities do  \n    not. \n \n74. At ICE detention facilities, ICE standards require that the agency provide those in credible \nfear proceedings the opportunity to access counsel confidentially, both telephonically and in \nperson. ICE detention centers generally provide telephones for access to legal representation and \nmeeting spaces for attorneys to meet with clients and prospective clients.  \n75. ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards (“PBNDS”) specifically require \nthat those in expedited removal proceedings shall have the opportunity to telephonically contact \nboth counsel and prospective counsel. PBNDS 5.6(V)(E) (providing that ICE detention centers \n“shall” grant “[f]ull telephone access” in order for a detainee to contact “legal representatives”; \n“to obtain legal representation”; to access “legal services providers or organizations” on the \nprovided list; and, specifically, “for consultation when subject to expedited removal” and requiring \nthat “when a detainee is under an expedited removal order, his/her ability to contact pro bono \nlegal representatives shall not be restricted” (emphasis added)). The PBNDS also bar “limit[ing] \na detainee’s attempt to obtain legal representation,” beyond “reasonable restrictions” on call hours, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 19 of 48\ntime, and frequency. Id. 5.6(V)(F)(1); see also id. 5.6(II)(7) (“Detainees shall be able to make free \ncalls to the ICE/ERO-provided list of free legal services providers for the purpose of obtaining \ninitial legal representation.”). \n76. The PBNDS also require ICE detention facilities to provide in-person attorney access. \nAttorneys must have physical access to ICE facilities, every single day, for at least eight hours a \nday during the work week and four hours a day on weekends and holidays. PBNDS 5.7(J)(2). The \nPBNDS  requires  that  “each  detainee  may  meet  privately  with  current  or  prospective  legal \nrepresentatives and their legal assistants.” Id. 5.7(J)(1). \n77. CBP facilities, by contrast, provide no meaningful opportunity to access counsel either \ntelephonically or in person—whether confidentially or otherwise. Those detained in CBP custody \nare held essentially incommunicado, with no meaningful opportunity to communicate with the \noutside world.  \n78. CBP categorically denies attorneys in-person meetings with clients or prospective clients.  \nCBP asserts that its facilities are not designed to allow attorneys to meet in person with detained \nnoncitizens. CBP facilities do not have confidential attorney-client meeting areas, nor do they have \nany space dedicated to in-person visitation by attorneys or others.  \n79. Moreover, unlike for those in ICE custody, there is no way for attorneys to easily verify \nwhether a client or prospective client is in CBP custody and, if so, where that individual is located. \nFor ICE detainees, an attorney or other interested person may use ICE’s Online Detainee Locator \nSystem to look up an individual’s location of detention using the individual’s name, country of \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 20 of 48\nbirth, and birthdate or alternatively name and A-number.9 There is no such system for CBP \ndetainees. \n80. CBP’s national standards, unlike ICE’s, contain no provisions guaranteeing telephonic or \nin-person communication with attorneys or others in the outside world. \n  B.  Asylum seekers in PACR and HARP cannot meaningfully access counsel or  \n    otherwise communicate with the outside world. \n \n81. Individuals subject to PACR and HARP are provided with effectively no telephonic \ncommunication with the outside world. Once a credible fear interview is scheduled, individuals \nare provided a single window of approximately 30 minutes to one hour in which to attempt to \nreach a family member or attorney by telephone. \n82. Even for an asylum seeker able to reach an attorney by telephone, this single window is \ninsufficient for meaningful communication and consultation with counsel during the credible fear \nprocess. \n83. During the time in which asylum seekers may use the telephone, the conversation is not \nconfidential. Agents monitor phone calls by standing within earshot outside the door. \n84. Critically, there is no opportunity for asylum seekers to leave a call-back number or \notherwise provide for their call to be returned. If an asylum seeker in the PACR or HARP program \ncannot reach a particular person or entity—or anyone at all—during the time frame provided for \ncalls, they have no other opportunity to do so. \n \n9 Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Online Detainee Locator System, \nhttps://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/index.  An A-number is a unique registration number issued by \nUSCIS to many noncitizens.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 21 of 48\n85. Like all CBP facilities, Border Patrol Station 1 in El Paso does not permit detainees to \nreceive any visitors. There is therefore no opportunity for asylum seekers in the PACR and HARP \nprograms to meet in person with anyone prior to or during their credible fear proceedings. \n86. As described below, the individual Plaintiffs in this lawsuit had no meaningful opportunity \nto access counsel while in the PACR and HARP programs. Organizational Plaintiff Las Americas \nhas been functionally unable to communicate with individuals in CBP detention with whom it \nwishes to consult and for whom it may wish to serve as counsel. \n87. Moreover, the list of attorneys that detainees in the PACR and HARP programs have \nreceived is independently insufficient for any meaningful communication or consultation with \nprospective counsel. Detainees have called the list they are provided “the list of ghosts” because \nof their inability to contact any person by calling the numbers on the list. Although organizational \nPlaintiff Las Americas is on the ordinary list of free and low-fee attorneys provided by ICE to \nthose with pending credible fear proceedings, it is not receiving calls from individuals in PACR \nand HARP based on the list that CBP provides.  Other legal services providers report similar \nexperiences. \n88. Those detained in CBP facilities also generally lack the ability to communicate with family \nor friends. Frequently, the loved ones of CBP detainees do not know where they are or even that \nthey have been detained. CBP has said that, for those in its custody, it has “no obligation to notify \nfamily or counsel.”10 For PACR and HARP, the only exception to this rule is the single brief \nwindow during which asylum seekers may make outside calls—and hope those whom they call \nanswer the phone.  \n \n10 Max Rivlin-Nadler, Asylum-Seeker Held Incommunicado for Three Weeks by Border Patrol, \nKPBS, Nov. 26, 2019, https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/nov/26/asylum-seeker-held-\nincommunicado-three-weeks-borde/ (quoting CBP statement). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 22 of 48\n89. Accordingly, asylum seekers in PACR and HARP are unable to meaningfully access \ncounsel or anyone else with whom they may wish to consult, despite express statutory and \nregulatory right to do so. \nC.  Access to counsel is critically important in the credible fear process. \n \n90. Access to counsel is a critical protection for those in credible fear proceedings.  \n91. The interview and review can often require a detailed explanation from asylum seekers \nabout extremely traumatic events and implicate complex legal determinations. \n92. Asylum seekers have often traveled long distances and with children. They are frequently \naffected by mental health issues present in those fleeing violence, as well as by exhaustion and \nnumerous other physical health challenges.  At the same time, they are expected to immediately \ndefend their rights during accelerated removal proceedings in which their lives and futures—and \nthose of their children—are at stake. \n93. The vast majority of asylum seekers, including the individual plaintiffs in this lawsuit, are \nfleeing serious violence or threats of serious violence or death. An attorney can assist an asylum \nseeker in preparing for their interview or review. \n94. The ability to confidentially consult with a lawyer prior to the interview and review allows \nthe asylum seeker to be better prepared to present all relevant information. \n95. Attorneys are able to elicit information about why clients left their home countries and why \nthey are afraid to return and to help determine whether a client’s child may have separate or \nadditional claims.  Attorneys can also assist clients in presenting their full stories in chronological \norder and fully explaining why they are going to be harmed if they are returned. \n96. Attorneys are also able to advise clients about the interview process, including that clients \ncan ask for a question to be repeated or clarified, can advise that the interpreter is inadequate, and \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 23 of 48\ncan say they do not know the answer to a question.  Attorneys can also inform clients that their \ntestimony will be recorded. This knowledge is especially critical for individuals who will need to \nbe prepared to recount traumatic experiences during their interview. \n97. Further, an attorney may review documents or evidence in person and help clients prepare \nto present corroborating evidence of their claims. \n98. Meaningful and confidential communication with an attorney assists an asylum seeker in \npresenting all of the relevant information concerning their personal and traumatic experiences and \nin ensuring they understand the standard under which their fear will be judged, whether they may \nvolunteer additional information, and what information may be relevant to volunteer. \n99. The presence of the asylum seeker’s attorney during the credible fear interview is also \nnecessary for the attorney to understand what occurred during the interview and to best prepare \ntheir client for the immigration judge’s review of any adverse determination by an asylum officer. \n100. In an asylum seeker’s preparation for review of a negative credible fear determination by \nan immigration judge, an attorney is able to help evaluate why the credible fear interview was \nunsuccessful, better develop the asylum seeker’s claims, and prepare for the hearing before the \nimmigration judge. \n101. Case outcomes demonstrate that attorney access is essential for noncitizens in immigration \nproceedings. Detained noncitizens with representation in immigration proceedings are more than \ntwice as likely to receive relief from removal as those without representation.11 \n102. Attorney access has been particularly critical for asylum seekers in expedited removal. In \n2014, advocates established a pro bono attorney project at a remote detention center in Artesia, \n \n11 Ingrid V. Eagly & Steven Shafer, A National Study of Access to Counsel in Immigration \nCourt, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 51 (2015). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 24 of 48\nNew Mexico, which held Central American mothers and children seeking asylum and in expedited \nremoval proceedings. After one month, removals decreased by 80%, and within two months, \nremovals had decreased by 97%.12 Likewise, a pro bono project at a detention center for families \nin expedited removal proceedings had, as of 2018, secured relief from expedited removal for more \nthan 99.9% of those represented.13 And in 2018, after asylum seekers held incommunicado at a \nfederal prison pending their credible fear interviews secured access to counsel via court order, all \n74 represented between the issuance of the temporary restraining order and the issuance of the \npreliminary injunction were determined to have a credible or reasonable fear of persecution. \nInnovation Law Lab v. Nielsen, 342 F. Supp. 3d 1067, 1073-75 (D. Or. 2018). \nIV.  PACR and HARP Require Asylum Seekers to Remain in Conditions of Confinement \n  Incompatible with a Meaningful Credible Fear Interview. \n \n103. CBP’s facilities are commonly called hieleras for their freezing temperatures and are \nnotoriously inhumane.  \n104. These facilities were designed for “short term” detention and not to hold people through \nthe full duration of credible fear proceedings.   \n105. Individuals are often detained in small, concrete cells with concrete or metal benches. \nCBP’s internal guidance states that the cells are neither designed nor equipped for overnight \nsleeping. It specifies that such cells shall have “no beds.”14 \n106. In many CBP facilities, including Border Patrol Station 1, the lights are left on all night.  \n \n12 Innovation Law Lab, The Artesia Report, https://innovationlawlab.org/the-artesia-report/the-\nartesia-report/. \n13 Kari E. Hong and Stephen Manning, Getting it Righted: Access to Counsel in Rapid Removals, \n101 Marquette L. Rev. 673, 699-700 (2018). \n14 See U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Office of Internal Affairs Security Management Division, \nCBP Security Policy and Procedures Handbook, HB1400-02B (2009), 494, available at \nhttps://info.publicintelligence.net/CBPSecurityHandbook.pdf (“No beds; a hold room is not \ndesigned for sleeping.”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 25 of 48\n107. CBP holding facilities do not include regular access to basic hygiene, including showers \nand the means for detainees to brush their teeth.  \n108. A May 2019 report by DHS’s own inspector general detailed extreme overcrowding and \nhorrible conditions of confinement at a CBP holding facilities in the El Paso area, including \ndetaining single adults in standing-room-only conditions for a week and holding approximately \n900 detainees at a facility with a capacity of 125.15 \n109. Individuals and families in credible fear proceedings in the PACR and HARP programs \nhave been held in El Paso’s Border Patrol Station 1. Many detainees there are held in tents where \npeople sleep on mats on the floor. Others are held in freezing hielera cells, which lack even mats.   \n110. Detainees have reported to members of Congress severely deficient detention conditions \nat El Paso Station 1, including that detainees were told to drink from toilets; were forced to sleep \nin extremely cramped conditions; and were denied access to medication.16 \n111. Asylum seekers are frequently exhausted and often ill from their long journeys. Detention \nin CBP facilities that lack such basic necessities as beds and basic hygiene materials does not allow \nasylum seekers to recuperate prior to the credible fear interview.  \n112. These conditions inhibit asylum seekers’ ability to accurately or fully recount traumatic \npast events.    \n \n15 DHS Office of Inspector General, Management Alert-DHS Needs to Address Dangerous \nOvercrowding Among Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (Redacted) 3 (May \n30, 2019), https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2019-05/OIG-19-46-May19.pdf. \n16 Ryan Bort, Drinking Out of Toilets: The Conditions in Border Patrol Facilities Are Beyond \nHorrifying, Rolling Stone (July 2, 2019), https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-\nnews/border-patrol-facilities-conditions-aoc-democrats-854586/.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 26 of 48\n113. The  conditions  of  confinement  in  CBP  facilities  hinder  asylum  seekers’  ability  to \nmeaningfully participate in their credible fear interviews and in the credible fear process more \nbroadly. \nV.  Plaintiffs’ Experiences Demonstrate that PACR and HARP Deny Asylum Seekers the \nOpportunity to Meaningfully Access the Credible Fear Process and Seek Protection. \n \nA.  Organizational Plaintiff Las Americas \n114. Las Americas’ experiences in attempting to represent asylum seekers in PACR and HARP \ndemonstrate that it is impossible for such individuals to obtain meaningful access to counsel. Las \nAmericas has been unable to communicate with prospective clients in PACR and HARP, whether \ntelephonically or in person, prior to their credible fear interview or immigration judge review. \n115. In light of the approximately 30-minute to 1-hour window that the PACR and HARP pilot \nprograms provide for asylum seekers to contact counsel, Las Americas faces severe obstacles to \ndirectly connecting telephonically with any prospective client. One of Las Americas’ attorneys \nmust be on call and available in order to serve the prospective client immediately. This is especially \nburdensome because many of Las Americas’ attorneys are frequently inside detention facilities \nproviding legal representation. Moreover, PACR and HARP require Las Americas to have a staff \nmember available to answer every single phone call before it goes to voicemail, since there is no \nmeans for the organization to call back an individual in one of the programs. \n116. As a result, Las Americas has not yet received a phone call from an individual in PACR \nand HARP and has to date not been able to connect a person in PACR or HARP with an attorney \nin order to provide legal advice to the asylum seeker upon direct outreach. \n117. Las Americas has been unable to meet in person with individuals in PACR and HARP. Las \nAmericas’ legal director requested an in-person meeting with a prospective client in PACR in order \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 27 of 48\nto conduct an intake. A Border Patrol officer informed her, “We are not equipped to facilitate in-\nperson meetings.” \n118. Historically, CBP has consistently denied Las Americas attorneys in-person access to CBP \nfacilities, including El Paso’s Border Patrol Station 1. It has told Las Americas that it cannot \naccommodate attorneys at Border Patrol Station 1. \n119. In contrast, most individuals that Las Americas represents in the El Paso area are in ICE \ndetention  at  the  El  Paso  Processing  Center  and  other  ICE  facilities.  After  confirming  the \nprospective client’s location through their assigned A-number in ICE’s online detainee locator, \nLas Americas is able to send an attorney or paralegal to meet with the individual. Locating an \nindividual in ICE detention takes no more than a few minutes. The entire process of locating and \nmeeting with the person to conduct a screening interview can typically take place in a single \nmorning or afternoon. \n120. Las Americas has been functionally unable to track down individuals in CBP custody in \nthe PACR and HARP programs within the compressed time frame necessary to meaningfully \ncommunicate with them. \n121. Instead, Las Americas staff have been forced to expend significant amounts of time \nattempting to track down prospective clients in CBP custody. In trying to find and then speak \ntelephonically to one person detained in CBP custody and subject to PACR, Las Americas staff \nexchanged at least 18 emails and 4 phone calls with various CBP officials over a period of 2 days. \n122. For this prospective client, Las Americas first contacted CBP via email around 10:19 AM \non November 20, 2019, requesting access to the prospective client in PACR. A Border Patrol \nofficer requested that Las Americas “send . . . a proposed date and time” for the conversation. At \nno point did the Border Patrol officer indicate where the prospective client was in the credible fear \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 28 of 48\nproceedings. The Las Americas legal director provided windows of availability for a telephone \nconversation that day and also requested an extension so that she could prepare her client. Border \nPatrol did not provide for a conversation that day. \n123. The next day, November 21, at around 2:40 PM Border Patrol informed Las Americas that \nit “ha[d] not confirmed their [the prospective client’s] location yet” and asked that Las Americas \ndouble check the spelling of her name. At roughly 4:59 PM on November 21, Border Patrol \nconfirmed that it had located the prospective client “at the El Paso Station”—over 30 hours after \nLas Americas first sought to locate her. \n124. On the following day, November 22, at around 2:48 PM, Border Patrol informed Las \nAmericas that the prospective client had in fact gone through the immigration judge review process \nsometime on November 20. The immigration judge had already affirmed the adverse credible fear \ndetermination and had ordered Las Americas’ prospective client removed. \n125. Las Americas has to date been unable to connect with any individual in PACR or HARP \nprior to the completion of their credible fear proceedings. In contrast, Las Americas regularly \nconnects with and represents individuals in ICE custody in their credible fear proceedings, \nincluding prior to the credible fear interview itself. \nB.  Individual Plaintiffs A.R.R.D. and her son, L.E.R.D. \n126. A.R.R.D. fled El Salvador with her now seven-month-old son, L.E.R.D., to seek asylum in \nthe United States. Gang members have repeatedly extorted A.R.R.D. and threatened her life and \nthe life of her son. \n127. In 2015, A.R.R.D. owned a small restaurant where she sold Mexican food.  She worked \nfor the city during the day and at the restaurant at night.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 29 of 48\n128. One day that year, gang members arrived at her house.  A man knocked on her door and \nthen passed her a phone.  The person on the phone said that he was calling from jail and represented \nthe 18th Street gang.  He started yelling obscenities at A.R.R.D. and told her that if she did not pay \nthe gang 1,000 U.S. dollars they would kill her family members one by one so that she could see \nhow they died, and then they would kill her. \n129. A.R.R.D. ended up selling the chairs and other supplies from her restaurant to pay the gang \nthe money and then was forced to close her restaurant and go work for the city full time. \n130. In early September 2019, two members of the same gang that threatened A.R.R.D. in 2015 \nreturned to her house. They knocked and slammed at the door until she opened it.  When she \nopened it, she had her baby, L.E.R.D., in her arms. The gang members said they were from the \n18th Street gang and that A.R.R.D had one week to give them 3,000 U.S. dollars.  They pointed a \ngun at her child’s head, and said if she did not pay, they would kill A.R.R.D. and her baby. \n131. That night, A.R.R.D. grabbed her wallet and left the house with her son.  She left so quickly \nthat she did not even bring a spare change of clothes. \n132. The next day, A.R.R.D. went to the police to file a complaint. The police officer who took \nher statement told her that she should flee the country with her son because the gang would kill \nher if she could not pay and the police could do nothing. Following that conversation, A.R.R.D. \nfled with L.E.R.D. While traveling to the U.S border to seek asylum, L.E.R.D.’s grandmother \ntexted A.R.R.D. to inform her that the gang members were looking everywhere for her, saying \nthey would kill her if they found her. \n133. On or about October 8, 2019, A.R.R.D and L.E.R.D. crossed the Rio Grande into the \nUnited States near El Paso. They were looking for Border Patrol in order to seek asylum. They \nwere apprehended by Border Patrol that same day and taken to a CBP facility. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 30 of 48\n134. A.R.R.D. and L.E.R.D. were placed in a cold cell that other detainees called a hielera. \n135. On or about October 9, 2019, A.R.R.D. was taken to a room by Border Patrol agents and \nwas shown a video in Spanish. The video explained that A.R.R.D. was going to be given something \ncalled a credible fear interview in the next 24 hours, but A.R.R.D. did not understand the video. \n136. On or about October 11, 2019, A.R.R.D. and L.E.R.D. were taken to a room and given a \nphone and a list of names with phone numbers. The agent who escorted them to the room told \nA.R.R.D. that she had 30 minutes to call her family members or one of the attorneys on the list. \nAlthough she tried calling several of the attorneys, no one answered. A.R.R.D. had no way to leave \na message or to receive a call back.  She then called her sister-in-law, and they spoke for \napproximately 10 minutes.  During the entirety of A.R.R.D.’s time in CBP custody, she had no \nother opportunity to use a telephone, and she did not hear from her sister-in-law again. For the rest \nof her time in CBP custody, she repeatedly asked Border Patrol agents for access to a phone to call \nher family, but they always refused any other access. \n137. On or about October 13, 2019, A.R.R.D. had her credible fear interview. She was very \nconfused throughout the interview. \n138. On or about October 14, 2019, a Border Patrol agent informed A.R.R.D. that she had not \npassed the interview and that she could request a review of that determination by an immigration \njudge. \n139. On or about October 15, 2019, A.R.R.D. was taken into a room in the facility to speak with \nan immigration judge by phone. She was again confused by the process.  At the end of the ten-\nminute interview, the immigration judge explained that she had failed the interview and that she \nwould soon be removed. A.R.R.D. never received further notification as to the immigration judge’s \nfinal decision on her case. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 31 of 48\n140. On or about October 17, 2019, Border Patrol agents took her into a room in the facility and \ntold her to sign some documents in English. Although she signed the papers, she does not know \nwhat they were.  \n141. During the time that A.R.R.D. was held in detention, she and L.E.R.D. had to sleep on the \nfloor. At no time was she able to speak with an attorney about her asylum case.  \n142. DHS removed A.R.R.D. and her son to El Salvador on or around October 21, 2019. \n143. A.R.R.D. and her son are currently in hiding in a small town in El Salvador. She is afraid \nto disclose her location because gang members are looking for her and her family. A.R.R.D. and \nL.E.R.D. remain indoors at all times.  A.R.R.D. has not left the house since being removed, not \neven to take L.E.R.D. to a doctor.  She is afraid for her life and L.E.R.D.’s life while they remain \nin El Salvador. \nC.  Individual Plaintiffs A.S.C.R., K.M.V., and F.B.G.C. \n144. In late September 2019, A.S.C.R., her husband K.M.V., and their now 14-month-old \ndaughter F.B.G.C. fled El Salvador to seek asylum in the United States. The family had received \nmultiple death threats from gang members. \n145. In El Salvador, K.M.V. worked for a trucking company and was often out of the country. \n146. In late August 2019, two gang members showed up at the family’s door.  They both started \nknocking on the door—very aggressively.  One of the men said that they knew A.S.C.R. was alone \nwith her children and that her husband was out of town.  They demanded a 3,000 U.S. dollar \npayment to the gang, and said that if A.S.C.R. did not pay that she and her children would end up \nin body bags. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 32 of 48\n147. A.S.C.R. and her family tried to flee to a different municipality where her mother lived, \nbut there a gang member approached K.M.V. and told him that if he did not leave, there would be \nconsequences. \n148. The family then tried to report the gang threats to the police, but the police said they should \nflee the country if they could because the gangs would not stop pursuing them.  They fled the next \nday. \n149. On or about October 8, 2019, A.S.C.R., K.M.V., and F.B.G.C. crossed the Rio Grande into \nthe United States near El Paso. They were looking for Border Patrol in order to seek asylum. They \nwere apprehended by Border Patrol that same day and taken to a CBP facility. \n150. After approximately a day in CBP detention, A.S.C.R., K.M.V., and F.B.G.C. were taken \nto a room with other detainees and showed a video. The video explained that they would receive \na credible fear interview to determine if they could apply for asylum. A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. found \nthe video confusing and did not understand the process. \n151. Two days later, on or about October 10, 2019, CBP agents took the family out of the cells \nin which they were detained. The agents put them in a small room with a wireless phone and a list \nof names and phone numbers for, the agents said, lawyers. A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. were told they \nhad 30 minutes to make calls. The door to the room was open, and the agents were just outside. \nThe list had around 15 names on it, and the couple do not remember seeing any organizations on \nthe list. \n152. Before they were given the 30 minutes to make phone calls, A.S.C.R. had spoken with \nother asylum seekers in her cell who went through the same experience. They told her that they \nhad called many names on the list but that no one had ever answered. Because of that, her cellmates \nreferred to the list as “the list of ghosts.” \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 33 of 48\n153. A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. tried calling two names on the list, but no one answered.  Because \nthey only had 30 minutes remaining and had been told that no ever answered from that list, they \nused the rest of the time to call A.S.C.R.’s sister-in-law.  A.S.C.R. was able to speak with her \nsister-in-law for approximately 10 minutes. She told her that she was currently under arrest by \nCBP. \n154. After that 30-minute window, A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. were given no other opportunity to \nuse a telephone during the credible fear screening process. They did not hear from A.S.C.R.’s \nsister-in-law again for the remaining time they were detained by CBP. \n155. On or around the following day, October 11, 2019, A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. had their \ninterview with an asylum officer. They found the interview to be very confusing. A.S.C.R. and \nK.M.V. did not feel like they had a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the interview because \nthey had no understanding of what it would be like. \n156. On or about October 16, 2019, A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. were informed that they had not \npassed the fear interview. They requested review of the decision by an immigration judge.   \nA.S.C.R. and K.M.V. were not given another opportunity to contact counsel or family members \nbefore the review by the immigration judge. \n157. On or around October 18, 2019, after an approximately five-minute telephonic hearing in \nwhich only K.M.V. was able to speak, an immigration judge denied their appeal. A CBP agent \nthen informed A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. that there was no way to appeal that decision and that they \nwould be removed. \n158. Over the approximately 20 days that the family was in CBP custody, their young daughter \nF.B.G.C. barely ate. She could only consume breast milk, and A.S.C.R. was too weak to produce \nenough to feed her. F.B.G.C. also exhibited signs of illness: she had a consistent fever and was \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 34 of 48\nvery red. A.S.C.R. thought F.B.G.C. would die if they were forced to remain in CBP detention any \nlonger. A.S.C.R. felt they had to get out of CBP custody, no matter what, to save her daughter’s \nlife. \n159. A few days later, CBP agents told A.S.C.R. and K.M.V. that the immigration judge had \nofficially upheld the negative finding from their interview and they would be deported soon.  On \nor about October 28, 2019, A.S.C.R., K.M.V., and F.B.G.C. were removed to El Salvador. \n160. Since being sent back to El Salvador, the family has been in hiding, along with A.R.R.D. \nand her son, in a different part of the country from their previous home. They cannot leave the \nhouse or otherwise go out in public, because they know the gang can identify them and harm or \nkill them. They are brought food by relatives, but they will not set foot outside of the house for \nfear of risking their lives and the lives of their children. \nD.  Individual Plaintiffs B.G.R., D.M.F.G., B.C.F.G., J.M.F.G., and S.F.G. \n161. In late September 2019, Plaintiffs B.G.R., her husband, and her children D.M.F.G., \nB.C.F.G., J.M.F.G., and S.F.G., who are 8, 7, 5, and 2 respectively, fled Michoacán, Mexico \nafter B.G.R.’s father was disappeared and the family received numerous threats to their lives.   \n162. In Michoacán, B.G.R.’s husband had a small business selling shoes and clothing. B.G.R. \ncared for the children at home.  \n163. Her father owned a small ranch with horses and other animals. In July 2019, he was on \nhis way to his ranch when he was disappeared by cartel members. B.G.R. has not seen her father \nsince. \n164. Soon after her father disappeared, a member of a drug cartel called B.G.R. and asked her \nfor 500,000 Mexican pesos (about $25,000) in exchange for her father. B.G.R. asked for proof \nthat her father was alive but never received an answer. She has not seen her father again.  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 35 of 48\n165. On or about September 15, 2019, a cartel member called B.G.R.’s husband and told him \nthat they had to pay the cartel 4,000 Mexican pesos (about $200) a month in order to continue \noperating their business. They told her husband that if they did not pay the cartel they would kill \nB.G.R. and her family.  \n166. On or about September 20, 2019, cartel members called B.G.R.’s husband again and told \nhim that the family had to pay up. If they did not, the cartel said, they would kill B.G.R. and her \nchildren. They also told B.G.R.’s husband that the family should forget about B.G.R’s father, \nbecause he was gone and would never come back.  \n167. They told her husband specifically where their children went to school, where they lived, \nand what areas they tended to frequent.  \n168. B.G.R also noticed that strange men with guns had begun following her around town.  \n169. After this call, B.G.R. and her husband became very scared and decided to flee Mexico. \nThey did not place a report with the police because it is well known that the cartel controls the \npolice. They have seen cartel members threaten people and the police then arrest those persons \nwho were threatened. Those persons are then either disappeared or murdered.  \n170. On or about September 26, 2019, B.G.R. and her family arrived in Ciudad Juárez, \nMexico. They went straight to the Cordova International Bridge in order to cross into the United \nStates and request asylum. CBP agents initially refused them entry to the United States. They \nwere then placed on a list of Mexican asylum seekers. Accordingly, they lived in a tent \nencampment at the base of the bridge for almost two months while waiting on the list. \n171. On November 20, 2019, B.G.R and her family were allowed to cross into the United \nStates to request asylum. They were taken to a CBP facility, where B.G.R. and her children were \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 36 of 48\nseparated from her husband.  B.G.R. does not know why they were separated.  She has not seen \nher husband since they were separated.   \n172. A few hours after they arrived at the CBP facility, two men entered the room with B.G.R. \nand identified themselves as officers.  They asked B.G.R. questions about why she and her \nchildren were seeking asylum.  When B.G.R. explained her story, the officers laughed at her and \naccused her of lying.  They said her father was not dead and was probably lying in bed next to \nher mother. The men also asked for evidence, and so B.G.R. gave them the police report from \nher father’s disappearance. \n173. A few hours later that day, B.G.R. and her children were taken into another room with \ncomputers.  A guard in a blue uniform asked them questions and input the answers into a \ncomputer.  He asked them where they were from and why they were fleeing and requested \ninformation about the people they were fleeing from.  That questioning lasted approximately 30 \nminutes.  \n174. That night, B.G.R. and her children slept on the floor of a room on top of a mattress with \na very thin blanket.  \n175. The next day they were transferred to another CBP facility.  B.G.R. and her children were \nplaced in a small cell inside the building.  B.G.R. overheard a guard tell another detainee that \nthey were staying in a hielera.  \n176. In the hieleras, B.G.R. and her children slept on the floor. They were not given a \nmattress. \n177. On or about November 21, 2019, a guard came and took B.G.R. and her children into a \nroom that had a desk with two chairs and a wireless phone.  The guard told B.G.R. that she had \none hour and that this was her opportunity to call family.  He also handed her a list of names and \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 37 of 48\nphone numbers and told her it was a list of attorneys she could call. B.G.R. tried calling her \nfamily members, but no one answered.  She also tried calling some of the names on the list, but \nno one answered.   \n178. On or about November 22, 2019, the guards came and removed everyone else from the \nhielera, except for B.G.R. and her children. She was then handed a wireless phone over which \nshe had her asylum interview. B.G.R. was not prepared for the interview, nor did she understand \nthe purpose of the interview.  \n179. While in CBP custody, S.F.G.—B.G.R.’s youngest child—had developed a fever. He was \ntaken to a doctor in the CBP facility. The doctor said there was nothing wrong with him and \nrefused to give him any medicine. Another of B.G.R.’s children refused to eat while detained.   \n180. The day after the asylum interview, a guard came into the room. He did not speak \nSpanish.  Instead, he used his cell phone to translate. The guard told B.G.R. that she had failed \nher interview and failed to qualify to stay in the United States. He asked B.G.R if she wanted to \nappeal that decision but stated that if she did so she and her children would stay in detention until \nthe resolution of the case. Under the guard’s pressure and fearing for her children’s health, she \ndid not appeal the decision. The guard handed her some documents in English to sign, but she \ndoes not know what they were and did not get a copy.   \n181. On or about November 24, B.G.R. and her children were moved to the tent area of El \nPaso Station 1, where they slept on a mattress on the floor.  B.G.R. asked to try to call her \nfamily, but she was told that she could not make calls from that facility.  \n182. On or about November 29, B.G.R. and her children were removed back to Ciudad Juárez, \nMexico.   \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 38 of 48\n183. After their removal, B.G.R. received a call from her husband, who is currently detained \nin an ICE facility in New Mexico.   \n184. B.G.R. and her children are currently sleeping in the tent encampment at the base of the \nCordova International Bridge. They do not know where to go or what to do.  B.G.R. is afraid for \nher life and the lives of her children.  \n185. While B.G.R. was detained, she did not speak with an attorney or with any family \nmember outside the CBP facility. \nVI.  PACR and HARP Erroneously Return Asylum Seekers, Including the Individual \nPlaintiffs, to Places Where They Face Potential Harm. \n \n186. PACR and HARP set asylum seekers up for failure in the credible fear process—no matter \nhow strong their claims for protection. By forcing asylum seekers to proceed through the credible \nfear process while essentially incommunicado in CBP custody, without access to counsel, in \nconditions that otherwise significantly interfere with their ability to have a meaningful credible \nfear interview, and on a rushed timeline, PACR and HARP result in the erroneous removal of \npeople who are at risk of persecution, torture, and death. \n187. PACR and HARP deprived the individual Plaintiffs of a meaningful opportunity to access \ncounsel and to consult with family members and, therefore, to meaningfully access protections for \nrelief from removal. The individual Plaintiffs have been removed to the countries from which they \nfled, and they face significant danger to their lives while they remain there. \n188. PACR and HARP also have kept organizational Plaintiff Las Americas from accessing \nprospective clients in the credible fear process. Las Americas has sought to make contact with \nprospective clients in PACR and HARP without success. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 39 of 48\n189. If PACR and HARP remain in place, people who have claims for asylum or other forms of \nrelief and protection that require that they be placed in full immigration proceedings will be \nerroneously sent back to danger, persecution, or even death.  \n190. Congress specifically implemented procedural safeguards to prevent this kind of erroneous \ndeprivation of the right to apply for asylum, in requiring that individuals in the credible fear process \nhave access to counsel to ensure a meaningful opportunity to seek relief. With PACR and HARP, \nthe executive branch is attempting to effectuate an end run around the procedural safeguard of \naccess to counsel, by implementing policies that are not in accordance with the duly enacted law \nof the United States, with the executive branch’s own regulations, and with the fundamental goals \nof the asylum system: protecting those at risk of persecution or torture, and ensuring that all those \nwho may be eligible for protection have a full day in court. \nVII.  PACR and HARP Harm Organizational Plaintiff Las Americas. \n \n191. PACR and HARP have disrupted Las Americas’ operations in the El Paso area and forced \nthe organization to divert resources to attempt to provide legal and other assistance to asylum \nseekers in CBP detention. In doing so, they have greatly impaired Las Americas’ ability to \nrepresent asylum seekers detained in the El Paso area—which is critical to Las Americas’ mission. \nThese harms are exacerbated every day that PACR and HARP remain in effect. \n192. Las Americas seeks to provide direct legal services to individuals in PACR and HARP due \nto its long history of responding to urgent direct services needs for noncitizens in West Texas. If \nLas Americas is able to connect with individuals in PACR and HARP, it will seek to provide legal \nservices to those individuals. Las Americas has attempted to connect with such individuals in order \nto provide legal services and has been unable to do so. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 40 of 48\n193. In response to the extraordinarily narrow windows of time that individuals in PACR and \nHARP have to speak with an attorney, Las Americas has re-trained its intake staff to attempt to \nidentify and elevate calls from or on behalf of individuals in PACR and HARP—for example, calls \nin which the individual expresses a particularly urgent need to speak with an attorney or a third \nparty says they are unable to further contact an individual in immigration proceedings. Las \nAmericas intake staff has created a separate tracker for calls from individuals who are in either \nPACR or HARP and now attempts to immediately contact an attorney while the caller is still on \nthe line.  Las Americas will now staff a separate phone line with a dedicated legal assistant in order \nto free up a line solely for the purpose of providing representation to asylum seekers in the PACR \nand HARP programs. \n194. PACR and HARP require Las Americas’ director of legal services to divert time from Las \nAmericas’ docket working with individuals detained in ICE custody in anticipation of possible \ncalls from asylum seekers in PACR and HARP. The director of legal services now is on call, ready \nto respond within hours to prepare those asylum seekers for the interview and to otherwise engage \nwith asylum seekers in the credible fear process. From November 20, 2019 to December 3, 2019, \nLas Americas’ director of legal services devoted approximately 60% of her time to attempting to \nlocate and consult with individuals in PACR and HARP. The time that the legal services director \nhas expended attempting to locate prospective clients in PACR and HARP is time that she has not \ndevoted to supervising attorneys, working on behalf of asylum seekers, preparing for upcoming \nlitigation on behalf of asylum seekers, and doing additional advocacy work regarding detention \nconditions at ICE facilities where her clients are detained. \n195. In an attempt to account for the obstacles to access imposed by PACR and HARP, Las \nAmericas sent a paralegal to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico to screen and sign up for representation \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 41 of 48\nMexican asylum seekers who could be subject to the HARP program.  CBP has not been able to \nlocate the five clients signed up through this method in their systems.  \n196. As a result of CBP’s failure to provide timely information concerning and access to clients \nand potential clients, Las Americas is implementing plans to conduct CFI and RFI preparations in \nCiudad Juárez. Pro bono counsel often assist Las Americas in providing CFI and RFI preparation \nand  representation  for  clients  detained  in  ICE  custody.    However,  pro  bono  counsel  are \nsignificantly less likely to cross into Mexico to assist in these efforts. Las Americas therefore will \nbe forced to extend resources beyond those required in similar cases where clients are in the United \nStates or in ICE custody. \n197. If PACR and HARP continue, Las Americas will be forced to hire additional staff. Las \nAmericas will divert funds that it would have put into communications as well as previously \nplanned staff raises designed to encourage retention. Hiring the additional staff member will \nresult in additional costs, in terms of time invested in the hiring process and time invested in on-\nboarding and training. If PACR and HARP continue and Las Americas were to choose not to \nhire an additional staff member, it would need to decrease its representation for adult detainees in \nother settings—scaling back its representation in bond, parole, and full asylum proceedings—due \nto resource constraints.  \n198. Las Americas is working to develop a rapid response intake system for detained individuals \nthat includes rapid intakes, preparation for the credible fear interview, and the ability to engage in \nfull asylum legal representation. It has a grant contingent on this work to serve detained adults in \nICE custody. Las Americas will have to work to attempt to rearrange the grant if PACR and HARP \ncontinue. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 42 of 48\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n199. All of the foregoing allegations are incorporated by reference in each of the following \nclaims. \nFIRST CLAIM \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv)) \n200. The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), provides that a \nnoncitizen in credible fear proceedings within the expedited removal process “may consult with a \nperson or persons of [their] choosing prior to” a credible fear “interview or any review thereof, \naccording to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.” \n201. Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(B)(iv) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel or otherwise consulting with \nindividuals of their choosing during the credible fear process.  \nSECOND CLAIM \n(Violation of 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4)) \n202. Federal regulations governing credible fear proceedings for those in expedited removal \nprovide that a noncitizen “may consult with a person or persons of [their] choosing prior to” a \ncredible fear “interview or any review thereof.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4). Under the regulation, \n“Any person or persons with whom the alien chooses to consult may be present at the interview \nand may be permitted, in the discretion of the asylum officer, to present a statement at the end of \nthe interview.” Id. \n203. Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 C.F.R. § \n208.30(d)(4) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel or otherwise consulting with \nindividuals of their choosing during the credible fear process. Defendants’ acts also violate 8 \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 43 of 48\nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4) by preventing counsel and other individuals that asylum seekers choose to \nconsult from being present at the credible fear interview. \nTHIRD CLAIM \n \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362; Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b)) \n \n204. The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362, provides that “[i]n any removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of being \nrepresented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such \nproceedings, as he shall choose.” \n205. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides that “[a] person compelled \nto appear in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, \nrepresented,  and  advised  by  counsel  or,  if  permitted  by  the  agency,  by  other  qualified \nrepresentative. A party is entitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified \nrepresentative in an agency proceeding.” Individuals subject to expedited removal procedures are \ncompelled  to  appear  in  person  before  agency  representatives.  Congress  has  not  exempted \nexpedited removal proceedings from the procedural protections provided in § 555(b). \n206. Defendants’ PACR and HARP programs and their implementation violate 8 U.S.C. § 1362 \nand 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) by preventing individuals from accessing counsel during the credible fear \nprocess, including in the credible fear interview itself. \nFOURTH CLAIM \n \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n \n207. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, provides that a Court “shall hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions” that are “arbitrary, capricious, an \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 44 of 48\nabuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law”  and  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” \n208. The PACR and HARP programs are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \ncontrary to law. Among other reasons, the programs are arbitrary and capricious because they \nentirely failed to consider important aspects of the problem, including that the programs deny \nasylum seekers the ability to consult with counsel and other persons of their own choosing and to \nhave those representatives present at the credible fear interviews and immigration judge review \nand that the programs do not take into account the effect of the conditions of confinement in CBP \nfacilities on asylum seekers’ credible fear interviews; the programs depart from prior policies \nwithout acknowledgment of or a reasoned explanation for the departure; and the programs are \nillogical and irrational. The programs are also contrary to law allowing asylum seekers to consult \nwith persons of their own choosing, including counsel, prior to credible fear interviews and to \nreview by an immigration judge and to have those individuals present at credible fear interviews. \nFIFTH CLAIM \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Convention Against Torture, the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, and Implementing Regulations) \n \n209. The Immigration and Nationality Act and implementing regulations, including 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1), 8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(4), 208.30, and 1003.42 (expedited removal); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 \n(asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (withholding of removal); and CAT, implemented in the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title \nXXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note) entitle \nindividuals to a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT \nrelief,  as  well  as  numerous  procedural  safeguards  in  connection  with  those  applications. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 45 of 48\nDefendants, through their implementation of the PACR and HARP programs, have violated these \nstatutory and regulatory rights in multiple respects, including by: \na.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to consult with and be assisted by \nattorneys or others prior to and during the credible fear process and the immigration \njudge review process, and to have attorneys or others present at the credible fear \ninterview; and \nb.  Maintaining  conditions  that  hinder  the  ability  to  meaningfully  participate  in \ncredible fear proceedings, including the credible fear interview. \n \nSIXTH CLAIM \n \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution) \n \n210. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides \nthat “[n]o person shall . . .  be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.” \n211. The individual Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers have protected interests in applying for \nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, in obtaining withholding of removal and CAT \nrelief upon a showing that meets the applicable standards, and in not being removed to a country \nwhere they face serious danger and potential loss of life.   \n212. The individual Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers are entitled under the Due Process \nClause to a fair hearing as to their eligibility for asylum and other relief from removal, including \nat a minimum a procedure that is in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory standards.   \n213. Defendants,  through  their  implementation  of  HARP  and  PACR,  have  violated  the \nIndividual Plaintiffs’ and other asylum seekers’ rights to due process, including by: \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 46 of 48\na.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to consult with and be assisted by \nattorneys or others prior to and during the credible fear process and the immigration \njudge review process, and to have attorneys or others present at the credible fear \ninterview; and \nb.  Effectively denying a meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of \nremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and relief from removal under CAT. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court grant the following relief: \n1.  Declare Defendants’ policies requiring that individuals and families remain in CBP custody \nfor  the  duration  of  their  credible  fear  proceedings  and  the  actions  and  practices  of \nDefendants described above contrary to law; \n2.  Enter an order vacating the programs keeping individuals and families in CBP custody for \nthe duration of their credible fear proceedings, including but not limited to all written \npolicies and guidance issued by DHS and DOJ regarding PACR and HARP; \n3.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendants and their directors, officers, agents, and \nemployees from continuing to apply the new programs to individuals and families who are \nplaced in credible fear proceedings;  \n4.  Enter an order vacating the expedited removal orders issued to each of the individual \nPlaintiffs; \n5.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants to provide each of the individual Plaintiffs with a new \ncredible fear process or, in the alternative, full immigration court removal proceedings \npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; to return Plaintiffs to the United States at no expense to \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 47 of 48\nPlaintiffs; and to parole Plaintiffs into the United States for the duration of those credible \nfear and/or removal proceedings; \n6.  Enter an order staying the credible fear proceedings of persons currently subject to PACR \nand HARP in the El Paso sector until they have been either paroled or transferred to ICE \ncustody and have had an adequate opportunity to access counsel; and, for those who have \nalready received an adverse determination in a credible fear interview, vacating any \nnegative finding and/or removal order and enjoining Defendants from removing them until \nthey have been provided with a new credible fear process fully compliant with law or, in \nthe alternative, full immigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; \n7.  Enter an order enjoining Defendants to provide those previously subject to PACR and \nHARP with a new credible fear process fully compliant with law or, in the alternative, full \nimmigration court removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; to return them to the \nUnited States at no expense; and to parole them into the United States for the duration of \nthose credible fear and/or removal proceedings; \n8.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, \nand any other applicable statute or regulation; and \n9.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n \n   \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 2   Filed 12/05/19   Page 48 of 48\nDated: December 5, 2019             Respectfully submitted, \n  /s/ Arthur B.

No. 1:19-cv-3640 (KBJ) \n \nCHAD WOLF,  \nin his official capacity, Acting Secretary of the  \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al.,  \n   \n     Defendants. \n \n_______________________________________ \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, Plaintiffs Las Americas Immigrant \nAdvocacy Center; A.R.R.D. and her minor child, L.E.R.D.; A.S.C.R, K.M.V., and their minor \nchild F.B.G.C.; and B.G.R. and her minor children, D.M.F.G., B.C.F.G., J.M.F.G., and S.F.G. \nrespectfully move this Court for summary judgment on all counts raised in their Amended \nComplaint, Dkt. No. 2.  \nAs explained in the accompanying memorandum, Defendants have put in place a new \npolicy of detaining asylum seekers in CBP facilities throughout their asylum screening process, \nwithout any meaningful opportunity to access prospective or retained counsel or other third \nparties and in appalling conditions. Defendants’ policy change is unlawful in several ways. It is \narbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). It violates \nclear statutory and regulatory requirements that noncitizens in credible fear proceedings have \naccess to counsel and the ability to consult with other third parties. Moreover, it violates \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 35   Filed 01/27/20   Page 2 of 3\nstatutory and regulatory guarantees that noncitizens may apply for asylum and are entitled to \nwithholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231 and relief pursuant to the Convention Against \nTorture if they meet the relevant criteria. Finally, it deprives asylum seekers of due process in \nviolation of the Constitution. This motion is based on the accompanying memorandum; the \nAdministrative Record provided by Defendants; the evidence filed in support of the \nmemorandum; the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. No. 21, including the evidence filed \nin support; and such oral arguments and evidence as may be presented at a hearing on the \nmotion. Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to prevail on all their claims and are entitled to relief on \nall claims as a matter of law. A proposed order is attached for the Court’s convenience. \n \nDated: January 27, 2020              Respectfully submitted,  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03640-KBJ   Document 35   Filed 01/27/20   Page 3 of 3\n   /s/Andre Segura \n   \nArthur B.

Executive Office of the \nPresident, 196 F.R.D. 201, 202 (D.D.C. 2000) (Calendar \nCommittee three-judge panel). A plaintiff that seeks to depart from \nthat general rule \"bears the burden of demonstrating that the case is \na related case under an applicable subsection of Rule 40.5.\" Tripp v. \nExecutive Office of the President, 194 F.R.D. 340, 342 (D.D.C. \n2000). The two cases at issue here, Las Americas Immigrant \nAdvocacy Center V. Wolf et al., 19-cv-3640, and L.M.-M. et al. v. \nCuccinelli et al., 19-cv-2676, challenge different policies, \nimplemented by different component-agencies, and turn on different \nlegal theories. Moreover, it is not sufficient that the two cases touch \non the same general subject matter; that is, that the two cases \nchallenge policies that allegedly restrict asylum seekers' access to \ncounsel during the credible fear process. The Court, accordingly, \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of showing \nthat the cases are related for the purposes of Local Rule 40.5(a)(3). \nThus, it is hereby ORDERED that this case shall be randomly \nreassigned pursuant to Local Rule 40.3(a).
