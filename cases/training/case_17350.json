After many issues of Prison Legal News were withheld from prisoners in Michigan from 2016 to 2019, HRDC filed this lawsuit on August 22, 2019, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. it sued the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) under Section 1983. HRDC was represented by its own counsel, along with co-counsel from Honigman and the MSU Law School Civil Rights Clinic. The complaint alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and sought injunctive and declaratory relief, compensatory, punitive, and nominal damages, attorneys' fees, and a jury trial. </p><p>Specifically, the complaint alleged that issues of Prison Legal News, as well as some other one-off HRDC publications, were withheld from prisoners between September 2016 and July 2019. Different issues were withheld at different prisons, and the complaint lists 22 different Michigan prisons where materials were withheld at some point. This is the alleged censorship under the First Amendment. HRDC also alleged that MDOC almost never provided notice that it was withholding materials, and failed to offer any process for HRDC to appeal its decision. HRDC did appeal a few times by sending letters to some of the prisons in question, and those appeals were all denied except for one. This is the alleged Fourteenth Amendment due process claim.</p><p>The judge on the case is Judge Thomas L. Ludington. On Jan. 6, 2020, the judge denied injunctive relief and dismissed all defendants except for the Director of MDOC. 431 F.Supp.3d 925. Discovery is due at the end of July 2020, and a settlement conference and pre-trial hearing are also scheduled. </p>",

Ludington \n          \nv. \n \nO’BELL WINN, et. al, \n \n  Defendants. \n____________________________/ \n \nORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO \nDISMISS AND DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \n \nOn August 22, 2019, Plaintiff, Human Rights Defense Center, filed a complaint against \nDefendants: Prison Wardens O’Bell Winn, Bonita Hoffner, Willie Smith, and Carmen Palmer, 30 \nunnamed prison employee Does, and Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) Director \nHeidi Washington. ECF No. 1. Plaintiff is a publisher of magazines and materials, such as Prison \nLegal News for inmates about “prisons, jails, and other detention facilities, prisoners’ rights, court \nrulings, management of prison facilities, prison conditions, and other matters pertaining to the \nrights  and/or  interests  of  incarcerated  individuals.”  Id.  at  PageID.6.  Plaintiff  alleges  that \nDefendants have censored and withheld its publications to prisoners in Michigan, violating the \nFirst Amendment (Count I) and the due process clause from the Fourteenth Amendment (Count \nII).  Id.  at  PageID.32–34.  Plaintiff  seeks  monetary  damages  against  all  Defendants  in  their \nindividual  capacities  on  the  First  Amendment  and  due  process  claims.  Plaintiff  also  seeks \ninjunctive relief against Director Washington in her official capacity on both claims and a \ndeclaratory judgment that MDOC violated the Constitution.  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.313    Page 2 of 29\nOn the same day Plaintiff filed the complaint, it also filed a motion for preliminary \ninjunction, seeking to enjoin Defendants from “(1) censoring written materials mailed by HRDC \nto prisoners in Defendants’ prisons and (2) denying HRDC notice and an opportunity to challenge \nany such censorship decisions.” ECF No. 3. In September and October, the parties stipulated to \nextend the time for Defendants to respond to the complaint and Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary \ninjunction. ECF Nos. 18, 21. On October 18, 2019, Defendants jointly filed a motion to dismiss \nall claims, except the First Amendment claim against Defendant Washington in her official \ncapacity. ECF No. 22. As explained below, Defendants motion to dismiss will be granted in part \nand denied in part. Also, Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction will be denied. \nI. \n \n  Plaintiff, Human Rights Defense Center, is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit entity that “publishes \nthe monthly newsprint journal Prison Legal News, the longest-running independent newsprint \njournal concerning prisons and detention centers in the United States, along with publications \nfocusing on prisoner rights issues.” ECF No. 24 at PageID.212-213. Plaintiff also publishes a \nCriminal Legal News publication, sends books to prisoners, and “corresponds regularly with \nprisoners on constitutional issues and potential violations of their civil rights.” Id. Defendant \nO’Bell Winn is the Warden of the Saginaw Correctional Facility, Bonita Hoffner was the Warden \nof Lakeland Correctional Facility from May 2012 to December 2017, Willie Smith was Warden \nof Ionia Correctional Facility from October 2002 to May 2018, and Carmen Palmer was Warden \nof Michigan Reformatory at times relevant for the case. ECF Id. at PageID.213-214. Defendant \nDoes 1 through 30 “are or were employed by and are or were agents of MDOC when some or all \nof the challenged inmate mail policies and practices were adopted and/or implemented.” Id. at \nPageID.215. Defendant Heidi Washington “is, and at all relevant times herein mentioned was, the \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.314    Page 3 of 29\nDirector of MDOC, the state agency that manages the correctional facilities within the State of \nMichigan.” Id. at PageID.213. \nA. \n  In its amended complaint, Plaintiff explains that it “publishes and distributes a soft-cover \nmonthly journal titled Prison Legal News, which contains news and analysis about prisons, jails, \nand other detention facilities, prisoners’ rights, court rulings, management of prison facilities, \nprison conditions, and other matters pertaining to the rights and/or interests of incarcerated \nindividuals.  The  monthly  journal  is  published  on  newsprint  and  is  72-pages  long.”  Id.  at \nPageID.216. Plaintiff “also publishes and/or distributes approximately 40 different softcover \nbooks about the criminal justice system, legal reference books, and self-help books of interest to \nprisoners.” Id. at PageID.216. There are three publications relevant to this suit—Prison Legal \nNews, Criminal Legal News, and various books that HRDC publishes. Plaintiff has “46 subscribers \nto its monthly publication [Prison Legal News] within the MDOC” as of July 2019 with one to six \nsubscribers  at  each  of  the  following  prisons:  Baraga  Correctional  Facility,  Bellamy  Creek \nCorrectional Facility, Carson City Correctional Facility, Central Michigan Correctional Facility, \nChippewa  Correctional  Facility,  Cooper  Street  Correctional  Facility,  Earnest  C.  Brooks \nCorrectional Facility, G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility, Richard A. Handlon Correctional \nFacility, Gus Harrison Correctional Facility, Ionia Correctional Facility, Lakeland Correctional \nFacility,  Macomb  Correctional  Facility,  Marquette  Branch  Prison,  Michigan  Reformatory, \nMuskegon Correctional Facility, Oaks Correctional Facility, Saginaw Correctional Facility, and \nthe Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility. Id. at PageID.217-218.  \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.315    Page 4 of 29\nB. \n  Michigan Department of Corrections Policy Directive 05.03.118 governs the distribution \nof mail to prisoners. The relevant part of the 13-page policy states “Mail shall not be prohibited \nsolely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social, sexual, unpopular, or \nrepugnant.” Para. D. Books, magazines, and other similar publications are allowed only if ordered \nfrom an approved vendor or directly from the publisher, if it is mailed directly to the prisoner, or \nif it is from a correspondence school. Para. Z. The policy outlines prohibited mail, including “mail \nthat may pose a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the facility, facilitate or \nencourage criminal activity, or interfere with the rehabilitation of the prisoner.” Para. NN.  \nIf mail is received that violates the policy, it will be rejected. Para RR. If a prisoner has \nmail that has been rejected, a notice of rejection is sent to the prisoner and there is a multi-stage \nappeals process, including review by a hearings officer, the warden, and CFA Deputy Director. \nParas. VV-DDD. The sender of the rejected mail also will be sent a copy of the rejection notice. \nPara. VV. \nC. \n  In its complaint, Plaintiff alleges “Defendants have adopted and implemented mail policies \nand practices prohibiting delivery of written speech from HRDC while failing to provide due \nprocess notice of and an opportunity to challenge that censorship.” ECF No. 1 at PageID.1. \nPlaintiff alleges it “engages in core protected speech and expressive conduct on matters of public \nconcern, such as the operation of prison facilities, prison conditions, prisoner health and safety, \nand prisoners’ rights.” Id. at PageID.5. It “distribute[s] its monthly publication to prisoners and \nlaw librarians in more than 3,000 correctional facilities located across all 50 states, including the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons and MDOC.” Id. at PageID.7. Plaintiff alleges “certain prisons within \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.316    Page 5 of 29\nthe state of Michigan have withheld all or part of issues of [HRDC publications] . . . . [and] believes \nthat at least one officer at each prison . . . had direct knowledge of and were directly involved in \neach  and  every  instance  of  censorship.”  Id.  at  PageDI.9.  Plaintiff  claims  “prison  officials \nerroneously rejected issues of Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, on the grounds that \ncontent of the magazines’ articles posed a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the \nfacility,  facilitated  or  encouraged  criminal  activity,  or  interfered  with  the  rehabilitation  of \nprisoners” even though the publications “pose no threat to any legitimate penological interests.” \nId. at PageID.9. Plaintiff alleges 29 of 36 issues of Prison Legal News “were censored by at least \none MDOC facility” and some books HRDC sent to prisoners were also rejected because “HRDC \nwas not the publisher or authorized vendor.” Id. Additionally, despite MDOC’s policy stating \notherwise, Plaintiff alleges “a majority of MDOC facilities have a custom and practice of failing \nto send the required notice” of rejection to the sender. Id. at PageID.10. Even if MDOC gives \nnotice, it “does not provide a process to challenge censorship decisions” and “[i]n many cases \n[when HRDC appealed the rejection], the facility that censored the materials ignored the appeal.” \nId. at PageID.10. The rationale provided in the rejection notices HRDC did receive cited concerns \nabout “the security, good order, or discipline of the facility” or concerns the material “may \nfacilitate or encourage criminal activity, or may interfere with the rehabilitation of the prisoner.” \nId. at PageID.11, 12, 15, 25. Books were also rejected because “the sender is not the publisher[] \nand is not an authorized vendor.” Id. at PageID.12, 23.  \nII. \n \n  A pleading fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) if it does not contain allegations that \nsupport recovery under any recognizable legal theory. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). \nIn considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court construes the pleading in the non-movant’s favor \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.317    Page 6 of 29\nand accepts the allegations of facts therein as true. See Lambert v. Hartman, 517 F.3d 433, 439 \n(6th Cir. 2008). The pleader need not provide “detailed factual allegations” to survive dismissal, \nbut the “obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitle[ment] to relief’ requires more than labels \nand conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). In essence, the pleading “must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face” and \n“the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is \ninapplicable to legal conclusions.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678–79 (quotations and citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit has held that “a conclusory legal interest” in forfeited property is insufficient to \nbe successful against a motion to dismiss. United States v. Fabian, 764 F.3d 636, 638 (6th Cir. \n2014); United States v. Akhtar, 2018 WL 5883930 at *2 (6th Cir. Sept. 19, 2018).  \nIII. \n \n  Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s alleged violations of the First Amendment and the \ndue process clause against the four named wardens, Winn, Hoffner, Smith, and Palmer, 30 prison \nemployee Does, and MDOC Director Washington in their individual capacities under Fed. R. Civ. \nPro. 12(b)(6) on the basis of qualified immunity. ECF No. 22 at PageID.140-142. Defendants \nfurther seek to dismiss the due process claim against Defendant Washington in her official capacity \nunder 12(b)(6) because, at most, her behavior was negligent “which is not actionable under the \nDue Process Clause” or because the due process claim is moot. Id. at PageID.141, PageID.157.  \nA.  \n \n  The caption of the original complaint stated that Defendant Winn was sued in his official \ncapacity (ECF No. 1 at PageID.1), but the body of complaint indicated Defendant Winn was \nactually being sued in his individual capacity for monetary damages. ECF No. 1 at PageID.3 (“As \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.318    Page 7 of 29\nto all claims presented herein against him, Defendant Winn is being sued in his individual capacity \nfor damages.”). An individual sued in their individual capacity is being sued “for actions he takes \nunder color of law,” i.e., for actions Defendant Winn took during his job. Baar v. Jefferson Cty. \nBd. Of Educ., 476 Fed. Appx. 621, 634 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. \n159, 165 (1985)). In comparison, “[o]fficial capacity suits . . . ‘generally represent . . . another way \nof pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent,’” i.e., MDOC. Baar v. \nJefferson Cty. Bd. Of Educ., 476 Fed. Appx. 621, 634 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Kentucky v. \nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985)). Damages for individual capacity suits are recouped from the \ndefendant, but in an official capacity suit, any relief must come from the entity itself. Kentucky v. \nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).  \nDefendants argue any potential suit against Defendant Winn in his official capacity is \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. ECF No. 22 at PageID.155-157. Plaintiff does not address the \nissue in its response, but filed an amended complaint changing the caption of the complaint to \nclarify that Defendant Winn is being sued in his individual capacity. ECF No. 24 at PageID.211. \nDefendants included a footnote in their reply explaining the history of confusion over the suit \nagainst Defendant Winn and state “[i]t is agreed Def.’s motion to dismiss shall relate to the Pl.’s \namended complaint and Def. Winn also seeks dismissal for all claims against him in his individual \ncapacity.” ECF No. 30 at PageID.303. As such, Defendants argument that the suit against \nDefendant Winn is barred by the Eleventh Amendment will be disregarded and Defendant Winn \nwill be considered as a Defendant who seeks to dismiss the First Amendment and due process \nclaims based on qualified immunity in III.B.  \n \n \n \n \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.319    Page 8 of 29\nB. \n \nDefendant Wardens Winn,1 Hoffner, Smith, and Palmer, Director Washington, and 30 Does \nhave been sued in their individual capacity for monetary damages on both the First Amendment \nand due process claims. ECF No. 24 at PageID.242-244. Defendants argue they are eligible for \nqualified immunity on both claims.  \nQualified immunity is “an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.” \nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985). The doctrine protects government officials “from \nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 \nU.S. 800, 818 (1982). This is an objective standard. Ohio Civil Service Employees Association v. \nSeiter,  858  F.2d  1171,  1173  (6th  Cir.  1988).  “Qualified  immunity  balances  two  important \ninterests—the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly \nand the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their \nduties reasonably.” Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009). Qualified immunity protects \n“all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.” Malley v. Briggs, 475 \nU.S. 335, 341 (1986). \nThe existence of qualified immunity turns on the question of whether a defendant’s action \nviolated  clearly  established  law.  Id.  at  243–44.  “This  inquiry  turns  on  the  ‘objective  legal \nreasonableness of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the \ntime it was taken.’” Id. at 244 (quoting Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 614, (1999). “To be clearly \nestablished,  a  right  must  be  sufficiently  clear  ‘that  every  reasonable  official  would  [have \nunderstood] that what he is doing violates that right.’” Reichle v. Howards, 132 S. Ct. 2088, 2093 \n                                                 \n1 See supra Section III.a for explanation of why Defendant Winn is included here. \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.320    Page 9 of 29\n(2012). “[E]xisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond \ndebate.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 741 (2011). The Court has discretion regarding the \nsequence with which to conduct the analysis. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236. Thus, the Court may hold \nthat a right is not clearly established law without first analyzing whether the relevant facts actually \nestablish a constitutional violation. Id. The Sixth Circuit has emphasized the proper order to \nanalyze a qualified immunity claim is to determine if “the facts viewed in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiffs show that a constitutional violation has occurred,” second, if the violation was of \n“a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known,” and \nthird, if “plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence ‘to indicate that what the official allegedly did \nwas  objectively  unreasonable  in  light  of  the  clearly  established  constitutional  right.’” \nMerriweather v. Zamora, 569 F.3d 307, 315 (6th Circuit 2009). However, the Supreme Court has \nheld this order is not mandatory. Id.  \n“Once the qualified immunity defense is raised, the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate \nthat the officials are not entitled to qualified immunity.” Silberstein v. City of Dayton, 440 F.3d \n306, 311 (6th Cir. 2006). The relevant inquiry is whether “it would be clear to a reasonable officer \nthat his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 \n(2001). \nIn Lyons v. City of Xenia, the Sixth Circuit explains that for a constitutional right to be \nclearly established, the officers must be on notice of conduct that would violate a plaintiff’s rights. \nThere are two ways a plaintiff can demonstrate an officer was on notice of the constitutional \nright—“the violation was sufficiently ‘obvious’ under the general standards of constitutional care \nthat the plaintiff need not show ‘a body’ of ‘materially similar’ case law” or “where the violation \nis shown by the failure to adhere to a ‘particularized’ body of precedent that ‘squarely govern[s] \n- 9 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.321    Page 10 of 29\nthe case.” Lyons v. City of Xenia, 417 F.3d 565, 579 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Brosseau v. Haugen, \n543 U.S. 194, 599–600 (2004)). \ni. \n  Defendants first allege entitlement to qualified immunity on the First Amendment claim. \nWhether there is a clearly established constitutional right will be addressed first. Second, the facts \nwill be evaluated to determine if there is a violation of an alleged clearly established constitutional \nright. \na.  \n“To determine whether a right is ‘clearly established,’ we must first look to decisions of \nthe Supreme Court, then to decisions of [the Sixth Circuit] and courts within this Circuit, and last \nto decisions of other circuits.” Ciminillo v. Streicher, 434 F.3d 461, 468 (6th Cir. 2016). The \nstandard for review of prison policies challenged by the First Amendment “is whether the \nregulations are ‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interest.’” Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 \nU.S. 401, 404 (1994) (quoting Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)). This standard applies to \nboth the prisoners and third parties trying to contact the prisoners. Id. When evaluating prison \nregulations, the Supreme Court is clear that “Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison \ninmates from the protections of the Constitution . . . . Because prisoners retain these rights, ‘[w]hen \na prison regulation or practice offends a fundamental constitutional guarantee, federal courts will \ndischarge their duty to protect constitutional rights.’” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987) \n(quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405–06 (1974)). However, “courts are ill equipped \nto deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform.” Turner v. \nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987) (quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405 (1974)). “Where \na state penal system is involved, federal courts have . . . additional reason to accord deference to \nthe appropriate prison authorities.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 85.  \n- 10 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.322    Page 11 of 29\nEven though case law focuses on prisoners rights, the same deference granted to prison \nofficials when determining if a prisoner’s First Amendment rights have been violated also applies \nto publisher’s rights to contact or communicate with a prisoner. The Supreme Court articulated \nfour factors to determine  \nwhether a prison’s restriction on incoming publications was reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests: “(1) whether there is a valid, rational connection \nbetween the prison policy and the legitimate governmental interest asserted to \njustify it; (2) the existence of alternative means for inmates to exercise their \nconstitutional rights; (3) the impact that accommodation of these constitutional \nrights may have on other guards and inmates, and on the allocation of prison \nresources;  and  (4)  the  absence  of  ready  alternatives  as  evidence  of  the \nreasonableness of the regulation.” Harbin-Bey v. Rutter, 420 F.3d 571, 578 (6th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 917 (6th Cir. 1992) (citing \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89))).  \n \nIf the restriction or practice was reasonably related to legitimate prison concerns, there is no \nviolation of the First Amendment.  \nAddressing the first factor, a reasonable prison official could conclude that there is a \nrational connection between the denials of the HRDC publications and the security at the prison. \nFor example, a prison warden who has concerns that certain individuals who might seek to escape \nmight seek information about prisoners seeking to escape from other prisons. Or a prison warden \nmay be concerned that an article that alleges Michigan prisons are poisoning prisoners may incite \nviolence, thereby potentially harming the guards and other inmates in the prison. Security concerns \nare likely similar at most prisons, but not identical. On the second factor, the MDOC makes a \nprison by prison determination. This allows more prisoners to receive the publications than an out-\nright ban of all HRDC publications. If prison staff were required to be more uniform in their \nrejections, then anytime one facility has concerns with an HRDC publication, prisoners at other \nfacilities would not receive the issue. Or, if prison staff were required to distribute every issue, \n- 11 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.323    Page 12 of 29\nthere could be a particularly inflammatory article about a specific prison that could lead to unrest \nand security concerns at the highlighted prison, potentially causing harm to guards and inmates.  \nIn addition, MDOC policy articulates a review process for prisoners and senders of mail to \nchallenge a rejection. The third factor focuses on the effect of fully accommodating prisoners First \nAmendment rights on the safety of guards and other inmates. In this case, there could be security \nconcerns with the material. Most of HRDCs publications are allowed in most Michigan prisons \nbecause the information is not considered a security threat. However, as mentioned earlier, there \nmay be specific topics more likely to cause security concerns than others. The prison warden is in \nthe best position to evaluate what topics are likely to cause security risks, not a Court. Plaintiff \neven alleges that most of the rejection notices it received from MDOC facilities explained that the \nreason the publication was rejected was attributable to security concerns. If a warden is concerned \nthat material may cause a riot or disruption, he does not have to wait until problems emerge. See \nMurchison v. Rogers, 779 F.3d 882, 890 (8th Cir. 2015); Lawson v. Singletary, 85 F.3d 502, 512 \nn.15 (11th Cir. 1996). Concerns for safety and security are real and could have a significant impact \non the prison. The fourth factor explores the question of whether there are easy alternatives to the \ncurrent procedure. The only alternative to the current prison by prison determination is an outright \nban which would be more restrictive than the current policy or full disclosure which provides no \ndeference to prison officials.  \nIn addition, the two procedures for Defendants to be placed on notice that their conduct \nviolates Plaintiff’s rights are not satisfied.  The first criteria is “where the violation was sufficiently \n‘obvious under the general standards of constitutional care . . . the plaintiff need not show ‘a body’ \nof ‘materially similar’ case law.” Lyons, 417 F.3d at 579.  Here the violation was not sufficiently \nobvious. The Supreme Court has held that “there is no question that publishers who wish to \n- 12 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.324    Page 13 of 29\ncommunicate with those who . . . willingly seek their point of view have a legitimate First \nAmendment interest in access to prisoners.” Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 408 (1989). \nHowever, the Sixth Circuit has also explained that prisoners right to receive mail is “subject to \nrestriction in the interests of prison security” as long as the restrictions “further legitimate \npenological objectives, in a manner no more restrictive than necessary.” Brooks v. Seiter, 779 F.2d \n1177,  1180  (6th  Cir.  1985).  While  First  Amendment  cases  provide  that  defendants  cannot \narbitrarily prohibit prisoners from receiving mail, the case law also provides that deference should \nbe provided to prison officials to “further legitimate penological objectives.” Id. The deference \noutlined in case law is simply too discretionary for Defendants to be placed on notice that their \nbehavior violated a clearly established constitutional right.  \nThe second criteria is “failure to adhere to a ‘particularized’ body of precedent that \n‘squarely govern[s] the case.’” Lyons, 417 F.3d at 579. Just as the case law is not sufficiently \nconcrete for employees to be aware of an obvious violation of a prisoner’s First Amendment rights, \nthe contours of the law and the discretion provided to prison officials lacks sufficient clarity for \nemployees to be on notice of “particularized” legal precedent. Additionally, Defendants alleged \nactions were in line with the current case law precedent. Instead of forwarding all HRDC \npublications  (which  Defendants  argue  could  decrease  prison  safety)  or  denying  all  HRDC \npublications (which would violate prisoner’s First Amendment rights), employees evaluated each \nissue of Prison Legal News at each prison every month. The result as alleged by Plaintiff may \nappear arbitrary, but Plaintiff has not asserted any action on the part of any MDOC employee \nwhere the employee inappropriately or inaccurately claimed prison security was at risk when in \nfact it was not. There is sufficient deference in the standard and the individualized nature of the \nreview of mail that it cannot be said that Defendants failed to adhere to the case precedent. In fact, \n- 13 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.325    Page 14 of 29\nbased on Plaintiff’s alleged data, when MDOC employees mailed rejection notices to HRDC, all \nthe notices claimed Prison Legal News was rejected due to security concerns generally or potential \ncriminal activity. Based on Plaintiff’s allegations, it appears Defendants reviewed each issue of \nPrison Legal News individually at each prison. The statistics proffered by Plaintiff do not indicate \nany sort of coordination between prisons. Therefore, if prison employees did reject or accept mail \non a month by month basis, their behavior conforms with the current case law framework of \nproviding prisoners access to mail while rejecting any items that could create a security concern. \nAgain, this process is better aligned with current precedent than an out-right ban on the materials.  \nIn  summary,  the  case  law  demonstrates  that  prisoners  and  publishers  have  a  First \nAmendment right to specific material that is sent from a publisher to a prisoner. However, \nsignificant deference is extended to prison officials when determining what publications should be \nrejected and what should be allowed to be sent to the prisoner. The contours of the case law is \nintentionally too deferential to prison officials and for a prison worker, warden, or MDOC director \nto be on sufficient notice of a clearly established constitutional right in order to violate it. Plaintiff’s \nFirst Amendment right is not clearly established because of the discretion extended to prison \nofficials to determine what mail is permitted in prisons. Therefore, Defendants could not have \nknown they were violating a clearly established constitutional right when deciding which issues \nof Prison Legal News and other HRDC publications to allow admittance into the prison and which \nones to prohibit. \nb. \nEven if there were a clearly established constitutional right, the facts do not support the \nassertion that Defendants violated that right. Once Defendants asserted a qualified immunity \ndefense, Plaintiff has the burden of alleging sufficient facts to demonstrate that a reasonable person \n- 14 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.326    Page 15 of 29\nwould have known that they were violating clearly established constitutional law. Defendants \nargue that even if there were a violation of established constitutional right, Defendants are still \neligible for qualified immunity because case law provides that 1) “security is the most important \nissue in a prison,” 2) “prison officials’ judgment as to prison safety and security is entitled to \ndeference,” and 3) “some level of inconsistency in review is tolerable” considering the amount of \nmail Defendants process daily. ECF No. 22 at PageID.165. Plaintiff responds that Defendants’ \nfocus on security is without merit because “Defendants’ censorship is inconsistent and haphazard.” \nECF No. 29 at PageID.275. For example, three facilities rejected the May 2019 issue of Prison \nLegal News while the other Michigan prisons accepted the publication. ECF No. 29 at PageID.275. \nPlaintiff also alleged Defendants “censored HRDC’s magazines based on articles about medical \nproblems at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility, problems with private companies \nthat contracted to provide food services at MDOC prisons, [] indeed virtually any article that \nmentions an MDOC prisoner or employee” and “a Vermont prisoner who happened to be at a non-\nMDOC facility in Michigan.” ECF No. 29 at PageID.277-278 (footnotes omitted). Plaintiff further \nargues “prisons throughout the United States, including other MDOC facilitates, deliver HRDC’s \npublications without adverse consequences. There is no reason to give more deference to the \njudgment of MDOC officials who censor HRDC’s publications than to those who allow prisoners \nto receive them.” ECF No. 29 at PageID.278.  \n  The Supreme Court has held the standard of review for prisoner constitutional questions is \nrational basis review. It has also concluded that deference should be granted to prison officials due \nto the security concerns they encounter daily. MDOC’s policy includes opportunities for individual \nreview and an appeal process including a hearing officer, the prison warden, and the CFA Deputy \nDirector. ECF No. 22 at PageID.153-154. As Defendants discuss in their reply, “there is no one \n- 15 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.327    Page 16 of 29\nsize fits all solution” to regulating prisons. ECF No. 30 at PageID.304. Plaintiff does not meet its \nburden to show Defendants qualified immunity defense should not apply on the First Amendment \nclaim. The First Amendment claim for monetary damages against Defendants Winn, Washington, \nHoffner, Smith, Palmer, and Does 1-30 will be dismissed. \nii. \n \nPlaintiff’s second argument is that Defendants violated its right to due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment. ECF No. 24 at PageID.243. The same qualified immunity framework \ndiscussed supra2 applies to the due process claim, including the burden on Plaintiff to provide \nsufficient facts to override Defendants qualified immunity defense. Silberstein v. City of Dayton, \n440 F.3d 306, 311 (6th Cir. 2006). There are three minimal due process safeguards that are required \nfor censorship of prisoner mail, first “notice of rejection [must] be given to the inmate-recipient.” \nMartin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d 236, 243 (6th Cir. 1986). Second, there must be “an opportunity to \nprotest the decision” to reject the mail. Id. at 243–44. Third, there must be an opportunity to appeal \nthe “rejection decision to an impartial third party prior to the letter being returned.” Id. at 244. \nAssuming without deciding that Plaintiff had a clearly established constitutional right to notice, \nthere is insufficient evidence of a pattern of behavior by Defendants that they were knowingly \nviolating Plaintiff’s constitutional right to due process.  \n  Plaintiff alleges in its complaint that some facilities always provided a notice of rejection, \nothers sometimes provided notice, and a few never provided notice at all. See ECF No. 24 at \nPageID.219-242. Plaintiff also alleges even when it received notice, it was frequently too broad to \nchallenge the rejection. Id. at PageID.220-242. Plaintiff explains there are about seven prisons \nwhere it believes the prisoner subscriber did not receive HRDC mail, but HRDC was never sent a \n                                                 \n2 See Section III.B. \n- 16 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.328    Page 17 of 29\nrejection letter.3 In the remainder of the prisons listed in HRDC’s complaint, HRDC received at \nleast one notice of rejection when a publication was rejected. \n  Defendants argue that “ordinary negligence [on the part of any or all defendants] does not \nrise to the level of a due-process violation.” ECF No. 22 at PageID.174. For the named wardens \nspecifically, Defendants allege “Plaintiff has not shown that they have failed to participate in the \nprocess of re-review of the decisions of hearing officers.” ECF No. 22 at PageID.174. Therefore \nDefendants argue they are entitled to qualified immunity.  \nPlaintiff is correct that it has a right to receive notice of mail that was rejected by the prison. \nSee Martin v. Kelley, 803 F.2d 236, 244 (6th Cir. 1986). Plaintiff argues that notice is essential for \nthe prisoner or the sender to be aware of the rejection and to challenge the decision, if they so \ndesire. ECF No. 29 at PageID.273. This is also true. However, Plaintiff cannot make the leap from \nlack of notice from some prisons to an intentional violation of a constitutional right. Plaintiff makes \nthree arguments in response to Defendants’ claim for qualified immunity, none of which are \npersuasive. \nPlaintiff first argues that negligence cannot be used to defend an employee’s failure to \ncomply with MDOC policy. ECF No. 29 at PageID.274. This unsupported argument does not hold \nwater. An employee may reject the publication but the notice may be lost in the mailroom, a worker \nmay forget to mail the notice like in Dale E. Frankfurth, D.D.S. v. City of Detroit, or it simply \ncould have been lost in the mail. 1987 WL 44769 (6th Cir. Sept. 17, 1987). This is likely when \n                                                 \n3 It is not entirely clear from Plaintiff’s amended complaint how many times HRDC did not receive notice \nof the rejection versus times when the publication was rejected, but HRDC properly received notice. \nThere is more specific information in Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction on this issue, but it is \nnot discussed here because of the standard of review for a motion to dismiss. As such, the decision is \nbased on the facts alleged in the complaint only.  \n- 17 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.329    Page 18 of 29\n“mailroom staff at MDOC’s 31 facilities . . . process hundreds of pieces of mail each day.” ECF \nNo. 22 at PageID.172.  \nSecond, Plaintiff argues that unlike in Frankfurth where the Court found one clerk’s single \nmistake to be negligent, here there is an allegation of systematic efforts by MDOC and prison \nwardens to fail to mail rejection notices. ECF NO. 29 at PageID.274. While it is clear that Plaintiff \nalleges about sixty pieces of mail were rejected without notice and multiple mail clerks and \nwardens are involved, there is no pattern identifiable from the face of the complaint of one prison \nroutinely rejecting publications from HRDC. MDOC has over 39,000 prisoners. Plaintiffs allege \n120 issues of Prison Legal News were rejected over three years at 22 different MDOC facilities. \nPlaintiffs allege they did not receive rejections for about 60 of the rejected issues. At most, it \nappears the Harrison prison allegedly rejected Prison Legal News 12 times within three years with \nno notice to HRDC. ECF No. 24 at PageID.230. The 60 times HRDC allegedly did not receive \nnotice of the rejection can be considered negligence on the part of the prison officials and not an \nintentional deprivation of HRDC’s due process rights. There is no indication any prison had a \npolicy where senders would not receive notice of rejection. Plaintiff’s three sentence argument that \nthis  was  habit  and  not  one-off  negligence  is  insufficient  to  meet  its  burden  to  overcome \nDefendants’ qualified immunity defense. \n Plaintiff’s third argument is that Defendants cannot argue both that security concerns \nprevented the publications from being given to prisoners (First Amendment claim) and argue \nnegligence for lack of notice (due process claim) to Plaintiff. ECF No. 29 at PageID.274-275. \nHowever, these two considerations are not inherently in conflict. In fact, it is quite possible for an \nemployee to make an intentional decision to reject a publication, maybe even create and send the \nrejection notice to the prisoner, but fail to complete the process to send the rejection notice to \n- 18 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.330    Page 19 of 29\nPlaintiff. Plaintiff has not presented evidence that Defendants intentionally violated Plaintiff’s due \nprocess rights in order to lose their entitlement to qualified immunity. Defendants motion to \ndismiss the individual damage claims against Defendants Winn, Washington, Hoffner, Smith, \nPalmer, and Does 1-30,  on the due process claim due to qualified immunity will be granted. \nC. \n \n  Next,  Plaintiff  argues  that  Defendant  Washington  in    her  official  capacity  violated \nPlaintiff’s right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and seeks injunctive relief. ECF \nNo. 24 at PageID.243.  \ni. \nIn Defendants’ motion to dismiss, they allege that “[t]he injunctive-relief, due-process \nclaim against Director Washington should be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) because, at most, any failure to follow MDOC’s mail policy directive 0.5.03.118 [sic] is \nnegligence, which is not actionable under the Due Process Clause.” ECF No. 22 at PageID.141. \nHowever, Defendants do not address this argument in their brief. Instead Defendants seem to \nabandon the argument contending that the injunctive relief claim against Defendant Washington \nis moot due to an email she sent out to all prison wardens reminding and emphasizing MDOC’s \npolicy. ECF No. 22 at PageID.157-161. Because Defendants do not expand upon their argument \nthat the injunctive relief due process claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, it will \nbe denied.  \nii. \na. \nTurning next to the mootness argument, Defendants argue the due process claim regarding \ninjunctive relief against Defendant Washington is moot. ECF No. 22 at PageID.157. A case \n- 19 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.331    Page 20 of 29\nbecomes moot “when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest in the outcome.” Los Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) \n(quoting Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969). Usually, “voluntary cessation of \nallegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case.” \nDavis, 440 U.S. at 631 (quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632 (1953)). The \nburden on Defendants to demonstrate “mootness ‘is a heavy one.’” Davis, 440 U.S. at 361 (quoting \nW.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. at 6333). However, “the burden in showing mootness is lower when it \nis the government that has voluntarily ceased its conduct.” Speech First, Inc. v. Schlissel, 939 F.3d \n756, 767 (6th Cir. 2019). The government’s “self-correction provides a secure foundation for a \ndismissal based on mootness so long as it appears genuine.” Speech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at 767 \n(quoting Bench Billboard Co. v. City of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d 974, 981 (6th Cir. 2012)). The Court \n“presume[s] that the same allegedly wrongful conduct by the government is unlikely to recur.” \nSpeech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at 767. However, “[w]hile all governmental action receives some \nsolicitude, not all action enjoys the same degree of solicitude. . . . [The Court] takes into account \nthe totality of the circumstances surrounding the voluntary cessation, including the manner in \nwhich the cessation was executed.” Speech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at 767.  \nWhere  the  government  voluntarily  ceases  its  actions  by  enacting  new \nlegislation or repealing the challenged legislation, that change will presumptively \nmoot the case unless there are clear contraindications that the change is not genuine.  \nOn the other hand, where a change is merely regulatory, the degree of \nsolicitude  the  voluntary  cessation  enjoys  is  based  on  whether  the  regulatory \nprocesses leading to the change involved legislative-like procedures or were ad hoc, \ndiscretionary, and easily reversible actions. \nIf the discretion to effect the change lies with one agency or individual, or \nthere are no formal processes required to effect the change, significantly more than \nthe bare solicitude itself is necessary to show that the voluntary cessation moots the \nclaim. \nWhere  regulatory  changes  are  effected  through  formal,  legislative-like \nprocedures, we have found that to moot the case the government need not do much \n- 20 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.332    Page 21 of 29\nmore than simply represent that it would not return to the challenged policies. \nSpeech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at 768–69 (citations omitted). \n \nb. \n \nIn Speech First, Inc., the University of Michigan President and other senior officials \nchanged the definitions of the terms “harassing” and ‘bullying” from the Office of Student Conflict \nResolution’s  website  after  the  plaintiff  filed  the  complaint  regarding  the  vagueness  of  the \ndefinitions. Speech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at 761–62, 769. However, there was no evidence presented \nof any formal process used to change the definitions in question nor had the school “affirmatively \nstated that it does not intend to reenact the challenged definitions.” Speech First, Inc., 939 F.3d at \n769. In the case at hand, Defendant Washington “formally reminded all its 31 facilities that they \nshould have—and follow—detailed operating procedures for incoming mail, consistent with \nMDOC Policy Directive 05.03.118 and Statewide Operating procedure 05.03.118A.” ECF No. 22 \nat PageID.159-160. Defendant Washington claims she is “entitled to solicitude as [a] government \nofficial[], and especially since this communication is consistent with already existing MDOC \npolicy 05.03.118, it is unlikely that [she] will turn around and issue a contrary directive. Moreover, \nshe has given facilities a date certain by which they must check, and if necessary, amend their \noperating procedures.” ECF No. 22 at PageID.160.  \nWhile government officials are entitled to solicitude when responding to a lawsuit, Director \nWashington has not changed her department’s standards in order to satisfy even the lower standard \nfor  governmental  mootness.  As  admitted  by  Defendants,  Director  Washington  can  reverse \ndirection and issue a contrary directive. The likelihood of her amending her directive to encourage \nprison officers to stop complying with the policy is likely low. However, when Defendants state \n“it is unlikely that she will turn around and issue a contrary directive” in their motion to dismiss, \nthey are essentially admitting she has the ability to issue a counter-directive in the future. ECF No. \n- 21 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.333    Page 22 of 29\n22 at PageID.160. Defendant Washington has not substantiated that there is an institutional process \nto ensure she does not amend the policy in the future. Second, Defendant Washington has only \nreminded her employees to follow the current policy. She is aware that Plaintiffs are challenging \nthe enforcement of the policy and not the policy itself (see ECF No. 22 at PageID.160). However, \nshe does not provide evidence of any specific mechanism she intends to use to ensure the prisons \nwill enforce the current policy going forward besides one friendly reminder email. Consequently \nPlaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief against Defendant Washington for violation of due process is \nnot moot and will survive Defendants’ 12(b)(6) motion. \nD. \n   \nOne form of relief Plaintiff seeks is a declaratory judgment “that Defendants’ policies and \npractices violate the Constitution.” ECF No. 24 at PageID.244. 28 U.S.C. 2201 provides  \nIn a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United \nStates, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not \nfurther relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and \neffect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such. \n \nPlaintiff did not assert a claim for declaratory judgment in its complaint or amended complaint. \nECF Nos. 1, 24. It only listed its request for a declaratory judgment in its request for relief at the \nend of the complaint. There is no live claim for declaratory judgment by Plaintiff.  Defendants’ \nrequest to deny Plaintiff’s request for declaratory judgment is untimely at this stage in the \nproceedings and will be denied.  \nIV. \n \n  Plaintiff brought First Amendment and due process claims against 35 Defendants in their \nindividual capacities, which will be dismissed. The two remaining claims are for injunctive relief \nagainst Defendant MDOC Director Washington in her official capacity for violations of its First \n- 22 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.334    Page 23 of 29\nAmendment and due process rights. As such, the analysis on the preliminary injunction will be \nlimited to these two claims.  \nA. \n \nGenerally, in determining whether to grant injunctive relief, a court must examine and \nweigh four factors: “(1) whether the movant has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits; \n(2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued; (3) whether the \nissuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public \ninterest would be served by issuing the injunction.” Overstreet v. Lexington–Fayette Urban Cty. \nGov’t, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002); McPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 119 F.3d \n453, 459 (6th Cir. 1997). “These factors are not prerequisites, but are factors that are to be balanced \nagainst each other.” Overstreet, 305 F.3d at 573. \nNotwithstanding  this  balancing  approach,  however,  the  likelihood  of  success  and \nirreparable harm factors predominate. Thus, “[a]lthough no one factor is controlling, a finding that \nthere is simply no likelihood of success on the merits is usually fatal.” Gonzales v. Nat’l Bd. of \nMed. Exam’rs, 225 F.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2000); Mich. State AFL–CIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, \n1249 (6th Cir. 1997) (“While, as a general matter, none of these four factors are given controlling \nweight, a preliminary injunction issued where there is simply no likelihood of success on the \nmerits must be reversed.”). This is especially true in First Amendment cases where “the likelihood \nof success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.” Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, \n265 (6th Cir. 2009).  \nPlaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating its entitlement to a preliminary injunction, and \nits burden is a heavy one. “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be \ngranted only if the movant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly \n- 23 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.335    Page 24 of 29\ndemand  it.” Overstreet,  305  F.3d  at  573.  “[T]he  proof  required  for  the  plaintiff  to  obtain \na preliminary injunction is much more stringent than the proof required to survive a summary \njudgment motion.” Leary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2000). Thus, plaintiffs may \nnot merely point to genuine issues of material fact which exist, but must affirmatively demonstrate \ntheir entitlement to injunctive relief. \nB. \n \nPlaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction as to both the First Amendment and due process \nclaims. Each will be discussed in turn. \ni. \n \n  Plaintiff analyzes Turner’s four factors contending that Defendant Washington violated the \nFirst Amendment, thereby demonstrating that it is likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and \nas such, meets the first Overstreet factor for a preliminary injunction. ECF No. 3 at PageID.58. \nPlaintiff argues the censorship of HRDC publications “bears no rational relation to legitimate \npenological objectives” and therefore Defendants behavior is unconstitutional. ECF No. 3 at \nPageID.58. To bolster its claim, Plaintiff explains that monthly Prison Legal News issues are \naccepted at some facilities and rejected by others without any logical explanation for why some \nfacilities reject the publication and others allow prisoners to receive the mail. ECF No. 3 at \nPageID.60. Plaintiff also alleges that the rejected mail will be helpful to rehabilitate prisoners and \nprepare them for life after incarceration. ECF No. 3 at PageID.61. While it is true that “Turner \nrequires prison authorities to show more than a formalistic logical connection between a regulation \nand a penological objective,” Defendant Washington responded by providing an example of one \nissue that was rejected by some prisons. The June 2017 edition (that was rejected by 11 facilities) \nincludes quotes that says Parnall Correctional Facility has “been poisoning prisoners,” compares \n- 24 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.336    Page 25 of 29\nit to a gas chamber, and alleges “MDOC ‘disregards’ prisoner complaints.” ECF No. 23 at \nPageID.194. The rationale for each rejection is unknown, but Plaintiff’s bare allegation that the \ncensorship “bears no rational relation to legitimate penological objectives” alone is insufficient to \nestablish a likely constitutional violation. Additionally, Plaintiff does not explain what positive \nand productive articles prisoners are being denied as a result of the censorship.  \n  Addressing the second Turner factor, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Washington failed to \nprovide alternate means for HRDC to exercise their First Amendment rights. ECF No. 3 at \nPageID.63. HRDC claims it does not have the resources to reach out to prisoners individually via \nphone calls or prepare television programs as an alternative to the written publication. Defendant \nWashington counters by explaining that not every issue is rejected and HRDC can communicate \nwith prisoners with non-rejected publications. Also, the Sixth Circuit has explained that alternative \nmeans of communication do not have to convey the same message to the same prisoner as the \nrejected communication. See Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 417–18 (1989).  \n  Plaintiff  continues  to  the  third  Turner  factor  stating  accommodating  HRDC’s  First \nAmendment right by not rejecting publications would not cause an additional burden to prisons \nbecause the prison workers could just as easily give the publication to the prisoner rather than \nrejecting it. ECF No. 3 at PageID.65. Plaintiff claims it “is not aware of any state or federal prison \nwhere its publications have created a security problem” and therefore, Michigan prisons should \nfollow suit. Defendant Washington focuses on the potential security concerns and her anticipation \n“that prisoners might dodge prison rules and that certain publications might foster that behavior.” \nECF No. 23 at PageID.200. Plaintiff’s statement that no other prison has had security concerns \nbecause of Prison Legal News does not mean the same is true in Michigan—especially when a \npublication compares an MDOC facility to a gas chamber.  \n- 25 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.337    Page 26 of 29\n  The fourth Turner factor focuses on the question of whether the regulation exaggerates the \nnecessary response from the prison. Plaintiff argues that because other prisons operate without \nproblems and distribute Prison Legal News and other HRDC publications outside of Michigan, the \nsame would be true in Michigan. ECF No. 3 at PageID.66. Defendant Washington responds that \nthere are no less strict responses available to ensure the publication reaches as many prisoners as \npossible without creating security concerns. This is true. MDOC does not restrict all HRDC \npublications  or  even  certain  issues  from  all  prisons.  Instead,  each  prison  makes  its  own \ndetermination if that month’s publication will be rejected—thereby ensuring the greatest number \nof prisoners receive the publication. In this case, with the facts as currently presented, it is not \nlikely Plaintiff will prevail on its First Amendment claim. \n  While there are four factors to determine if a motion for preliminary injunction should be \ngranted, the likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the case is frequently the determinative factor. \nSee Jones, 569 F.3d at 265. The second preliminary injunction factor is if the moving party, \nPlaintiff, will suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction is not issued. Plaintiff may still \nmail publications to prisoners in Michigan and object when a publication is rejected according to \nthe policy. Therefore, Plaintiff may have to object and seek review of rejected publications, but \nthere will not be irreparable harm. Factor three also favors denying the preliminary injunction. \nCourts are to give deference to prison officials’ determination of safety in prisons. At this point, \nDefendant Washington has demonstrated legitimate security concerns with some HRDC articles \nif this Court were to require all Prison Legal News issues to be delivered to their recipients. Factor \nfour asks if the public interest would be served by an injunction. HRDC would benefit, but no \nother person would benefit from the injunction. Taking all four factors together, Plaintiff has not \nmet its burden to obtain a preliminary injunction on the First Amendment claim. \n- 26 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.338    Page 27 of 29\nii. \n \n  Plaintiff also seeks a preliminary injunction on its due process claim. Plaintiff rightfully \nasserts it is entitled to notice of a rejected publication. ECF No. 3 at PageID.67-69. Plaintiff’s \nability to challenge rejections is diminished when it does not receive notice of the rejection or the \nreason for the rejection. However, Plaintiff cannot show that it is likely to prevail on the merits of \nthe  due  process  claim  by  simply  outlining  the  law  and  alleging  that  other  prisons  require \nnotification for rejected mail without any security consequences. Plaintiff explains the Federal \nBureau of Prisons has a notification policy that has been upheld in the Courts. However, Plaintiff \ndoes not challenge MDOC’s policy and so the analogy to the federal Bureau of Prisons’ policy is \nirrelevant to the determination of whether MDOC’s actions violates Plaintiff’s due process rights. \nDefendant Washington explains that MDOC’s policy is to provide notice to senders when mail is \nrejected and that some negligence on the part of Defendant Washington or her staff is not \nactionable under the due process clause. It is unknown if Defendant Washington’s behavior of not \nadequately enforcing the notification policy is intentional or negligent, but Plaintiff has alleged \ninsufficient facts to show it is likely to prevail on the merits of the due process claim. The first \nOverstreet preliminary injunction factor favors Defendant Washington.  \n  The second factor in a preliminary injunction analysis is irreparable harm. In this case, \nPlaintiff will suffer irreparable harm, the inability to challenge rejection decisions, if it does not \nreceive notice each time an issue from a prisoner’s subscription to an HRDC publication or an \nHRDC book is rejected. To date, Plaintiff alleges it has not received notice of about half of the \nover 120 rejections of its publications in three years. To counter Plaintiff’s concerns, Defendant \nWashington has responded by reminding all prisons to follow MDOC policy, which includes \n- 27 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.339    Page 28 of 29\nsending  notice  to  senders  of  rejected  mail.  Without  knowledge  of  the  effect  of  Defendant \nWashington’s reminder though, this factor favors Plaintiff.  \n  The third factor to be examined when a preliminary injunction is requested is whether the \ninjunction would harm others. Plaintiff alleges there would be minimal injury to Defendant \nWashington or her staff if they are required to send notice of rejections because the current practice \ndoes not provide Plaintiff with sufficient information to challenge the alleged rejections of the \npublication. Unlike the First Amendment claim where a preliminary injunction could potentially \ncause harm to prison staff and other prisoners, here there would no harm to Defendant if the \ninjunction required all prisons to follow the policy and send notifications to senders whose mail \nwas rejected. The third factor weighs in favor of Plaintiff.  \n  The fourth factor inquires whether the preliminary injunction will serve the public interest. \nPlaintiff argues the notice ensures its First Amendment rights are being protected. Without notice, \nit cannot challenge any potential violations. If the same problem has been occurring with other \nsenders, notice would serve the public interest by ensuring all senders of prison mail receive notice \nof rejections. Even if this behavior only occurs with Plaintiff, there is no harm to the public interest \nby issuing an injunction. Therefore, the fourth factor favors Plaintiff. \nDespite  the  second,  third,  and  fourth  factors  favoring  Plaintiff,  Plaintiff  has  not \ndemonstrated that it is likely, on the facts as they currently stand, that it will prevail on the merits \nof the First Amendment and due process claims for injunctive relief. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction will be denied.  \nV. \n \n  Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 22, is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The First Amendment and due process claims \n- 28 - \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 32   filed 01/06/20    PageID.340    Page 29 of 29\nagainst Defendants Winn, Hoffner, Smith, Palmer, Washington, and the 30 Does in their individual \ncapacities are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.

INTRODUCTION \n1. The HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE CENTER (“HRDC”) brings this \naction to enjoin Defendants’ improper censorship of its monthly journal, Prison \nLegal News, and other publications that HRDC sends to prisoners in the Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections (“MDOC”). \n2. Defendants have adopted and implemented mail policies and practices \nprohibiting delivery of written speech from HRDC while failing to provide due \nprocess notice of and an opportunity to challenge that censorship. Defendants’ \nactions violate HRDC’s rights under the First and the Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  HRDC  thus  brings  this  action,  pursuant  to  42 \n1 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.2    Page 2 of 36\nU.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages to be proven \nat trial. \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3. This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which \nauthorizes actions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, \nprivileges, and immunities secured to HRDC by the laws of the United States. \n4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 \nU.S.C.  §§  1331  and  1343.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  claims  seeking \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and \n2202 against all Defendants. \n5. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). On \ninformation and belief, at least one Defendant, O’Bell Winn, resides within this \njudicial district, and many of the events giving rise to the claims asserted herein \noccurred within this judicial district. On information and belief, all Defendants are \nresidents of the state of Michigan. \nIII. PARTIES \n6. HRDC  is  a  not-for-profit  charitable  corporation  recognized  under \n§ 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, with its principal place of business in \nLake Worth, Florida. Founded in 1990, HRDC publishes the monthly newsprint \njournal  Prison  Legal  News,  the  longest-running  independent  newsprint  journal \n2 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.3    Page 3 of 36\nconcerning  prisons  and  detention  centers  in  the  United  States,  along  with \npublications focusing on prisoner rights issues. HRDC also corresponds regularly \nwith prisoners on constitutional issues and potential violations of their civil rights.  \n7. Defendant O’Bell Winn (“Winn”) is, and on information and belief at \nall relevant times herein mentioned was, the Warden of the Saginaw Correctional \nFacility (“Saginaw”), a prison under the control of MDOC within the State of \nMichigan. Defendant Winn has responsibility for the execution of MDOC policies, \nprocedures,  and  practices  at  Saginaw,  including  the  approval  of  publication \ncensorship decisions. As to all claims presented herein against him, Defendant \nWinn is being sued in his individual capacity for damages. At all relevant times, \nDefendant Winn has acted under color of state law. \n8. Defendant Heidi Washington (“Washington”) is, and at all relevant \ntimes herein mentioned was, the Director of MDOC, the state agency that manages \nthe correctional facilities within the State of Michigan. Defendant Washington has \nultimate  responsibility  for  the  promulgation  and  implementation  of  MDOC \npolicies, procedures, and practices and for the management of MDOC.

For more than 28 years, the focus of HRDC’s mission has been public \neducation, advocacy, and outreach on behalf of, and for the purpose of assisting, \nprisoners  who  seek  legal  redress  for  infringements  of  their  constitutionally \nguaranteed and other basic human rights. HRDC engages in core protected speech \nand expressive conduct on matters of public concern, such as the operation of \nprison facilities, prison conditions, prisoner health and safety, and prisoners’ rights. \nHRDC’s mission, if realized, has a salutary effect on public safety. \n5 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.6    Page 6 of 36\n14. In furtherance of its mission, HRDC publishes and distributes a soft-\ncover monthly journal titled Prison Legal News, which contains news and analysis \nabout prisons, jails, and other detention facilities, prisoners’ rights, court rulings, \nmanagement of prison facilities, prison conditions, and other matters pertaining to \nthe  rights  and/or  interests  of  incarcerated  individuals.  The  monthly  journal  is \npublished on newsprint and is 72-pages long. \n15. More  recently,  HRDC  also  began  publishing  a  second  monthly \nmagazine, Criminal Legal News. This magazine focuses on review and analysis of \nindividual  rights,  court  rulings,  and  news  concerning  criminal  justice-related \nissues. This magazine is also published on newsprint, and is 48 pages long. \n16. HRDC also publishes and/or distributes approximately 40 different \nsoftcover books about the criminal justice system, legal reference books, and self-\nhelp books of interest to prisoners. These books are designed to foster a better \nunderstanding  of  criminal  justice  policies  and  to  allow  prisoners  to  educate \nthemselves about related issues, such as legal research, how to write a business \nletter,  health  care  issues,  and  similar  topics.  Pertinent  to  this  lawsuit,  HRDC \npublishes and/or distributes the books 1) Protecting Your Health and Safety, which \ndescribes  the  rights,  protections  and  legal  remedies  available  to  prisoners \nconcerning their incarceration, 2) the Prisoner Diabetes Handbook, which provides \ninformation on how to manage diabetes in a carceral setting, and 3) the Prisoners’ \n6 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.7    Page 7 of 36\nSelf-Help Litigation Manual, which is a guide for understanding and protecting the \nrights of prisoners. \n17. HRDC’s monthly journal and other publications, as described above, \ncontain political speech and social commentary, which are core First Amendment \nrights and are entitled to the highest protection afforded by the U.S. Constitution. \n18. HRDC has thousands of subscribers in the United States and abroad, \nincluding prisoners, attorneys, journalists, public libraries, judges, and members of \nthe general public. HRDC has distributed its monthly publication to prisoners and \nlaw librarians in more than 3,000 correctional facilities located across all 50 states, \nincluding the Federal Bureau of Prisons and MDOC. \n19. Prison Legal News is popular among inmates in Michigan. Despite \nDefendants’  censorship,  as  of  July  of  2019  HRDC  had  46  subscribers  to  its \nmonthly  publication  within  the  MDOC,  including:  2  at  Baraga  Correctional \nFacility (“Baraga”); 3 at Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility (“Bellamy Creek”); 2 \nat  Carson  City  Correctional  Facility  (“Carson  City”);  1  at  Central  Michigan \nCorrectional Facility (“Central Michigan”); 2 at Chippewa Correctional Facility \n(“Chippewa”); 2 at Cooper Street Correctional Facility (“Cooper Street”); 2 at the \nEarnest C. Brooks Correctional Facility (“Brooks”); 4 at the G. Robert Cotton \nCorrectional Facility (“Cotton”); 1 at the Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility \n(“Handlon”); 6 at the Gus Harrison Correctional Facility (“Harrison”); 2 at Ionia; 4 \nat Lakeland; 2 at Macomb Correctional Facility (“Macomb”); 3 at the Marquette \n7 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.8    Page 8 of 36\nBranch  Prison  (“Marquette”),  1  at  the  Michigan  Reformatory,  2  at  Muskegon \nCorrectional Facility (“Muskegon”); 1 at Oaks Correctional Facility (“Oaks”), 3 at \nSaginaw, and 1 at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility (“WHV”).  \n20. Additionally,  in  furtherance  of  its  mission  and  to  increase  the \ndissemination of its message, HRDC sends individually addressed sample copies \nof its publications to non-subscriber prisoners within MDOC. \nB. CENSORSHIP AT MDOC FACILITIES \n21. The  First  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  protects \nHRDC’s  right  to  communicate  with  prisoners  who  are  incarcerated  within  the \nMDOC.  Regulations,  policies,  or  practices  that  restrict  the  receipt  of  mail  by \nprisoners are invalid unless they are rationally related to a legitimate penological \ninterest.  \n22. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires \nthat  publishers  receive  notice  of  and  be  allowed  to  challenge  restrictions  on \nprisoners’ receipt of mail. Regulations, policies, or practices that do not provide \nthese minimum procedural safeguards are invalid. Fourteenth Amendment rights \nare also violated where procedural safeguards are not followed as applied to a \nparticular publisher.   \n23. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  various \nprisons within MDOC’s system do not comply with the First and/or Fourteenth \nAmendments.  HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that \n8 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.9    Page 9 of 36\nDefendants’  policies  and  practices  have  deprived  and  will  continue  to  deprive \nHRDC  of  the  right  to  distribute  its  materials  to  prisoners,  and  of  notice  or \nopportunity  to  appeal  when  its  publications  are  not  delivered  to  prisoner \nsubscribers.  \n24. As described in further detail below, certain prisons within the state of \nMichigan have withheld all or part of issues of Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal \nNews, and books published and/or distributed by HRDC. HRDC is informed and \nthereon believes that at least one officer at each prison (listed by name or as one of \nDOES 1-30 above), had direct knowledge of and were directly involved in each \nand every instance of censorship complained of below. \n25. Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News pose no threat to any \nlegitimate penological interests. However, in numerous instances prison officials \nerroneously rejected issues of Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, on the \ngrounds that content of the magazines’ articles posed a threat to the security, good \norder, or discipline of the facility, facilitated or encouraged criminal activity, or \ninterfered with the rehabilitation of prisoners. \n26. In all, between August 2016 and July 2019, 29 of the 36 monthly \nissues of Prison Legal News were censored by at least one MDOC facility. \n27. MDOC officials also rejected books sent by HRDC to prisoners in its \ncustody, on the grounds that HRDC was not the publisher or authorized vendor. \n9 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.10    Page 10 of 36\n28. Further, although MDOC’s policies state that when a piece of mail is \nrejected a copy of the Notice of Package/Mail Rejection shall be sent to the sender, \na majority of MDOC facilities have a custom and practice of failing to send the \nrequired notice. \n29. Even  when  notice  is  sent to a  sender, MDOC  does not provide  a \nprocess to challenge censorship decisions. On several occasions, HRDC appealed \nthe  rejection  of  its  publications.  In  many  cases,  the  facility  that  censored  the \nmaterials ignored the appeal. \n30. In one instance where HRDC’s appeal was considered, the facility’s \nrejection decision was reversed. On March 21, 2018, an official at the Earnest C. \nBrooks Correctional Facility informed HRDC that it would allow the delivery of \nthe Prisoners’ Self-Help Litigation Manual. \n31. On  June  11,  2018,  HRDC  sent  a  letter  to  Defendant  Washington \ndetailing the censorship of its publications at MDOC facilities, and demanding that \nMDOC cease rejecting Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal News, and HRDC’s \nbooks without a legitimate penological interest. Neither Defendant Washington nor \nanyone else at MDOC responded to the letter. \n32. HRDC  is  aware  of  at  least  the  following  specific  examples  of \nimproper censorship and/or lack of notice by prisons within MDOC: \n1. CENSORSHIP AT ALGER \n33. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \n10 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.11    Page 11 of 36\nsubscribers incarcerated at Alger did not receive issues of Prison Legal News on \nmultiple occasions.  \n34. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Alger from receiving the October 2016, March 2017, June \n2017, June 2019, and July 2019 issues of Prison Legal News. Each of these issues \nof Prison Legal News were individually addressed and mailed to the subscribers \nincarcerated at Alger. HRDC is informed and believes that, although each of those \nissues was properly delivered to Alger, the issues were withheld from delivery by \nstaff at the facility. \n35. HRDC  has never  received  any  notice  from  MDOC  relating to  the \ncensorship of the October 2016, March 2017, and June 2017 issues of Prison Legal \nNews at Alger. HRDC also never received any notification of an opportunity to \nappeal those censorship decisions.  \n36. The  Notice  of  Package/Mail  Rejection  for  the  June  2019  issue  of \nPrison Legal News states the reason for rejection as “PRISON LEGAL NEWS \nVOLUME  30  #  6  FOR  June  2019  IS  REJECTED  DUE  TO  POSING  A \nSECURITY THREAT.” The Notice failed to specify how or in what manner that \nissue was a threat.   \n37. The  Notice  of  Package/Mail  Rejection  for  the  July  2019  issue  of \nPrison  Legal  News  states  the  reason  for  rejection  as  “ONE  ARTICLE \nCONTAINING INFORMATION THAT POSES A SECURITY THREAT.” The \n11 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.12    Page 12 of 36\nNotice failed to specify which article was problematic, or how or in what manner \nthat article was a threat. \n38. This censorship of Prison Legal News and the failure of Defendants to \nprovide  adequate  notice  and  explanation  to  HRDC  violates  HRDC’s  First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as further detailed below. \n2. CENSORSHIP AT BARAGA \n39. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Baraga did not receive issues of Prison Legal News on \nmultiple occasions.  \n40. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Baraga from receiving the December 2017, January 2018, \nMarch 2018, March 2019 and other issues of Prison Legal News. Each of these \nissues  of  Prison  Legal  News  were  individually  addressed  and  mailed  to  the \nsubscribers incarcerated at Baraga. HRDC is informed and believes that, although \neach of those issues was properly delivered to Baraga, the issues were withheld \nfrom delivery by staff at the facility.  \n41. Additionally, staff at Baraga rejected a copy of the book Protecting \nYour  Health  and  Safety  sent  to  a  prisoner  in  December  2018.  The  Notice  of \nPackage/Mail Rejection form sent to HRDC listed the reasons for rejection as \n“mail  that  may  pose  a  threat  to  the  security,  good  order,  or  discipline  of  the \nfacility” and “[t]he sender is not the publisher, and is not an authorized vendor.”   \n12 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.13    Page 13 of 36\n42. HRDC  has never  received  any  notice  from  MDOC  relating to  the \ncensorship of the March 2019 issue of Prison Legal News at Baraga. HRDC also \nnever  received  any  notification  of  an  opportunity  to  appeal  that  censorship \ndecision. This censorship of Prison Legal News and the failure of Defendants to \nprovide  adequate  notice  and  explanation  to  HRDC  violates  HRDC’s  First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as further detailed below.  \n3. CENSORSHIP AT BELLAMY CREEK \n43. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that many of the \nprisoner subscribers incarcerated at Bellamy Creek did not receive issues of Prison \nLegal News on multiple occasions.  \n44. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Bellamy Creek from receiving the July 2017, December \n2017, January 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, and August 2018 issues \nof  Prison  Legal  News.  Each  of  these  issues  of  Prison  Legal  News  were \nindividually  addressed  and  mailed  to  the  subscribers  incarcerated  at  Bellamy \nCreek. HRDC is informed and believes that, although each of those issues was \nproperly delivered to Bellamy Creek, the issues were withheld from delivery by \nstaff at the facility.  \n45. This  failure  of  Defendants  to  deliver  Prison  Legal  News  violates \nHRDC’s First Amendment rights, as further detailed below. \n13 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.14    Page 14 of 36\n4. CENSORSHIP AT BROOKS \n46. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that many of the \nprisoner subscribers incarcerated at Chippewa did not receive issues of Prison \nLegal News on multiple occasions. \n47. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Brooks did not receive the June 2019 and July 2019 \nissues of Prison Legal News. These issues of Prison Legal News were individually \naddressed and mailed to the subscribers incarcerated at Brooks. HRDC is informed \nand believes that, although that issue was properly delivered to Brooks, the issue \nwas withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n48. HRDC has never received any notice relating to censorship of any \nissues of Prison Legal News at Brooks. HRDC also never received any notification \nof an opportunity to appeal any censorship decisions. This censorship of Prison \nLegal  News  and  the  failure  of  Defendants  to  provide  adequate  notice  and \nexplanation to HRDC violates HRDC’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as \nfurther detailed below. \n5. CENSORSHIP AT CARSON CITY \n49. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Carson City did not receive the January 2018 issue of \nPrison Legal News. This issue of Prison Legal News was individually addressed \nand mailed to the subscribers incarcerated at Carson City. HRDC is informed and \n14 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.15    Page 15 of 36\nbelieves that, although that issue was properly delivered to Carson City, the issue \nwas withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n50. The Notice of Package/Mail Rejection for this issue states the reason \nfor rejection as “Article in Prison Legal News Jan 2018 Issue” was “mail that may \npose a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the facility, may facilitate \nor  encourage  criminal  activity,  or  may  interfere  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nprisoner.” The Notice failed to specify which article was objectionable, or why it \nwas a threat. \n51. The Notice provided to HRDC is insufficient, as it fails to provide \nsufficient basis to justify the censorship, and does not contain enough information \nfor  HRDC  to  reasonably  challenge  the  rejection  decision.  This  conduct  by \nDefendants violates HRDC’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as further \ndetailed below. \n6. CENSORSHIP AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN \n52. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prisoners \nincarcerated at Central Michigan are not allowed to receive Prison Legal News. A \nprisoner bought a subscription to Prison Legal News in January 2018, but prison \nstaff told him that he could not receive the magazines. \n53. The  issues of  Prison  Legal  News  were individually  addressed  and \nmailed to the subscriber incarcerated at Central Michigan. HRDC is informed and \n15 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.16    Page 16 of 36\nbelieves that, although each of those issues were properly delivered to Central \nMichigan, they were withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n54.

In  adopting  and  implementing  the  above  censorship  policies  and \npractices,  Defendants  have  knowingly  violated,  continue  to  violate,  and  are \nreasonably expected to violate in the future, HRDC’s constitutional rights. \n112. Defendants’  unconstitutional  policies  and  practices  have  caused \nHRDC serious and irreparable harm including, but not limited to: suppression of its \npolitical message, frustration of its organizational mission, loss of its ability to \nrecruit  new  supporters,  subscribers,  and  writers,  loss  of  subscriptions,  loss  of \nopportunities for purchases and sales of its publications, loss of opportunities for \nbook sales, and diversion of its resources. Absent intervention by this Court these \nactions will continue and HRDC will be subjected to a continuation of the same \nirreparable and serious injuries. \n113. The above violations of HRDC’s rights and the harms to HRDC were \ncaused  by  mail  and  censorship  policies  adopted  or  approved  by  Defendant \nWashington in her capacity as head of MDOC. \n31 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.32    Page 32 of 36\n114.

Defendants’  unconstitutional  policy,  practices,  and  customs  are \nongoing  and  continue  to  violate  HRDC’s  rights,  and  as  such  HRDC  has  no \nadequate remedy at law. \n116. HRDC is entitled to injunctive relief requiring Defendant Washington \nto prohibit Defendants from refusing to deliver or refusing to allow delivery of \nHRDC’s books and magazines, and prohibiting Defendants from censoring mail \nwithout due process of law. \n117. As a result of the foregoing, HRDC seeks compensatory and punitive \ndamages against the individual Defendants. \nCOUNT I \nViolation of the First Amendment (Censorship) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983\n118. HRDC  re-alleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  herein  all  of  the \nallegations contained in the above paragraphs. \n119. The  acts  described  above  constitute  violations  of  HRDC’s  rights \nunder the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n32 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.33    Page 33 of 36\n120. HRDC  has  a  constitutionally  protected  liberty  interest  in \ncommunicating  with  incarcerated  individuals,  a  right  clearly  established  under \nexisting case law. \n121. The  conduct  of  Defendants  was  objectively  unreasonable  and  was \nundertaken intentionally with malice, willfulness, and reckless indifference. \n122. HRDC’s injuries and the violations of its constitutional rights were \ndirectly and proximately caused by the policies and practices of Defendants, which \nwere and are the moving force of the violations. \n123. Defendants’ acts described above have caused damages to HRDC, and \nif not enjoined, will continue to cause damage to HRDC. \n124. HRDC seeks injunctive relief against Heidi Washington in her official \ncapacity, and nominal and compensatory damages against all Defendants. HRDC \nseeks  punitive  damages  against  the  individual  Defendants  in  their  individual \ncapacities. \nCOUNT II \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Due Process) \n42 U.S.C. § 1983\n125. HRDC  re-alleges  and  incorporates  by  reference  herein  all  of  the \nallegations contained in the above paragraphs. \n126. The  acts  described  above  constitute  violations  of  HRDC’s  rights \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n127. Because  HRDC  has  a  liberty  interest  in  communicating  with \n33 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.34    Page 34 of 36\nprisoners,  HRDC  has  a  right  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  receive  notice  of  and  an  opportunity  to  appeal  Defendants’ \ndecisions to censor their written speech. \n128. Defendants’  policies  and  practices  fail  to  provide  HRDC  with \nadequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. \n129. The  conduct  of  Defendants  was  objectively  unreasonable  and  was \nundertaken intentionally with malice, willfulness, and reckless indifference. \n130. HRDC’s injuries and the violations of its constitutional rights were \ndirectly and proximately caused by the policies and practices of Defendants, which \nare and were the moving force of the violations. \n131. Defendants’ acts described above have caused damages to HRDC, and \nif not enjoined, will continue to cause damage to HRDC. \n132. HRDC seeks injunctive relief against Heidi Washington in her official \ncapacity, and nominal and compensatory damages against all Defendants. HRDC \nseeks  punitive  damages  against  the  individual  Defendants  in  their  individual \ncapacities. \nV.

A declaration that Defendants’ policies and practices violate the \nConstitution; \n34 \n31883527.3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 1   filed 08/22/19    PageID.35    Page 35 of 36\nB. A preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Washington \nto prohibit Defendants from continuing to violate the \nConstitution, and providing other equitable relief; \nC. An award of compensatory, punitive, and nominal damages; \nD. An award of full costs and attorneys’ fees arising out of this \nlitigation; and\nE. Any and other further relief this Court may deem just and \nappropriate. \nVI.

INTRODUCTION \n1. The HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENSE CENTER (“HRDC”) brings this \naction to enjoin Defendants’ improper censorship of its monthly journal, Prison \nLegal News, and other publications that HRDC sends to prisoners in the Michigan \nDepartment of Corrections (“MDOC”). \n2. Defendants have adopted and implemented mail policies and practices \nprohibiting delivery of written speech from HRDC while failing to provide due \nprocess notice of and an opportunity to challenge that censorship. Defendants’ \nactions violate HRDC’s rights under the First and the Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe  United  States  Constitution.  HRDC  thus  brings  this  action,  pursuant  to  42 \n1 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.212    Page 2 of 37\nU.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and damages to be proven \nat trial. \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3. This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nUnited States Constitution and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which \nauthorizes actions to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, \nprivileges, and immunities secured to HRDC by the laws of the United States. \n4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 \nU.S.C.  §§  1331  and  1343.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  claims  seeking \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and \n2202 against all Defendants. \n5. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). On \ninformation and belief, at least one Defendant, O’Bell Winn, resides within this \njudicial district, and many of the events giving rise to the claims asserted herein \noccurred within this judicial district. On information and belief, all Defendants are \nresidents of the state of Michigan. \nIII. PARTIES \n6.

The true names and identities of Defendants DOES 1 through 30 are \npresently unknown to HRDC. Each of Defendants DOES 1 through 30 are or were \nemployed by and are or were agents of MDOC when some or all of the challenged \ninmate  mail  policies  and  practices  were  adopted  and/or  implemented.  Each  of \nDefendants DOES 1 through 30 were personally involved in the adoption and/or \nimplementation of the mail policies and practices at the MDOC facilities, and/or \nwere  responsible  for  the  hiring,  screening,  training,  retention,  supervision, \ndiscipline, counseling, and/or control of MDOC facilities staff who interpret and \nimplement  these  mail  policies.  HRDC  will seek  to  amend  this  First  Amended \nComplaint as soon as the true names and identities of Defendants DOES 1 through \n30 have been ascertained. \nIV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA. HRDC’S MISSION \n13. For more than 28 years, the focus of HRDC’s mission has been public \neducation, advocacy, and outreach on behalf of, and for the purpose of assisting, \nprisoners  who  seek  legal  redress  for  infringements  of  their  constitutionally \nguaranteed and other basic human rights. HRDC engages in core protected speech \nand expressive conduct on matters of public concern, such as the operation of \nprison facilities, prison conditions, prisoner health and safety, and prisoners’ rights. \nHRDC’s mission, if realized, has a salutary effect on public safety. \n5 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.216    Page 6 of 37\n14. In furtherance of its mission, HRDC publishes and distributes a soft-\ncover monthly journal titled Prison Legal News, which contains news and analysis \nabout prisons, jails, and other detention facilities, prisoners’ rights, court rulings, \nmanagement of prison facilities, prison conditions, and other matters pertaining to \nthe  rights  and/or  interests  of  incarcerated  individuals.  The  monthly  journal  is \npublished on newsprint and is 72-pages long. \n15. More  recently,  HRDC  also  began  publishing  a  second  monthly \nmagazine, Criminal Legal News. This magazine focuses on review and analysis of \nindividual  rights,  court  rulings,  and  news  concerning  criminal  justice-related \nissues. This magazine is also published on newsprint, and is 48 pages long. \n16. HRDC also publishes and/or distributes approximately 40 different \nsoftcover books about the criminal justice system, legal reference books, and self-\nhelp books of interest to prisoners. These books are designed to foster a better \nunderstanding  of  criminal  justice  policies  and  to  allow  prisoners  to  educate \nthemselves about related issues, such as legal research, how to write a business \nletter,  health  care  issues,  and  similar  topics.  Pertinent  to  this  lawsuit,  HRDC \npublishes and/or distributes the books 1) Protecting Your Health and Safety, which \ndescribes  the  rights,  protections  and  legal  remedies  available  to  prisoners \nconcerning their incarceration, 2) the Prisoner Diabetes Handbook, which provides \ninformation on how to manage diabetes in a carceral setting, and 3) the Prisoners’ \n6 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.217    Page 7 of 37\nSelf-Help Litigation Manual, which is a guide for understanding and protecting the \nrights of prisoners. \n17. HRDC’s monthly journal and other publications, as described above, \ncontain political speech and social commentary, which are core First Amendment \nrights and are entitled to the highest protection afforded by the U.S. Constitution. \n18. HRDC has thousands of subscribers in the United States and abroad, \nincluding prisoners, attorneys, journalists, public libraries, judges, and members of \nthe general public. HRDC has distributed its monthly publication to prisoners and \nlaw librarians in more than 3,000 correctional facilities located across all 50 states, \nincluding the Federal Bureau of Prisons and MDOC. \n19. Prison Legal News is popular among inmates in Michigan. Despite \nDefendants’  censorship,  as  of  July  of  2019  HRDC  had  46  subscribers  to  its \nmonthly  publication  within  the  MDOC,  including:  2  at  Baraga  Correctional \nFacility (“Baraga”); 3 at Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility (“Bellamy Creek”); 2 \nat  Carson  City  Correctional  Facility  (“Carson  City”);  1  at  Central  Michigan \nCorrectional Facility (“Central Michigan”); 2 at Chippewa Correctional Facility \n(“Chippewa”); 2 at Cooper Street Correctional Facility (“Cooper Street”); 2 at the \nEarnest C. Brooks Correctional Facility (“Brooks”); 4 at the G. Robert Cotton \nCorrectional Facility (“Cotton”); 1 at the Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility \n(“Handlon”); 6 at the Gus Harrison Correctional Facility (“Harrison”); 2 at Ionia; 4 \nat Lakeland; 2 at Macomb Correctional Facility (“Macomb”); 3 at the Marquette \n7 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.218    Page 8 of 37\nBranch  Prison  (“Marquette”),  1  at  the  Michigan  Reformatory,  2  at  Muskegon \nCorrectional Facility (“Muskegon”); 1 at Oaks Correctional Facility (“Oaks”), 3 at \nSaginaw, and 1 at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility (“WHV”).  \n20. Additionally,  in  furtherance  of  its  mission  and  to  increase  the \ndissemination of its message, HRDC sends individually addressed sample copies \nof its publications to non-subscriber prisoners within MDOC. \nB. CENSORSHIP AT MDOC FACILITIES \n21. The  First  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  protects \nHRDC’s  right  to  communicate  with  prisoners  who  are  incarcerated  within  the \nMDOC.  Regulations,  policies,  or  practices  that  restrict  the  receipt  of  mail  by \nprisoners are invalid unless they are rationally related to a legitimate penological \ninterest.  \n22. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires \nthat  publishers  receive  notice  of  and  be  allowed  to  challenge  restrictions  on \nprisoners’ receipt of mail. Regulations, policies, or practices that do not provide \nthese minimum procedural safeguards are invalid. Fourteenth Amendment rights \nare also violated where procedural safeguards are not followed as applied to a \nparticular publisher.   \n23. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  various \nprisons within MDOC’s system do not comply with the First and/or Fourteenth \nAmendments.  HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that \n8 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.219    Page 9 of 37\nDefendants’  policies  and  practices  have  deprived  and  will  continue  to  deprive \nHRDC  of  the  right  to  distribute  its  materials  to  prisoners,  and  of  notice  or \nopportunity  to  appeal  when  its  publications  are  not  delivered  to  prisoner \nsubscribers.  \n24. As described in further detail below, certain prisons within the state of \nMichigan have withheld all or part of issues of Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal \nNews, and books published and/or distributed by HRDC. HRDC is informed and \nthereon believes that at least one officer at each prison (listed by name or as one of \nDOES 1-30 above), had direct knowledge of and were directly involved in each \nand every instance of censorship complained of below. \n25. Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News pose no threat to any \nlegitimate penological interests. However, in numerous instances prison officials \nerroneously rejected issues of Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, on the \ngrounds that content of the magazines’ articles posed a threat to the security, good \norder, or discipline of the facility, facilitated or encouraged criminal activity, or \ninterfered with the rehabilitation of prisoners. \n26. In all, between August 2016 and July 2019, 29 of the 36 monthly \nissues of Prison Legal News were censored by at least one MDOC facility. \n27. MDOC officials also rejected books sent by HRDC to prisoners in its \ncustody, on the grounds that HRDC was not the publisher or authorized vendor. \n9 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.220    Page 10 of 37\n28. Further, although MDOC’s policies state that when a piece of mail is \nrejected a copy of the Notice of Package/Mail Rejection shall be sent to the sender, \na majority of MDOC facilities have a custom and practice of failing to send the \nrequired notice. \n29. Even  when  notice  is  sent to a  sender, MDOC  does not provide  a \nprocess to challenge censorship decisions. On several occasions, HRDC appealed \nthe  rejection  of  its  publications.  In  many  cases,  the  facility  that  censored  the \nmaterials ignored the appeal. \n30. In one instance where HRDC’s appeal was considered, the facility’s \nrejection decision was reversed. On March 21, 2018, an official at the Earnest C. \nBrooks Correctional Facility informed HRDC that it would allow the delivery of \nthe Prisoners’ Self-Help Litigation Manual. \n31. On  June  11,  2018,  HRDC  sent  a  letter  to  Defendant  Washington \ndetailing the censorship of its publications at MDOC facilities, and demanding that \nMDOC cease rejecting Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal News, and HRDC’s \nbooks without a legitimate penological interest. Neither Defendant Washington nor \nanyone else at MDOC responded to the letter. \n32. HRDC  is  aware  of  at  least  the  following  specific  examples  of \nimproper censorship and/or lack of notice by prisons within MDOC: \n1. CENSORSHIP AT ALGER \n33. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \n10 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.221    Page 11 of 37\nsubscribers incarcerated at Alger did not receive issues of Prison Legal News on \nmultiple occasions.  \n34. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Alger from receiving the October 2016, March 2017, June \n2017, June 2019, and July 2019 issues of Prison Legal News. Each of these issues \nof Prison Legal News were individually addressed and mailed to the subscribers \nincarcerated at Alger. HRDC is informed and believes that, although each of those \nissues was properly delivered to Alger, the issues were withheld from delivery by \nstaff at the facility. \n35. HRDC has never received any notice from MDOC relating to the \ncensorship of the October 2016, March 2017, and June 2017 issues of Prison Legal \nNews at Alger. HRDC also never received any notification of an opportunity to \nappeal those censorship decisions.  \n36. The  Notice  of  Package/Mail  Rejection  for  the  June  2019  issue  of \nPrison Legal News states the reason for rejection as “PRISON LEGAL NEWS \nVOLUME  30  #  6  FOR  June  2019  IS  REJECTED  DUE  TO  POSING  A \nSECURITY THREAT.” The Notice failed to specify how or in what manner that \nissue was a threat.   \n37. The  Notice  of  Package/Mail  Rejection  for  the  July  2019  issue  of \nPrison  Legal  News  states  the  reason  for  rejection  as  “ONE  ARTICLE \nCONTAINING INFORMATION THAT POSES A SECURITY THREAT.” The \n11 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.222    Page 12 of 37\nNotice failed to specify which article was problematic, or how or in what manner \nthat article was a threat. \n38. This censorship of Prison Legal News and the failure of Defendants to \nprovide  adequate  notice  and  explanation  to  HRDC  violates  HRDC’s  First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as further detailed below. \n2. CENSORSHIP AT BARAGA \n39. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Baraga did not receive issues of Prison Legal News on \nmultiple occasions.  \n40. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Baraga from receiving the December 2017, January 2018, \nMarch 2018, March 2019 and other issues of Prison Legal News. Each of these \nissues  of  Prison  Legal  News  were  individually  addressed  and  mailed  to  the \nsubscribers incarcerated at Baraga. HRDC is informed and believes that, although \neach of those issues was properly delivered to Baraga, the issues were withheld \nfrom delivery by staff at the facility.  \n41. Additionally, staff at Baraga rejected a copy of the book Protecting \nYour  Health  and  Safety  sent  to  a  prisoner  in  December  2018.  The  Notice  of \nPackage/Mail Rejection form sent to HRDC listed the reasons for rejection as \n“mail  that  may  pose  a  threat  to  the  security,  good  order,  or  discipline  of  the \nfacility” and “[t]he sender is not the publisher, and is not an authorized vendor.”   \n12 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.223    Page 13 of 37\n42. HRDC has never received any notice from MDOC relating to the \ncensorship of the March 2019 issue of Prison Legal News at Baraga. HRDC also \nnever  received  any  notification  of  an  opportunity  to  appeal  that  censorship \ndecision. This censorship of Prison Legal News and the failure of Defendants to \nprovide  adequate  notice  and  explanation  to  HRDC  violates  HRDC’s  First  and \nFourteenth Amendment rights, as further detailed below.  \n3. CENSORSHIP AT BELLAMY CREEK \n43. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that many of the \nprisoner subscribers incarcerated at Bellamy Creek did not receive issues of Prison \nLegal News on multiple occasions.  \n44. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Bellamy Creek from receiving the July 2017, December \n2017, January 2018, March 2018, May 2018, June 2018, and August 2018 issues \nof  Prison  Legal  News.  Each  of  these  issues  of  Prison  Legal  News  were \nindividually  addressed  and  mailed  to  the  subscribers  incarcerated  at  Bellamy \nCreek. HRDC is informed and believes that, although each of those issues was \nproperly delivered to Bellamy Creek, the issues were withheld from delivery by \nstaff at the facility.  \n45. This  failure  of  Defendants  to  deliver  Prison  Legal  News  violates \nHRDC’s First Amendment rights, as further detailed below. \n13 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.224    Page 14 of 37\n4. CENSORSHIP AT BROOKS \n46. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that many of the \nprisoner subscribers incarcerated at Chippewa did not receive issues of Prison \nLegal News on multiple occasions. \n47. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Brooks did not receive the June 2019 and July 2019 \nissues of Prison Legal News. These issues of Prison Legal News were individually \naddressed and mailed to the subscribers incarcerated at Brooks. HRDC is informed \nand believes that, although that issue was properly delivered to Brooks, the issue \nwas withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n48. HRDC has never received any notice relating to censorship of any \nissues of Prison Legal News at Brooks. HRDC also never received any notification \nof an opportunity to appeal any censorship decisions. This censorship of Prison \nLegal  News  and  the  failure  of  Defendants  to  provide  adequate  notice  and \nexplanation to HRDC violates HRDC’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as \nfurther detailed below. \n5. CENSORSHIP AT CARSON CITY \n49. HRDC  is  informed  and  believes  and  thereon  alleges  that  prisoner \nsubscribers incarcerated at Carson City did not receive the January 2018 issue of \nPrison Legal News. This issue of Prison Legal News was individually addressed \nand mailed to the subscribers incarcerated at Carson City. HRDC is informed and \n14 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.225    Page 15 of 37\nbelieves that, although that issue was properly delivered to Carson City, the issue \nwas withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n50. The Notice of Package/Mail Rejection for this issue states the reason \nfor rejection as “Article in Prison Legal News Jan 2018 Issue” was “mail that may \npose a threat to the security, good order, or discipline of the facility, may facilitate \nor  encourage  criminal  activity,  or  may  interfere  with  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nprisoner.” The Notice failed to specify which article was objectionable, or why it \nwas a threat. \n51. The Notice provided to HRDC is insufficient, as it fails to provide \nsufficient basis to justify the censorship, and does not contain enough information \nfor  HRDC  to  reasonably  challenge  the  rejection  decision.  This  conduct  by \nDefendants violates HRDC’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as further \ndetailed below. \n6. CENSORSHIP AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN \n52. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prisoners \nincarcerated at Central Michigan are not allowed to receive Prison Legal News. A \nprisoner bought a subscription to Prison Legal News in January 2018, but prison \nstaff told him that he could not receive the magazines. \n53. The  issues of  Prison  Legal  News  were individually  addressed  and \nmailed to the subscriber incarcerated at Central Michigan. HRDC is informed and \n15 \n32583357.1 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-12470-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 24   filed 10/23/19    PageID.226    Page 16 of 37\nbelieves that, although each of those issues were properly delivered to Central \nMichigan, they were withheld from delivery by staff at the facility. \n54. HRDC has never received any notice relating to censorship of any \nissues of Prison Legal News at Central Michigan. HRDC also never received any \nnotification of an opportunity to appeal any censorship decisions. This censorship \nof Prison Legal News and the failure of Defendants to provide adequate notice and \nexplanation to HRDC violates HRDC’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as \nfurther detailed below. \n7. CENSORSHIP AT CHIPPEWA \n55. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that many of the \nprisoner subscribers incarcerated at Chippewa did not receive issues of Prison \nLegal News on multiple occasions.  \n56. HRDC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that prison staff \nprevented prisoners at Chippewa from receiving the February 2017, April 2017, \nJanuary 2018, February 2018, March 2018, April 2018, May 2018, June 2018, July \n2018,  and  August 2018  issues  of  Prison  Legal  News.  Each  of  these  issues  of \nPrison  Legal  News  were  individually  addressed  and  mailed  to  the  subscribers \nincarcerated at Chippewa.
