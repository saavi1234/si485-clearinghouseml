    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. In the fall of 2019, district court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule. But after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The District Court in this case issued a judgment enjoining the public charge rule for the Department of State on July 29, 2020. On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for government agencies to review actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule.</p><p><u>Make the Road New York Sues Over the Public Charge Rule</u></p><p>On December 19, 2019, individuals facing deportation, their United States citizen relatives, and nonprofit organizations that assist noncitizens filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs sued the State Department (DOS); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and President Trump, claiming violations of the APA, an <i>ultra vires</i> proclamation by the President, and violations of Fifth Amendment Equal Protection. They alleged that Trump Administration’s changes to the asylum system, various deferred-action programs, and to the family-based immigration system had the purpose and effect of excluding lawful status immigrants \"from predominately nonwhite countries.\" They also alleged that the new rules would essentially create a wealth test for entry into the United States. Plaintiffs alleged that these discriminatory impacts were deliberate and purposeful, and would cause substantial harm in destroying their families, penalizing the use of benefits, and diverting resources from them. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Judge George Daniels.</p><p><u>Background on the Public Charge Rule: Changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual, Presidential Proclamation, and Department of Homeland Security’s Interim Rule</u></p><p>Beginning in January 2018, the DOS published revisions to the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) that changed how consular officers should interpret the public charge rule, which defines personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. The change increased the types of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that if a consular officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is “inadmissible.” Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa. The plaintiffs asserted that the effect of this Rule would be to force immigrant families to choose between using these benefits or risk failing to gain entry to the U.S.</p><p>On October 4, 2019, President Trump issued a proclamation (the Proclamation) relating to the public charge rule, ordering DOS and HHS to deny visas to those who cannot prove they will be able to get health insurance. A week later on October 11, 2019, when the Department of Homeland Security's similar public charge rule (DHS Rule) was beginning to be enjoined by courts around the country, DOS formalized the changes to the FAM by implementing the Interim Final Rule. This rule mirrored the DHS Rule, explicitly expanding the definition of \"public charge\" for the purposes of granting visas.</p><p>The Proclamation was enjoined nationwide on November 26, 2019 in <i><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17309\">Doe v. Oregon</a></i>. 2019 WL 6324560. This case followed soon after, seeking to enjoin and vacate the 2018 FAM revisions, the Interim Final Rule, and the Proclamation.</p><p>On January 14, 2020, this case was accepted as related to <i>Make the Road New York v. Cuccinelli</i> (S.D.N.Y. 2019).</p><p><u>The Plaintiffs Seek a Preliminary Injunction and Defendants Move to Dismiss</u></p><p>On January 21, 2020, plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction, asserting that they were likely to prevail on their claim and if the policies were allowed to continue plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm in the form of indefinite family separation, health risks, and loss of resources for the entities that support noncitizens.</p><p>On February 13, defendants moved to dismiss, asserting that plaintiffs lacked subject matter jurisdiction and failed to state a claim.  </p><p>Plaintiffs additionally sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the defendants from enacting their policies until there was a hearing on the preliminary injunction motion.  The temporary restraining order was intended to protect the plaintiffs from the harms outlined in the complaint until the preliminary injunction motion could be adjudicated. The court rejected the emergency motion on February 21.</p><p>The DOS rule went into effect on February 24, 2020.</p><p><u>District Court Grants Preliminary Injunction, Denies Motion to Dismiss</u></p><p>On July 29, 2020, Judge Daniels issued an order granting a preliminary nationwide injunction against the new rule. 475 F.Supp.3d 232. He held that (1) plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction by being denied visas, which would result in indefinite family separation; (2) an injunction would be \"heavily\" in the public interest; and (3) a nationwide injunction was appropriate because these problems were not geographically isolated. </p><p>The court also granted defendants' motion to dismiss in part, allowing President Trump to be removed as a party from the case. However, Judge Daniels denied every other part of the motion, finding that (1) plaintiffs’ APA claim was within the zone of interest of the INA; (2) plaintiffs; challenge to the 2018 FAM changes were not moot; (3) the APA authorizes judicial review of the DOS's actions; (4) defendants had likely violated the APA; (5) plaintiffs had adequately stated an equal protection claim; and (6) the Proclamation was likely contrary to the INA and <i>ultra vires</i>.</p><p>On September 22, 2020, defendants filed an interlocutory appeal of the preliminary injunction  to the Second Circuit, docket no. 20-3214. They also moved in the District Court to stay the July order pending appeal. The defendants asked Judge Daniels to rule on their motion by October 16, but he declined to do so. The defendants also asked to the Second Circuit to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal.</p><p><u>Changes with the Biden Administration</u></p><p>On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for government agencies to review actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. On February 10, the Second Circuit entered an order holding the proceedings on the interlocutory appeal in abeyance.</p><p>On February 20, defendants moved to stay proceedings for 90 days while the new administration reevaluated the rule. The court granted the motion on February 22.</p><p>As of February 27, 2021, the FAM revisions, Interim Final Rule, and the Proclamation are enjoined nationwide. The Second Circuit has yet to rule on defendants' appeal of the injunction and the stay of the order pending appeal. Proceedings in both the Second Circuit and District Court are currently on hold while the new administration reevaluates its approach to the public charge rule.</p><p></p>",

(Compl., ECF No. 1.) \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 2 of 52\nAt issue are multiple government actions that apply to individuals seeking to  become \nlawful petmanent residents (\"LPRs\").  First, Plaintiffs challenge DOS's January 2018 changes to \nSection 302.8 of Volume 9 of its Foreign Affairs Manual (\"FAM\"), which govems consular officer \ndeterminations of whether an individual applying for a visa is ineligible because he or she is likely \nto become a \"public charge\" (the \"2018 FAM Revisions\").  (See Compl. ~ 3.)  Second, Plaintiffs \nchallenge DOS's October 11, 2019 rule, Visas: Ineligibility Based on Public Charge Grounds, 84 \nFed.  Reg.  54,996  (Oct.  11,  2019)  (codified at 22  C.F.R.  § 40.41)  (the \"DOS Rule\"), which \nredefines the term \"public charge\" and establishes new criteria for public charge determinations \nduring consular processing.  (See Compl. ~ 3.)  The DOS Rule went into effect on February 24, \n2020.  (Defs.' Letter dated Feb. 11, 2020, ECF No. 50, at 1.)  And third, Plaintiffs challenge the \nPresident's  October  4,  2019  Proclamation,  Suspension  of Entry  of Immigrants  Who  Will \nFinancially Burden the United States Healthcare System, in Order to Protect the Availability of \nHealthcare Benefits for Americans, Proclamation No. 9945, 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991 (Oct. 9, 2019) \n(the \"Proclamation\"), as well as subsequent government actions to implement the Proclamation. \n(Compl. ~ 3.)  The Proclamation was scheduled to go into effect on November 3, 2019.  (Id. ~ 10.) \nHowever,  on November 2,  2019,  a  federal  district court in the  District of Oregon issued  a \ntemporary restraining order enjoining the implementation of the Proclamation, Doe #1 v.  Trump, \n414 F. Supp. 3d 1307, 1319 (D. Or. 2019), and subsequently, on November 26, 2019, issued a \npreliminary injunction, Doe v.  Trump, 418 F. Supp. 3d 573, 605 (D. Or. 2019).  On May 4, 2020, \nthe  Ninth  Circuit  denied  the  government's  request  to  stay  the  district  court's  preliminary \ninjunction.  Doe #1 v.  Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1070 (9th Cir. 2020). \nPlaintiffs  seek,  inter  alia,  (1)  a judgment declaring that  the  DOS  Rule,  2018  FAM \nRevisions, Proclamation, and agency actions implementing the Proclamation are unauthorized by \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 3 of 52\nand contrary to law, (2) a vacatur of the 2018 F AM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation, and \n(3) an injunction enjoining Defendants from implementing, or taking any actions to enforce or \napply, the 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule, or Proclamation.  (Compl. at 109-10.) Plaintiffs now \nmove pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65  and the Administrative Procedure Act, \n5 U.S.C. § 705, for a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from applying or implementing \nthe  2018  FAM  Revisions,  DOS  Rule,  and  Proclamation.  (Notice  of Mot.,  ECF No.  43.) \nDefendants, in turn, move to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(l) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  (Notice of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 53.)  Plaintiffs' \nmotion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the application or implementation of the 2018 F AM \nRevisions,  DOS  Rule,  and  Proclamation  is  GRANTED.  Defendants'  motion to  dismiss  is \nGRANTED to the extent that the President is dismissed as a party to this action. \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \nA.  Immigrant Visas and Public Charge Determinations. \nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \"INA\"), an intending immigrant seeking \npermanent residence in the United States must apply for and be issued an immigrant visa through \nconsular  processing  at  a United  States embassy  or consulate.  See  8 U.S.C.  §  1202(a),  (e); \n22 C.F.R. § 42.62.  Immigrants who are unlawfully present in the United States must also seek \npermanent residence through the consular process, as they are generally ineligible to adjust their \nstatus domestically.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), (c)(2).  Such individuals, however, are barred from \n1irNamu TnYldpeh.  le O(e tvmrhr. edeelC een\"ruvtD acaintHcni iotaSn n fe ra Rleoclluifta,ul  ttea4he\"ld1e )9  b Dai sacF Octs.ik eoSSgtn  Rruf,oo puMrupltnhe.a d  k3ai enrnd e d tgg6h raa4ee r 7apdR,ta ieon6rraag 5dld 4lete hN-tl5ae eUi 5wlf  nri (naiYSt meto.hDdreik w.sSN  vCot..a rYotkCeu.  sufr 2octD0'crs e1i pnOp9uea)clb.rlt tilom,iSb c1e euc9nrch  th1C ao 1ribv,gf a 2.He c0 7kod19gme99rt 3eeoMr luam(ne GnimddnB  oaiDSstr iea)oic.nn nudcsMruo iptmrayprk  ioeD(or\" raeDt httceoHeids  SRti hob\"deny).     \nreference herein. \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 4 of 52\nretuming to the United States for a set time period if their unlawful presence exceeds 180 days, \nunless they are granted an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), (v).  To \nsecure an I-601A waiver, an immigrant must establish that he or she is the spouse or child of a \nUnited States citizen or LPR who would suffer extreme hardship if he  or she were refused \nadmission.  Id. at§ 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). \nFor those seeking family-sponsored immigrant visas, the first step is for a qualifYing family \nmember to submit a sponsorship petition (Form I -130) on behalf of the applicant. Once the petition \nis approved, the beneficiary must complete a visa application and, in most cases, be interviewed \nby  a  consular  officer  who  will  determine  whether  to  grant  or  deny  the  application. \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1202(a), (e); 22 C.P.R. § 42.62.  Part of the consular officer's evaluation entails \ndetermining whether the applicant is ineligible for a visa under the so-called \"public charge\" \nprovision of the INA.  See 8 U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(4).  As  set out at 8 U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(4), the \ngovernment may find as inadmissible any noncitizen \"who, in the opinion of the consular officer \nat the time of application for a visa, ... is likely at any time to become a public charge.\"  I d. at § \n1182(a)(4)(A).  In determining whether an applicant is likely to become a public charge, the \nconsular officer must consider, at a minimum, the applicant's ( 1) age, (2) health, (3) family status, \n(4) assets, resources, and financial status, and (5) education and skills.  Id. at§ 1182(a)(4)(B). \nPrior to the government actions at issue, \"public charge\" was defined as a noncitizen who \nhas become or is likely to become \"primarily dependent on the govemment for subsistence, as \ndemonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) \ninstitutionalization for long-term care at government expense.\"  Field Guidance on Deportability \nand Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg.  28,689, 28,689 (May 26,  1999) \n(intemal quotation marks omitted).  This definition was set forth in field guidance issued in 1999 \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 5 of 52\n(the \"Field Guidance\") by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")~the predecessor \nagency to  United  States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\")  and United  States \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\")~that \"summarize[d ]  longstanding law with \nrespect to public charge\" determinations.  !d. \nB.  The 2018 FAM Revisions. \nUntil recently, consistent with the Field Guidance, the F AM defined \"public charge\" as a \nnoncitizen who is likely to become \"primaTily dependent on the U.S. Government\" for subsistence · \neither from \"[r]eceipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance\" or \"[i]nstitutionalization \nfor long-term care at U.S. Government expense.\" (See Dec!. of Andrew J. Ehrlich in Supp. of Pis.' \nMot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\"Pis.' Dec!.\"), Ex. 3 (Illustration of changes from pre-2018 FAM to post-\n2018 FAM) (\"Illustration of2018 F AM Revisions\"), ECF No. 45-3, at 2.) Prior to 2018, the FAM \nexpressly prohibited consular officers from considering use of non-cash benefits in determining \nwhether an applicant is likely to become a public charge, and provided a non-exclusive list of such \nnon-cash benefits programs, including, inter alia, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program \n(\"SNAP\"), Medicaid, and Child Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\").  (See Illustration of 2018 \nFAM Revisions at 4.)  The FAM also directed consular officers to normally consider a valid \naffidavit of support sufficient to meet the requirements under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  (!d.  at \n23.) \nOn Janmuy  3,  2018, DOS implemented the 2018 FAM Revisions.  The 2018  FAM \nRevisions did not explicitly redefine the term \"public charge,\" but for the first time directed \nconsular officers to negatively weigh the receipt (past or current) of any type of public assistance, \nincluding non-cash benefits, in determining whether to issue a visa to an applicant. (See id. at 8.) \nAmong other changes, the 2018 FAM Revisions also reduced the value given to an affidavit of \n5 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 6 of 52\nsupport, specifYing that it would merely be a \"positive\" factor rather than normally sufficient to \nsatisfY the requirements under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  (See id. at 6.) \nC.  The DHS Rule and DOS Rule. \nOn October 10,2018, DHS published a notice of proposed mlemaking, Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. 10, 20 18), which sought, inter alia, to redefine \n\"public charge\" and amend the standard then used in public charge determinations with respect to \napplications for admission or adjustment of status. See id at 51,114. The notice provided a 60-day \npublic comment period on the proposed mle.  Id at 51,116.  Subsequently, on August 14, 2019, \nDHS issued the DHS Rule, Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. \n14, 2019) (codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, 248), which was scheduled to take \neffect on October 15, 2019.  Id at 41,292.  However, between October 11 and October 14, 2019, \nfive federal district courts, including this Court, issued preliminary injunctions enjoining the DHS \nRule.2  Make the Rd NY v.  Cuccinelli, 419 F. Supp. 3d 647, 654 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); New York v. \nUS.  Dep't of Homeland Sec., 408 F. Supp. 3d 334, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Cook Cty., Illinois v. \nMcAleenan, 417 F. Supp. 3d 1008, 1014 (N.D. Ill. 2019); Casa de Md, Inc. v. Trump, 414 F. Supp. \n3d 760, 767 (D. Md. 2019); City & Cty. ofS an Francisco v.  USCIS, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1057, 1073 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019); Washington v.  US. Dep't ofH  omeland Sec., 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1199 (E.D. \nWash. 2019). \nOn October 11, 2019, the same day that the first of these injunctions was issued, DOS \nissued the DOS Ru1e,  which largely mirrors the DHS  Rule, and which DOS contended was \n\"intended to align [its] standards with those of [DHS].\"  84 Fed. Reg. at 54,996.  The DOS Rule, \n2 Today, this Court also grants a new temporary injunction enjoining the DHS Rule during the COVID-19 \nnational health emergency in two related actions that are now consolidated, New York v.  United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security, 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD); Make the Road New York v. Cuccinel/i, 19 Civ. \n7993 (GBD). \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 7 of 52\nlike the DHS Rule, defines \"public charge\" as any noncitizen \"who receives one or more public \nbenefits ... for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month period (such that, for \ninstance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months' worth of benefits).\"  ld. at \n55,014.  In addition, the DOS Rule, like the DHS Rule, defines \"public benefit\" as both cash \nbenefits and noncash benefits, such as SNAP, Medicaid, public housing, and Section 8 housing \nassistance.  ld. \nInvoking the \"good cause\" exception to the notice and comment requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (the \"APA  \"), DOS published the DOS Rule four days before its \neffective date of October 15,2019. DOS alleged that good cause existed because, \"[c]oordination \nof [DOS] and DHS implementation of the public charge inadmissibility ground is critical to \n[DOS' s] interest in preventing inconsistent adjudication standards and different outcomes between \ndeterminations of visa eligibility and determinations of admissibility at a port of entry.\"  I d.  at \n55,011.  Implementation of the DOS Rule was delayed, however, pending approval by the White \nHouse Office of Management and Budget of a form required for processing visa applications.  (See \nDefs.' Letter dated Feb. II, 2020, ECF No. 50, at 1.)  On Febmary II, 2020, Defendants informed \nthis Court that DOS would begin implementing the DOS Rule on February 24, 2020, the same day \nthat DHS intended to implement its own DHS Rule following the Supreme Court's January 27, \n2020 order staying this Court's injunction of the DHS Rule.  (Id.  at 1-2.).  Additionally, on \nFebruary 27, Defendants represented to this Court that as part of its implementation of the DOS \nRule, DOS updated the F AM to reflect the provisions of the DOS Rule, thereby overriding the \n2018 FAM Revisions.  (See Defs.' Add'! Submission in Opp'n to Pis.' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \n(\"Defs.' Add'! Submission\"), ECFNo. 67, at 2-3.) \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 8 of 52\nD.  The Proclamation and Agency Actions Implementing the Proclamation. \nOn October 4, 2019, shortly before the publication of the DOS Rule, President Trump \nissued the Proclamation.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991.  The Proclamation seeks to suspend, subject to \ncertain exceptions, entty into the United States of any immigrant who cannot demonstrate either \nthat he \"will be covered by approved health insurance\" within 3 0 days of arriving to the United \nStates, or that he \"possesses the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical \ncosts.\"  Id.  at 53,992.  The Proclamation identifies eight forms of coverage that it deems to be \n\"approved health insurance,\" plus \"any other health plan that provides adequate coverage for \nmedical care as detennined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\" I d.  It also explicitly \nexcludes Medicaid fi:om its list of \"approved health insurance\" for any individual over the age of \n18.  Id. \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  Proclamation  will  be  implemented  by  DOS  and  HHS, \n(Compl. 'l!lO), and that DOS has already taken several actions towards implementing it, (see id. \n'l!'l!l42-53).  Plaintiffs identifY three such actions in the complaint.  First, on October 24, 2019, \nDOS  published  a  60-Day  Notice  of  Proposed  Information  Collection:  Public  Charge \nQuestionnaire, 84 Fed. Reg. 57,142 (Oct. 24, 2019), that proposed an information collection form \nto be used by consular officers \"in assessing whether an applicant is likely to become a public \ncharge.\"  Though primarily focused on implementing the DOS Rule, the form also asks questions \n\"to establish that the applicant will be covered by an approved health insurance plan within 30 \ndays of entry into the United States, or that the applicant possesses sufficient financial resources \nto cover reasonably foreseeable medical costs.\"  84 Fed. Reg. at 57,143. \nSecond, on October 30, 2019, DOS published a Notice oflnformation Collection Under \nOMB Emergency Review: Immigrant Health Insurance Coverage, 84 Fed. Reg. 58,199 (Oct. 30, \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 9 of 52\n2019)  (the \"Emergency Notice\"  or \"Notice\").  Noting that the Proclamation \"authorizes the \nSecretary of State to establish standards and procedures for governing\" determinations under the \nProclamation,  the  Emergency  Notice  states  that  consular  officers  will  ask  immigrant  visa \napplicants whether they will be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entry, and, if so, to \n\"identifY  the  specific  health insurance  plan,  the  date  coverage  will  begin,  and  such  other \ninformation related to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary.\" Id at 58,199-\n200.  Consistent with the Proclamation, the Emergency Notice explains that if applicants do not \nhave coverage, the Proclamation does not limit entry if they \"possess financial resources to pay \nfor reasonably foreseeable medical expenses.\"  Id at 58,200.  And the Notice defines \"reasonably \nforeseeable medical expenses\" as those \"related to existing medical conditions, relating to health \nissues  existing at the time of visa adjudication.\"  Id  The Emergency Notice invited public \ncomments up to October 31,2019.  Id. at 58,199. \nThird, DOS has issued directives to consular officials regarding the implementation of the \nProclamation (All Diplomatic and Consular Posts Collective messages (\"ALDACs\")), including \nproviding definitions of ambiguous terms.  (Compl. ~ 150.)  Plaintiffs cite an ALDAC dated \nOctober 30, 2019 that (1) lists \"narrow examples of when a person's entry would be 'in the national \ninterest\"' and therefore exempt from the Proclamation, and (2) \"directs consular officers not to \nimplement the Proclamation prior to ... conesponding updates to the F AM.\"  (Compl. ~ 151-52.) \nAs noted, the Proclamation was intended to go into effect on November 3, 2019, but its \nimplementation was  enjoined  by  a temporary  restraining  order  and  subsequent preliminary \ninjunction issued by the District of Oregon.

Plaintiffs. \nPlaintiffs Alicia Doe, Brenda Doe, Carl Doe, Diana Doe, and Eric Doe (the \"Individual \nPlaintiffs\") are all immigrants seeking lawful permanent residence or, in the case of Eric Doe, \nmarried to an immigrant who is seeking LPR status.  (See Compl. ~~ 43~9.) Plaintiff Alicia Doe \nlives with her U.S. citizen husband and their two U.S. citizen daughters, one of whom suffers from \nsevere disabilities stemming from cerebral palsy.  (!d. ~ 43.)  Alicia is the primary caregiver for \nher disabled daughter.  (!d.~ 44.) Alicia's husband \"supports the family by working at a restaurant \nfull-time for minimum wage,\" but the family, except for Alicia, also receives various fmms of \npublic  assistance,  including  Supplemental  Security  Income  related  to  Alicia's  daughter's \ndisabilities, SNAP, and public housing.

Carl \"owns his own business, from which he earned $20,000 last year.\" \n(!d.)  Plaintiff Diana Doe lives with her U.S. citizen husband and U.S. citizen daughter.  (!d.~ 48.) \nShe is the sole caretaker for her husband, who is retired and disabled, and adolescent daughter. \n(!d.) Last year, her husband received Social Security income and retirement benefits totaling about \n$28,000.  (!d.)  Diana suffers from diabetes and has \"typically paid out-of-pocket at neighborhood \nclinics to obtain health care.\" (/d.; Pis.'

Eric suffers from chronic leukemia \nthat requires ongoing treatment.  (Id) \nThe five immigrants have all resided in the United States without authorization after \nentering without inspection.  (See Compl. ,, 44, 46-49.) Due to their unauthorized presence, they \nwill have to leave the United States to undergo consular processing abroad in order to receive \nimmigrant visas.  Four of the immigrants have already received I-601A waivers of inadmissibility \nfor unlawful presence, based on extreme hardship.  (!d.)  They are, therefore, permitted to seek \npermanent residence through consular processing without additional delay.  See supra Part I. A. \nAdditionally, all of the immigrants have secured a US CIS-approved I-130 petition that establishes \na qualifYing family relationship with a United States citizen and is the first step towards securing \na family-based immigrant visa.  (!d.,, 43-49.) \nPlaintiffs Make the Road New York, African Services Committee,  Central American \nRefugee Center New York, Catholic Charities Community Services (Archdiocese of New York), \nand Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc.  (the \"Organizational Plaintiffs\") are nonprofit \norganizations that work with and for immigrants.  (See Compl. ,, 21-42.)  They provide direct \nservices, including legal, educational, and health-related.  (Compl. ,, 21, 24, 28, 34--35, 38-39.) \nMake the Road New York, for  instance, conducts educational workshops on issues affecting \nimmigrants, represents immigrants in removal proceedings, and assists immigrants in applying for \nbenefits and accessing health services.  (Compl. ,  21.)  Similarly, African Services Committee \nprovides legal representation in immigration proceedings, including representing sponsors and \nnavigating consular processing; health-related services; and food pantry and nutrition services. \n(Compl. ,  24.)

(Compl. ~~ 30, 35, 38.) \nII.  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER \nJURISDICTION \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot meet the jurisdictional requirements of standing \nand  ripeness,  and  therefore  preliminaty  relief should  be  denied  and  this  action  should  be \ndismissed.  (Mem. in Opp'n to Pis.' Mot. for Prelim. Inj. and in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"PI \nOpp'n & MTD Mem.\"), ECF No. 54, at 13-20, 22-23.)  The proper procedural route for such a \nchallenge is a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pmsuant to Rule 12(b)(l). \nSee All. for Envtl. Renewal, Inc.  v.  Pyramid Crossgates Co., 436 F.3d 82, 88 n.6 (2d Cir. 2006) \n(\"[T]he proper procedural route [for a standing challenge] is a motion under Rule 12(b)(l).\"); \nDuane Reade, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 261 F. Supp. 2d 293,294 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) \n(\"Ripeness is jmisdictional in nature and therefore properly considered on a motion to dismiss for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b) (1) of the Federal Rules.\"). \n\"A Rule 12(b)(l) motion challenging subject matter jurisdiction may be either facial or \nfact-based.\"  Carter v. HealthPort Techs., LLC, 822 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. 2016).  A facial challenge \nis \"based solely on the allegations of the complaint or the complaint and exhibits attached to it,\" \nwhile a fact-based motion \"proffer[s J  evidence beyond the [complaint and attached exhibits].\" I d. \nat 56-57.

Co., \nLLC v.  Deloitte &  Touche LLP, 549 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir. 2008)) (alterations omitted), and \n\"draw[] all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,\"  id.  at 57 (quoting Lunney v.

Plaintiffs Have Standing and Their Claims Are Ripe for Jndicial Review. \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits the judicial power of federal courts to \"Cases\" or \n\"Controversies.\"  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl.  I.  To invoke this power, a plaintiff must have \nstanding to sue.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398,408 (2013) (citation omitted).  The \nplaintiff bears the burden of establishing standing, Raja m in v.  Deutsche Bank Nat'/ Tr.  Co., 757 \nF.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Lzg'an v. Deft. ofWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Premium \nMortg. Corp. v. Equifax, Inc., 583 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir. 2009)), and such burden applies to each \nclaim and form of relief sought, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v.  Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006).  To \ndemonstrate Article III standing, the plaintiff must show that (1) \"it has suffered a concrete and \nparticularized injury that is either actual or imminent,\" (2) \"the injury is fairly traceable to the \ndefendant,\" and (3) \"it is likely that a favorable decision will redress that injruy.\"  Massachusetts \nv. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 517 (2007) (citing Lzg'an, 504 U.S. at 560-61). \"[T]he presence of one party \nwith standing is sufficient to satisfY Article III's case-or-controversy requirement.\"  Rumsfeld v. \nForum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006) (citation omitted). \nTo be justiciable, Plaintiffs' claims must also be ripe~that is, they \"must present 'a real, \nsubstantial controversy, not a mere hypothetical question.'\"  Nat'/ Org. for Marriage,  Inc.  v. \nWalsh, 714 F.3d 682, 687 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting ASMAT Cable Ltd. v.  Cablevision of Conn., 6 \nF.3d 867, 872 (2d Cir. 1993)).  \"The ripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III limitations \non judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\"  I d.  (quoting \nNat'/ Park Hospitality Ass'n v.  Dep't of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003)).  The constitutional \nrequirement \"overlaps with the standing doctrine, 'most notably in the shared requirement that the \nplaintiffs injury be imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical.\"' In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl \nEther (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., 725 F.3d 65, 110 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Ross v. Bank ofA m., \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 14 of 52\nNA., 524 F.3d 217, 226  (2d Cir.  2008)).  Prudential ripeness, meanwhile, requires a court to \n\"evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of \nwithholding court consideration.\"  Nat'! Org. for Marriage,  Inc., 714 F.3d at 691  (quoting NY. \nCivil Liberties Union v.  Grandeau, 528 F.3d 122, 131-32 (2d Cir. 2008)). \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs all fail to allege concrete and particularized injury that \nis actual or imminent, and therefore cam10t meet the requirements for standing and ripeness.  (See \nPI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 13-20.)  In particular, Defendants claim that Individual Plaintiffs lack \nstanding because neither they nor their family members allege any immediate plans to leave the \ncolilltry to  apply  for  visas,  and none  of the  actions  challenged here \"directly bar\" Individual \nPlaintiffs from obtaining public benefits.  (Id.  at 16-18.)  Defendants maintain that Individual \nPlaintiffs additionally lack standing to challenge the Proclamation because neither they nor their \nfamily members allege any reasonably foreseeable medical costs that they are lillprepared to cover, \nand  therefore  face  no  \"more  than  a  speculative  prospect  of suffering  injury  based  on  the \nProclamation.\"  (Id.  at 15-16.)  Defendants further argue that none of Organizational Plaintiffs \nhave suffered any concrete injury attributable to any of the challenged actions since the only harm \nalleged by these plaintiffs is that they have made changes to services they were already providing. \n(Id at 18.) \nContrary to Defendants' assertions, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that they have standing \nand that their claims  are  ripe  for  review.  To  establish standing,  plaintiffs \"bringing  a pre \nenforcement facial challenge ... need not demonstrate to a certainty\" that they will be negatively \naffected, \"but only that [they have] 'an actual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced \nagainst'  [them].\"  Pac.  Capital Bank,  NA.  v.  Connecticut,  542 F.3d 341,  350 (2d Cir.  2008) \n(citations omitted).  Here,  Individual Plaintiffs fear that their,  or their family  members', visa \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 15 of 52\napplications would be denied under the public charge framework at issue, because of their or their \nhouseholds' health issues, income, English-language skills, and use of non-cash public benefits, \namong other reasons.  (See Compl. '1['1[ 43-49,253, 257.)  Defendants do not contend that this fear \nis unreasonable, at least with respect to the 2018 FAM Revisions and DOS Rule.  Instead, relying \non the Supreme Court's decision in Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, Defendants argue that \nthere  is  no  \"certainly  impending\"  collision  between Individual  Plaintiffs'  interests  and  the \nchallenged  government  actions.  (PI  Opp'n  &  MTD  Mem.  at  17.)  See also \nClapper, 568 U.S. at 409  (\"Thus,  we  have repeatedly  reiterated  that  'threatened injury  must \nbe certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,' and that' [a ]llegations ofp ossible future injury' \nare not sufficient.\" (alterations in original) (citations omitted)).  Individual Plaintiffs, however, \nadequately demonstrate that they or their family members are actively engaged in the process of \napplying for LPR status, including by obtaining approved I-130 petitions, as well as obtaining or \npreparing requests for I-601A waivers of inadmissibility.  (See Compl. '1['1[ 43-49.)  The fact that \nthey have not specified dates on which they plan to leave the United States and submit visa \napplications to  continue the DOS process does not turn their ongoing efforts into \"someday \nintentions,\" as Defendants argue.  (See PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 17.) \nMoreover, in Clapper, the plaintiffs' theory of hatm under the statutory scheme at issue \nwas predicated on a series of decisions by government actors that determined whether such scheme \nwould apply to the plaintiffs at all.  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 410.  In contrast, Individual Plaintiffs are \nundisputedly subject to the challenged government actions.  Individual Plaintiffs or their family \nmembers have taken steps toward securing visas, and before any visas can be issued, consular \nofficers must evaluate whether such individuals are likely to become public charges under the \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 16 of 52\nchallenged framework.  Individual Plaintiffs' alleged hatm is \"certainly impending\" and far from \ndependent on a \"speculative chain of possibilities.\"  Clapper, 568 U.S. at 414. \nFinally, Defendants argue that Individual Plaintiffs cannot be hatmed by the Proclatnation, \nin  particular.  The Proclamation does  not require immigrants to  purchase  \"approved health \ninsurance\" so long as they do not have \"reasonably foreseeable healthcare costs that they are not \nprepared to cover.\"  (PI Opp'n &  MTD Mem. at 15-16.)  Defendants contend that Individual \nPlaintiffs or their family members seeking visas, as applicable, do not have any such expenses and \ntherefore unreasonably fear exclusion under the Proclatnation.  This is plainly incorrect.  Diana \nDoe suffers from diabetes, a clu·onic condition with potentially significant medical expenses. (Pis.' \nDec!., Ex. 16 (Dec!. of Diana Doe), ECF No. 45-16, ~ 16; Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Pis.' \nMot. for Prelim. Inj. and in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"PI Reply & MTD Opp'n\"), ECF \nNo. 66, at 28.)  Though she \"has typically paid out-of-pocket at neighborhood clinics to obtain \nhealth care,\"  (Compl.  ~ 48.),  it is  entirely  unclear  whether  she  can cover any  \"reasonably \nforeseeable\" expenses as contemplated by the Proclamation.  There is simply no guidance on how \nconsular  officers  will  determine  what  expenses  related  to  existing  medical  conditions  are \n\"reasonably foreseeable.\"  Without an \"approved health insurance\" plan, Diana Doe faces  a \nnon-speculative threat of denial of admission, especially considering the administration's intent to \nenforce the Proclatnation \"to the maximum extent possible\" and the Proclamation's focus on the \n\"strain [on] Federal and State governrnent budgets,\" \"higher costs on hospitals and other health care \ninfrastructure,\" and other \"large burden[s] on taxpayers\" associated with uninsured individuals. \n84. Fed. Reg. at 53,991, 53,993. To mitigate this risk, Diana Doe will be forced to purchase private \nhealth insurance that qualifies as \"approved health insurance\" under the Proclamation.  Her fear \nof denied admission, absent costly compliance measures, is sufficient to establish standing.  See \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 17 of 52\nBabbitt v.  United Farm Workers Nat. Union, 442 U.S. 289, 302 (1979) (holding that a plaintiff has \nstanding to  make  a pre-enforcement challenge when \"fear of criminal prosecution under  an \nallegedly unconstitutional statute is not imaginary or wholly speculative.\"); Hedges v.  Obama, 724 \nF. 3d 170, 196-97 (2d Cir. 2013) (\"[The Supreme Court] has applied [the Babbitt] principle in a \nnumber of cases challenging criminal statutes-finding standing where the plaintiff 'will have to \ntake significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution'-and in the civil \ncontext as well.\" (citations omitted)).  In sum, Individual Plaintiffs will unquestionably suffer \n\"concrete and particularized\" injuries that are \"actual or imminent,\" given that they face indefinite \nfamily separation, high costs for private health insurance plans, and prolonged insecurity due to \ntheir uncertain immigration status.  And with every day that passes that these Individual Plaintiffs \nor their family members are unable to move forward with their visa applications out of fear of \ndenial,  they  continue  to  be  deprived  of the  many  benefits  of LPR  status,  including  work \nauthorization and legal security. \nIn any event,  Organizational Plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrate that they will have to \nexpend-and have already expended-significant time and resources to provide new services as \na direct result of the 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation.  (See, e.g., Compl. ,, 23, \n26-27, 29-30, 33, 37, 41-42.)  Courts have repeatedly found that an organization has standing \nwhere, as here, the defendant's conduct interferes with the organization's ability to carry out its \nmission or usual activities or forces the organization to divert its resources in order to prevent some \nadverse consequence on a class of individuals.  See,  e.g., Centro de Ia Comunidad Hispana de \nLocust Valley v.  Town ofO  yster Bay, 868 F.3d 104, 111 (2d Cir. 2017) (\"[W]here an organization \ndiverts its resources  away  from its  current activities, it has suffered an injury  that has been \nrepeatedly  held  to  be  independently  sufficient  to  confer  organizational  standing.\"  (citations \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 18 of 52\nomitted)); Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington v.  Trump, 276 F. Supp. 3d 174, 190 \n(S.D .N.Y. 20 17) (\"[A ]n organization has standing where it is forced to expend resources to prevent \nsome adverse or harmful consequence on a well-defined and particularized class of individuals.\"), \nrev'd on other grounds, 953 F.3d 178 (2d Cir. 2019), as amended (Mar. 20, 2020).  And because \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have adequately  shown that their injuries are \"imminent rather than \nconjectural or hypothetical,\" In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liab. Litig., 725 \nF.3d at  110 (citation omitted), and that they  \"will endure hardship if decision is  withheld,\" \nSimmonds v.  INS, 326 F.3d 351, 359 (2d Cir. 2003) (citation omitted), their claims are also ripe \nfor review. \nB.  Plaintiffs' Have Standing to Assert Claims Against HHS and HHS Secretary Azar \nRegarding the Proclamation. \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert any claims against HHS or \nHHS Secretary Azar, because \"HHS is not responsible for\" the 2018 FAM Revisions, the DOS \nRule, or the Proclamation, and Plaintiffs therefore fail to identify any action \"fairly traceable\" to \nHHS that has caused them any injury.  (PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 15.)  Plaintiffs allege in their \ncomplaint, however, that HHS is responsible for implementing the Proclamation, (see, e.g., Comp l. \n~~ 3,  10, 153 &  n.48), and that the Proclamation \"assigns to HHS a variety of responsibilities \nregarding its implementation and enforcement,\" (id ~53). Indeed, the ninth form of \"approved \nhealth insurance\" listed in the Proclamation is \"any other health plan that provides adequate \ncoverage for medical care as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his \ndesignee.\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 53,992 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the Proclamation tasks HHS with \nissuing  periodic  reports  and  policy  recommendations  on  \"the  continued  necessity\"  of the \nProclamation and any amendments that may be watTanted to achieve its aims.  Id at 53,993.  In \nfact, Plaintiffs cite in their complaint a news article quoting an HHS spokesperson as saying, \"HHS \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 19 of 52\nwill continue to  work with the State Department to implement the president's proclamation,\" \n(Compl. 'If 153 n.48), thereby implying that HHS is already acting to implement the Proclamation. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have standing to assert claims against HHS and Secretary Azar regarding \nthe Proclamation.  See Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 828 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring \nin part and  concurring  in the judgment) (\"Review of the  legality  of Presidential action  can \nordinarily be obtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the President's \ndirective.\" (citations omitted)). \nC.  The President is Dismissed as a Defendant. \nPlaintiffs' seek, in pmi, declaratory and injunctive relief against the President regarding the \nProclamation, which raises a \"thom[y] standing question.\" Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802-03 (plurality \nopinion).  Granting  equitable  relief against  the  President  implicates  serious  constitutional \nquestions.  Generally,  courts  have  no  'Jurisdiction of a bill  to  enjoin  the  President  in  the \nperformance of his official duties.\"  !d.  (quoting Mississippi v.  Johnson, 71  U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, \n501 (1866)).  In Franklin, the Supreme Court issued a clear warning that an injunction against the \nPresident is an \"extraordinary\" remedy that should \"raise[] judicial eyebrows.\" !d. at 802. \nIn this  action, there  is  no  reason to  risk upsetting  longstanding separation-of-powers \nprinciples.  First, dismissing the President will not preclude judicial review of the Proclamation or \nother challenged governmental actions.  Second, Plaintiffs' claims under the AP A are not brought \nagainst  the  President,  either  personally  or  in  his  official  capacity.  Third,  Plaintiffs'  equal \nprotection and ultra vires claims remain as this Court, of course, has authority to issue a declaratory \njudgment and  enjoin lower executive  officials  and  agencies  from  implementing the targeted \ngovernment actions.  See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952).  In \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 20 of 52\nshort, retaining the President as a party will have no substantive effect on the outcome of this \naction.  Accordingly, the President is dismissed from this action. \nIII.  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM \n\"To  survive  a motion to  dismiss,  a  complaint must  contain sufficient factual  matter, \naccepted as  true,  to  'state a  claim to  relief that is  plausible  on its face.\"'  Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl.  Corp.  v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  The \nplaintiff must demonstrate \"more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully\"; \nstating a facially plausible claim requires the plaintiff to plead facts that enable the court \"to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"  !d.  (citation \nomitted).  The factual allegations pled must therefore \"be enough to raise a right to relief above \nthe speculative level.\"  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omittedV \nA  district  court must first  review  a plaintiffs  complaint to  identifY  allegations  that, \n\"because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\"  Iqbal, \n556 U.S. at 679.  The court then considers whether the plaintiffs remaining well-pleaded factual \nallegations, assumed to be tme, \"plausibly give rise to  an entitlement to relief.\"  !d.; see also \nTargum v.  Citrin Cooperman &  Co.,  LLP, No.  12 Civ. 6909 (SAS), 2013 WL 6087400, at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2013). In deciding the 12(b)(6) motion, the comtmust also draw all reasonable \ninferences in the non-moving party's favor.  See NJ. Carpenters Health Fund v.  Royal Bank of \nScot.  Grp., PLC, 709 F.3d 109, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2013). \n3cboF o\"rri iImlnmtnogp  d ilTdnaeeoicgcnic hdtsu .iua,mn siIg tena. n\"cnat'.   s,em  Fx9eoh8iitsti7ihhbo beFintre.   o2itinordn    i dv1np.i 4clsMao2mi,rn iiprsItoSasifrO nfaud stn(e'a2 dd,pd e o6 irCn s7Rs i0ireut.  s bFlse1y.i  9o 1Sr9ne2u3 f(p)oeb)prr).e.

Specifically, in Counts I \nand II, Plaintiffs claim that the 2018 F AM Revisions, DOS Rule, and agency actions implementing \nthe Proclamation violate the substantive requirements and procedural rules for agency action under \nthe APA.4  (Compl. ~~ 182-217, 266-281.) Under Count III, Plaintiffs allege that the 2018 FAM \nRevisions,  DOS  Rule,  and Proclamation violate the  equal  protection guarantee  of the  Fifth \nAmendment.  (Compl. ~~ 218-39, 282-89.)  And finally, in Count IV, Plaintiffs claim that the \nProclamation conflicts with the INA and is ultra vires.  (Campi. ~~ 240-48, 290-94.) \nA.  The Organizational Plaintiffs Are Within the Zone of Interests of the INA. \nDefendants argue that Organizational Plaintiffs cannot state an actionable claim under the \nAPA because they fall outside of the zone of interests of the INA.  Specifically, Defendants argue \n\"there is no indication that the provision of the INA at issue here-8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)-reflects \nany concern for the interests of immigrant service and advocacy organizations.\"  (PI Opp'n & \nMTD Mem. at 22.) \nDefendants'  arguments  are  unavailing.  The  zone-of-interests  test  is  \"not  'especially \ndemanding,\"' particularly as to the AP A and its \"generous review provisions.\" Lexmark Int '1, Inc. \nv.  Static  Control  Components,  Inc.,  572 U.S.  118,  130  (2014)  (citation omitted).  \"The test \nforecloses suit only when a plaintiffs 'interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with \nthe purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to \npetmit the suit.\"' Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band ofP  ottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. \n209,225 (2012) (citation omitted).  In considering whether Plaintiffs satisfy the zone-of-interests \n4 Plaintiffs claim is not that the Proclamation itself is subject to the AP A, but that the agency actions \nimplementiug the Proclamation violate the APA.  (See, e.g., Campi.~~ 195-98, 204-05; PI Reply & MTD \nOpp'n at 6 n.3.) \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 22 of 52\ntest,  this  Court  is  not  limited to  the  specific  provision  at  issue,  but rather  should  consider \nCongress's overall purpose in enacting the INA.  See Clarke v.  Sec.  Indus. Ass 'n, 479 U.S. 388, \n401 (1987).  Importantly, there is no requirement that Congress intended \"to benefit the would-be \nplaintiff.\"  Id 479 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  Additionally, economic injuries have regularly \nbeen sufficient to satisfy the test under various statutes, because a plaintiff \"who is 'likely to be \nfinancially' injured ... may be a reliable private attorney general to litigate the issues of the public \ninterest.\"  Ass'n ofD  ata Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 154 (1970) (citations \nomitted); see also e.g., Bank of Am.  Corp.  v.  City of Miami,  137 S. Ct. 1296, 1304-05 (2017). \nOrganizational Plaintiffs fall within the INA's ambit; in particular, its basic purpose to provide \nintending immigrants with a framework for admission.  Organizational Plaintiffs' very mission is \nto aid immigrants, including by navigating procedures for visa applications and adjustment of \nstatus.  And their members and  clients include individuals who  are  directly impacted by  the \nparticular  governmental  actions  at  issue.  Moreover,  Organizational  Plaintiffs  have  already \nsuffered economic injuries in their efforts to mitigate the potentially harmful effects of the 2018 \nFAM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation.  See supra Part II.A.  Organizational Plaintif:fu' \ninterests are thus, \"at the least, 'arguably within the zone of interests\"' of the INA.  Bank of Am. \nCorp., 137 S. Ct. at 1303 (quotingAss'n ofD  ata Processing Serv.  Orgs., Inc., 397 U.S. at 153). \nB.  Plaintiffs' Claims Challenging the 2018 FAM Revisions Are Not Moot. \nOn February 27,2020, Defendants notified this Court that \"[a]s part of its implementation \nof the Department of State's October 2019 public charge rule, the Government has updated its \nForeign Affairs Manual (F AM) with new instructions reflecting the policy established by the \nOctober 2019 rule.\"  (Defs.' Add' I Submission at 2.) Defendants therefore claim that \"the January \n2018 FAM guidance challenged in this case has been superseded, and the Department's consular \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 23 of 52\nofficers are no longer using it in the adjudication of visa applications.\" (!d. at 2-3.) Accordingly, \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims regarding the 2018 F AM Revisions are moot and should \nbe dismissed.  (Reply Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs.' Reply\"), ECF No. 70, at 3-4.) \nDefendants are correct that a claim may become moot \"after a defendant voluntarily \ndiscontinues challenged conduct,\" Am. Freedom Def Initiative v. Metro.  Transp. Auth ., 815 F.3d \n105, 109 (2d Cir. 2016), but this is not the norm.  Courts will find mootness in such a case only if \n'\" (1) it can be said with assurance that \"there is no reasonable expectation\" that the alleged \nviolation will recur' and '(2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated \nthe effects of the alleged violation.\"' !d. (quoting Cty. ofL os Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625,631 \n(1979)).  In mootness inquiries, the defendants carry a heavy burden of persuasion. See id at 110. \nAs  preliminary  matter,  the  challenged  conduct  has  not  ceased.  Though  there  are \ndifferences between the 2018 F AM Revisions and the current F AM, at least some of the alleged \nharms associated with the 2018 FAM Revisions are still present in the most recent revisions.  For \nexample, consular officers are still directed to consider an applicant's use of non-cash benefits in \ndetermining whether he or she is likely to become a public charge.  See 9 F AM § 302.8-2(B)(l ), \nhttps://farn.state.gov/FA  M/09FA  M/09FAM030208.html. \nEven  assuming,  arguendo,  that the  2018  FAM Revisions  were  entirely  superseded, \nDefendants' argument fails on the first prong of the American Freedom Defense Initiative analysis. \nThough the 2018 F AM Revisions are no longer being used by consular officers in the adjudication \nof visa applications, Defendants do not argue that there is no reasonable expectation that DOS will \nrevert back to the 2018 FAM Revisions at a later time, including if this Court were to enjoin the \nDOS Rule.  At oral argument on Plaintiffs'  motion for a preliminary injunction, Defendants \nexplained that if the DOS Rule were enjoined, the 2018 FAM Revisions would not automatically \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 24 of 52\nbe restored.  (See  Tr.  of Oral Arg. dated Feb. 28, 2020, ECF No. 76, at 7:1-20.)  According to \nDefendants, DOS would then need to consider how to comply with the injunction and issue new \ninstructions to consular officers, and such instructions may or may not be \"similar or identical\" to \nthe 2018 FAM revisions.  (Id.)  Simply put, Defendants do not represent that they will not engage \nin the voluntarily ceased conduct going forward.  They do not foreclose the possibility of DOS \nreimplementing the 2018 F AM Revisions and even admit that any future updates to the F AM may \nbe \"similar oridentical\" to the 2018 FAM Revisions.  (Tr. of Oral Arg. dated Feb. 28, 2020, ECF \nNo. 76, at 7:8-10.) \nDOS' s decision to supersede the 2018 FA  M Revisions does not render Plaintiffs claims \nmoot and prevent this court from granting declaratory and injtmctive relief.  \"A case becomes moot \nonly when it is impossible for a court to  grant 'any effectual relief whatever' to the prevailing \nparty.\"  Am. Freedom Def Initiative, 815 F.3d at 109 (quoting Knox v.  Serv.  Emps.  Int'l Union, \nLocal 1000,  567  U.S.  298,  307  (2012)).  Where,  as  here,  Defendants may  later resume  the \nchallenged conduct, \"an injunction provides 'effectual relief because it precludes the defendant \nfrom reviving the challenged conduct in that manner.\"  Id . \nC.  The Challenged Government Actions Are Subject to Judicial Review. \n1.  The 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Emergency Notice \nDefendants claim that the APA does  not authorize judicial review of the 2018  FAM \nRevisions, DOS Rule, or agency actions implementing the Proclamation, including the Emergency \nNotice.  Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot challenge (1) \"policy decisions\" by \nagencies relating to  admission or exclusion of immigrants, unless affirmatively authorized by \nCongress, (PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 21), and (2) agency action that is not final, (id at 23). \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 25 of 52\nContrary to Defendants' suggestion otherwise, the AP A does not exempt from review \nagency action that pertains to the admission or exclusion of immigrants.  In support of their claim \nthat judicial review of such action is barred, Defendants rely principally on Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. \n787 (1977), where the Supreme Court assessed the constitutionality ofiNA provisions that failed \nto give preferential status to the relationship between \"illegitimate\" children and their biological \nfathers.  (See PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 21.)  As Plaintiffs aptly observe, rather than finding the \nissue unreviewable, the Supreme Court \"underscore[d ] the limited scope of judicial inquiry into \nimmigration legislation.\"  Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792 (emphasis added).  The Court noted that it had \n\"repeatedly emphasized that 'over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress \nmore  complete  than  it  is  over'  the  admission  of aliens.\"  !d.  (emphasis  added)  (citation \nomitted).  Fiallo  did not  extend this  limit on judicial review to  executive  or  agency  action \nimplementing Congressional legislation like those at issue here. \nThe APA does limit judicial review to \"final agency action,\" see 5 U.S.C. § 704, but the \n2018 PAM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Emergency Notice5 meet this standard.6  Agency action is \nconsidered \"final\" under the AP A where the  action first,  \"mark[s] the consurnrnation of the \nagency's decisionmaking process,\" and second, is \"one by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\"  US. Army Corps ofEng'rs v.  Hawkes \nCo., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813 (2016) (quotingBennettv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997)).

Sbns.tro  otm5ha5eed,    \n64 (2004). \n6 Any claims against HHS or Secretary Azar under the AP A are dismissed because Plaintiffs have not \nsufficiently alleged \"final agency action\" by such defendants. \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 26 of 52\ntake a \"pragmatic\" approach to finality.  Id. at 1815 (citing Abbott Labs. v.  Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, \n149 (1967)). \nAs an initial matter, the DOS Rule plainly qualifies as \"final agency action\" and Defendants \ndo not claim otherwise.  The 2018 FAM Revisions and Emergency Notice also satisfy the first \ncondition of finality, as DOS gave no indication that the standards and procedures outlined therein \nwere  \"merely  tentative  or  interlocutory.\"  US.  Army Corps  of Eng'rs,  136  S.  Ct.  at  1813. \nDefendants, however, argue that the 2018 FAM Revisions and the Emergency Notice have no \n\"independent legal effect\" and therefore fail as to the second prong.  (See PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. \nat 24, 42; Defs.' Reply at 27.)  Defendants characterize the FAM as an \"agency manual\" that \n\"provides guidance to (DOS] personnel on how to comply with legal requirements imposed by \nstatutes and regulations.\" (PI Opp'n& MTD Mem. at 25.)  But the 2018 FAM Revisions are more \nthan that.  Despite DOS's purported intention to merely \"clarify the agency's interpretation of the \napplicable  statutes  and regulations,\"  id.,  the 2018  FAM Revisions  substantively changed the \nframework associated with public charge determinations.  They \"embodie[d ) a conscious change \nin policy\" and \"legal consequences flow[ed]\" from their implementation.  State of New  York v. \nUS. Immigration and Customs Enf't, 431 F. Supp. 3d 377, 386-87 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  According \nto the complaint, in fiscal year 2018, there was a twelve-fold increase in denials on public charge \ngrounds.  (Compl.  ~ 84.)  This practical effect of the 2018 FAM Revisions  corroborates the \nconclusion that they  constitute  a  final  agency  action.  See,  e.g.,  State  of New  York  v.  US. \nImmigration and Customs Enf't, 431  F.  Supp. 3d at 386 (citing a 1700 percent increase in civil \nimmigration arrests by ICE officers around New York state courthouses in support of finding that \nan agency policy regarding courthouse arrests was a final agency action). \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 27 of 52\nLegal consequences will flow from the Emergency Notice as well.  As Plaintiffs note, the \nNotice explicitly sought to \"establish standards  and procedures  ... governing\" admissibility \ndeterminations under the Proclamation.  84 Fed. Reg.  at 58,199.  The Notice imposes distinct \nobligations  on visa applicants  to  demonstrate  that  they  will be  covered  by  approved  health \ninsurance within 30 days of entry or possess financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable \nmedical expenses.  Under the Notice, applicants who state that they will have approved health \ninsurance coverage are required to \"identify the specific health insurance plan, the date coverage \nwill begin, and such other information related to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems \nnecessary.\" !d. at 58,199-200. Additionally, the Emergency Notice limits \"reasonably foreseeable \nmedical expenses\" to those related to \"health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.\"  !d. \nat 58,200.  Contrary to Defendants' assertion that the Emergency Notice is \"simply a preliminary \nstep ... to collect information,\" (Defs.' Reply at 28), the Notice provides standards for consular \nofficers to implement the Proclamation with \"direct and appreciable legal consequences\" for visa \napplicants, US. Army Corps ofEng'rs, 136 S. Ct. at 1814 (quoting Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178); see \nalso Franklin, 505 U.S. at 796-97 (\"To dete1mine when an agency action is final, we have looked \nto, among other things, whether its impact 'is sufficiently direct and immediate' and has a 'direct \neffect on ... day-to-day business.\"' (alterations in original) (citations omitted)). \n2.  The Proclamation \nThe Proclamation, itself, is also subject to judicial review.  In Franklin, the Supreme Court \nheld that Presidential actions are not subject to review under the APA, Franklin, 505 U.S. at 801, \nbut noted that such actions \"may still be reviewed for constitutionality.\"  !d.  (citing Youngstown \nSheet &  Tube Co.  v.  Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); Panama Refining Co.  v.  Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 \n(1935)).  However, not \"every claim alleging that the President exceeded his statutory authority \n27 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 28 of 52\n[is] considered a constitutional claim.\"  Dalton v.  Specter, 511 U.S. 462,474 (1994).  Such claims \nmay be merely statutory, and in such cases, \"[w]here a statute ... commits decisionmaking to the \ndiscretion of the President, judicial review of the President's decision is not available.\"  Id. at 477. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegation that the Proclamation is ultra vires and violates \nseparation of powers \"is a statutory claim, not a constitutional [one],\" (PI Opp'n & MID Mem. at \n43 (citing Dalton, 511 U.S. at 471-77)), and that review of such a statutory claim is impermissible \nunder Dalton because the INA \"commits the decision\" to  issue  such a Proclamation \"to the \ndiscretion of the President,\" (id.  (quoting Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474)). \nNo court has found that Congress granted the President unfettered power, immune from \njudicial review, to  issue a proclamation that directly  conflicts with express provisions of the \nINA.  Neither of the two Supreme Court cases on which Defendants rely-Dalton and Trump v. \nHawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018)-stand for the proposition otherwise.  The Dalton Comt made \nclear that not \"every action by the President, or by another executive official, in excess of his \nstatutory authority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution,\" 511 U.S. at 472, but by no means \nfound that \"action in excess of statutory authority can never violate the Constitution or give rise to \na constitutional claim,\" Sierra  Club  v.  Trump,  929 F.3d 670,  696  (9th Cir.  2019) (discussing \nDalton) (alteration in original). \nThe President issued the Proclamation pursuant to  8 U.S.C.  § ll82(f).  Section 1182(f) \nprovides the President with authority to \"suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as \nimmigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be \nappropriate\" whenever he finds that \"entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United \nStates would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"  8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).  The text \nof the statute plainly provides the President with significant discretion to impose entry restrictions, \n28 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 29 of 52\nbut under Defendants' interpretation, the President would have seemingly limitless authority to \noveiTide the complex inadmissibility framework enacted by Congress and codified in the rest of \nSection 1182, so long as he claimed to be protecting the interests of the country.  This could not \nhave been what Congress intended and stands in sharp contrast to the executive actions at issue in \nDalton.  In Dalton, the Court considered a challenge to the President's decision to close a specific \nmilitary facility pursuant to  the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (\"Base \nClosure Act\"), which had implemented an \"elaborate selection process\" designed \"to provide a \nfair process that [would] result in the timely closure and realignment of military installations inside \nthe United States.\"  Dalton, 551 U.S. at 464 (citation omitted).  As part of the selection process, \nthe  Secretary  of Defense  submitted  recommendations  to  an  independent  commission  that \neventually made recommendations to the President, who then either approved or disapproved such \nrecommendations.  !d.  at 465.  The substance of the plaintiffs' challenge in Dalton was that the \nSecretary ofthe Defense and independent commission allegedly violated procedural requirements \nof the Base Closure Act in formulating their recommendations to close a specific facility.  In that \ncontext, the Court \"explained that an allegation that the President had not complied with the statute \nwould not necessarily become a constitutional claim through an ultra vires themy.\" Sierra Club, \n929 F.3d at 696 (citing Dalton, 551 U.S. at 472-73).  Unlike in Dalton, Plaintiffs' contention is \nnot that the President simply did not fully comply with a congressionally prescribed process. \nRather, Plaintiffs claim that the President's actions affirmatively displaced a congressionally \nmandated test for admissibility.  If true, in issuing the Proclamation, the President implicated \nconstitutional separation of powers concerns not present in Dalton.  Plaintiffs' allegations are thus \nappropriately considered as constitutional claims subject to judicial review. \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 30 of 52\nIn Hawaii,  the  Supreme  Court  recognized  that  \"§  1182(f)  exudes  deference  to  the \nPSrteasteids,e\"n t1\"3 a8n Sd.  \"Cgtr.a antt s2 4th0e8 .P rTeshied eCnotu brrt,o hado wdiesvcerre,t isotinl lt o\"a ssussupmened[d  t)h we ietnhtotuyt o dfe acliideinnsg i nthtoa tt phlea Uinntiiftefsd'  \nsatta itsustuoery e xclcaeiemdse dar teh ree Evixeewcaubtilvee,\"'s i pdo awte 2r4 o0r7 w, aans do pthreorcweeisdee udn tcoo envsatiltuuattieo nwahl,e ithde ar tt h2e4 p0r8o-c1l2am,2a4t1io8n- \n2th3e. reA iss  t\"hneo c roeuarsto inn  ttoh ef oDriesgtori crte voife Owr eogno tnh efo munerdi tisn w rehveine wthien gS uthper esmame eC Poruorct lhaams a[tiitosenl fa!t  eisnsguaeg heedr ein,  \nsuch review.\"  Doe v.

The 2018 FAM Revisions and DOS Rule Are Likely Contrary to the INA. \nAs this Court found with respect to the DHS Rule-which Defendants admit \"largely \ntracks\" the DOS Rule and advances the same new definition of\"public charge,\" (see PI Opp'n & \nMTD Mem. at 33)-Plaintiffs not only adequately allege, but are likely to succeed on the merits \nof their claim that Defendants lacked the authority to redefine \"public charge\" as they have in the \nDOS  Rule,  contrary  to  the  INA  and  in  violation  of the  AP A.  See  Make  the  Rd  NY, \n419 F. Supp. 3d at 656, 660-61.  The long-standing definition of\"public charge\" is someone who \nis primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  (See Compl. ~~ 5, 156-81.) Further, it \nis undisputed that the term has never been construed as receipt of 12 months of benefits within a \n36-month period.  Rather, prior to the implementation of the DOS Rule and the DHS Rule, public \ncharge determinations were an inquiry about self-subsistence, not about lawful receipt of benefits \nthat are in many cases temporary and supplemental.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Congress \never intended for a redefinition of the term as that set forth in the DOS Rule or DHS Rule.  (See \nCompl. ~~ 165-78.) Defendants' definition is plainly outside the bounds ofthe statute. \nSimilarly,  the  2018  FAM Revisions  likely  exceed the  limits  of the \"public  charge\" \ndefinition under the INA.  While the 2018 FAM Revisions did not alter the explicit definition of \n\"public charge,\" they required consular officers to evaluate the receipt of public assistance of any \ntype, at any time, and by any family member in making such determinations.  (See Illustration of \n2018 FAM Revisions at 8.)  Congress has repeatedly rejected attempts to  consider non-cash \nbenefits in the public charge analysis, (see Comp l. ~~ 169-74 )  -a fact that strongly favors finding \nthat DOS acted in excess of statutory authority in implementing the 2018 F AM Revisions, see \n31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 32 of 52\nHwGfdsraooeuamutmvpeldepdrearml wnenmmiho nvar.eea vknntRe itto u'astnmlha  sciasa nhtfnce tiodeelnrdC vpds,eo rio5dedn 4 tgena8rrtto aheiUtotse,is n. oS a.nr\".l er )o5eos.n 5upfe7le  tnI,a  onot5rte n7h fd-iea9clnc y-a t8 s,Gc h0oeot  m(hnav2edsbe0 sori0iFnnrs6saimtee)at idlen(od,n\"c n Cet,G   eobupxunerrpiggdcorraeaveeusnsisd sscsleeeh'y   ,er  sseruwujeeecf xhfchiciwt ccilbiouheeendi ngno etohed ufsfr ti e tlthissfnh eroeoe\" uvdaamrevr ce raieyl  sypb p l uyatuonba bt gglhlisaiucecuia in prgsc pcetnhho  ataarhttrtrhu aggeartee e n    \nindividuDale foern fdaamnitlsy .c\"l a6im4  Ftheda.t  Rtheeg .S autp 2re8m,6e9 2C. ourt's order staying this Court's injunction of the \nDOc(MiSHlDpnaoeSjpiHumtm 'oSnnR mb t c&uhRetaila ruyoe Mtol o net\"frTh' sp, tei  Dhrsn Jo eD. a,cvM  tHu[iidSdoeriSruemnse sspwRn. er eteniualdsmyttlpi ee 3nee  p3igsc]es c.)i n)Ca ou d(lponlTniyeulnooa .rg\"t wstit)  tnh.dbfr geuoies  lnTfc.tco ghohur aSnesertets e  raeetaiahpnd sreWpo  yt ienh,sSo as etlelthu f ocaevio onp .rf Sngpe Ctud clhiap oociC srnoase istktCrmaii codCyouene tu iyro'Ctsr ..,f  to[ m' tstulhAhl eriloestsir n r  idtdCOso iueadiocscrp tu ,nhao iro,sr1b ttst'4te s uhfa0r]rii d  nos2Sed gm0.aCr  1re tCloihs9ittseues .  r  Irtc6 inhtnah'8jesnuja1  umanld,nl lcee6eycttnr8isteiogii2ntosnes n.n s,(\"o i2   nto\"f0o[a( ft2 nPht tt0i]hIehoo) e e n    \nregarding th2e.  prTohper i2et0y1 8o fF aA pMre Rlimeviinsiaornys i,n DjuOncSt iRounl ein,  athnadt  Eacmtieorng erenmcya iNnos tuicned iAsrtuer Lbeikde. ly Arbitrary \nand Capricious. \nAn agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the promulgating agency \"has relied on \nfabaUnsecpa.ftSroeor.crr oste w2  otw9h[f,.he  ]th\" i4ac e3gh  pe (CrnI1ocdo9by.n 8l.eg\"3m r)eM.N, s s[oeo \"tvhroTe Jarhrs  ot eVhfn feeoeshlcreti eocsidslpne, et a eM nnto hfedrfexes  .prd el AAavitsniP esatAow 'tni    ocounroenf nfq UdosuierSd ir.rie ,te srtsI,h   ndeece an.c n'taivi sr.r ieboSalinygttar e tatfnhearc ayiFylt e  anadrnmt modtos     Mccc\"oaueoputnn.rn gsiAticaeduigroet eotruo  .s  ai'tin nnh sse i.t m ae'rCnvpedoiaod.asr,er to4ndan6cn ee3itsd     \n32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 33 of 52\ndecisionmaking,\"' Michigan v.  EPA,  135  S.  Ct.  2699, 2706 (2015) (citation omitted), and to \n\"articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action,\" State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citation omitted). \nWhere an agency changes an existing policy, the agency need not demonstrate \"that the reasons \nfor the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one,\" but it must \"show that there are \ngood reasons for the new policy.\"  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) \n(alteration in original).  This requirement is heightened where the \"new policy rests upon factual \nfindings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,\" id. (citation omitted), as \"a reasoned \nexplanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered \nby the prior policy,\" id at 516. \nAs this Court found in enjoining the DHS Rule, Defendants fail to provide any reasonable \njustification for changing through the DOS Rule the definition of\"public charge\" or the framework \nfor determining whether an individual is likely to become a public charge.  See Make the Rd NY., \n419 F. Supp. 3d at 662-63.  Defendants claim that the DOS Rule was \"largely driven by a desire \nto conform [DOS's] standard to the standard adopted by DHS.\"  (PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 37.) \nDefendants' argument rings hollow. A \"desire\" for consistency is far from a sufficient explanation \nfor upending a framework that has been in place for decades, particularly where there is neither \nsupport for such a change in the history ofU.S. immigration law, nor any indication that Congress \nwanted such a change.  Moreover, Defendants took no action throughout the entire comment \nperiod for the DHS Rule, during which time they could have considered and addressed any \narbitrary aspects of the DOS Rule.  Defendants instead waited until just four days before the DHS \nRule was originally to go into effect to rush to publish its own parallel rule without public debate. \nDefendants offer no explanation whatsoever for their decision to implement the 2018 FAM \nRevisions.  In fact, DOS has never provided a rationale for its substantial departure from the public \n33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 34 of 52\ncharge framework under the FAM that existed prior to January 3, 2018.  Defendants similarly \nfailed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking iu publishing the Emergency Notice.  First, the Notice \nestablishes no workable standard for implementing the Proclamation.  Despite providing some \nparameters for \"reasonably foreseeable medical expenses,\" neither the Notice nor the Proclamation \ndefines a number of other key terms needed to carry out the President's directive, particularly those \nrequired to determine whether a given health insurance plan qualifies as approved coverage.  For \nexample, the Proclamation considers a \"visitor health insurance plan that provides adequate \ncoverage  for  medical  care  for  a  minimum  of  364  days\"  to  be  an  approved  plan. \n84 Fed. Reg. 53,992 (emphasis added).  The Notice, however, fails to provide any standard or \nguidance for what constitutes \"adequate coverage for medical care.\"  The Notice similarly leaves \napplicants and consular officers facing an unmoored inquiry as to the bounds of several other \ncategories of approved health insurance, as it also fails to define such terms as, \"unsubsidized \nhealth plan\" and \"catastrophic plan.\"  (Mem. of Law in Supp. ofPls.' Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\"PI \nMem.\"), ECF No. 44, at 37; see also Camp!. 'i[204.)  Additionally, as Plaintiffs correctly note, the \nProclamation and the agency actions implementing it will likely result in \"the very harms [that] \nthe  Proclamation purports  to  prevent.\"  (PI  Mem.  at  3 7;  see  also  Comp l.  'II  244-47 .)  The \nProclamation, by its own terms, attempts to address the issue of uncompensated costs incurred by \nhospitals in treating uninsured patients.  However, many of the \"approved health insurance\" plans \nare  legally or practically unavailable to many immigrants, and Plaintiffs allege that multiple \noptions  do  not  provide  comprehensive  coverage  for  such  services  as  prescription  drugs, \nhospitalization or emergency care.  (PI Mem. at 37; Compl. 'i[245); see also Doe v.  Trump, 418 F. \nSupp. 3d at 583-84.  In limiting adequate healthcare options for immigrants, the Proclamation and \nEmergency Notice may increase, rather than decrease, the number ofunderinsured, or effectively \n34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 35 of 52\nuninsured, American residents. Defendants thus risk generating the uncompensated care costs that \nthe Proclamation professes to address. \n3.  The 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule,  and Emergency Notice Likely Violate the \nProcedural Requirements of the APA . \nThe AP A, subject to  limited exceptions, requires an agency to provide for notice and \ncomment before issuing a rule.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)-(d).  Specifically, the agency must publish \n\"[g]eneral notice of proposed rule making\" and provide the public \"an opportunity to participate \nin the rule making tlu·ough submission of written data, views, or arguments.\"  I d.  § 553(b ), (c). \nThe APA's notice-and-comment requirements \"are not mere formalities,\" but rather \"serve the \npublic interest by providing a forum for the robust debate of competing and frequently complicated \npolicy considerations.\"  Nat. Res. Def Council v.  Nat'/ Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d \n95, 115 (2d Cir. 2018).  These requirements do not apply, however, \"to interpretative rules, general \nstatements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice,\" or \"when the agency \nfor good cause finds ... that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest.\"  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A)-(B); see also id.  § 553(d)(2)-(3).  \"The \nburden is on the agency to  establish that notice and comment need not be provided.\"  Nat 'I. \nHighway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d at 113-14 (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the DOS \nRule violated the AP A's procedural requirements and that dismissal of this claim is inappropriate. \nDefendants argue that DOS properly invoked the good cause exception to the notice-and-comment \nrequirements, given the \"impending effective date\" of the parallel DHS Rule and the \"critical\" \nneed to \"promptly align\" the public charge standards used by DOS and DHS.  (PI Opp'n & MTD \nMem. at 31-32.) As noted, the good cause exception applies only in circumstances where notice-\nand-comment is \"impracticable, unnecessmy, or contrmy to the public interest.\"  5 U.S.C.  § \n35 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 36 of 52\n5ro1e\"5i(fcs1inc3cs poa4soi(  toim bmricg(n) nuconm(mdgilBnite  efieftM )innoimn.cng  ttaa aei \" niMcgmnIdstkmh    ai\"u ittmTp[cn osdorrkt  miau ]n  rtTaccfheaecrkt dcctoiutsutcoius,clar aeuayketIl lre s nilsi,st aym ceytin Ih.t  n,puhid.r sceaa.a 6 .atci ..r8imtvmt. o2  r..t pnpe o  EgFutgsa heP  bsc.a3enaitrlA n,difde c,pe  rea a tau6wdsnytlb8a  dl,h9a ylf2 siies4  iccuFc tn)h byco..ci  3e.hnno\"tnAd ft hnaeei Nsse8nsrf  e e7ieattcqoos,adt i t ud'9 a\"latte3m.olh i   n rfetH(ieo ot ntDimr\"r iai agtp.slehtCvht uhrrete.wbgeao  lpCt le, ai ieutnvcioyhxrbc e r.eicT y l nw2 ier rcits0pauneh i1fittlrdefniue2eioun tcas)ens ) ttiitr\"si.S mr oet  ayopTsnmaf  trs ht,aoae \"treinpnyd on \"dp\"g iuA twa ul,htyt dtniobheen.mn   e ieiutcecim h!ncshaddeee.p u.a,e   sl s optse8r(eeuucafm9 rinr lbnm4teyeolio  inn\"iFwttcn itgip.c.acao3 \"retetMu doii  oola na!daannndgnt c ,.d  d  k   \nTrucks, NInocn.,e 6 o8f2 t hFe.3 cdi ractu 9m4-s-t-a9n5c).e s warranting invocation of the good cause exception are present. \nRimDsifad ntosarHtioada thamlnawylp eStedonisepsar hoaw de,R dobb ntilalreiDcufeeainrt-dhnflfuldOigeoeo  enn u  pD rr,Sftiine ewrhltnHt'io yd eshctt eOp  he hStetrreerooeeee ncx d  snl tct Dcceh,eoreo  utoaadebnHonassi m eo assreAeSrrteiun  me i dfoP 2fgdRaoeuiefA0h lcurru pint1  iez.lhliatt  8tdeeso etilc.Dh s  m    waoDuceecHn8auoia miHny3t\"lrmsSe dg cgeS pl Ftmu  royi otsugesRmh oi ersdaemgeupdnuvd.no  lo tpeeDocRe scrdnlyip  aOyteni t toenugi  teSttdwont .ssodA h   e   naR 5enebi\"uieet1f oy utsgfve,A bt  le1uuDdaieapcPc1nsd  nrHttjet4t Aoe ou nit 2.Sl  oops ,e a0 t.tt orfDh lph 1'  idsApaeeua9geearn  nb.fnsdoye ne d l  PpvstIaino rh nseolgpdutbahes iserlaeocit  eeonDntenfefhd,omcat t- Oiae sydraafru e   ,nfusfSsD  lsua dtDlig' aeOitwn cs-al temc owweuStpefoedrtleau airo ml lRnkesb trlro uicdiumalyinni tlsanl,calegg ee nytj cs. n decut   itntstnuh ndow Do ddrawi  ruitccireuepnetaogridfhlr,gaiieeen on ot\"l t nmen,vogu[st ddehi it otat]daga c erukhffnnoet  n ioei[ad  ttnoDtw slidnaieglnn lmooerhon t  dofwowta tpiie in ndmwcrriineolneit efydsahoi cg ftytm an feeohr teonachtAsr pahtutt stehlsi rP sarev 'e  ] nA e     \n36 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 37 of 52\nprocedures.\"'  (PI Mem. at 24 (quoting Nat'/ Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d at 114-\n15)); see also Nat. Res. Def Council v. Abraham, 355 F.3d 179, 205 (2d Cir. 2004) (\"We cannot \nagree ... that an emergency of [the agency's] own making can constitute good cause.\"). \nPlaintiffs also sufficiently allege that the 2018 FAM Revisions and Emergency Notice \nviolate notice-and-comment requirements, and are likely to prevail on these claims.  Defendants \nmaintain that such actions  are interpretive rules  and therefore exempt fi·om  APA procedural \ndemands.  When reviewing an agency's compliance with required procedures, courts distinguish \nbetween interpretive rules and substantive or legislative rules.  While interpretative rules are not \nsubject to rulemaking requirements, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A); id.  § 553(d)(2), legislative rules \n\"must  comply  with  the  notice  and  comment  provisions  of the  AP A,\"  Sweet  v.  Sheahan, \n235 F .3d 80, 90 (2d Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).  However, the distinction between legislative \nand interpretive rules is somewhat amorphous.  As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, the \n\"precise meaning [of the tetm 'interpretive rule'] is the source of much scholarly and judicial \ndebate.\"  Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass'n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015); cf Noel v.  Chapman, 508 F.2d \n1023, 103 0 (2d Cir. 197 5) (noting that the distinction between rules subject to notice-and-comment \nand general statements of policy is \"enshrouded in considerable smog.\"). \nStill,  courts have proffered some general principles for  consideration.  In this  circuit \nlegislative rules \"are those that 'create new law, rights, or duties, in what amounts to a legislative \nact.\"'  Sweet,  235  F.3d  at  91  (quoting  White  v.  Shalala,  7 F.3d 296,  303  (2d  Cir.  1993)). \n\"Legislative mles have the force oflaw.\"  New York City Employees' Ret. Sys. v. S.E.C., 45 F.3d \n7, 12 (2d Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).  Interpretive rules, on the other hand, \"merely 'clarifY an \nexisting statute or regulation.\"'  Sweet, 235 F.3d at 91 (quoting United States v.  Yuzary, 55 F.3d \n4 7,  51  (2d Cir. 1995)).  Interpretive mles are \"issued by an agency to advise the public of the \n37 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 38 of 52\nagency's construction of the statutes and mles which it administers.\"  Perez,  575  U.S.  at 97 \n(quoting Shalala v.  Guernsey Memorial Hospital, 514 U.S. 87, 99 (1995)).  In Sweet, the Second \nCircuit also described a \"more comprehensive test for distinguishing legislative and interpretive \nrules\" set forth by the D.C. Circuit.  Id (citing Am. Mining Cong. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., \n995 F.2d 1106, 1110-12 (D.C. Cir.  1993)).  The American Mining Congress court detailed four \nquestions relevant to this inquiry: \n(1) whether in the absence of the rule there would not be an adequate legislative \nbasis for enforcement action or other agency action to confer benefits or ensure the \nperformance of duties, (2) whether the agency has published the rule in the Code \nof Federal Regulations, (3) whether the agency has explicitly invoked its general \nlegislative authority, or (4) whether the rule effectively amends a prior legislative \nrule. \n995 F.2d at 1112.  If any of these questions are answered affirmatively, the rule is legislative rather \nthan interpretive.  !d.  Here, the 2018 FAM Revisions, at a minimum, effectively amended a prior \nlegislative rule-the public charge framework memorialized in the Field Guidance and the F AM \nprior to January 3, 2018.  Defendants contend that such prior rules were not legislative because \nthey did not go through notice-and-comment mlemaking.  This arguably circular logic simply \nignores the fact that such agency actions established a substantive set of rules governing public \ncharge detetminations beyond the minimum requirements set forth in the INA. \nDefendants argue that the F AM cannot be legislative, because it does not carry any legal \nforce.  Rather,  it  \"provides  guidance  to  [DOS]  personnel  on  how  to  comply  with  legal \nrequirements\" and \"instruct[s] [DOS] personnel on [DOS] policies and procedures.\"  (PI Opp'n & \nMTD Mem. at 25.)  Defendants claim that Volume 9 of the FAM, in particular, simply provides \n\"consular  officers  with  the  guidance  needed  to  make  informed  decisions  based  on  U.S. \nimmigration law and regulations.\" (Id at 26.)  Though \"[a] n agency's characterization of a rule is \nthe 'starting point' for an analysis of its status as legislative or interpretive,\" Mejia-Ruiz v. INS, 51 \n38 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 39 of 52\nF.3d 358, 365 (2d Cir. 1995) (citations omitted), it is just that-a starting point.  And as the District \nof Maryland already found, Volume 9 of the FAM \"contain[s] all the hallmarks of a legislative \nrule.\"  Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v.  Trump, 416 F. Supp. 3d 452, 505 (D. Md. 2019). \nSpecifically,  it  institutes  a  comprehensive  framework  for  public  charge  inadmissibility \ndeterminations that cannot be said to simply clarifY what is set forth in the INA.  The INA provides \na list of five factors (i.e., age; health; family status; assets, resources and financial status; and \neducation and skills) for consular officers to consider, at a minimum, in assessing whether a visa \napplicant is likely to become a public charge.  The FAM's public charge provisions transform this \nbasic directive into an intricate set of rules regarding, inter alia, the types of public assistance to \nbe considered and excluded, the impact and reliability of an applicant's financial sponsor, and the \nspecific information relevant to the officer's evaluation, and that the applicant must therefore \nprovide.  Also, the 2018 F AM Revisions substantially alter this framework by imposing new legal \nlimitations on visa applicants not previously reflected in the F AM or INA, including eliminating a \nsafe harbor for non-cash public assistance utilized by applicants or their family members.  See \nSweet, 235 F.3d at 91 (\"Legislative rules can impose obligations on members of the public distinct \nfrom, and in addition to, those imposed by statute.\") (citation omitted).  Moreover, the public \ncharge provisions of the F AM do  not simply provide general guidance to consular officers to \nexercise their discretionary authority in inadmissibility detmminations.  Many of the directives are \nmandatory.  See id (\"Legislative rules bind members of the agency and the public ....\" ) (citation \nomitted).  DOS cannot skirt notice-and-comment requirements by shoehorning a comprehensive \nlegal regime into \"guidance\" for agency personnel and the public. \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs allege that DOS's Emergency Notice is a substantive rule.  Defendants \nlabel the Emergency Notice as simply a preliminary step for information collection, but \"[w   ]hen \n39 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 40 of 52\ndetermining whether an agency action is subject to [notice-and-comment], the court looks not to \nlabels given by the agency, but rather to the nature of the impact of the agency action.\"  L.M v. \nJohnson,  150 F.  Supp.  3d 202,  215  (E.D.N.Y.  2015) (citing  Lewis-Mota v.  Sec'y of Labor, \n469 F.2d 478, 481-82 (2d Cir.  1972)).  The Emergency Notice carries legal force because it \n\"create[d ) new ... duties\" for immigrant visa applicants.  Sweet, 235 F.3d at 91  (quoting White, \n7 F.3d at 303).  The health insurance requirements imposed on immigrant visa applicants under \nthe Proclamation and Emergency Notice were not previously contained in statute or regulation.  In \nissuing the Emergency Notice, DOS was not merely interpreting existing law.  DOS was acting to \nimplement the statutmy policy set forth in 8 U.S.C.  § 1182(f), as specifically reflected in the \nProclamation.  Rules that implement statutory policy are substantive in nature.  See United States \nv. Lott, 750 F.3d 214,217-18 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281,302-\n03  (1979); Am.  Broad.  Cos.,  Inc.  v.  FCC, 682 F.2d 25, 32 (2d Cir.  1982)).  Simply put, DOS \nneeded to take action to effect the President's directive in consular processing, and did so through \nthe Emergency Notice. \nBoth of these agency actions (i.e., the 2018 FAM Revisions and the Notice) therefore \nquali:fY as substantive rules that required meaningful engagement with the public.  Plaintiffs were \ndeprived  of any  such  engagement,  however,  because  DOS  did  not  provide  any  notice  or \nopportunity for comment on the 2018 FAM Revisions, (Compl., 83), and the Emergency Notice \nwas open for comment for less than 48 hours, see 84 Fed. Reg. at 58,199.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nare likely to prevail on their claim that the 2018 FAM Revisions and Emergency Notice violated \nnotice-and-comment requirements of the AP A. \n40 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 41 of 52\nE.  Plaintiffs Adequately State a Claim Under the Equal Protection Clause. \nDefendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim that the 2018 F AM Revisions, DOS Rule, \nand Proclamation violate the equal protection guarantee under the Fifth Amendment, because they \nwere motivated by  discriminatory animus towards, and disproportionally harm, immigrants of \ncolor.  Defendants argue that the complaint is devoid of allegations that any of the challenged \nactions was motivated by racial animus.  (PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 44.) \nCourts may look to a variety of circumstantial and direct evidence when \"[d ]etermining \nwhether invidious  discriminatory purpose was  a motivating  factor\" for  governmental action, \nincluding the disparate impact of the action, the \"historical background of the decision,\" the \n\"specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,\" and \"contemporary statements \nby members of the decisionmaking body.\"  Vill.  ofA  rlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., \n429 U.S.  252, 266-68 (1977).  Plaintiffs provide substantial evidence of the disproportionate \nimpact of the challenged government actions on immigrants from countries that are predominantly \ncomprised of people of color (e.g., Mexico, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and the Dominican \nRepublic), (Compl. -,r-,r  221-28), which Defendants do not appear to dispute.  Plaintiffs fmther \nallege, at length, in their complaint that the President \"has a long and well-documented history of \ndisparaging and demeaning inrmigrants, particularly those from Latin American, African, and \npredominately Muslim nations.\"  (Id. -,r 229.)  These statements include, inter alia,  allegedly \nexpressing \"dismay that the United States does not 'have more people from places like Norway,' \ncontrasting such immigrants with those from ' [expletive deleted]  countries'  such as Haiti and \ncountries in Afi·ica.\"  (!d. -,r 230).  Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that other high-ranking decision \nmakers have expressed similar hostility toward immigrants of color.  Senior Policy Advisor \nStephen Miller, who has taken an active role in furthering the President's immigration policies and \n41 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 42 of 52\nthe changes to the public charge framework, in patticular, (id. ~ 235), has allegedly decried the \ncosts of the United States immigration system associated with low-income immigrants and linked \nimmigrants and people of color with low education, crime, and terrorism, (id ~~ 234, 236). \nThe  Supreme Comt recently  rejected an equal protection challenge to the decision to \nrescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that was based, in part, on \ndisparate impact on Latinos and alleged discriminatory statements by the President.  Dep't of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents oft he Univ. ofC  alifornia, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915-16 (2020). Defendants \nargue  that the  pllll'ality  opinion  in  Regents  strongly  supports  dismissal  of Plaintiffs'  equal \nprotection claims in this case.  (Defs.' Letter dated June 25, 2020, ECF No. 86.)  Defendants point \nto two aspects of the plurality opinion, in patticular.  First, the plUl'ality discounted the disparate \nimpact of the rescission of DACA because \"Latinos make up a large share of the unauthorized \nalien population,\" and so \"one would expect them to make up an outsized share of recipients of \nany cross-cutting immigration relief program.\"  Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  The Court explained \nthat \"[w]ere this fact sufficient to  state a[n]  [equal protection]  claim, virtually any generally \napplicable immigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds.\" Jd. at 1916. But \nhere, Plaintiffs are not simply alleging that more immigrants of color are hlll't by the agency action \nat issue.  Instead, Plaintiffs cite evidence regarding the dispropmtionate percentage of nonwhite \nimmigrants that would be hurt by the agency action at issue, as compared to the percentage of \nimmigrants from predominantly white countries.  (See, e.g., Campi.~~ 224-25.)  Similarly, the \ncomplaint alleges that the 2018 F AM Revisions led to substantial increases in denials of immigrant \nvisas  on public charge  grounds for  individuals from  countries with predominantly nonwhite \npopulations,  with  little  to  no  increase  in  denials  on the  same  grounds  for  applicants  from \n42 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 43 of 52\npredominantly white countries.  (Compl. ~ 223.)  These findings are unaffected by the share of the \nimmigrant population that is nonwhite. \nSecond, the Regents plurality dismissed the President's statements as \"unilluminating\" \nbecause they were \"remote in time and made in unrelated contexts.\"  !d.  at 1916.  Here, the \nPresident's statements cited by Plaintiffs were not \"remote in time\" to Defendants' issuance of the \n2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation, or a draft Presidential executive order that \nallegedly precipitated their promulgation. (See Compl. ~~ 69-70, 229-33.) For instance, Plaintiffs \ncite statements from Janumy 2018, May 2018, and July 2019.  (!d.  ~~ 230.)  The 2018 FAM \nRevisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation were all announced within months of those statements. \nMoreover, as noted, Plaintiffs allegations also extend beyond the President's statements to include \nstatements by high-level officials that are responsible for the public charge framework represented \nby the government actions at issue. \nFurther, the District of Maryland has  already declined to  dismiss an equal protection \nchallenge  to  the  2018  FAM  Revisions.  Mayor  &  City  Council  of Baltimore  v.  Trump, \n416 F. Supp. 3d at 511-15.  As that court noted, \"at this juncture, the [Plaintiffs] do[] not need to \ndemonstrate a tight nexus between words and actions.\"  Jd at 515 (citations omitted).  As such, \nPlaintiffs have raised a plausible inference that issuance of the 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS Rule, \nand Proclamation was based, at least in part, on discriminatory motives and their claims survive \nDefendants' motion to dismiss. \nF.  Plaintiffs Demonstrate that the Proclamation is Likely Contrary to the INA and \nUltra Vires. \nPlaintiffs also make a compelling argument that the Proclamation is ultra vires and violates \nthe  INA  by  replacing  the  totality-of-circumstances  assessment  required  under \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) with \"a single factor requirement.\"  (PI Reply & MTD Opp'n at 19) \n43 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 44 of 52\nThe Proclamation seeks to address the public financial burden associated with permitting \nentry to uninsured immigrants.  This stated purpose-to address concerns that immigrants may \nburden the public fiscally-falls squarely within the domain of the public charge provision of the \nINA, which instmcts consular officers to consider \"at a minimum\" five enumerated factors in \npublic charge inadmissibility determinations: \"age;\" \"health;\" \"family status;\" \"assets, resources, \nand financial status;\" and \"education and skills.\"  8 U.S.C.  §  1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Rather than \nassessing all five factors, the Proclamation focuses exclusively on the applicant's \"ability to obtain \n'approved' private health care coverage or to absorb medical costs.\"  (PI Mem. at 32; see also \nCompl. ~ 187.)  If an immigrant is unable to meet the standard set forth in the Proclamation, he or \nshe is automatically denied entry. \nSection 1182(f) provides the President with wide latitude to supplement entry restrictions \nenumerated in the INA.  See Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2408 (\"§ 1182(f) vests the President \nwith 'ample power' to impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated in the \nINA.\" (citations omitted)).  However, his authority is not limitless.  At a minimum, the President \ncannot supersede other inadmissibility provisions under the INA duly enacted by Congress.  See \nid.  at 2411 (\"We may assume that§ 1182(f) does not allow the President to expressly override \nparticular provisions of the INA.\")  To hold otherwise would make a mocke1y of Constitutional \nseparation of powers principles.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs not only sufficiently allege, but are likely \nto prevail on their claim under Count IV that the Proclamation is ultra vires. 8 \n8 Moreover, though unlawful in its own right, the DOS Rule's treatment of health insurance coverage also \nconflicts with the Proclamation.  The DOS Rule requires consular officers to consider lack of health \ninsurance in the totality of circumstances rather than as a dispositive factor.  84 Fed. Reg. at 54,997 (\"[L]ack \nof health insurance alone would not make an alien more likely than not to become a public charge at any \ntime, but would instead be considered in the totality of the alien's circumstances.\") \n44 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 45 of 52\nIV.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from applying the 2018 F AM \nRevisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation.  \"[A] preliminary injunction is 'an extraordinary remedy \nnever awarded as of right.\"'  Benisek v.  Lamone,  138  S.  Ct.  1942,  1943 (2018) (per curiam) \n(citation omitted).  To obtain a preliminaty injunction, the moving party must establish \"that he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is  likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.\"  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The standard for a \nstay of agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 705 is the same as the standard for a preliminaty injunction. \nNat. Res. Def Council v.  US. Dep 't ofE  nergy, 362 F. Supp. 3d 126, 149 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that they are at least likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims that (1) the 2018 FAM Revisions and DOS Rule are contraty to the INA and in excess of \nstatutory  authority,  see  supra Part III.D.l.,  (2)  the  2018  FAM Revisions,  DOS  Rule,  and \nEmergency  Notice  are  arbitrary  and capricious,  see  supra Part III.D.2.,  (3)  the  2018  FAM \nRevisions,  DOS  Rule,  and  Emergency  Notice  violate  notice-and-comment  procedural \nrequirements of the AP A, see supra Part III.D.3., and (4) the Proclamation is ultra vires, see supra \nPart III.F.  Plaintiffs also establish the remaining elements for preliminaty relief. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated That They Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent a \nPreliminary Injunction \n\"A showing of irreparable harm is 'the single most important prerequisite for the issuance \nof a preliminary injunction.\"'  Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v.  Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \"To satisfY the irreparable harm requirement, Plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate that absent a preliminary injunction they will suffer 'an injury that is neither remote \nnor speculative, but actual and imminent,' and one that cannot be remedied 'if a court waits until \n45 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 46 of 52\nthe end of trial to resolve the ha:nn.\"'  Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60, \n66 (2d Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs, however, need only show \"a threat of irreparable \nharm, not that iiTeparable harm already ha[s] occmTed.\"  Mullins v. City ofN  ew York, 626 F.3d 47, \n55 (2d Cir. 2010). \nPlaintiffs are likely to suffer iiTeparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.  Individual \nPlaintiffs provide a strong basis for finding that each of the challenged government actions will \nresult in the denial of their or their family member's visa applications and that such denial will, in \nturn, result in indefinite family  separation.  Courts,  including those within this Circuit, have \nrecognized indefinite family separation as a form of irreparable injury.  See, e.g., Washington v. \nTrump,  847 F.3d 1151, 1169 (9th Cir.  2017) (identifYing \"separated families\" as \"substantial \ninjuries  and  even irreparable harms\");  Doe  v.  Trump,  418  F.  Supp.  3d at  598-99 (granting \npreliminary injunction and finding  family  separation caused by Proclamation to  be basis for \nin·eparable harm); Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F. Supp. 3d 349, 371 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\"[C]ourts \nrecognize the irreparable harms that stem from being unlawfully separated fi·om family.\"); JS.R. \nv.  Sessions, 330 F. Supp. 3d 731, 742-43 (D. Conn. 2018) (issuing preliminary injunction and \nfinding that family separation was irreparable injury).  Irreparable injury is particularly likely for \nfour of the Individual Plaintiffs, as USCIS already determined-in approving I-601A waivers of \nadmissibility-that their families would suffer \"extreme hardship\" if separated.  (See Compl. '1['1[ \n44, 46-47, 49); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(B)(v). Plaintiffs also adequately establish that they \nwill likely be treated negatively under the challenged actions for using benefits for which they and \ntheir families are legally eligible, and required to purchase costly insurance plans for which they \nwill never be reimbursed. \n46 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 47 of 52\nLastly, Organizational Plaintiffs have established that they are suffering an injury in fact \nbased on the diversion of their resources and irretrievable frustration of their missions.  See supra \nPmt II.A.  Because pending visa applications that were submitted before the DOS Rule was \nimplemented will nonetheless be subject to the DOS Rule, Organizational Plaintiffs are also being \nforced to dedicate significant resources and perform additional work on cases that, but for the new \nstandards, were effectively complete.  (See PI Reply & MTD Opp'n at 37.) \nB.  The Balance of Hardships and Public Interest Weigh in PlaintifPs Favor. \nThe remaining factors warranting preliminary relief-\"that the balance of equities tips in \n[the plaintiffs] favor\" and \"that an injunction is in the public interest,\" Winter v.  Nat.  Res. Def \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)-\"merge when the Government is the opposing party,\" Nken \nv. Holder, 556 U.S. 418,435 (2009). \nThe public interest weighs heavily in favor of an injunction.  As an initial matter, there is \nno public interest in allowing Defendants to proceed with unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious \nexecutive or agency actions that exceed their statutory authority.  See Planned Parenthood of \nN Y.C., Inc. v.  US. Dep 't ofH  ealth & Human Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) \n(\"It is evident that '[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency \naction.' ... The inverse is also true: 'there is a substantial public interest in \"having govemmental \nagencies abide by the federa11aws that govem their existence and operations.\"'\") (quoting League \nof Women Voters of US. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)); Hawaii v.  Trump, 878 F.3d \n662,700 (9th Cir. 2017), rev'd and remanded on other grounds, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018) (\"It is \naxiomatic that the President must exercise his executive powers lawfully.  When there are serious \nconcems that the President has not done so, the public interest is best served by 'curtailing unlawful \nexecutive action.\"' (citation omitted)). \n47 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 48 of 52\nPlaintiffs provided extensive reports of the adverse consequences that implementation of \nthe 2018 F AM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation will have on Plaintiffs, as well as on \nIndividual  Plaintiffs'  families,  Organizational  Plaintiffs'  clients,  immigrant  communities \nthroughout  the  country,  and  the  general  public.  These  consequences  include  family \ndestabilization, shortages in the labor market, increased medical costs, uncompensated medical \ncare, and other economic and public health harms.  (See,  e.g., Suppl. Dec!. of Andrew J. Ehrlich \nin Supp. of Pis.' Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\"Pis.' Suppl. Dec!.\"), Ex. 9 (Dec!. of Leighton Ku in Supp. \nof Pis.' Mot. for a Prelim.

(See Brief of Amicus Curiae in Supp. of Pis.' Mot. for a Prelim. Inj ., \nECF No. 49-2.)  They explain that because the government actions challenged in this case will \nreduce the number of lawful immigrants, the actions will \"cause substantial economic hatm to \nAmici, including by diminishing revenue collection, dampening the creation of small businesses, \nand reducing employment in key sectors of the economy.\"  (Jd.  at 8.)  They further explain that \nthe  Proclamation  directs  immigrants  to  purchase  limited  or temporary  insurance  plans  that \ntechnically satisfY the Proclmnation's requirements but do not actually provide comprehensive \ncoverage.  (Jd.  at 19.)  As a result, immigrants will be left underinsured and at greater risk of \nincurring uncompensated costs that will ultimately fall on and burden local and state govermnents. \n(Jd. at 19, 22.) \n48 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 49 of 52\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the potentially devastating effects that the \ngovernment's new public charge framework could have on public health and safety.  To date, \nCOVID-19 has afflicted over four million U.S. residents and caused close to 150,000 deaths across \nall 50 states and the District of Columbia.  In the wake of the pandemic, USCIS indicated that it \n\"will neither consider testing, treatment, nor preventative care ... related to COVID-19 as part of \na public charge inadmissibility determination, ... even if such treatment is provided or paid for by \none or more public benefits, as defined in the [DHS Rule].\" Public Charge Alert, U.S. Citizenship \n&  Immigr.  Servs.,  https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and \nprocedures/public-charge (last updated Mar. 27, 2020).  Still, reports show that the new public \ncharge  framework  continues  to  have  a  chilling  effect  on  immigrants,  who  have  foregone \ncoronavirus-related medical care to which they are legally entitled out of fear that seeking such \ncare will jeopardize their immigration status. Miriam Jordan,' We're Petrified': Immigrants Afraid \nto  Seek  Medical  Care  for  Coronavirus,  N.Y.  Times,  Mar.  18,  2020, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-immigrants.html; Maanvi Singh,  'I Have a \nBroken Heart':  Trump  Policy Has  Immigrants Backing Away from  Healthcare Amid Crisis, \nGuardian,  Mar.  29,  2020,  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/i-have-a-broken-\nheart-trump-policy-has-immigrants-backing -away-fi·om-healthcare-amid- crisis.  This  chilling \neffect, in turn, undoubtedly hampers efforts to contain the virus and protect the public health of \nresidents across the counl!y.  Moreover, the government's decision to craft a special exemption to \nthe public charge framework for coronavirus is an implicit acknowledgment that the public health \nrisks outweigh any motive to dissuade immigrants from accessing public benefits. \nMeanwhile, the hardships that Defendants allege that they will face if an injunction is \nissued are \"logistical burdens\" of complying with a \"temporary injunction,\" and inconsistent \n49 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 50 of 52\napplication by DOS and DHS of the public charge mle.  (PI Opp'n & MTD Mem. at 48l The \nbalance of equities and public interest clearly tip in Plaintiffs' favor. \nC.  A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate. \nAs this Court found with respect to its preliminary injunction regarding the DHS Rule, and \nfor additional reasons, a nationwide injunction is both necessary to redress the harms caused by \nthe 2018 F AM Revisions, DOS Rule, and Proclamation, and appropriate given the strong federal \ninterest in uniformity of the national immigration policies at issue here.  See Make the Rd. NY v. \nCuccinelli, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 666-68; see also Texas v.  United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187-88 (5th \nCir. 2015) (upholding a nationwide injunction of the Defened Action for Parents of Americans \nand  Lawful  Permanent Residents  (DAPA)  immigration  relief program,  in part,  because  the \nConstitution requires and Congress has called for unifmm administration of immigration laws). \nThe scope of preliminary injunctive relief generally should be \"no broader than necessary to cme \nthe effects of the harm caused by the violation,\" Church & Dwight Co.  v.  SPD Swiss Precision \nDiagnostics, GmBH, 843 F.3d 48, 72 (2d Cir. 2016), but \"is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff,\" Califano v.  Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n702 (1979).  The likely unlawful agency actions in this case apply universally, to determinations \nby U.S. immigration officials regarding the inadmissibility of immigrant visa applicants around \nthe  world.  Limited  relief would  simply  not  protect  the  interests  of all  stakeholders.  A \n., \ngeographically  restricted  injunction,  in particular,  would  result  in  different  inadmissibility \ndeterminations based solely on location.  The effect of the government actions at issue should not \n9 Defendants insist that another hmm  is  \"[i]nterference with the  exercise of authority granted to the \nPresident and the Department of State.\" (ld.) Plaintiffs, however, adequately demonstrate that the President \nand DOS exceeded their authorities under the INA.  See supra Part III.D.l. and III.F. \n50 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633-GBD   Document 88   Filed 07/29/20   Page 51 of 52\ndepend on what side of the George Washington bridge between New York and New Jersey one \nfortuitously finds oneself. \nMoreover, a geographically limited injunction would be especially unworkable in a case \nsuch as this, where consular officers on foreign soil would have to determine how to apply different \nrules to different applicants.  Such a remedy invites arbitrary enforcement and creates more \nquestions than it answers.  For example, would the consular officer look to where the applicant \nlived in the United States? What ifthe applicant moved recently or intends to live somewhere else \nupon admission?  Is  the  location where the  applicant's family  resides more appropriate for \nconsideration?  If an applicant is working with an Organizational Plaintiff, should officers look to \nthe location of such organization?  Such an injunction would undoubtedly lead to inconsistent \napplications of the DOS Rule and Proclamation (and 2018 FAM Revisions, to the extent they are \nreimplemented).  Thus, aprelimimuy injunction entirely batTing the 2018 FAM Revisions, DOS \n10 \nRule, and Proclamation is appropriate. \n10 This Court is cognizant of the equitable and constitutional concerns regarding nationwide injunctions. \nSee,  e.g.,  Dep't of Homeland Sec.  v.  New  York,  140  S.  Ct.  599  (2020)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concun·ing). \nNeve1theless, in the appropriate circumstances, \"district courts sitting in equity have the authority to issue \nnationwide injunctions.\"  Saget v.  Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 378 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Leman v. \nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co.,  284 U.S. 448, 451  (1932)).  To be sure, a court's authority to issue \nnationwide injunctions is a power that should be exercised sparingly, and certainly cannot be applied in \nconflict with each circuit's own determination of its appropriateness.

For generations, immigration to America has represented an opportunity \nfor families to strive for a better life together.  Central to this expression of our national values is \nour family-basedimmigrationsystem,which ensures that hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens \nand lawful permanent residents can petition for their husbands, wives, parents, children, and \nsiblings to obtain lawful permanent residence status (“green cards”)in the United States.  This \nsystem is intended to maintain family unity, integrity, and stability.  It is enshrined in statute.  \nAnd it has never been reserved for the wealthy.  To the contrary, immigrants have endured \nincalculable hardship to escape grinding poverty around the globe, withthe promise held out to \nthem that our immigration laws will allow them the chance, one day, to reunite with their \nfamilies in this country.  \n2. Since January 2017, the Trump Administration has tried to reverse all of \nthis by executive fiat.  Showing utter disdain not only for these values, but for the statutes that \ncodify them into law—and for the Constitution—the Defendants in this case have sought to \nrender lawful immigration into this country a privilege for the wealthy and the white, imposing \nunlawful income requirements on people seeking family unity andthe chance for a better life.  If \nthe Administration wishes to impose its boldly stated preferences for excluding people of color \nand admitting only the wealthy, however, it cannot do so by executive action.  Not in defiance of\nstatutes that say otherwise. And not in the face of the Constitution.  These unlawful executive \nactions should be enjoined.  \n3. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to stop three interrelated government actions\nthat apply to intending immigrants seeking to enter the U.S. as lawful permanent residents \n(“LPRs”): (a) the Department of State’s (“DOS”) January 2018 changes to the public charge \n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 4 of 116\nprovisions of its Foreign Affairs Manual (“FAM”), which governs consular processing (the \n“FAM Revisions”); (b) the DOS’s October 11, 2019 Interim Final Rule, which changes the \npubliccharge regulations that applyat the point of consular processing (the “IFR”); and (c) the \nOctober 4, 2019 “Presidential Proclamation Suspending the Entry of Immigrants Who Will\nFinancially Burden the Health Care System” (the “Proclamation”), as well as subsequent actions \nto implement the Proclamationby DOS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”) (“Proclamation Implementing Actions”).  In this Complaint, werefer to the FAM \nRevisions, the IFR, the Proclamation, and the Proclamation Implementing Actions collectivelyas \nthe “Consular Rules.”\n4. TheseConsular Rules were not legislated by Congress.  On the contrary, \nlike the public charge rule issued by DHS on August 14, 2019 (the “DHS Rule”), which was \nsubsequently enjoined nationwide, the FAM Revisions, the IFR, and the Proclamation \nImplementing Actions explicitly contradict the Immigration and Nationality Act’s (“INA”)\npublic charge provision, 8 U.S.C.§1182(a)(4). The Proclamation itself also exceeds the \nauthority granted by Section1182(f) of the INA.  Some or all of these actions violate not only \nthe INA but also the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the principle of separation of \npowers, and the Equal Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.\n5. The “public charge” concept in the INA has been distorted beyond all \nrecognition by Defendants, who have seized on it as a means to implement their anti-poor, anti-\nfamily agenda.  But it has never applied to working families like those of the individual plaintiffs \nin this case,and tens of thousands of others like them.  For more than a century, courts and \nadministrative agencies have recognized that the public charge provisions of the INA apply only\nto noncitizens who are destitute and wholly unable to work, and who are thus likely to be \n2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 5 of 116\npredominantly reliant on government aid for subsistence.  In that time, Congress has repeatedly \nre-enacted the public charge provisions of the Act without change.  Congress has alsoexpressly \nrejected efforts to broaden its scope by legislation.  Notwithstanding this lack ofCongressional \nauthority, Defendants seek to redefine “public charge” to exclude any intending immigrant who a \nconsular officer predicts may use even a minimal amount of supplementary, non-cash public \nbenefits,including health benefits, at any time in the future—even long after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen. These redefinitions would fundamentally transform American immigration law by \nconditioning lawful permanent residence on high incomes and wealth sufficient to absorbthe \nprospective impacts of thevagaries of life,such as health problems,wage losses,or the ability to \nnavigate the United States’byzantinesystem of private health insurance.\n6. The Defendants’ attempted transformation formally began with the \nadoption of the2018FAM Revisions governing public charge, which for the first timedirected \nconsular officers to negatively weigh the receipt of means-tested benefits other than cash \nassistance by intending immigrants and their financial sponsors.  Without expressly redefining \n“public charge,” the FAM Revisions have been used to deny admission to intending immigrants \nbased on an overbroad, erroneous interpretationof the INA.  Since January 2018, public charge\ndenials have increased dramaticallyfrom the levels in the years immediately precedingthe \nrevision.  But, contrary to law, no rule-making was undertaken by DOS in connection with \nadoption of the FAM Revisions.\n7. The FAM Revisions apply only to people seeking to enter the United \nStates, whether as immigrants or as non-immigrants. Relatedly, on August 14, 2019, DHS \nintroduced a final rule, “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds” that would apply primarily \nto applicants for LPR status already within the United States, to be effective on October 15,\n3\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 6 of 116\n2019. The DHS Rule purports to implement Section 212(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. § 1182\n(a)(4)). However, it fundamentally altered the longstanding definition of “public charge,”and \nwas enjoined by five different federal district courts spanning four different federal circuits\nbetween October 11 and October 14, 2019.1 Like the FAM Revisions, the 2019 DHS Rule \nprovided that, for the first time, a public charge would be defined not as a person with no \npossible means of support, but rather as a person who at any time in the future might usepublic \nbenefits for as little as three or four months in any36-month period, ever.  These public benefits \ninclude such widely-used non-cash assistance as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutritional \nAssistance Program (“SNAP,”formerly called “food stamps”), and housing subsidies. \n8. The same day that the first injunctions were issued blocking the \nimplementation ofthe DHS Rule, DOS issued the IFR, also with an October 15, 2019 effective \ndate. The substance of the IFR is almost identical to the DHS Rule.  Like the enjoined DHS \nRule, the IFR would dramatically expandpublic charge inadmissibility to include peoplewho at \nany time in the future might use any amount of a minimal number ofbenefits. And the IFR’s\nimpact would be enormous.  One study finds that 81 percent of the world’s population would fail \nto satisfy a wealth test that is a factor in the public charge determinationunder the IFR.2 DOS \ninitially stated that the IFR wouldgo into effect on October 15, 2019, but then sought notice-and-\n1 See Make the Road New York v.Cuccinelli, 19 Civ. 7993, (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019), ECF No. 147 (“N.Y. Op.”) \n(nationwide injunction); Washington v. DHS,19-CV-5210(E.D. Wash. Oct. 11, 2019), ECF No. 162(“Wash. \nOp.”) (nationwide injunction); City & Cty. of S.F. v. USCIS,19-cv-04717,(N.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2019), ECF No.\n115(“Cal. Op.”) (injunctioncovering multiple states); Casa de Md. v. Trump,PWG-19-2715(D. Md. Oct. 14, \n2019), ECF No. 65(“Md. Op.”) (nationwide injunction) andCook Cty., Ill. v. McAleenan,19 C 6334,(N.D. Ill. \nOct. 14, 2019), ECF No. 65(“Ill. Op.”) (statewide injunction in one state). All five district courts to consider \nthe DHS Rule issued preliminary injunctions enjoining implementation and enforcement.  The Fourth and Ninth \nCircuits have stayed the injunctionsissued in Maryland, California, and Washington.\n2 Danilo Trisi,Administration’s Public Charge Rules Would Close the Door to U.S. to Immigrants Without \nSubstantial Means, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 7(November 11, 2019),available at\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-11-19imm.pdf.\n4\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 7 of 116\ncomment on a form required for the public charge determination.  It is unclear whether DOS is \nimplementing the IFR without this form. As with the FAM changes, DOS did not undertake full-\nnotice and comment rulemaking in connection with the IFR. \n9. Despite professing to be justified in using extraordinary rulemaking \nprocedures, DOS purports to have placed the IFR on hold to some unknown date.  Specifically, \nduring proceedings in Mayor and City of Baltimore v.Trump, 18-cv-3636 (D. Md.), a separate \nchallenge to the FAM Revisions, the Administration stated that it has postponed the effective \ndate of the IFR, but did specifyhow long the postponement will last or with what notice the IFR \nwill go into effect.  Simultaneously, the DOS website claims that the rule is postponed pending \npromulgation of certain implementing forms at an unknown date in the future.\n10. On October 4, 2019, while motions to enjoin the DHS rule were pending, \nand shortly before the publication of the IFR, Defendant Trump issued the Proclamation, which \nsuspended the entry of any individuals seeking immigrant visas who could not demonstrate that \nthey could obtain certain forms of “approved” private health insurance within 30 days of entry or \nthat they had sufficient financial capacity to absorb “reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”3 The \nProclamation, to be implemented by Defendants DOS and HHS, stated that it would go into \neffect on November 3, 2019.  On November 2, 2019, a federal district court in the District of \nOregon issued a temporary restraining order that enjoinedimplementation of the Proclamation, \nand subsequently issued a preliminary injunction on November 26, 2019.4 The court found a \n3 SeePresidential Proclamation 9945, available athttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-\n22225/suspension-of-entry-of-immigrants-who-will-financially-burden-the-united-states-healthcare-system-in.\n4 Doe #1v.

Nov. 26, 2019).\n5\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 8 of 116\nlikelihood that the Proclamation conflicts with the public charge provision of the INA and related \nfederal health care statutes.\n11. Recognizing that each of the Consular Rules is intended to accomplish the \nsame goals of fear, confusion, and exclusion, the instant case seeks to enjoin all three Consular \nRules.  As federal courts found in enjoining the DHS Rule, this Administration’s new scheme \nthreatens grave harm to the United States citizens, intending immigrants, and immigrant \nassistance organizations who are plaintiffs here—as well as to immigrant communities and the \npublic interest.  The scheme that Defendants have devised runs contrary to governing statutes \nand the Constitution.  \n12. Defendants fully understand and intend the havoc these changes will \nwreak on immigrant families by fundamentally changing U.S. immigration law and rewriting \nduly-enacted Congressional acts through administrative fiat.  Stephen Miller, the President’s\nsenior advisor on immigration and a principal architect of the IFR, as well as the parallel DHS \nRule, described these administrative actionsas “transformative.” He is correct.  But under the \nConstitution, it is up to Congress, not the Executive, to “transform[]” U.S. law. \n13. Defendants seek to achieve by executive action what the Trump \nAdministration has failed to achieve through legislation.  The Administration has explicitly \nsought to reduce family-based immigration and convert U.S. immigration policy to an arbitrary \nand discriminatory wealth-based system.  Its efforts to achieve that goal through legislation have \nfailed.  The Consular Rules at issue here circumvent Congress in furtherance of that goal. \n14. TheConsular Rules violate theAPAbecause they purport to change both \nthe deployment,andthe long-term understanding, of public charge in a manner that is contrary to \nthe INA.  They are not in accordance with law because they fail to comport with notice-and-\n6\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 9 of 116\ncomment requirements, and because they are arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\nIndeed, they substantially undermine numerous statutes under which immigrants are afforded \naccess to public benefits, including the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the Children’s Health \nInsurance Reauthorization Act (“CHIPRA”).  \n15. Further, the Proclamation exceeds presidential authority as set forth in\nSection1182(f) of the INA,which does not permit cursory orders rewriting and contradicting \nentire statutory systems nor allows adoption ofpermanent immigration bans.\n16. The Consular Rules also discriminate against people with disabilities \ncontrary to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  29 U.S.C. § 794.\n17. Finally, the Consular Rules violate the Constitution because their adoption \nwas driven by unconstitutional animus against immigrants of color.  These changes reflect the \nPresident’s longstanding hostility to non-white immigrants, who comefrom what he has referred \nto as “shithole countries,” and whom he has characterized as “animals” who are “infesting” the \nUnited States.  He has repeatedly referred to immigration from the southern border as an \n“invasion.”  Defendant Trump has relied on Stephen Miller, the White House Advisor associated \nwith white nationalist groups, to engineer his immigration policy, including the Consular Rules.\n18. For these reasons, plaintiffs—individuals facing exclusion from the United \nStates, their petitioning United States citizen relatives, and nonprofit organizations that advise, \nassist, advocate and serve hundreds of thousands of low-income noncitizens and their families in \nNew York and nationwide—bring this action under the INA, the APA, and the Fifth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution to enjoin the Consular Rules and the Proclamation\nImplementing Actions,to declare them unlawful, and to set them aside.  \n7\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 10 of 116\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n19. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’claims pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343, as this case arises under the United States Constitution and \nfederal statutes, including the APA, 5 U.S.C. §551 et seq., and the INA, 8 U.S.C. §1101et seq.\n20. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391 because \nPlaintiffs Alicia Doe, Brenda Doe, and Eric Doereside in this district, Plaintiffs MRNY, ASC, \nand CCCS-NY have offices in this district, and Plaintiffs CARECEN-NY and CLINIC serve \nclients and affiliates in this district.\nI. Plaintiffs\n21. Plaintiff Make the Road New York (“MRNY”) is a nonprofit, \nmembership-based community organization with more than 23,000 members residing in New \nYork.  Its mission is to build the power of immigrant and working-class communities to achieve \ndignity and justice. MRNY represents thousands of immigrants in removal proceedings and \naffirmative applications for immigration benefits, including citizens and LPRs seeking to help \nfamily members obtain immigrant visas and intending immigrants themselves.  MRNY also\nassists immigrants in accessing health services, navigating the health system, and advocating for \nimproved access to health care.  MRNYalso provides English as a second language, civics, basic \nadult education, and citizenship classes for immigrant New Yorkers. \n22. MRNY was deprived of an opportunity to comment on DOS’s changes to \nthe public charge guidelines before the FAM Revisions were published or before the IFR was \nissued.  Nonetheless, following publication of the IFR and the opening of a truncated, post-\nimplementation comment period, MRNY submitted to DOS a detailed comment documenting \nnumerous harms the DOS’s process was inflicting and would inflict on its members and \n8\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 11 of 116\nimmigrant communities.  MRNY’s comment demonstrated the IFR’s substantial chilling effect \nonfamilies and individuals entitled to nutritional and health assistance,the risks to public health \nand children should the IFR take effect,and the economic losses and increased suffering of \nimmigrant communities.  MRNY’s comment also criticized the IFR’s racist intent and \ndisproportionate impact on Latinx communities, as well as the incoherence and unlawfulness of \nthe IFR’s alteration of thelongstandingtest to determine whether an immigrant is or may \nbecome a public charge. Although MRNY was able to draft and submit its own comments \nfollowing publication of the IFR, DOS gave less than 48 hours’notice for the public to submit \ncomments on an information collection related to the Proclamation, forcing MRNY to sign on to \na group comment letter.\n23. The Consular Rules are causing substantial harm to MRNY.  MRNY’s\nmission of advocating for the rights of low-income immigrant communities is inseparable from \nthe interests of its members in not being denied admission or adjustment of their immigration \nstatus, in receiving vital public benefits, and in maintaining family integrity and unity.  \nDefendants’actions harm MRNY, and threaten it with ongoing and future harm, by causing the \norganization to divert resources otherwise needed elsewherein response to Defendants’actions.  \nIn particular, MRNY must divert resources to address its clients’and members’need for \ninformation about the impact that receipt of public benefits has on their own or family members’\nimmigration goals, such as serving as a sponsor and obtaining LPR status through consular \nprocessing.  MRNY’s provision of health enrollment services, as well as its representation of,\nand consultation with,clients considering consular processing now require more time, which \nprevents MRNY from assisting in as manyconsular processing clients.  MRNY must also inform \nits members, clients and impacted community members of the heightened risk that family \n9\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 12 of 116\nmembers seekingimmigrant visas will be denied as a result of the Consular Rules, which will \nresult in family separation for MRNY clients and members.\n24. Plaintiff African Services Committee (“ASC”) is a Harlem-based non-\nprofit human rights agency dedicated to mobilizing and empowering immigrants, refugees, and \nasylees from Africa, the Caribbean,and across the African Diaspora.  ASC provides, among \nother things: housing placement and health services; legal representation in immigration \nproceedings, including representing sponsors and navigating consular processing; English \nlanguage classes; food pantry and nutrition services; andassistance inthe development of \nleadership skills through community education and organizing.  \n25. During the public notice-and-comment period following the publication of \nthe DHS public charge rule, ASC submitted to DHS a detailed comment documenting numerous \nharms that changes to the public charge determination would inflict on its clients and immigrant \ncommunities generally, with a particular focus on the risks to health care access for those with \nHIV and AIDS.  The publication of the Consular Rules without a meaningful opportunity for \nnotice-and-comment deprived ASC of the opportunity to provide comments detailing the \nextensive harms imposed by Defendants here.\n26. Defendants’actions threaten substantial harm to ASC’s ability to \naccomplish its mission,which includes helpingimmigrant families stabilizetheir circumstances \nin the United States through family reunification, as well as connecting them to government \nservices and benefits for which they are eligible as an additional means of support.  The support \nprovided byreunitingfamilies through family-based immigration and connecting them to needed \nforms of assistance is especially important for ASC’s clients, who are vulnerable due to chronic \nhealth conditions andusuallylack private health insurance. The Consular Rules are adversely \n10\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 13 of 116\naffecting ASC’s ability to link clients with the family, benefits,and services they need because \nthe rules have created the warranted fear that receivingsuchbenefits today will be held against \nthem in the future when they pursue their goals of seeking LPR status through consular \nprocessing, or when they help a family member to do so by serving as a sponsor.\n27. Becausethe impact of the Consular Rules on ASC clients and constituents\ncan be so severe – illness and even fatal health deterioration,as well as family separation –the \norganization has no choice but to devote significant resources to responding to theimpact of the\nnew Consular Rules, diverting resources form the many legal needs of ASC’s clients.\n28. PlaintiffCARECEN –NY is a non-profit human rights agency founded in \n1983 to provide advocacy, education and legal services to immigrants who live on Long Island, \nand to protect them from exploitation and discriminatory treatment.  Although the majority of \nCARECEN–NY’s clients live on Long Island, it also serves immigrants who reside in New \nYork City and other parts of New York state.  Nearly one hundred percent of CARECEN –NY’s\nclients are foreign-born, and the organization’s advocacy initiatives are guided by the priorities \nidentified by the immigrant community.  CARECEN –NY currently has approximately 400 \nclients who are applying for immigrant visas, who are already subject to the FAM Revisions and \nwill be subject to the Proclamation,and ultimately, the IFR at their consular interviews.  \n29. CARECEN –NY’s staff have already expended significant additional \ntime, and consequently organizational resources, beyond the organization’s traditional resource \nallocations, as a result of Defendants’actions.  All CARECEN –NY staff had to be trained on \nthe implications of the Consular Rules in order to effectively consult with clients and address the \nwidespread confusion and fear in the immigrant community resulting from those changes.  \n11\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 14 of 116\nAmong other actions, CARECEN –NY has been forced to amend its intake and representation \nprotocols and procedures in response to the Consular Rules.\n30. Additionally, CARECEN –NY staff commenced communicating with \nclients who are projected to have immigrant visa interviews within the next six months, notifying \nthem that they will be required to provide proof of medical insurance coverage pursuant to the \nProclamation, and strategizing around how to obtain this coverage, in addition to other \ndocumentation and evaluations required under the current FAM and IFR.  CARECEN –NY has \nalso begun holding community education workshops to educate its immigrant clients on the \nimplications of the Consular Rules.  Although the Proclamation has been preliminarily enjoined \nnationwide by a federal district court in Oregon, and the DHS rule has been preliminarily \nenjoined by other federal courts, the FAM Revisions remain in effect, and CARECEN –NY has \nto continue the additional work of educating clients about the potential effects of the \nProclamation should any preliminary injunction be limited or overturned, as well as the impact \nof the IFR in light of an uncertainenvironment andan unspecifieddate of implementation.\n31. Ensuring family unity for immigrant families is a central CARECEN –\nNY’s mission.  The ConsularRules individually, and together, all have a tremendous chilling \neffect on the ability of CARECEN –NY clients to be reunited with family members in the \nUnited States, and therefore on CARECEN –NY’s mission itself.  Approximately 98 percent of \nCARECEN –NY clients are working class, with household income under 125 percent of the \nFederal Poverty Guideline (“FPG”).  For these clients, not only will their household income, \nresources,and family status be subject to a new negative weight under the FAM Revisions and \nIFR, but paying for the private or catastrophic health insurance required under the Proclamation \n12\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 15 of 116\nwill be financially impossible for the overwhelming majority of CARECEN –NY’s clients—\nthereby foreclosing their ability to be reunited with their family members.  \n32. This chilling effect has not only been felt by CARECEN –NY clients, but \nCARECEN –NY itself.  The immigrant visa cases that CARECEN –NY files are almost \nexclusively fee-for-service.  As basic eligibility for immigrant visas changes based on the FAM, \nIFR, and the inability to obtain expensive medical insurance, this will necessarily cause a \ncommensurate decrease in the number of fee-for-service cases CARECEN –NY takes on.  The \nfees generated by immigrant visa cases form a significant part of CARECEN –NY’s revenue \nstream, comprising approximately 20 percent of its annual budget, and projected budget losses \nwill significantly impede and reduce CARECEN –NY’s ability to serve the directly impacted \npopulation and to provide adequate legal assistance for its clients. \n33. Because of the impact the Consular Rules have on CARECEN –NY\nclients and constituents, in addition to the many legal needs presented by clients, the organization \nhas no choice but to devote significant additional resources to responding to the Consular Rules.\n34. Plaintiff Catholic Charities Community Services (“CCCS-NY”)is part of \nCatholic Charities, New York, and the New York Archdiocese.  It is a nonprofit organization \nwith offices throughout New York City and the Lower Hudson Valley. CCCS-NY’s mission is \nto provide high quality human services to New Yorkers of all religions in need, including and \nespecially the most vulnerable.  CCCS-NY has been pursuing this mission since 1949 through a \nnetwork of offices and services that enable participants to access, among other things, \nimmigration legal services,refugee resettlement,and English as a Second Languageservices.\n35. CCCS-NYoperates a150-employee Immigration and Refugee Services \nDivision, which provides legal counsel for immigrants, includingassisting citizen and LPR \n13\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 16 of 116\nsponsors and intending immigrants in pursuing immigrant visas through consular processing, as\nwell as three immigration resource hotlines.  Two of the hotlines are fundamental to the \nprovision of legal services and legal information by New York City and New York State, which \nsponsors them.  These hotlines—the “ActionNYC” and the “Office for New Americans” \nhotline—answer over 43,000calls in 29languages and make more than 79,000 referrals to social \nservice providers throughout New York State each year.  The Immigration and Refugee Division \nalso provides resettlement and integration services, English language and civics classes,\nassistance with obtaining work authorization,as well as facilitating reunification ofmany \nimmigrants with members of their families.  During 2019, the Division of Immigrant and \nRefugee Services program services and organizing work affected over 28,000individuals—\nchildren, families, workers—in New York.\n36. CCCS-NYwas deprived of an opportunity to comment on DOS’s changes \nto the public charge guidelines before the FAM Revisions were published or before the IFR was \nissued.  Nor was CCCS-NY able to comment on theimplementation of the Proclamation within \nthe 48-hour window that was allotted. \n37. Defendants’actions directly harm CCCS-NYin multiple ways.  The \nConsular Rules threaten CCCS-NY’s ability to achieve its core mission of assistingvulnerable \nimmigrant families inestablishingtheir footing in the communities they serve, whether through \nobtaining LPR status to preserve and protect family unity,or ensuring that clients who are \neligible continue to access critical government services and benefits that support vulnerable \nfamilies.  These Consular Rules also require CCCS-NYto devote substantial resources to \nassistingclients in understanding and addressing their impact.  Given the critical role the CCCS-\nNYhotlines play in the State and City response to public charge, CCCS-NYis also on the front \n14\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 17 of 116\nline of responding to the impact of theConsularRules.  In this capacity, CCCS-NY assists both\nU.S. citizens and LPRs who want to help family members wishing to act as sponsors and who \nfear the negative implications of receiving government benefits, and those who want to obtain \nLPR status themselves and need assistance with the consular process.\n38. Plaintiff Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (“CLINIC”) is a \nnational non-profit training and resource network focused on equipping immigration \norganizations with the tools necessary to provide comprehensive immigration representation.  \nCLINIC’s network includes approximately 370 affiliate immigration programs, which operate \nover 400 offices in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  Its network employs more than 2,300 \nattorneys and accredited representatives who, in turn, serve hundreds of thousands of low-\nincome immigrants each year, including aiding them with applications for adjustment of status.  \nIn seeking to further its mission of embracingthe Gospel value of welcoming strangers, CLINIC \nsupports its network by hosting in-person and multi-day trainings on immigration related \nmatters,providing e-learning courses and webinars,publishing newsletters, fact sheets, and \nreports with developments in the immigration landscape, and, in some instances, providing direct\nfunding for affiliates working directly with immigrant communities.\n39. CLINIC affiliates employ not only attorneys but also Department of \nJustice-accredited representatives. Accredited representatives are non-attorney staff or volunteers \nwho are approved bythe Department of Justice to represent noncitizens in immigration court or \nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals or the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”). An accredited representative must work for a non-profit or social service \norganization that provides low-or no-cost immigration legal services. Many CLINIC affiliates \n15\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 18 of 116\nrely on accredited representatives for the day-to-day work of their organization. In turn, those \naccredited representatives rely on CLINIC’s resources for training and guidance.\n40. CLINIC was deprived of an opportunity to comment on DOS’s changes to \nthe public charge guidelines before the FAM Revisions were published and before the IFR was \nissued.  Nonetheless, following publication of the IFR and the opening ofa truncated, post-\nimplementation comment period, CLINIC submitted to DOS a detailed comment documenting \ntheharms and burdens the IFR would inflict on immigrant communities and legal representatives \nand pointedout significant legal and practical flaws inthe IFR’s scheme.  These flaws included, \namong others, the IFR’s failure to justify changes to longstanding practice, its bypassing of the \nlegislative process,and its inconsistency with Congressional intent and the plain meaning of \n“public charge.”  CLINIC also submitted a comment in connection with implementation of the \nProclamation within the 48-hour window allotted to do so.  The CLINIC comments stated, \namong other things, that the proposed questions consular officers would ask immigrant visa \napplicants are arbitrary and vague,provide too much discretion to consular officers,and \nimproperly limit visa eligibility to applicants with financial resources. \n41. Defendants’actions threaten to impede CLINIC’s mission,have already \ndirectly harmed CLINIC and threatenedongoing and future harm to CLINIC, including through\nthe devotion of substantial resources to address the Consular Rules and theirimpact.  Attorneys \nand accredited representatives from affiliates submit inquiries regarding individual immigration \nmatters that are particularly complex and rely on CLINIC staff provides an expert consultation. \nCLINIC has experienced increased demand for consultations since changes to the FAM \nRevisions were published and sincepublication ofboththeProclamation andthe IFR.\n16\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 19 of 116\n42.

PlaintiffAlicia Doe is an intending immigrant from El Salvador who lives \ninUpper Manhattan with her U.S. citizen husband, also from El Salvador, and their two citizen \ndaughters, ages 16 and 14.5 Alicia is the beneficiary of a Form I-130 “Petition for Alien \nRelative,” filed by her husband and approved by USCIS. Alicia’s husband supports the family \nby working at a restaurant full-time for minimum wage. Alicia does not work outside the home.  \nShe spends much of her time tendingtothe special needs of her youngerdaughter who has \nsevere disabilities stemming from cerebral palsy.  Her daughter cannot walk, and she has trouble \nspeaking and doing many other basic activities of daily living.  The daughter has received \nSupplemental Security Income(“SSI”)since she was three-years old on account of her \ndisabilities. The family also lives in public housing, which means the rent, except for Alicia’s\nshare, is subsidized by the federal government, which is necessary to ensure that the rent is \naffordable onAlicia’s husband’s wages. The household, not including Alicia,alsoreceives\nSNAP to help with food expenses. Except for Alicia, the other household members receive \nState-funded health insurance. Although Alicia is eligible for state-funded Medicaid, she is \nhealthy and has not signed up for state insurance for fear that it would affect her ability to obtain \nan immigrant visa.  She cannot afford a private plan.  A worker assigned by the City of New \n5 Alicia, Brenda, Carl, Diana and Eric Doe are the pseudonyms for individual plaintiffs who fear public exposure \nbecause of their uncertain immigration status or the uncertain immigration status of their relatives, whose \napplications for lawful permanent residence status is pending. Plaintiffs intend to file a motion to seek leave \nfrom the Court to proceed anonymously pursuant toSealed Plaintiffv. Sealed Defendant#1, 537 F.3d 185 (2d \nCir. 2008).    \n17\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 20 of 116\nYork to assist Alicia’s disabled daughter has agreed to be a financial co-sponsor.  Upon \ninformation and belief, theworker makes approximately $62,000per year.\n44. Alicia’s goal is to obtain LPR status. Because Alicia has resided in the \nU.S. without authorization after entering without inspection, she will have to leave the country to \nseek her immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. Without a waiver of her period of unlawful \npresence, Aliciawould be required to remain outside the U.S. for ten years before she could \nobtain LPR status. Alicia applied for a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence based on \nextreme hardship (Form “I-601A waiver”), and her application was approved. This means that \nshe is able to return to El Salvador for consular processing without the ten-year waiting period,\nprovided she is otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa.  In her application,she explained the \nextreme hardship that her family would suffer without the waiver, including her role as primary \ncaregiver for herdisabled daughter, which would be very difficult for her U.S. citizen husbandto \nprovide, as heworks to support the family.  Although Alicia would not have been denied \nadmission on public charge grounds under the consular rules that pre-dated the FAM Revisions,\nwere she to undergo consular processing and face application of any of the Consular Rules \nchallenged in this case, her immigrant visa would likely be denied, and she would be separated \nfrom her family indefinitely. Once Alicia obtains her green card, she would want to find a job \ncompatible with her family’s needs to increase the household’s income. \n45. Plaintiff Brenda Doe is an intending immigrant from the Dominican \nRepublic who lives in the Bronx with her U.S. citizen husband, who is also from the Dominican \nRepublic, and their three children.  The younger twochildrenare both U.S. citizens: one is a \nminor and the other is a collegestudent who struggles with a learning disability. They also have \na young adult son who has permanent residence, and who is currently unemployed.  Brenda is \n18\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 21 of 116\nthe beneficiary of an I-130 “Petition for Alien Relative” filed by her husband and approved by \nUSCIS.  Brenda’s husbandalways worked and supported the family, but he lost his sight due to \nglaucoma in 2015, and was forced to stop working due to his disability. He is certified legally \nblind by the State of New York. His last job before becoming disabled was at a very high-end \nNew York City restaurant where he was making approximately $60,000 per year.  He receives \nSocial Security Disability benefits with a supplement for his minor daughter. In addition to their \nSocial Security benefits, the family, except for Brenda, receives support in the form of SNAP \nbenefits.  Brenda’s husband receives Medicare, and the two younger children receive State-\nfunded health insurance.  Brenda is eligible forState-funded Medicaid but she did not apply to \nreceive it because she is healthy and is concerned that receiving the insurance would impact her \nimmigration case. She cannot afford private insurance.  Brenda’s sister-in-law (her husband’s\nsister) has agreed to be Brenda’s financial co-sponsor. The sister-in-lawhas no dependents and \ntogether with her husband, makes approximately $140,000 a year in income.  Once Brenda \nobtains her green card, she aimsto finda job compatible with her family’s needs to increase their \nhousehold income.  \n46. Brenda’s goal is to obtain LPR status. Because Brendahas resided in the \nU.S. without authorization after entering without inspection, she will have to leave the country to \nseek her immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad. Without a waiver of her period of unlawful \npresence, Brendawould be required to remain outside the U.S. for ten years before she could \nobtain LPR status. Brendaapplied for an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility,and her application \nwas approved. This means that she is able to return to the Dominican Republic for consular \nprocessing without the ten-year waiting period,provided she is otherwise eligible for an \nimmigrant visa.  In her application,she explained the extreme hardship that her family would \n19\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 22 of 116\nsuffer without the waiver.  In particular, she is the primary caregiver for her disabled husband.  \nAlthough Brenda would not have been denied admission on public charge grounds under the \nconsular rules that pre-dated theFAM Revisions, were she to undergo consular processing and \nface application of any of the Consular Rules challenged in this case, her immigrant visa would \nlikely be denied, and she would be separated from her family indefinitely. \n47. Plaintiff Carl Doe is an intending immigrant and a member of MRNY who \nlives in Queens with his U.S. citizen wife and adult stepdaughter. His goal is to obtain LPR \nstatus.  His wife’s I-130 petition on his behalf was granted, and USCIS has granted his I-601A \nwaiver request on account of extreme hardship to his wife,who depends on him for financial and \nemotional support. Carl speaks English and owns his own business, from which he earned \n$20,000last year.  Because he resided in the U.S. without authorization after entering without \ninspection, once he receives an appointment date for consular processing, he will berequired to \nreturn to his country of origin, El Salvador, for an interview with a DOS consular officer.\nAlthough he would not have been deemed likely to become a public charge in the past, henow \nfaces the risk of being unable to return to the U.S. as a result of the Consular Rules, subjecting \nhimselfand his family to indefinite separation.  Although Carl Doe is 32, has never had any \nhealth problems, and is eligible for state-funded Medicaid, to mitigate the risks to his \nimmigration petition imposed by the Consular Rules, he will be forced to have his company \npurchase an expensive health plan that does not provide adequate health care coverage.\n48. Plaintiff Diana Doe is an intending immigrant and a member of MRNY \nwho lives in Long Island in the home she owns with her husband. Her husband is 67 years old \nand their daughter 12; both are U.S. citizens. Her husband’s I-130 petition on her behalf was \ngranted.  Because Diana Doehas resided in the U.S. without authorization after entering without \n20\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 23 of 116\ninspection,she will have to leave the country to seek her immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate \nabroad. Without a waiver of her period of unlawful presence, Diana would be required to remain \noutside the U.S. for ten years before she could obtain LPR status.  She will file an I-601A request \nfor a waiver of inadmissibility for unlawful presence based on extreme hardship, which she is \ncurrently preparing.  Once it is granted, Diana Doe will have to return to her country of origin, \nMexico, for an interview with a DOS consular officer.  Because Diana Doe’s husband is retired \nand disabled, he receives Social Security income as well as retirement benefits from his union, \ntotaling about $28,000 last year. Diana Doe is the sole caretaker for her husband and adolescent \ndaughter, and shares caretaking duties for her 85-year-old mother, also a U.S. citizen, with her \nsiblings. Diana Doe would not have been deemed likely to become a public charge in the past,\nbut should Diana Doe depart the U.S. to wait for a consular processing appointment, she will \nfacethe imminent risk of being unable to return to the U.S. as a result of the Consular Rules,\nsubjecting herand herfamily to indefinite separation. Although Diana Doe has typically paid \nout-of-pocket at neighborhood clinics to obtain health care,to mitigate the risks imposed by the \nConsular Rules, she will have to deplete her small savings in order to purchase an expensive \nhealth plan that does not provide adequate health care coverage.\n49. Plaintiff Eric Doe is a U.S. citizen originally from Mexico. He resides in \nManhattan with his wife, an intending immigrant from Mexico, and three of their children. Eric \nfiled an I-130 “Petition for Alien Relative” on behalf of his wife, which was approved by USCIS. \nEric is a superintendent for several New York City apartment buildings, and makes \napproximately $52,000 per year. Eric also has a chronic form of leukemia which requires \nongoing treatment, but he has been able to keep working despite periods during which he \nbecomes very ill. Each of the family members receives state-funded health insurance, but no \n21\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 24 of 116\nother government benefits.  Eric’s wife, who works part-time cleaning homes, wants to obtain \nLPR status.  Because she has resided in the U.S. without authorization after entering without \ninspection, she will have to leave the country to seek her immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate \nabroad.  Without a waiver of her period of unlawful presence, she would be required to remain \noutside the U.S. for ten years before she could obtain LPR status. Eric’s wife has been approved\nfor an I-601A waiver of inadmissibility, which means she is able to return to Mexico for consular \nprocessing without the ten-year waiting period provided she is otherwise eligible for an\nimmigrant visa.  In her I-601A application,she explained the extreme hardship that her family \nwould suffer without the waiver, especially her husband. Although Eric’s wife would not have \nbeen denied admission on public charge grounds under the consular rules that pre-dated the FAM \nRevisions, were she to undergo consular processing and face application of any of the Consular \nRules challenged in this case, her immigrant visa would likely be denied, and Eric would either \nhave to return with their children to Mexico at the risk of Eric’s health or be separated from his \nwife indefinitely. \nII. Defendants\n50. Defendant Michael Pompeo is the Secretary of State, the federal agency \nthat oversees consular processing and the entries of intending immigrants seeking adjustment. \nHe is responsible for overseeing the enforcement and implementation of the Proclamation for all \nDepartment of State staff and is charged by statute with the administration and enforcement of \nimmigration laws, including those related to the powers, duties,and functions of consular \nofficers not reserved to the officers themselves. 8 U.S.C. §1104. Defendant Pompeo is sued in \nhis official capacity.\n22\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 25 of 116\n51. Defendant DOS is a cabinet department of the United States federal \ngovernment. DOS is charged with the issuance of immigrant visas abroad and consular \nprocessing of intending immigrants seeking admission. \n52. Defendant Alex Azar is the Secretary of the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services, the federal agency that regulates private and public health \ninsurance.  He is responsible for overseeing enforcement and implementation of the \nProclamation by staff at the Department of Health and Human Services. Defendant Azar is sued \nin his official capacity.  \n53. Defendant HHS is a cabinet agency within the United States federal \ngovernment.  The Proclamation assigns to HHS a variety of responsibilities regarding its \nimplementation and enforcement.  \n54. Defendant Trump is President of the United States. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity.  In that capacity, he issued the Proclamation.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nI. Obtaining LPR Status through Consular Processing\nand the Public Charge Provisions of the INA\n55. To understand how the Defendants seek to radically undo, by executive \naction, the duly enacted federal immigration statutes, it is necessary first to understand how the \nINA, together with implementing regulations, comprehensively addresses who may and may not \nbecome a lawful permanent resident of the United States.  \n56. The INAdefines “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” to mean \n“the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United \nStates as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws . . .”  8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(20).  \n23\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 26 of 116\nAn LPR, or green card holder, has received an “immigrant visa” and has permission to live and \nwork in the U.S. permanently as long as the person abides by the law, as well as the right to \npetition for certain family members to join them in the U.S. as LPRs.  LPR status is also a \nprecondition for most immigrants to be eligible for obtaining U.S. citizenship through \nnaturalization.  \n57. There are various paths through which an intending immigrant can obtain \nLPR status.  Family-based immigration is the predominant path, accounting for 66 percent of all \nadjustments to LPR status.6 Other paths to LPR status include (without limitation): humanitarian \nentry provided to refugees, asylees, and certain survivors of crime; employer sponsorship; and \nthe diversity visa lottery. How an intending immigrant obtains LPR status through a family \nmember depends on whether they are applying from within the United States, in which case the \nprocess is called “adjustment of status,” or seeking to enter the U.S. with an immigrant visa \nthrough consular processing in a Department of State consular office or foreign embassy. \n58. Obtaining an adjustment to LPR status through a family member requires \nthe intending immigrant, among other things, to have a qualifyingrelationship with certain U.S.-\ncitizen or LPR relatives.7 Family members file DHS Form I-130 to petition for their beneficiary \n6 See Dep’t of Homeland Security, Annual Flow Report: Lawful Permanent Residents, at 5 (2018),available at\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Lawful_Permanent_Residents_2017.pdf.\n7 One category of qualifying relationships is “immediate relative,” meaning a spouse of a U.S. citizen, an \nunmarried child under the age of 21 of a U.S. citizen, or the parent of a U.S. citizen who is at least 21 years old.  \n8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i);1151(f).  The INA places annual numerical limits on the number of immigrant \nvisas available to relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs in certain categories, but there are no such limits on the \nnumber of persons seeking to obtain LPR statusthrough an immediate relative.  Id. §1151(b). Other relatives \nof a U.S. citizen or LPR may qualify under “family-based preference” categories.  Id.§1153(a).  These include \nunmarried adult sons or daughters of citizens; spouses and unmarried sons or daughters of LPRs; married sons \nor daughters of citizens; and brothers and sisters of citizens, but there are annual numerical limits placed on the \nimmigrant visas available in each of these family-based preference categories.  Id.§1151(a)(1).  Most family-\nbased applicants for LPR status are required to have a financial sponsor who can support them at or above 125 \npercent of the FPG.  See id.at §1183a.  \n24\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 27 of 116\nfamily members to establish the qualifying family relationship.  Where an intending immigrant \nseeks LPR status through her employer, the employer files DHS Form I-140 to petition for \nbeneficiary employees to establish the qualifying employee/employer relationship.  Once these I-\n130 or I-140 petitions are approved, the beneficiary continues the process of seeking immigrant \nstatus by filing a Form I-485 application to adjust status, together with voluminous information \nto demonstrate that the beneficiary is eligible for an immigrant visa and is not inadmissible \npursuant to the INA. \n59. Consular processing begins with a Form I-130 or I-140 filed on behalf of \nthe intending immigrant.  Once one of thoseforms is approved, the beneficiary continues the \nprocess of seeking immigrant status by filing a Form DS-260 immigrant visa electronic \napplication, together with voluminous information to demonstrate that the immigrant is eligible \nfor immigrant visas and is not inadmissible under the provisions ofthe INA.\n60. Family-based applicants for LPR status –both those adjusting their status \nand thoseundergoing consular processing –need to demonstrate that none of the grounds of \ninadmissibility set forth in section 212 of the INA are applicable.  Id.§ 1182(a)(1)–(10) \n(including, e.g., grounds related to health, unlawful presence, criminal convictions, national \nsecurity, and others).  One such ground relates to whetherthe applicant is likely to become a \npublic charge.  Where any of the grounds of inadmissibility are present and not waived, the \napplication for admission or adjustment will be denied. If the applicant is found to be eligible \nand there is no basis for denial, the application for status adjustment is approved, and the \napplicant is issued a lawful permanent resident card or green card.  \n61. Some intending immigrants have previouslyenteredthe United States\nwithout admission or parole, which is a ground of inadmissibility. See8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A).  \n25\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 28 of 116\nIn such cases,the intending immigrant cannot adjust herstatus within the United States.  In such \ncases,the intending immigrant must depart the U.S. to continue the consular process, typically in \nthe country of origin.  If the intending immigrant has accrued between six months and one year \nof unlawful presence, she is subject to a three-year bar on returning; if she has accrued more than \none year of unlawful presence, the bar is ten years.  8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(9)(B).  There is an \nunlawful presence waiver process for which intending immigrants can apply to avoid the three-\nor ten-year exclusion and the resulting displacement from their community and family.  In order \nto qualify for the Form I-601A waiver, the intending immigrant must demonstrate extreme \nhardship to the sponsoring family member that would occur if the sponsor either had to remain \noutside the country with the intending immigrant, or were to become separated from the \nintending immigrant during the period of exclusion.  Where the I-601A waiver is granted, the \nintending immigrant typically leaves the United States when their consular interview is \nscheduled.  At that interview, the DOS consular officer must evaluate all the bases for denying \nadmission set forth in the INA,including the public charge provision.\n62. The public charge basis for inadmissibility is set forth in §1182(a)(4) of \nthe INA, which bars admission to a noncitizen who “in the opinion of the consular officer at the \ntime of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application \nfor admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to become a public charge is \ninadmissible.” Id.§1182(a)(4)(A).8\n8 A separate provision of the INA renders “deportable” noncitizens who, within five years after the date of entry, \nhave “become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry.” Id.§\n1227(a)(5).  Regulations governing this provision would be promulgated by the Department of Justice and are \nnot at issue here. \n26\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 29 of 116\n63. The INA identifies five factors that a consular officer or the Attorney \nGeneral must consider when making a prospective public charge determination in the \nadmissibility context: (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and financial \nstatus; and (5) education and skills.  Id.§1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The statute does not ascribe \nparticular weight to any factor and requires that these five factors be considered “at minimum.”\nThe INA also permits a consular officer or the Attorney General to “consider any affidavit of \nsupport” from a financial sponsor.  8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(4)(B)(ii). \n64. In addition to the barriers to admission set forth in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a), the \nINA also provides for the President to issue proclamations to temporarily “suspend” or “impose”\nrestrictions on the entry of foreign-born persons if he “finds” such entry to be “detrimental to the \ninterests of the United States.” 8 U.S.C. §1182(f).  However, theproclamation power does not \npermit the President to “override particular provisions of the INA,” as the Supreme Court \nrecently reaffirmed.Trump v.Hawaii, 138 S.Ct. 2392, 2411 (2018).\nII. Defendants’Attempts to Rewrite the Immigration Statutes by Executive Action\n65. The Defendants’ attempts to transform the statutorily-mandated \nimmigration scheme set forth above has taken multiple forms, including throughthe Consular \nRules challenged in this action. \nA. DHS Promulgates the “Public Charge” Rule, \nBased on Nativist and Flawed Social Science\n66. The actions challenged in this lawsuit originated in an April 2016 policy \nproposal by the Center for Immigration Studies (“CIS”), a group that the Southern Poverty Law \n27\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 30 of 116\nCenter designates an “anti-immigrant hate group.”9 The policy-drafting group’s brief history \ntraces to its founder, a white supremacist who believed “that for European-American society and \nculture to persist, it requires a European-American majority and a clear one at that,”10 and who \nfeared that America’s white majority was threatened by the “greater reproductive powers of \nHispanic immigrants.”11\n67. The CIS publication that was the genesis of the actions challenged here \nlists numerous proposals for limiting immigration of low-income people and asylum seekers \nfrom non-European countries, including using “the public charge doctrine to reduce the number \nof welfare-dependent foreigners living in the United States.”12\n68. Critical to CIS’s approach is its laundering of information to reverse \nengineer support forpolicies to reduce immigration by people of color.  In essence, CIS seeks \nthrough misrepresenting and misstating data and slipshod logic to provide intellectual cover for \nracist exclusion.  Conservativethinktanks such as the libertarian Cato Institute have criticized \nCIS’s “unsound methodological choice[s]”that are made to “inflate[]”the apparent use of public \nbenefits programs by noncitizens so as to justify expanding public charge.13\n9 See Southern Poverty Law Center listing of Center for Immigration Studies as an “anti-immigrant hate group,” \nSouthern Poverty Law Center, available athttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/center-\nimmigration-studies.\n10 See Matt Schudel, John Tanton, architect of anti-immigration and English-only efforts, dies at 85, Wash.

Within a week of President Trump’s inauguration, a draft of an executive \norder targeting immigrant-headed families that had used any means-tested public benefit, \nincluding children’s health insurance for U.S. citizen children, was leaked to the public, initiating \na pattern across the country of fear, and resulting in mass immigrant withdrawal from public \nservices and benefits.  The draft executive order, among other things, directed DHS to issue new \nrules defining “public charge” to include any person receiving means-tested public benefits and \nordered similar amendments of the FAM.14\n70. The draft Executive Order was never signed.  But DHS embarked on \ndrafting changes to the public charge criteria through notice-and-comment rulemaking, and on \nOctober 10, 2018, DHS published aNotice of Proposed Rulemakingentitled “Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds.”  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 \n(proposed Oct. 10, 2018) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, 213, 214, 245, 248).  The \nproposed rule was met with comments from more than 266,000 think tanks, scholars, advocacy \ngroups, legal services organizations, children’s aid groups andother nonprofits, states, \nmunicipalities, and individuals—the “vast majority” of which “opposed the Rule,” accordingto \nDHS.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,304.  \n71. On August 14, 2019, USCIS published the final DHS Rule. Twenty-three \nstates and the District of Columbia, six municipalities, nineteen non-profit immigrants’rights, \npublic interest, and health advocacy organizations; and two individual plaintiffs filed suit in five \ndifferent federal courts around the country.

Twoappellate \ncourts havestayedthe effect of injunctions issued by District Courts in California and \nWashington, and in Maryland, but the DHS Rule remains enjoined.   \nB. DOS Pursues Analogous Changes to its Consideration of “Public Charge” \n72. As DHS undertook the process of promulgatingthe DHS Rule,Defendant \nDOS simultaneously embarked on similar changes to its own rules and regulations, first through \nthe revisions to its Foreign Affairs Manual embodied in the FAM Revisions,published in \nJanuary 2018 without any notice-and-comment period, and then through publication of the IFR \non October 11, 2019, also without advance notice-and-comment.  \n73. Like the enjoined DHS Rule, the FAM Revisions and the IFR seek to \nimplement objectives of theCIS “wish list” and the draft executive order.  \n(i) The FAM Revisions\n74. The FAM is the “single, comprehensive, and authoritative source for the \nDepartment’s organization structure, policies, and procedures that govern the operation of the \nState Department, the Foreign Service, and, when applicable, other federal agencies.”15 The \nFAM “convey[s] codified information to Department staff and contractors so they can carry out \ntheir responsibilities in accordance with statutory, executive, and Department mandates.”16\nScholars have described the FAM as representing “the official policies of the Department of \n15 Foreign Affairs Manual and Handbook, U.S. Dep’t of State, available at http://fam.state.gov/.\n16 Id. \n30\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 33 of 116\nState” and constituting “binding authority on consulates, as well as on all other agencies within \nthe Department of State.”17\n75. From 1999 until 2018, the FAM has defined “public charge” as a non-\ncitizen who “is likely to become primarily dependent on the U.S. Government for subsistence” \neither from “[r]eceipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance” or “[i]nstitutionalization \nfor long-term care.” 9 FAM § 302.8-2(B)(1)[pre 2018 revisions]. This definition is consistent \nwith the 1999 INS Field Guidance, which specifically excluded from public charge \ndeterminations consideration of noncash benefits programs, such as Medicaid, SNAP, and \nhousing assistance. 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689 (May 26, 1999).\n76. Until January 3, 2018, the FAM explicitly prohibitedconsular officers \nfrom considering a visa applicant’s past, current, or future use of non-cash benefits: “Neither the \npast nor possible future receipt of such non-cash or supplemental assistance may be considered \nin determiningwhether an alien is likely to become a public charge.” See id.\n77. The FAM also provided a non-exclusive list of non-cash benefits \nprograms that should be excluded from consideration, includingSNAP, Medicaid, Child Health \nInsurance Program (“CHIP”), and other nutrition and food assistance programs. Additionally, \nthe FAM directed consular officers to consider “a properly filed, non-fraudulent Form I-864\n[Affidavit of Support] in those cases where it is required, . . . [as normally] sufficient to meet the \n[8 U.S.C. § 1182](a)(4) requirements [under the INA] and satisfy the ‘totality of the \ncircumstances’analysis.” 9 FAM § 302.8-2(B)(1) [pre-2018 revisions].\n17 Victoria Degtyareva, Defining Family in Immigration Law: Accounting for Nontraditional Families in \nCitizenship by Descent, 120 Yale L.J. 862, 872 (2011).\n31\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 34 of 116\n78. The January 3, 2018 FAM Revisions radically expanded who is likely to \nbe found inadmissible on “publiccharge” grounds by consular officers in multiple ways. The \nFAM Revisions are extremely broad—in some respects, going even farther than the enjoined \nDHS Rule. \n79. Specifically, the FAM Revisions direct consular officers to look for any \n“[p]ast or current receipt of public assistance of anytype by the visa applicant or a family \nmember in the visa applicant’s household,” including non-cash benefit programs, as evidence \nthat the applicant will likely become a “public charge” in the future.  9 FAM 302.8-2(B)(2)\n[post-2018 revisions] (emphasis added).\n80. In addition, Defendant DOS drastically reduced the weight given to a \nproperly filed Affidavit of Support, specifyingthat an Affidavit of Support will simply be a \n“positive,” as opposed to dispositive,factor.  Although the FAM still explicitly permits a \nnonrelative to serve as a joint sponsor, stating “[t]he joint sponsor can be a friend or third party \nwho is not necessarily financially connected with the sponsor’s household,” see9 FAM 302.8-\n2(C)(7)[post-2018 revisions],the FAM now incorporates language encouraging the consular \nofficer to consider the “likelihood that the sponsor(s)will support the visa applicant . . .” 9 FAM \n302.2(B)(3)(U)(1)(b)[post-2018 revisions]. This tension within the FAM Revisions—between \npermitting anyone to be a joint sponsor and at the same time inviting subjective judgement as to \nwho is more “likely” to abide by the contractual obligation set forth in the Affidavit of Support—\ninvites arbitrary and inconsistent evaluation of the Affidavit of Support.  For example, since the \nFAM Revisions were enacted, consular officers located in Ciudad Juarez, Mexicohave advised \nconsular interviewees that Forms I-864 demonstrating a current individual annual income at or \nabove the legal requirements is no longer sufficient. Some applicants presenting Affidavits of \n32\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 35 of 116\nSupport from a joint sponsor wereadvised, either orally or in writing, to submit one instead from \na family member or to further document the relationship between the joint sponsor and the\napplicant.  In other cases, consular officers are advising applicants that a better choice of sponsor \nwould be one who is afamilymemberor lives with the applicant.\n81. The FAM Revisions also work retroactively, as they direct consular \nofficers to considerpast receipt of benefits,which was not previously contemplated in the FAM.\nFor example, the FAM Revisions direct consular officers to consider the past use of non-cash \nbenefits by visa applicants and their sponsors and does not limit that consideration to benefits \nused after the FAM Revisions. The Rule thus penalizes noncitizens for decisions they made or \ntheir sponsors and family members in reliance on then-existing law and the INS Field Guidance. \n82. DOS has not identified anyauthority that would permit it to promulgate \nretroactive rules.  Without express authorization from Congress, DOS lacks the power to apply \nthe standards in the FAM Revisions retroactively.  \n83. The FAM Revisions were promulgated absent required rulemaking \nprocedures. None of these alterations were made with proper notice, explanation, or opportunity \nfor comment to the public. \n84. Following publication of the FAM Revisions,initial denials on public \ncharge grounds increased dramatically. While DOS findings of inadmissibility on public charge \ngrounds totaled 1,033 in fiscal year 2016, a total of 12,973 initial denials on public charge \ngrounds were issued in fiscal year 2018—atwelve-foldincrease.18 The highest increases in \n18 SeeDOS tables linked to in Ted Hesson, Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State \nDepartment, Politico (Aug. 6, 2019),available athttps://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-\nmexicans-trump-1637094.\n33\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 36 of 116\ndenials fell on Mexican applicants. While just sevenMexican nationals were refused an \nimmigrant visas on public charge grounds in fiscal year 2016, a total of 5,343 Mexican nationals \nwere refused an immigrant visa on public charge grounds during the first ten months of fiscal \nyear 2019.19 Intending immigrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and the Dominican \nRepublic also saw notable increases in initial findings of inadmissibility based on public charge \ngrounds.20 In contrast, there were eitherno, or in limited cases no meaningful,increase in \napplicants refused visas on public charge grounds from predominantly white countries.21\n85. The FAM Revisions are currently being challenged in the United States \nDistrict Court forthe District of Maryland. SeeMayor and City Council of Baltimore v.Trump,\nNo. 1:18-cv-03636 (D. Md., Filed November 28, 2018).  On September 20, 2019, the court \ndenied the government’s motion to dismiss, holding that the FAM Revisions “contain all the \nhallmarks of a legislative rule” that is “subject to notice and comment under the APA.”  2019 \nWL 4598011 at *32-33 (D. Md. Sept. 20, 2019). Further, the court held that theplaintiffs in that \ncase had plausibly alleged that the FAM Revisions were impermissibly retroactive and that they \nviolated the Equal Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. Id.\n19 Id.\n20 For instance, public charge denials for Pakistani national increased to 563 in the first ten months of 2019, from \njust two denials in fiscal year 2016.  Similarly, public charge denials for Bangladeshi nationals rocketed \nupwards to 1,262 in just the first ten months of fiscal year 2019, from 324 denials in fiscal year 2017.  Id.\n21 Id. The number of visa denials for applicants from Spain remained the same as compared between fiscal year \n2016 to the first ten months of 2019 (one visa denialin each time period).  Similarly, across that same time \nperiod, the number of visa denials for Bulgarian and German applicants only increased from one to two, and \ntwo to three, respectively.  Visa denials for Russian applicants actually fell from fiscal year 2016 to 2019, from \n14 to 11.\n34\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 37 of 116\n(ii) The Interim Final Rule\n86. On October 11, 2019, as five federal courts were drafting or issuing \ndecisions blocking the DHS public charge rule from taking effect, DOS published an interim \nfinal rule (IFR), amending 22 C.F.R. § 40.41. Visas: Ineligibility Based on Public Charge \nGrounds, 84 F.R. 54996 (October 11, 2019).\na. The Substance of the IFR Mirrors that of \nthe Enjoined DHS Rule\n87. The IFR states that it is amending the FAM and is “intended to align the \nDepartment’s standards with those of the Department of Homeland Security,” to avoid \ninconsistent applications of the public charge provision between the two federal agencies.  84\nFed. Reg. at 54,996. Thus, the IFR takes the applicable provisions and definitions from the DHS \npublic charge rule and incorporates those into the FAM. See id.\n88. The amendments include definitions of “public charge,” “public benefit,” \n“alien’s household,” “age,” and “receipt of public benefits.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 54,996; 55,001-11.\nThese amendments represent a dramatic change to the standards related to public charge set forth \nin the 1999 INS Field Guidance.\n89. First, the IFR defines “public charge” to mean a person “who receives one \nor more [specified] public benefits . . . for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\nmonthperiod (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two \nmonths).”  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,014(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(b)).  DOS offers no cogent \nexplanation for this 12-month trigger or why it considers the appropriate threshold to be 12 \nmonths rather than 6, 24, or any other number.  \n35\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 38 of 116\n90. Second, the IFR defines “public benefit” to mean any amount of benefits \nfrom anyof the programs enumerated in the Rule.  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,014(proposed 22 C.F.R. \n§40.41(c)).   The IFR defines “public benefits” to include a wide range of cash and non-cash \nbenefits that offer short-term or supplemental support to eligible recipients.  These benefits \ninclude cash benefits such as SSI, 42 U.S.C. § 1381 et seq.; TANF, 42 U.S.C. § 601 et seq.;\n“Federal, state or local cash benefit programs for income maintenance;” and non-cash \nsupplemental benefits such as SNAP, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2011–2036c; Section 8 Housing Assistance \nunder the Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 984; 42 U.S.C. §§1437f &1437u; \nSection 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, 24 C.F.R. parts 5, 402, 880–884, 886; federal \nMedicaid, 42 U.S.C. §§1396 et seq.(with certain narrow exclusions);22 and Public Housing \nunder section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. §1437et seq. 84Fed. Reg. \n54,999.23 In contrast, the 1999 Field Guidance directs consideration ofonly the likelihood that \nan individual will become primarily dependent on the government, as shown by receipt of \nmonthly cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, in making a public charge \ndetermination, and specifically excludes from considerationsuchnon-cash benefits.  \n91. The definition of “public charge” in the IFR also radically changes the \namount as well as the type of benefits that can trigger a public chargefinding.  While under the \n22 Medicaid benefits excluded from the public charge analysis include benefits paid for an emergency medical \ncondition, services or benefits provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, school-based \nbenefits provided to children at or below the eligible age for secondary education, and benefits received by \nchildren under 21 years of age, or woman during pregnancy and 60 days post-partum.  84 Fed Reg. at 55,014\n(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(c)).  \n23 The definition of “public benefits” excludes benefits received by (i) individuals enlisted in the armed forces as \nwell as their spouses and children, (ii) individuals during a period in which they are exempt from the public \ncharge inadmissibility ground, and (iii)children of U.S. citizens whose admission for lawful permanent \nresidence will automatically result in their acquisition of citizenship.  84 Fed. Reg. at 54,999(proposed 22 \nC.F.R. §40.41(b)).  \n36\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 39 of 116\nField Guidance, as noted, only a person who was considered “primarily dependent” on the \ngovernment for subsistence was considered a public charge, the IFR renders an immigrant an \nexcludable public charge upon receipt of anyamount of the listed benefits forany12months “in \nthe aggregate” duringthe 36-month period prior to filing avisa application.  Under this \n“aggregate” calculus, receipt of two benefits in one month would count as two months.  See 84\nFed. Reg. at 55,013(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(c)).  \n92. As with the now-enjoined DHS Rule, the IFR’s sweeping redefinition of \n“public charge” would drastically increase the number of persons potentially denied admission or \nentry on that basis.  According to a November 2019 report from the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities (“CBPP”), nearly 81 percent of the world’s population would fail to satisfy one \nparticular criterion found inboththe DHS Rule and the IFR: the “income test,” which has a \nnegative impact onimmigrants’publiccharge consideration if their income falls below 125 \npercent of the U.S. FPG.24\n93. As further illustration, by one estimate, in any one year, 30 percent of \nU.S.-born citizens receive one of the benefits included in the rule’s definition (compared to \napproximately 5 percent of U.S.-born citizens who meet the current benefit-related criteria in the \npublic charge determination under the 1999 Field Guidance).  Similarly, in any given year, 16 \npercent of U.S. workers receive one of those benefits, compared to 1 percent who meet the \ncurrent benefit-related criteria.  As set forth in its public comment on the parallel DHS Rule, the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that 40 percent of U.S.-born individuals \n24 SeeCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, Administration’s Public Charge Rules Would Close theDoor to \nU.S. to Immigrants Without Substantial Means(Nov. 11, 2019),available at\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/research/immigration/administrations-public-charge-rules-would-close-the-door-to-us-to-\nimmigrants.\n37\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 40 of 116\ncovered by a 2015 survey participated in one of those programs between 1998 and 2014—a\nfigure that, after adjusting for underreporting, is likely approximately 50 percent.25 A more \nrecent report by the same organization explains that, “[i]f one considers benefit receipt of the \nU.S.-born citizens over the 1997-2017 period, some 43 to 52 percent received one of the benefits \nincluded in the proposed public charge rule,” and that more than 50 percent of the U.S.-born \ncitizen population would receive such benefits over their lifetimes.26 While U.S. citizens are not \nsubject to either the FAM Revisions or the IFR, these figures illustrate the extraordinarily broad \npotential impact of those portions of the ConsularRules challenged in this action.\n94. The predictive nature of the test set forth in the IFR further magnifies the \nharm of the aggregate consideration of benefits.  It is difficult to imagine how a consular officer \ncould find that a person is likely in the future to receive only one benefit for twelve months \ninstead of two benefits for six months, three benefits for four months, etc.  Thus,a substantial \nprobability exists that the 12-month use limit will be theoretical only, with prediction being \nreduced simply to whether a person will or won’t be likely to ever use a non-cashbenefit.\n95. Third, the IFR defines the statutory phrase “likely at any time to become a \npublic charge” to mean “more likely than not at any time in the future to become a public charge, \n. . . based on the totality of the alien’s circumstances.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,012 (proposed 22 \n25 SeeCBPP,Commenton Proposed Rule on Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility (Dec. 7, 2018), at 2, 7–8,\n10, available athttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-37272;see also Center for \nAmerican Progress, Comments on Department of Homeland Security, Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nGrounds, RIN 1615-AA22, 83 Federal Register 51114, at 15 (Dec. 10, 2018) (“the proposed redefinition would \nmean that most native-born, working-class Americans are or have been public charges”)available at\nhttps://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2018/12/11075803/CAP-Comments-on-Public-Charge-\nAdmissibility.pdf.\n26 SeeCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, Trump Administration’s Overbroad Public Charge Definition Could \nDeny Those Without Substantial Means a Chance to Come to or Stay in the U.S.(May 30, 2019),available at\nhttps://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/trump-administrations-overbroad-public-charge-\ndefinition-could-deny.\n38\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 41 of 116\nC.F.R.§40.41(a)).  Thus, the IFR expressly disclaims anylimit on how far into the future \nevaluation of the public charge analysis is to extend. \n96. Fourth, the IFR creates and inserts a complex and confusing scheme of \npositive and negative “factors,” including certain “heavily weighted” factors, that supplants the \nstatutory totality of circumstances test used to determine whether a noncitizen is likely to become \na public charge under the INA.  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,012–13 (proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)).\n97. The bottom line of this scheme is straightforward: the rule defines public \ncharge solely by reference to use of benefits in any amount and uses factors that focus \noverwhelmingly on the noncitizen’s income and financial resources, and past or current receipt \nof public benefits will be weighted heavily in favor of a determination that the noncitizen is \ninadmissible and ineligible for LPR status. For example, one of the “heavily weighted negative \nfactors” under the IFR is past or current receipt of public benefits.  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,012 \n(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)).  Another “heavily weighted negative factor” is an applicant’s\ndiagnosis with a medical condition that is “likely to require extensive medical treatment” when \nthe applicant lacks private health insurance or financial resources to pay for anticipated costs.  Id.\n98. Indeed, every “heavily weighted positive factor” under the IFR similarly \nfocuses on the immigrant’s assets and financial resources, such as (1) having combined income, \nassets or resources, and support of at least 250 percent of the FPG; (2) being authorized to work \nand currently employed with an annual income of at least 250 percent of the FPG; or (3) \npossessing private health insurance.  Id. The IFR also expressly excludes from consideration as\nprivate health insurance any insurance purchased using premium tax credits under theACA. Id.\n99. Even the factors under the IFR that are not “heavily weighted” also focus \npredominantly on assets and financial resources.  For example, the IFR’s “income test”provides \n39\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 42 of 116\nthat consular officers will consider whether the applicant’s household’s annual gross income is at \nleast 125 percent of the most recent FPG based on household size.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 55,012-\n13 (proposed 22 C.F.R. § 40.41(a)).  If the applicant’s household’s annual gross income is below \nthat level, DHS will consider this a negative factor, unless the total value of the applicant’s\nhousehold assets and resources is at least five timesthe difference between the household’s\nincome and 125 percent of the FPG. See id.27\n100. The IFR also penalizes applicants who are under the age of 18—merely \nbecause of their age, even though they have their whole working lives ahead of them—as well as \nthose aged 62 and over, adults well below the typical retirement age in today’s punishing \neconomy.  See84 Fed. Reg. at 55,001(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)).  Thus, for example, even \n“in the case of a 17-year-old who has a credible offer of lawful employment that would make \nhim-or herself-sufficient, the alien’s age would be a negative factor.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 55,001 \n(emphasis added).  Further, whilethe IFR states that it does not “intend . . . [the] standard to \nimply that individuals over early retirement age are unable to work,” it retains the rigid 62-plus \nage line as a negative factor. Id.\n101. Apparently recognizing that retroactive application would be unlawful, the \nIFR does not adopt the FAM’s approach to past benefits and instead states that consular officers \nshould consider only those benefits received after October15, 2019 in determining whether an \napplicant for admission is likely to become a public charge. Id. at 55,006. Notably, this \n27 This amount is reduced to three times the difference for an immigrant who is the spouse or child of a U.S. \ncitizen, and one times the difference for an immigrant who is an orphan who will be adopted in the United \nStates after acquiring permanent residence.  See id.\n40\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 43 of 116\nlanguage does not appear to be impacted by the subsequent postponement ofthe IFR’s\nimplementation, and thus all benefits received since October 15 will count upon implementation.\n102. The IFR provides further that DOS will consider additional vague and \nunprecedented factors for which there appears to be no specific standard.  For example, for the \nfirst time, DOS will evaluate an intending immigrant’s English language proficiency, without \narticulating any standard or level of proficiency an applicant is required to attain or how such \nproficiency is to be measured.  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,013 (proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)(5)).  In \ncontrast, when determining a naturalization applicant’s English language proficiency, USCIS’s\nregulation sets out clear standards for ability to read, write and speak “words in ordinary usage”\nand directs applicants to test-study materials and testing procedures on the USCIS website.  See8\nC.F.R. § 312.1. \n103. DOS contends that it will still consider submission of an Affidavit of \nSupport, but the approach outlined in the IFR departs from practices pre-dating the FAM \nRevisions by decreasing the impact of a sufficient Affidavit of Support on thepublic charge \ndetermination. Under the IFR, an Affidavit of Support will no longer be sufficient to rebut a \npublic charge finding.  Rather, it will simply be one positive factor—and not even a heavily \nweighted one—in the new test. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 55,013 (proposed 22 C.F.R.§ 404.41(a)(7)).  \nMoreover, the IFR will no longer accept an Affidavit of Support at face value, but requires the \nconsular officer to evaluate “the likelihood that the sponsor would actually provide the required \nfinancial support, based on available information about the sponsor.” 84 Fed. Reg. 55,004.\n104. The impact of these factors is to multiply the number of grounds for \ndeeming noncitizens inadmissible as public charges and barred from LPR status.  By focusing\nvirtually all the factors DHS chooses to identify—including the majority of “heavily-weighted \n41\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 44 of 116\nfactors”—on an immigrant’s assets and resources, the IFR provides immigration officers with an \nabundance of options to deny green cards to low-income immigrants, whether they have ever \naccessed public benefits or not.  As discussed above, this approach represents a sharp departure \nfrom the consistent historical understanding and application of the public charge inadmissibility \nstandards. The income and resources-focused factors are not targeted to determining who is \ncurrently or predicted to be primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  Rather, they \nare geared toward excluding a much broader group of low-and middle-income noncitizens in the \npublic charge dragnet.\nb. The IFR Was Issued Without\nNotice-and-Comment Rulemaking\n105. Nearly three weeks before the IFR was issued, on September 20, 2019, \ndefendants receiveda ruling finding that the FAM Revisions constituted substantive, legislative \nrules and thus were subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.  Nonetheless, DOS issued the \nIFR four days before it was to go into effect and allowed no opportunity for public comment pre-\nimplementation.\n106. The IFR was thus issued without formal notice-and-comment rulemaking \nand without at least 30 days’notice of its effective date, as typically required by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b)(B), (d)(3).  Instead, the IFR states that \nDefendant DOS has “concluded that the good cause exceptions in 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B) and \n(d)(3) apply to [the IFR] as the delay associated with notice and comment rulemaking would be \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 55,011.\n107. The APAprovides that a rule is exempt from notice-and-comment \nrulemaking procedures “when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and \n42\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 45 of 116\na brief statement of the reasons therefore in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure \nthereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B).  \nThe APA separately provides that a rule is exempt from the statutory 30-day waiting period \nbetween the rule’s publication and effective date when “provided by the agency for good cause \nfound and published with the rule.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(d)(3). These provisions are generally \ninvoked in three circumstances: (1) when an emergency, or some other exigent circumstances \noutside the agency’s control, make compliance with standard notice-and-comment procedures \nimpracticable; (2) when compliance with notice-and-comment procedures would cause harm or \notherwise subvert the purposes of the rule; or (3) when Congress has implicitly waived the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.28\n108. In support of its conclusion that the IFR fulfills the good cause exception \nto notice-and-comment procedures, Defendant DOS provides only conclusory statements of \npublic harm created by self-inflicted exigency.  Specifically, DOS claims that different public \ncharge standards in DHS and DOS regulations will cause inconsistent adjudication, and that \nthese standards must be aligned prior to the original intended effective date of the DHS Rule.  \nDOS willfully excludes the fact that it waited more than a year after DHS initially published its \npublic charge rule to take action, itself causing the exigent circumstances that it now attempts to \nutilize as “good cause” to sidestep the APA’s regular notice-and-comment procedures.\n109. Specifically, the IFR states that any delay would be impracticable because \ntheDHS Rule was set to take effect October 15, 2019 and “[c]oordination of Department and \nDHS implementation of the public charge inadmissibility ground is critical to the Department’s\n28 Jared P. Cole, Cong. Research Serv., R44356,The Good Cause Exception to Notice and Comment Rulemaking: \nJudicial Review of Agency Action 4–8 (2016).\n43\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 46 of 116\ninterest in preventing inconsistent adjudication standards and different outcomes between \ndetermination of visa eligibility and determination of admissibility at a port of entry.” Id.\n110. Although oral arguments in the challenges to the DHS Rule had taken \nplace earlier that week or the week before, with courts strongly indicatingthat they intended to \nissue injunctions, DOS claimed “good cause” for skipping notice and comment as if the DHS \nRule had not been subject to any emergency challenge:  “[I]f implementation of the rule is \ndelayed pending completion of notice and comment, consular officers would apply public \ncharge-related ineligibility standards differed from those apply by DHS and, consequently, might \nissue visas to applicants who would later arrive at a port of entry and be found inadmissible by \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection.” Id. Remarkably, DOS did not explain how this disparity \nin definitions created an exigency given that the FAM changes of January 2018 meant that DHS \nand DOS were already applying different public charge assessments.\n111. Nor did the IFR provide any explanation for why, if “coordination” with \nDHS was paramount, Defendant DOS had failed to issue a proposed rule with adequate time for \npublic notice and comment for more than a yearafter DHS published its public charge rule for \ncomment on October 10, 2018.\nc. It Remains Unclear Whether the IFR Is In Effect\n112. Although the IFR states that it was to go into effect on October 15, 2019, \nsubsequent to issuance Defendant DOS opened public comments for thirty days, with a deadline \nfor public comment on November 12, 2019.\n113. Subsequently, on October 24, 2019, DOS announced that it would open a \n60-day comment period in order to permit public comments on a form required for consular \n44\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 47 of 116\nofficers to make public charge determinations.  The deadline for public comment on the Form \nDS-5540 is December 23, 2019. \n114. It remains unclear whether the IFR is in effect now, or, if it is not, when it \nwill go into effect—and if so, with what, if any, notice. This slapdash and confusing approach to \nrulemaking and effective dates makes it impossible for intending immigrants to know when they \nwill be subject to the IFR or how, if at all, the FAM Revisions are to be applied.\n(iii) The Public Benefits Targeted by the FAM Revisions\nand the IFR Provide Temporary and/or\nSupplemental Support to Individuals Who Work\n115. As noted, the IFR defines “public charge” to mean a person who receives \ncertain enumerated public benefits for more than 12 months in any 36-month period.  The \n“public benefits” at the root of the public charge inquiry include, for the first time, noncash \nbenefits designed to address hunger, health, and housing.  As INS recognized in issuing the 1999 \nField Guidance, these benefits “are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in \ncombination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family.”  64 Fed. Reg. at \n28,692.  Three of the most salient public benefits programs,SNAP, Medicaid, and federal \nhousing assistance,are widely used by working families, like plaintiffs,to supplement their other \nincome.  And they are, by design, available to people with incomes well above the poverty line \nand, in some cases, to people with significant assets.\na. SNAP\n116. Congress created the food stamp program (now known as the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or “SNAP”) in 1964, in order to “safeguard the \nhealth and well-being of the Nation’s population by raising levels of nutrition among low-\n45\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 48 of 116\nincome households.”29 The current maximum monthly allotment of SNAP benefits an individual \nis eligible for is $192 for an individual, or $504 for a family of three,30 which amounts to less \nthan $6 per person daily.  Most receive less.  The average actual allotment for a family of three \nin 2019 is estimated to be approximately $378 per month, or little more than $4 per person \ndaily.31\n117. The supplemental nature ofSNAP is evident not only from its name and \nrelatively limited maximum amount, but from the significant number of SNAP recipients who \nwork. Over one-third of non-disabled adults work in everymonth they participate in SNAP.32\nMany SNAP recipients must meet strict work requirements to maintain eligibility.33 Although \nmost SNAP recipients are subject to income and resource eligibility requirements, many \nrecipients have significant assets and income above the poverty line.  Among other things, many \nsignificant assets are excluded from SNAP eligibility determinations, including homes of \nresidence, the full or partial value of certain vehicles, and most retirement and pension plans. 7 \nU.S.C. § 2014(g); 7 C.F.R. § 273.8(e).

Households with earned income can maintain SNAP eligibility up to 150 percent of \nthe FPG, and households with childcare expenses up to 200 percent.  \nb. Medicaid and State-Funded Health Insurance\n118. Congress created the federal Medicaid program in 1965 to assist states in \nfurnishing medical assistance to individuals and families.34 Medicaid provides health coverage \nto millions of individuals, among them low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly \nadults and people with disabilities.35 Many recipients of Medicaid work.  Nearly 80 percent of \nnon-elderly, non-disabled adult Medicaid beneficiaries are in working families.36 Among \nMedicaid enrollees who work, over half work full-time for the entire yearin which they \nparticipate in the program.37 Research shows that access to affordable health insurance and \ncare, like Medicaid, “promotes individuals’ability to obtain and maintain employment.”38\n119.

Individuals whobecome an LPR through a family-based visa petition\ngenerally would become eligible for federal Medicaid after they have held a “qualified”\nimmigrant status,”see8 U.S.C. §1641(b), forfive years.  \n121. Through New York State of Health, New York’s state-run Health \nExchange, New Yorkers are screened for and enrolled in Medicaid as well as other types of \ngovernment-funded health insurance, government-subsidized private health insurance, and non-\nsubsidized private health insurance.  Government-funded insurance provided by New York \nincludes medical assistance that is available to persons not eligible for federal Medicaid. See \nN.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§ 366(1)(g), 369-gg.  Immigrants who are eligible for this form of state-\nfunded health insurance include qualified immigrants subject to the five-year waiting period, and \npersons considered permanently residing under color of law, including persons granted relief \nunder the deferred action for childhood arrivals (“DACA”) program or other deferred action, and \napplicants for asylum. \n122. Some New Yorkers are eligible for New York’s Basic Health Plan, called \nthe “Essential Plan.”  N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§366(1)(g), 369-gg. The Essential Planprovides \n39 Kaiser Family Foundation, Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions: Interactive Map,(Aug.1, 2019),\navailable at https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-\nmap/.\n40 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10); 42 C.F.R. § 435.603(d)(4). Although the ACA provided for Medicaid expansion up \nto 133% FPL, regulations provide for a 5 percent disregard that makes the effective rate 138%.\n41 John Cannan, A Legislative History of the Affordable Care Act: How Legislative Procedure Shapes Legislative \nHistory, 105 Law Libr. J. 131, 137 (2013). \n48\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 51 of 116\ncoverage to certain immigrants who are ineligible for federal Medicaid, as well as for New \nYorkers with income from 139 percent to 200 percent of the FPG who must pay a low monthly \npremium for coverage.42 As required by Congress, immigrants must be “lawfully present” to be \neligible for private qualified health plans pursuant to the ACA, including the Essential Plan. \n123. Although non-federal Medicaid does not count as a “public benefit” under \nthe public charge test, many noncitizens fear that enrollment in state-funded programs and even \nprivate coverage will carry adverse immigration consequences.  Almost all recipients of New \nYork Medicaid are required to enroll in private Medicaid-managed care plans.  N.Y. Soc. Serv. \nLaw §364-j.  Since many of the same health insurance companies offer commercial, Medicaid, \nMedicare, Essential Plan, and/or Children’s Health Insurance Program coverage, many New \nYorkers do not understand which program they are in, especially if their eligibility shifts year to \nyear. \nc. Federal HousingAssistance Benefits\n124. The IFR includes three types of federal housingassistance in its definition \nof “public benefit”: (i) public housing; (ii) Section 8 vouchers; and (iii)project-based Section 8.  \nMost tenants of public housing pay 30 percent of their income (after certain deductions) for rent \nand utilities.  Federal subsidies, issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nthe local public housing authority that owns and manages the public housing, are intended to \ncover the gap between tenant rents and operating costs.  Section 8 housing choice vouchers \nprovide a rental subsidy to the participant household that can be used to rent a privately owned \n42 SeeN.Y.

Each of these federal housingassistance programs has an income \neligibility requirement measured by the local Area Median Income (“AMI”) for the size of the \nfamily receiving the benefit.  \n125. Federal housingassistance programs support work by enabling low-\nincome households to live in stable homes.  Indeed, of the non-elderly, non-disabled households \nreceiving federal housingassistance, approximately two-thirds are headed by working adults.43\nThat number is even higher for households containing non-citizens, where approximately three-\nquarters of non-elderly, non-disabled households report earning wages.44\n126. As with SNAP and Medicaid, recipients of federal housingassistance may \nhave incomes above the poverty threshold and assets or other resources.  Under these three \nhousingassistance programs, while there are requirements for targeting assistance to lower-\nincome households (below 30 percent of AMI), a household can qualify for assistance with \nincome up to 80 percent of the AMI, which for a family of four in New York City is $85,360 per \nyear,45 more than three times above the FPG of $25,750 for a family that size.46\n43 CBPP,Commenton Proposed Rule on Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility(Dec. 7, 2018), at 48, available \nathttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-37272.\n44 Id.\n45 N.Y.C.

The Health Care Proclamation\n(i) Issuance of the Proclamation\n127. On October 4, 2019, the President issued Proclamation 9945, the \n“Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry of Immigrants Who Will Financially \nBurden the United States Healthcare System” (the “Proclamation”).  84 Fed. Reg. 53,991 (Oct. 9, \n2019). \n128. The Proclamation contains minimal findings, consistingprimarily of \nunsupported assertions pertaining to costs within the American healthcare system and similarly \nunsupported claims regarding immigrants, attempting to connect the former and latter.\n129. First, the Proclamation contends that “[h]ealthcare providers and taxpayers \nbear substantial costs” as a result of individuals accessing healthcare without insurance or \nindividual finances capable of paying their full medical bills.  Id.\n130. The Proclamation declares that the total cost of uncompensated care “ha[s] \nexceeded $35 billion in each of the last 10 years.”  Id. No support for the citation is provided.\n131. The Proclamation further claims that the existence ofuninsured residents \nstrains government budgets by relying upon taxpayer-funded public programs.  Id. No estimate \nof the impact is claimed.\n132. Second, the Proclamation alleges that uninsured individuals are more \nlikely to use emergency rooms, resulting in “overcrowding and delays for those who truly need \nemergency services.”  Id. No estimate of the purported impact is provided.\n133. Thereafter, the Proclamation claims in conclusoryterms that “the United \nStates Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not \ndemonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs.”  Id. The Proclamation states, with \n51\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 54 of 116\nneither citation nor further detail, that immigrants are “about three times more likely than United \nStates Citizens to lack health insurance.”  Id.\n134. Purporting to exercise the President’s power under 8 U.S.C. §1182(f), the \nProclamation declares that the entry “as immigrants of aliens who will financially burden the \nUnited States” would “be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”  Id. The \nProclamation requires that this assessment be conducted separately and independently of any \nother determination of admissibility.  Id.\n135. The Proclamation defines immigrants as financially burdensome unless \nthe intending immigrant eitherhas “approved health insurance,” as defined in the Proclamation, \nwithin 30 days of arriving in the United States or “financial resources to pay for reasonably \nforeseeable medical costs.”  \n136. The Proclamation expressly excludes Medicaid from the definition of\n“approved health insurance” for any person over 18 years old and identifies nine forms of \ncoverage that it deems to be “approved health insurance.”  84 Fed. Reg. 53,992 §3. The entirety \nof that list includes:\n(i) An employer-sponsored plan;\n(ii) An unsubsidizedhealth plan offered in the individual market \nwithin a State;\n(iii) A short-term limited duration health policy effective for a \nminimum of 364 days—or until the beginning of planned, \nextended travel outside the United States;\n(iv) A catastrophic plan;\n(v) A family member’s plan;\n(vi) A medical plan under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, \nincluding coverage under the TRICARE program;\n52\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 55 of 116\n(vii) A visitor health insurance plan that provides adequate coverage for \nmedical care for a minimum of 364 days—or until the beginning of \nplanned, extended travel outside the United States;\n(viii) A medical plan under the Medicare program; or\n(ix) Any other health plan that provides adequate coverage for medical \ncare as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nor his designee.\n137. The Proclamation provides neither definition nor citation for any of the \nterms and offers no standards by which to determine what falls within those phrases.  \n138. Limited classes of immigrants are excluded from the Proclamation’s\nrestriction.47 The largest of these classes include lawful permanent residents, certain special \nimmigrant visa holders, children of United States citizens, people seeking admission as asylees \nor refugees, and people subject to either withholding of removal, the Convention Against Torture \nand OtherCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”).  See id.\n139. The Proclamation vests the Secretary of State with the ability to “establish \nstandards and procedures” for determining admissibility under the Proclamation; to determine in \nconsultationwith the Attorney General whether an intending immigrant’s entry furthers “United \nStates law enforcement objectives”; and to determine whether an intending immigrant’s entry is \nin the “national interest.”  Id.\n47 Exclusions include: lawful permanent residents, asylees, refugees, individuals subject to withholding of \nremoval, and individuals protected under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (“CAT”), people holding valid immigrant visas predating the \nProclamation, nationals of Afghanistan or Iraq, or their children, seeking entry pursuant to SI or SQ Special \nImmigrant Visas; children of U.S. citizens seeking to enter pursuant to IR-2, IR-3, IR-4, IH-3, or IH-4 visas; \npeople seeking to enter the United States pursuant to an IR-5 visa whose sponsors demonstrate that the \napplicants healthcare will not “impose a substantial burden on the United States Healthcare system”;people \nseeking to enter on SB-1 visas; children other than those accompanying parents subject to the Proclamation; \npeople whose immigration would “further important United States law enforcement objectives”;and people \nwhose “entry would be in the national interest.”84 Fed. Reg. 53,992-3§2.\n53\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 56 of 116\n140. The Proclamation does not purport to provide an end date, instead calling \nfor the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \nHomeland Security and the “heads of other appropriate agencies” to submit a report within 180 \ndays regarding “the continued necessity of and any adjustments that may be warranted to the \nsuspensions.”  Id. Thus, although it purports to be a “suspension,” it is in fact an open-ended \nban. \n141. The Secretary of State is required to submit the report annually after the \nfirst production and is directed to immediately advise the President if the Secretary determines \nthat circumstances no longer warrant the suspension.  Id.\n(ii) Agency Implementation of the Proclamation\n142. The Proclamation was scheduled to take effect on November 3, 2019.  Id.\nIn the interim, DOS tookat least threesteps towards implementing the Proclamationas part of \nthe Proclamation Implementing Actions.\n143. First, on October 24, 2019, the DOS published a “60-Day Notice of \nProposed Information Collection: Public Charge Questionnaire” proposing to adopt a new form, \nDS-5540.  60-Day Notice of Proposed Information Collection: Public Charge Questionnaire, 84 \nFed. Reg.57,142 (Oct. 24, 2019). \n144. Proposed form DS-5540 is entitled “Public Charge Questionnaire” and is \nprimarily focused on implementing the IFR.  However, the first substantive questions on the DS-\n5540 ask whether the applicant has health insurance currently, will have such insurance within \n30 days of entering the United States, and what the specific plan and coverage date are, if \napplicable. Id.\n54\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 57 of 116\n145. Second, on October 29, 2019, DOS published a “Notice of Information \nCollection” for “Emergency Review” (“The Emergency Notice”), referring to Form “DS-5541\n(oral information collection).”  Notice of Information Collection Under OMB Emergency\nReview: Immigrant Health Insurance Coverage, 84 Fed. Reg. 58,199 (Oct. 30, 2019).  In the \nEmergency Notice, the Department of State claimed that “emergency review” of the proposed \ninformation collection was “necessary for the Department to prepare consular officers to \nimplement” the Proclamation.  Id. \n146. The Emergency Notice went on to specify the methodology by which the \nProclamation would be implemented.  Specifically, the Emergency Notice indicated that \nconsular officers “will verbally ask” immigrants subject to the Proclamation “whether they will \nbe covered by health insurance in the United States within 30 days of entry to the United States \nand, if so, for details relating to such insurance.”  Id.\n147. Where an applicant answered in the affirmative, the Emergency Notice \nfurther required that consular officers to request that the applicant identify the plan and coverage \nbeginning date and any other information that the officer deemed necessary.  Id.\n148. The Emergency Notice purported to explain what “reasonably foreseeable \nmedical expenses” included, defining those only as “expenses related to existing medical \nconditions, relating to health issues existing at the time of visa adjudication.”  Id. The \nEmergency Notice provided no further explanation.\n149. The Emergency Notice established a comment period terminating \nNovember 1, 2019, fewer than 48 hours after the Notice’s publication.  Id. Such a comment \nperiod is plainly illusory.\n55\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 58 of 116\n150. Third, DOS has issued implementation materials for consular officials, \nincluding All Diplomatic and Consular Posts Collective messages (“ALDACs”; question-and-\nanswer documents, and presentations).  These DOS materials mandate how the consular officers \nwill implement the Proclamation, including providing definitions to ambiguous terms.\n151. For example, in an ALDAC dated October 30, 2019, DOS provided \nnarrow examples of when a person’s entry would be “in the national interest” and directed \nofficers to contact the Department for approval of an exemption if they believed one of the \nnarrow exceptions applied.\n152. Underscoring the mandatory nature, the ALDAC specifically directs \nconsular officers not to implement the Proclamation prior to updates to corresponding updates to \nthe FAM—in effect overriding the Proclamation’s stated effective date.\n153. DOS did not engage in any notice and comment procedures despite \nnarrowing the ability of individuals to access entry into the United States.  DOS’last minute and \nslipshod efforts to implement the Proclamation confirm media reports that government officials \nwere scrambling to implement and enforce it by the effective date.  On information and belief, \nand in light of the directives of the Proclamation, these efforts necessarily include DOS and HHS \nofficials.48\n(iii) The Case in the U.S. District Court of Oregon\n154. On October 30, 2019, a coalition of civil rights organizations brought a\n48 Dan Diamond, Health officials: Trump immigration order could be illegal, Politico (Oct. 11, 2019), available at\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/11/trump-immigrants-health-insurance-illegal-044716 (“HHS will \ncontinue to work with the State Department to implement the president’s proclamation,” a spokesperson said.)\n56\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 59 of 116\nclass action lawsuit challenging the Proclamation only in the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Oregon (“the Oregon Proclamation Challenge”).  On November 2, 2019, the district court \ngranted the plaintiffs’motion for an emergency temporary restraining order, and issued a 28-day \ntemporary restraining order, barring the Government from implementing the Proclamation.  Doe \n#1 v.Trump, No. 3:19-CV-01743-SB, _ F. Supp. 3d _, 2019 WL 5685204 (D. Ore. Nov. 2, \n2019).  On November 26, 2019, the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the \nProclamation.\nIII. The Consular Rules Stand in Stark Opposition to the \nConsistent Historic Interpretation of the INA’s Public Charge Provisions \n155. The Consular Rules are inconsistent with the language of the INA and \nmore than a century of judicial precedent and administrative practice.  As Judge Daniels found in \nenjoining the DHS Rule, “the plain language in the INA, the history and common-law meaning \nof ‘public charge,’ agency interpretation, and Congress’s repeated reenactment of the INA’s\npublic charge provision without material change” demonstrated that the new definition proposed \nby the Trump Administration’s proposed definition represents a fundamental departure from the \n“long-standing definition” of “public charge.”  See Make the Road New York v.Cuccinelli, No.\n19 Civ. 7993, 2019 WL 5484638, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019).\n156. Since the “public charge” inadmissibility provision became part of federal \nimmigration law in 1882, courts and administrative agencies have consistently interpreted the \nterm “public charge” to refer to noncitizens who rely primarily on the government for \nsubsistence.  Congress has repeatedly considered and rejected efforts to expand the definition of \npublic charge in a manner similar to the definition in the adopted by the Consular Rules.\n57\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 60 of 116\nA. The Original Meaning of “Public Charge” Referred to A Narrow Class of \nPersons Wholly Unable to Care for Themselves\n157. The term “public charge” first appeared in federal immigration law in the \nImmigration Act of 1882, which provided that “any person unable to take care of himself or \nherself without becoming a public charge” could be denied admission to the United States.  22 \nStat. 214, §2.  Later bills changed the wording of the clause to “likely to become a public \ncharge,” and that language has been retained in the statute to the present.49\n158. While the 1882 Act and its successors did not define the term “public \ncharge,” Congress considered the phrase to refer to those who were likely to become long-term \nresidents of “poor-houses and alms-houses”—i.e., persons who were institutionalized and wholly \ndependent on the government for subsistence.  13 Cong. Rec. 5109 (June 19, 1882).  The state \nstatutes from which the 1882 Act is derived used the term “public charge” to refer to residents of \npublic institutions for the destitute, such as almshouses and workhouses.50\n159. Early judicial interpretations of the original public charge provisions \nconfirmed that Congress did not intend the public charge exclusion to apply broadly to any \nnoncitizens who relied on any modicum of outside assistance.  The Second Circuit, for instance, \nwas “convinced that Congress meant [by public charge] to exclude persons who were likely to \nbecome occupants of almshouses for want of means to support themselves in the future.”  Howe \nv.United States ex rel. Savitsky, 247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917).   \n49 E.g., 1891 Immigration Act, 26 Stat. 1084 §1; Immigration Act of 1903, 32 Stat. 1213, 1214 §2 (excluding \nfrom the United States “persons likely to become a public charge,” among others); Immigration Act of 1917, 39 \nStat. 874, 876 (same); Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 183 (1952) (excluding \nnoncitizens “who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of \nthe Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges”).\n50 SeeHidetaka Hirota, Expelling the Poor180–204 (2017).\n58\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 61 of 116\n160. Consistent with this narrow understanding of public charge, federal \nimmigration officials in the early 20th century excluded only a minuscule percentage of arriving \nimmigrants on public charge grounds.  According to DHS’s own data, of the approximately 21.8 \nmillion immigrants admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents between 1892 \nand 1930, approximately 205,000—less than one percent—were deemed inadmissible as likely \nto become public charges.  More recently, between 1931 and 1980, only 13,798 immigrants were \nexcluded on public charge grounds out of more than 11 million immigrants admitted as lawful \npermanent residents—an exclusion rate of approximately one-tenth of one percent.51\nB. Administrative Decisions Affirm the Original\nUnderstanding of Public Charge\n161. Decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals (the “BIA”) and the \nAttorney General in the mid-twentieth century narrowly limited the circumstances in which an \nimmigrant could be deported or denied admissionor adjustment of status on public charge \ngrounds.  BIA decisions have “clarified . . . that receipt of welfare would not, alone, lead to a\nfinding of likelihood of becoming a public charge.”  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,125.\n162. In 1948, the BIA held that “acceptance by an alien of services provided by \na State... to its residents, services for which no specific charge is made, does not in and of itself \nmake the alien a public charge.”  Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323, 324 (B.I.A. 1948).  A \nnoncitizen was removable as a public charge only if (1) the noncitizen was “charged” for receipt \n51 See Table 1. Persons Obtaining Lawful Permanent Resident Status: Fiscal Years 1820 to 2016, Department of \nHomeland Security (Dec. 18, 2017), available at https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-\nstatistics/yearbook/2016/table1; Immigration and Naturalization Service, 2001 Statistical Yearbook of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service 258 (2003),available at\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Yearbook_Immigration_Statistics_2001.pdf; see alsoMae \nNgai, Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America18 (2004).  Similarly, during the \nGreat Depression, the INSdid not consider immigrants who were “victims ofthe general economic depression” \ndeportable simply because they received public relief.  Id. at 72.  \n59\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 62 of 116\nof a public benefit under the law, (2) a demand for payment was made, and (3)the noncitizen or \na family member failed to pay.  Id.at 326.  Matter of B-has remained the law for more than \nseventy years.52\n163. In 1952, four years after Matter of B-was decided, Congress reenacted the \npublic charge provision in the Immigrationand Nationality Act of 1952 (the “1952 Act”). See \n66 Stat. 163, 183. The Senate report accompanying the corresponding bill that became the 1952 \nAct carefully traced the administrative and court decisions interpreting the public charge \nprovisions of the Act, and proposed retaining the existing provisions without defining the term \n“public charge.”  S. Rep. No. 1515, at 348-49 (1950).\n164. These administrative decisions continue to reflect a narrow definition of \n“public charge” despite the increasingly broad array of public benefits that became available \nsince the 1882 Immigration Act.53\nC. Congress Repeatedly Rejected Efforts to Change\nExisting Law Regarding Public Charge Determinations\n165. More recently, Congress has repeatedly confirmed the public charge \nprovisions of the INA without material change.  First, Congress left the provisions virtually \nunchanged when passing the Immigration Act of 1990.  The legislative history ofthe 1990 Act \nrecognized that something more than mere receipt of benefits was required to label an immigrant \n52 The holding in Matter of B-that mere receipt of public benefits does not render a person a public charge has \nbeen applied in the context of admissibility as well as removal.  SeeMatter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. \n409 (B.I.A. 1962; A.G. 1964) (“the [INA] requires more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will \nrequire public support”); see also Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (B.I.A. 1974) (noncitizens’receipt \nof welfare is insufficient to establish that they are likely to become a public charge); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. \n& N. Dec. 583, 590 (1974) (outlining circumstances under which noncitizen found likely to become a public \ncharge).   \n53 Such public benefit programs include the Aid to Dependent Children program (1935), public housing (1937), \nfood stamps (1964), Medicaid (1965), Supplemental Security Income (1972), and Section 8 housing vouchers \n(1974).  \n60\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 63 of 116\nas a public charge.54 In the debate leading to enactment of the 1990 Act, one Congressman \ncharacterized someone who “would become a public charge” as a person “who gets here who is \nhelpless.”55\n166. In 1996, Congress passed two major pieces of legislation: the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA,” colloquially called the \n“Welfare Reform Act”) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n(“IIRIRA”).  Neither statute purported to alter the longstanding meaning of “public charge,” or \nthe types of benefits that would be relevant in such a determination. Although PRWORA \nrestricted access to federal benefits for certain immigrants, it retained eligibility for some \nimmigrants,and authorized states to cover a broader group of noncitizens in state or local public \nbenefits programs. 8 U.S.C. §1621(d). Subsequent legislation restored or expanded access to \nfederally-funded government benefits for many immigrants.56 Congress plainly concluded that\n54 A 1988 House Report explained that courts associated the likelihood of becoming a public charge with \n“destitution coupled with an inability to work,” and noted the Supreme Court’s finding in 1915 that a person \ndeemed likely to become a public charge “is one whose anticipated dependence on public aid is primarily due to \npoverty and to physical or mental afflictions.” H. Report Series 7, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., at 121 (Sept. 1988) \n(citing Gegiow v.Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 (1915)).\n55 135 Cong. Rec. S14,291 (July 12, 1989) (statement of Mr. Simpson).\n56 In legislation following enactment of PRWORA, Congress expanded the availability of certain benefits, \nparticularly SNAP and Medicaid, to qualified immigrants.  See Agricultural Research, Education and Extension \nAct of 1998 (AREERA), Pub. L. No. 105-185 (1998)(restoring eligibility for certain elderly, disabled,and child \nimmigrants who resided in the United States when PRWORA was enacted); The Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-171 (2002)(restoring eligibility for food stamps (now SNAP) to \nqualified immigrant adults who have been in the United States at least five years, and immigrants receiving \ncertain disability payments and for children, regardless of how long they have been in the country); Children’s\nHealth Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), Pub. L. No. 111-3 (2009) (providing an option for \nstates to cover lawfully present immigrant children and pregnant women, regardless of their date of entry into \nthe U.S., under the federal Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) matching programs). \n61\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 64 of 116\nrestoring access to benefits for immigrants would serve important policy goals and would not \nrequire a change in public charge policy.57\n167. Nothing in PRWORA purported to change the meaning of “public charge” \nor to overturn its longstanding administrative application.  Nor was this accidental.  If Congress \nhad wanted to change the settled interpretation to include receipt of minimal amounts of non-\ncash benefits, it could have doneso as part of PRWORA. Congress declined to do so.  \n168. In addition, IIRIRA—which was passed the month after PRWORA—\ncodified the existing standard for determining whether a noncitizen was inadmissible as a public \ncharge.  Pub. L. No. 104-208 §531, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (amending 8 U.S.C. §1182). Nothing \nin the final passage of IIRIRA purported to expand the definition of public charge, or reflected \nan intent by Congress to use the public charge provision to refuse admission or status adjustment \nbased upon past or likely future receipt of supplemental or noncash public benefits.\n169. In fact, in the debate leading up to the enactment of IIRIRA, Congress \nspecifically considered and rejected a proposal to label as a public charge anyone who received \ncertain means-tested public benefits,including Aid to Families with Dependent Children, \nMedicaid, food stamps, SSI, and other programs “for which eligibility for benefits is based on \nneed.”  Immigration Control &Financial Responsibility Act of 1996,H.R. 2202, 104th Cong. \n§202 (1996).  The express purpose of this proposed provision was to overturn the settled \n57 In the analysis of comments published along with the final DHS Rule, on which the IFR is modeled, DHS \nconcededthat PRWORA’s policy statements about self-sufficiency were not codified in the INA, including in \nthe public charge inadmissibility provision, which makes no mention of “self-sufficiency.”  See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n41,355–56 (“although the INA does not mention self-sufficiency in the context of section 212(a)(4) of the Act, \n8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), DHS believes that there is a strong connection between the self-sufficiency policy \nstatements [in PRWORA] (even if not codified in the INA itself) at 8 U.S.C. 1601 and the public charge \ninadmissibility language in section 212(a)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), which were enacted within a \nmonth of each other.”).   \n62\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 65 of 116\nunderstanding of “public charge” found in the case law.  When the bill was considered by the \nSenate, Senator Alan Simpson (a proponent of the provision) explained during debate that the \npurpose of the new public charge definition was to override “a 1948 decision by an \nadministrative law judge”—Matter of B-, discussed supra ¶¶162-4. See 142 Cong. Rec. S4401, \nS4408–09(1996).  \n170. The effort to overturn Matter of B-and change the settled definition of \npublic charge was met with substantial criticism.  For example, Senator Patrick Leahy expressed \nconcern that the bill “is too quick to label people as public charges for utilizing the same public \nassistance that many Americans need to get on their feet.”  S. Rep. No. 104-249, at 63(1996).\nSenator Leahy was “disturbed that the[proposed expanded] definition of public charge goes too \nfar in including a vast array of programs none of us think of as welfare,” including medical \nservices and supplemental nutritional programs and urged that the bill “will yield harsh and \nidiosyncratic results that no one should intend.”  Id.at 64.\n171. The effort to redefine the public charge in IIRIRA thus failed.  Although a \nversion of the bill including the expansive definition of public charge cleared one chamber of \nCongress, the bill could not be passed until the provision was removed.  In a statement on the \nSenate floor the day IIRIRA was enacted, Senator Jon Kyl, a floor manager of the bill and \nproponent of the provision, explained: \n[I]n  order  to  ensure  passage  of  this  historic  immigration  measure, \nimportant provisions of title 5 have been deleted .. ..  [One] provision that \nwas removed from title 5 would have clarified the definition of “public \ncharge.” Under the House-passed conference report, an immigrant could \nbe deported—but would not necessarily be deported—if he or she received \nFederal public benefits for an aggregate of 12 months over a period of 7 \nyears. That provision was dropped during Saturday’s negotiations.\n142 Cong. Rec. S11872, S11882 (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n63\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 66 of 116\n172. IIRIRAthus specifically rejected this redefinition of “public charge,”and \ncodifiedthe longstanding INA public charge policy relating to admission and status adjustment.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(4).  \n173. In 2013, Congress again turned back efforts to redefine public charge to \ninclude anyone receiving means-tested public benefits when the Senate debated the proposed \nBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, a bill that sought \nto create a path to citizenship fornoncitizens who could show they were not “likely to become a \npublic charge.”  S. 744, 113th Cong. §2101 (2013).  During committee deliberations, Senator \nJeff Sessions sought to amend the definition of public charge to include receipt of “noncash \nemployment supports such as Medicaid, the SNAP program, or the Children’s Health Insurance \nProgram.”  S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013).  The proposed amendment was rejected by voice \nvote.  Id.\n174. In short, Congress has repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the definition \nof public charge along the lines now proposed by DOS.  In so doing, it has demonstrated its clear \nintent to continue to apply the historical definition of public charge that has endured for over 140\nyears.\n175. Moreover, and in contrast to those efforts that wererepeatedly rejected, in\nlegislation following enactment of PRWORA, Congress significantlyexpanded the availability \nof certain means-tested benefits, particularly SNAP and Medicaid, to qualified immigrants,\nincluding under CHIPRA and the ACA. The ACA, enacted by Congress in 2010, explicitly \nsought to increase access to affordablehealth coverage for millions of people and significantly \nreduced the number of uninsured individuals in the United States. Pub. L. 111-148 (Mar. 23, \n2010) (initially titled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by \n64\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 67 of 116\nthe Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“HCERA”) (together, the “Affordable Care \nAct” or “ACA”) 124 Stat. 119.  With over 10 titles and at over 900 pages, the ACA authorized \nthe creation of local, state-based markets or “health exchanges” to provide an array of affordable \ninsurance coverage options for consumers, including state-run-exchanges, a federally facilitated \nexchange available at the healthcare.gov website, or a combination of both.  Seesupra ¶¶121-23\n(describing health exchange and available products in New York State).\n176. To purchase health insurance through an ACA exchange, a person must \nprove that they: (1) reside in a U.S. state or territory; and (2) are “lawfully present.” 42 U.S.C. \n§18032(f)(1)(A)(ii); 45 C.F.R. § 155.305(a)(1)-(3).  For those purchasing health insurance \nthrough the ACA’s exchanges, Congress also provided premium tax credits to help offset the \ncost of insurance, 26 U.S.C. § 36B, and to lower individuals’out-of-pocket costs by requiring \ninsurers to provide cost sharing reductions for copayments (for medical visits and prescription \ndrugs), coinsurance, and deductibles. 42 U.S.C. § 18071.  In October 2017, however, the Trump \nadministration discontinuedreimbursements toinsurers for those cost-sharing reduction \npayments.58 On the ACA’s sliding scale, applicants with incomes up to 400percent of the \nfederal poverty line qualify for a tax credit.  See 26 U.S.C. § 36B(b)(3)(A)(i). Congress\nspecificallyextended those tax credits to any taxpayer who is “lawfully present in the United \nStates”and “has a household income which is not greater than 100 percent of . . . the poverty line \nfor a family of the size involved.” Id. at § 36B(c)(1)(B). The ACA thus expressly provides \n58 SeeTrump Administration Takes Action to Abide by the Law and Constitution, Discontinue GSR Payments,\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Oct. 12, 2017), available at \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/12/trump-administration-takes-action-abide-law-constitution-\ndiscontinue-csr-payments.html.\n65\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 68 of 116\navenues for lawfully present immigrants to purchase health insurance through the exchanges and \nto receive premium tax credits for which they qualify. Id.\n177. Congress not only explicitly increased and expanded access to health care \nunder the ACA, but also designed the ACA to ensure an essential standard of care in the \nprovision of health coverage in the U.S., requiring all health insurers to offer a selection of plans \nthat cover “essential health benefits.”  These benefits include coverage for the following: \nhospitalization, prescription drugs, mental health services, ambulatory patient services, maternity \nand newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive and wellness \nservices, and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.  42 U.S.C. § 18022(b)(1).  All \nindividual market plans, including ACA-defined and regulated catastrophic health plans,59 must \nprovide such essential health benefits, cover preexisting conditions, and may not impose annual \nor lifetime dollar limits on essential coverage.  \n178. Rather than penalize immigrants for their use of means-tested public \nbenefits, since 1996 Congress has affirmatively, explicitly, and deliberately decided toprovide \nimmigrants with access to public benefits,and expanded further access to affordable and \ncomprehensive health insurance, including for pre-existing conditions, in the ACA.  \nD. Administrative Field Guidance Reaffirms the\nSettled Interpretation of Public Charge\n179. Administrative guidance over the years has also reaffirmed the settled \ninterpretation of “public charge.”  For instance, in 1999,the INS issued its Field Guidance \nregarding public charge inadmissibility, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689 (May 26, 1999), and a parallel \n59 Short-term limited duration insurance (“STLDI”) plans, plans that insurers remain permitted incertain states to \nsell in addition to essential health plans, are exempt from the mandates of the ACA and cannot beoffered or \npurchased on ACA exchanges; STLDIplans are thus non-comprehensive and do not provide the fullscope of \nessential health benefits, and they can and often do denycoverage based on pre-existing conditions.\n66\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 69 of 116\nproposed regulation, 64 Fed. Reg. at 28,676 (May 26, 1999).  The Field Guidance specifically \nexcluded from public charge determinations consideration of noncash benefits programs, such as \nMedicaid, SNAP, and housing assistance.  \n180. The Field Guidance defined “public charge” as a noncitizen “who is likely \nto become (for admission/adjustment purposes) ‘primarilydependent on the government for \nsubsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income \nmaintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.’” Id.at \n28,689. The Field Guidance expressly excluded from public charge determinations \nconsideration of noncash benefits programs, such as  Medicaid, SNAP, and housing assistance.  \nId. (emphasis added).60 INS explained that “[i]t has neverbeen [INS] policy that any receipt of \nservices or benefits paid for in whole or in part from public funds renders an alien a public \ncharge, or indicates that the alien is likely to become a public charge.”  Id. at 28,692.    \n181. In identifying only primary dependence on monthly cash assistance for \nincome maintenance purposes as a trigger for the public charge determination, the Field \nGuidance made expectations clear both to applicants for adjustment and admission and to \nimmigration officers tasked with implementing it.  Indeed, the Field Guidance has been in effect \ncontinuously in the 20 years since it was adopted.  During that time, consistent with the Field \n60 INS further concluded that noncash benefit programs should not be considered in public charge determinations \nbecause benefits under such programs “are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone or in combination, \nprovide sufficient resources to support an individual or family.”  Id.at 28,692.  It explained that such benefits \n“are increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, reflecting broad \npublic policy decisionsabout improving general health and nutrition, promoting education, and assisting \nworking-poor families in the process of becoming self-sufficient.” Id. INS also emphasized that it did not \nexpect this definition “to substantially change the number of aliens who will be found deportable or \ninadmissible as public charges.”  Id.\n67\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 70 of 116\nGuidance and longstanding agency interpretation, the number of noncitizens excluded as likely \nto become a public charge has remained small.   \nARGUMENT\nI. The IFR, the FAM Revisions and Proclamation Implementing Actions Violate the \nAdministrative Procedure Act\n182. The Consular Rules, taken together and separately, violate the APA in \nseveral respects, including that they are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, [and] \notherwise not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), “contrary to constitutional right,” \nid. §706(2)(B), and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” id.\n§706(2)(C).\nA. The IFR and FAM Revisions are Contrary to Law\n183. As an initial matter, the IFR and FAM Revisions, alone and together, are \ncontrary to law in numerous respects.  \n(i) The IFR’s Definition of “Public Charge”\nIs Contrary to the INA Definition\n184. As discussed above, the IFR’s definition of “public charge” as an \nindividual who may at some time in the future receive a minimal amount of noncash public \nbenefits is contrary to the interpretation of “public charge” that has endured for 130 years:  an \nindividual primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  The statutory meaning of the \nterm “public charge” is evident from, among other things, and as demonstrated above: (i) the \nplain meaning of the phrase, (ii)the judicial and administrative interpretation of the term since it \nfirst became part of federal immigration law; (iii) Congress’approval of that interpretation in \nrepeatedly reenacting the statute; and (iv)Congress’rejection of efforts to expand that \ninterpretation in the manner the IFR now seeks to accomplish.  \n68\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 71 of 116\n185. Accordingly, the IFR is not in accordance with the law and is in excess of \nDOS’statutory jurisdiction.  5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), 706(2)(C).  Further, even without expressly \ndefining “public charge” in contravention of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), the FAM Revisions\nimplement the public charge provision to deny admission to intending immigrants based on an \noverbroad, erroneous interpretation inconsistent with the INA.\n(ii) The Proclamation Implementing Actions Are Contrary to the INA \nand the INA’s “Public Charge” Definition,and other Federal Statutes\n186. The Proclamation is to be implemented by the Secretary of State, who is \npermitted to establish standards and procedures governing determinations of “who should be \nbarred from the United States due to failing to meet the Proclamation’s requirements.” 84 Fed. \nReg. at 53,993, §3. In implementing the Proclamation’s dictates through agency guidelines, \nDOS acts contrary to the INA. \n187. This is so because the Proclamation itself conflicts directly with the \nstatutory text of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) of the INA.  The Proclamation, and the implementing \nactions, effectively erase the statutorily mandated “totality of the circumstances” evaluation\nunder the INA, excluding all of the other statutorily mandated factors andsubstituting the \nstatutory test with one sole factor as dispositive: the financial ability to buy health insurance or to \nabsorb foreseeable medical costs, to justify denial of admission. \n188. The Proclamation also contravenes the ACA and CHIPRA, because both\nstatutes authorize and attempt to encourageimmigrant families’access to public benefits and \nhealth care that the Proclamation would now categorically exclude. Both of these statutes \nexpress and reflect Congress’clear intent to expand access to meaningful and affordable health \ninsurance coverage to immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States, along with U.S. \n69\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 72 of 116\ncitizens, at a certain guaranteed level of comprehensive coverage.  Where the Proclamation \ndenies admission to all immigrants who are unable either to purchase the listed health insurance \nplans or who cannot pass a vague and undefined “wealth test” that condemns applicants who \nwould otherwise be eligible to enter the United States and receive health insurance benefits like \nMedicaid, CHIP, or financial assistance under the ACA to a category “detrimental to the United \nStates”—the Proclamation expressly contravenes acts of Congress, and is contrary to law.\n(iii) The IFR, the FAM Revisions, and the Proclamation Implementing \nActions Discriminate Against People with Disabilities and Violate the \nRehabilitation Act\n189. The Consular Rules discriminate against people with disabilities in \nviolation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), Pub L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. \n355. The IFR and the FAM Revisions do so by expressly treating disability as a negative\nfactor—indeed, as multiple negative factors—in making public charge determinations. The \nProclamation does so by requiring intending immigrants, who are unlikely to be able to purchase \nany “approved” health insurance plan,todemonstrate ability to absorb privately the foreseeable \ncosts of medical care, which for a person with, for example, HIV, diabetes, or mobility \nimpairment, can be prohibitive for all but the wealthiest. The Consular Rules thus conflict with \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination . . . \nunder any program or activity conducted by an Executive agency.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n70\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 73 of 116\n190. As a program or activity conducted by DOS, public charge determinations \nare subject to the Rehabilitation Act.61 DOS regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act \nprohibit the agency from denying a benefit or service “on the basis of handicap.”  22 C.F.R. \n§142.4(b)(1).These provisions provide further that the agency may not “utilize criteria or methods \nof administration” that would: “(i)have the effect of subjectingqualified handicapper persons to \ndiscrimination on the basis of handicap”; or “(ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or \nsubstantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the [agency’s] program or activity \nwith respect to handicapped persons.”  Id.§142(b)(4).\n191. The IFR and the FAM Revisionsviolate the Rehabilitation Act and the \nimplementing regulations by creating a new discriminatory scheme that is triggered by disability.\n192. First, the IFR imposes a negative “health” factor based on disability alone, \nproviding that “diagnos[is] with a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical care \nor institutionalization, or that will interfere with the alien’s ability to provide and care for himself \nor herself, to attend school, or to work,” with nothing more, is treated as a negative factor.  See84\nFed. Reg. at 55,012(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)(2)).\n193. Second, the IFR imposes an additional heavily weightednegative factor for\napplicants who (a) have a medical condition that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or \ninstitutionalization or that will interfere with their ability to provide for himself or herself, attend \nschool, or work; and (b) are uninsured and have neither the prospect of obtaining private health \n61 SeeDawn E. Johnsen, Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, Letter Opinion for the General Counsel \nImmigration and Naturalization Service(Apr. 18, 1997);Robert B. Shanks,Memorandum Re: Section504ofthe\nRehabilitationActof1973(Feb.2,1983).\n71\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 74 of 116\ninsurance, nor the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to \nsuch medical condition.  See84 Fed. Reg. at 55,013(proposed 22 C.F.R. §40.41(a)(8)(i)(C)).  \n194. The IFR thus takes a single characteristic common to individuals with \ndisabilities—a chronic health condition—and counts it as a negative factor twicein the totality of \nthe circumstances analysis: once as a negative factor relating to “health,” and once as an \nindependent “heavily-weighted negative factor” relatingto health and financial resources.  DOS\nprovides no explanation to justify this double-counting, which results in disproportionally \npunishing individuals with disabilities.  In the DHS Rule, on which the IFR is modeled, DHS \naffirmatively“acknowledges that multiple factors may coincide or relate to each other,” and makes \nno effort to explain or justify its conclusory denial that it is “impermissibly counting factors twice.”\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,407. DOS does not provide any justification or explanation for its similar use of \nduplicative factors.\n195. The Proclamation Implementing Actions take the discriminatory approach \nto immigrants with disabilities one step further. Rather than weighting various factors, they\nimpose just one requirement: the possession of an approved private health insurance plan or \nenough wealth to cover foreseeable medical costs.\n196. Requiring immigrants with disabilities to demonstrate greater financial \nresources to cover chronic health conditions and disabilities than immigrants without disabilities \nis discriminatory on its face, and unlawful under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and DOS \nregulations implementing the Act.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 22 C.F.R. §§ 1142.4(b)(1), (b)(4).62\n62 See generally,David A. Super, Professor of Law, Georgetown Law School (Oct. 31, 2019), Comment, \nInformation Collection Burden Assessment DS-5541--Public Notice: 10934 84 Fed. Reg. 58,199 (Oct. 30, \n2019) at 6-7,available at https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOS-2019-0039-0190.\n72\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 75 of 116\n197. The Proclamation Implementing Actions also contravene the anti-\ndiscrimination mandates of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to the extent theydeny\nadmission to individuals who will use non-private ACA-approved health exchange plans such as \nNew York State of Health’s Essential Plan, which covers pre-existing conditions, including \ndisabilities recognized under Section 504, and to the extent the Proclamation Implementing \nActions encourage the use ofshort term limited duration insurance (“STLDI”)or visitor plans,\nwhich are exempt from the ACA mandate prohibiting discriminatory coverage exclusions for \npre-existing conditions.  The Proclamation Implementing Actions fail to address how they\nconflict with Section 504, as well as how theyeffectively discriminate against and increases \nlimitations on immigrants with disabilities, including immigrants with HIV/AIDS.63\n198. The IFR, the FAM Revisions,and the Proclamation Implementing Actions\nare thus arbitrary and capricious because they discriminate against people with disabilities in \ncontravention of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\nB. The IFR, FAM Revisions and Proclamation Implementing\nActions are Arbitrary and Capricious\n199. The Consular Rules are complex, confusingand internally inconsistent, \nand invite arbitrary enforcement.  They transform the process for determining public charge \nthrough a series of changes both to the benefits considered relevant to the public charge \n63 In discouraging the use of the NY Essential Plan and other ACA Plans, and encouraging the use of STLDI and \nvisitor plans which exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage, or otherwise requiring an immigrant with \nHIV/AIDS demonstrate more independent financial resources to cover foreseeable medical costs via high-\ndeductible catastrophic or private health insurance than someone without HIV/AIDS, the Proclamation also \nfunctionally discriminates against immigrants with HIV/AIDS as a pre-existing health condition, and conflicts \nwith the explicit repeal of the 22-year travel restriction on the immigration of individuals with HIV/AIDS \nsigned into lawby President Obama in 2010. See MedicalExaminationofAliens—RemovalofHuman\nimmunodeficiencyvirus(HIV)infectionfromdefinitionofcommunicablediseaseofpublichealthsignificance.\nFinalrule.74Fed.Reg.56,547(Nov.2,2009),(codifiedat42C.F.R.§34.)\n73\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 76 of 116\ndetermination, and to the assessment and “weighting” of other qualities.  The IFR and FAM \nRevisions and the many internal inconsistencies within them fail to give applicants notice of \nconduct to avoid, and fail to provide adjudicators with clear guidelines to apply.\n200. These vague, broad, and standardless factors make it impossible for \nconsular officers to administer the IFR and the FAM Revisions in an objective and consistent \nmanner, or for applicants to predict how they will be applied.  \n201. For example, since the FAM Revisions took effect, consular officers in the \nCiudad Juarez, Mexicoconsulaterefused applicants who have submitted Affidavits of Support \nfrom co-sponsors that meet the income requirements where the co-sponsors are not family \nmembers or do not reside with the applicant.  Such arbitrary, unlawful implementation is invited \nby vagueness of the FAM Revisions, and makes it very difficult for visa applicants to prepare a \nsuccessful application.  \n202. Other vague factors also invite arbitrary enforcement of the Consular \nRules.  For example, the English proficiency factor in the IFR—which comes with no standard\nfor “proficiency” to guide either the applicant or the immigration officer—may be applied by \neach officer in a different way depending on the officer’s own language comprehension skills or \nthe officer’s ability to understand a non-U.S. accent. \n203. The healthinsurance factors are similarly confusing. The IFR specifically \nstates that, if an applicant has a medical condition that is likely to require extensive treatment, an \nimmigration officer should consider whether the applicant can pay for reasonably foreseeable \nmedical costs throughprivatehealth insurance.  84 Fed. Reg. at 55,013(proposed 22 C.F.R. \n§40.41(a)(8)(i)(C)).  It is unclear how consular officers, untrained in medical care or the \ncomplexities of the health care system, can make such a determination.\n74\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 77 of 116\n204. The agency action implementing the Proclamation was equally arbitrary \nand capricious.  The DOS has, as alleged above, propounded a new form DS-5540, and \npublished the Emergency Notice, DS-5541.  The Emergency Notice establishes no workable \nstandards for implementing the Proclamation.  It calls for the oral collection of information, no \nguidance to consular officers as to what constitutes “approved plans” under the Proclamation, \nvague guidance as to what constitutes “reasonably foreseeable medical expenses,” and, critically, \nfails to define “adequate coverage for medical care.”  The Proclamation provides that either the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services or his designee can determine that an unlisted plan \nsuffices if it “provides adequate coverage for medical care.”  The Proclamation does not define \nthis term and provides no guidance for consular officers or applicants, nor does the Emergency \nNotice. And HHS has failed to act to give DOS consular officers any notice.  As a result, it is a \nstandardless inquiry.  For example, it is unclear if a plan provides “adequate coverage” if it meets \nthe minimum requirements of the also-undefined “catastrophic coverage” or short-term limited \nduration insurance plans, or if it requires approximating the clearer, comprehensive coverage of \nan individual marketplace or Medicare plan.\nII. The Process for Promulgating the Consular Rules Blatantly\nViolated the Procedural Rules in theAdministrative Procedure Act\n205. The IFR, FAM Revisions and the Proclamation’s implementing \nregulations violate the APA because they were promulgated “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.”  5 U.S.C. §706(2)(D).  DOS’s haphazard processes for promulgating dramatic \nchanges to the immigration system were deficient because (a) DOS implemented the FAM \nRevisions and the IFR without opportunity for notice and comment, absent “good cause” \nrequired by the APA; (b) DOS issued notices instructing the public to provide comment on \n75\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 78 of 116\nimplementing regulations within a 48-hour period that utterly failed tocomport with notice and \ncomment requirements; (c) DOS is implementing the broad-ranging change wrought by the \nProclamation without opportunity for notice and comment; and (d) DOS failed to provide a \nreasoned explanation for changing policy direction from the 1999 Field Guidance.  \nA. The DOS Process for Promulgating the Consular Rules\nViolated Notice and Comment Requirements\n206. DHS, as part of its plan to rewrite the statutory provisions of the INA by \nagency action, published a notice of proposed rulemaking on October 10, 2018, inviting public \ncomments on its so-called “public charge” rule, over a 60-day period.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114.  \nInexplicably, and in stark contrast, DOS failed to do the samewith any of the Consular Rules.\nInstead, DOS promulgated the FAM Revisions with almost nonotice to the public, see supra \n¶¶83, 85, and,separately,when faced with a clear federal court decision that the Revisions \nrequired formal rulemaking, issued the IFR four days before it was to go into effect. And the \nEmergency Notice implementing the Proclamation arrived with an ad hoc 2-day comment \nperiod, while the directives transmitted to consular officers by State have undergone no \nrulemaking process.\n207. The process associated with the FAM Revisions is the very opposite of \nappropriate process under the APA.  Indeed, the FAM was posted in a bare (and incomplete) \nmemorandum on the DOS website with absolutely no notice or opportunity for comment.  It was \nthen, within weeks, withdrawn from the website.  DOS, outside of litigation, has never offered \nreasoned justification for the FAM Revisions, notwithstanding the fundamental change they \nwreak on the immigration system.  And, of course, DOS provided no opportunity for comment \non what is unquestionably a final agency action that imposes direct legal consequences on those \n76\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 79 of 116\naffected—and thus the kind of paradigmatic agency matter that should be subject to proper \nrulemaking.  No exceptions to notice and comment rulemaking apply to the FAM.\n208. The process leading to the IFR was no better.  DOS issued the IFR four \ndays before it was to go into effect and allowed no opportunity for public comment pre-\nimplementation. The IFR was thus issued without formal notice-and-comment rulemaking and \nwithout at least 30 days’ notice of its effective date,as typically required by the Administrative \nProcedure Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(d). And, as alleged above, in support of its conclusion that \nthe IFR fulfills the good cause exception to notice-and-comment procedures, Defendant DOS \nprovides only conclusorystatements of public harm created by self-inflicted exigency.  \n209. The DOS action implementing the Proclamation was likewise flawed.  \nSpecifically, DOS propounded an Emergency Notice that permitted less than forty-eight hours to \ncomment.  This is the barest and most pretextual nod to proper administrative process.  Given \nthat the Proclamation would effectively override not only the INA but the entire body of \nregulations implementing it, in favor of a single-issue dispositive test that could reduce \nimmigrationto the United States by two-thirds, DOS clearly failed to follow the APA in issuing \nit. \n210. Likewise, despite the mandatory nature of the guidance sent to consular \nofficials and the certainty that the guidance will shape the ability of immigrants to gain \nadmission to the United States, DOS has not engaged in any notice and comment process for the \nDOS implementation materials.\n77\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 80 of 116\nB. DOS Failed to Justify its Departure from the 1999\nField Guidance in issuing the IFR and the FAM Revisions\n211. DOS fails to provide a reasoned explanation for changing policy direction \nfrom the Field Guidance and promulgating the IFR for several reasons.  It provided no \nexplanation whatsoever for the FAM Revisions.\n212. At no point has DOS identified or discussed any problems with INS’s\nimplementation of the 1999Field Guidance, which has been in effect for over 20 years.  DOS \ndoes not suggest that the Field Guidance has been ineffective or difficult to administer, or that it \nhas had any adverse consequences, including to the American immigration system or to the \npublic.  DOS also fails to provides anyexamples of how the IFR’s goal of self-sufficiency has \nnot been served by the Field Guidance.  And the FAM Revisions arrived with no explanation at \nall. \n213. DOS fails to explain why its new definition of“public charge” better \nreflects congressional intent than the definition established in the Field Guidance.  DOS offers no \nevidence suggesting that INS misunderstoodCongress’intent when it issued the Field Guidance \nin 1999, or that Congress viewed the Field Guidance as inconsistent with its intent.  \n214. Likewise, DOS offers no reasoned explanation for why it is necessary or \nappropriate to redefine “public charge” to mean the receipt of even a minimal amount of \nsupplemental benefits available to working families at any time in the future.  \n215. DOS also offers no reasoned explanation for rejecting the expert views of \nagencies that administer the relevant public benefits that are reflected in the Field Guidance.  In \nissuing the Field Guidance, INS explained that its definition of public charge—and decision to \nexclude noncash benefits from consideration—reflected evidence and input it received after \n78\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 81 of 116\n“extensive consultation with” the agencies that administer such benefits.  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692.  \nThe IFR provides no such evidence of expert consultation, or any explanation for its \nabandonment of the “primary dependence” standard in the Field Guidance in favor of the \ndurational standard in the rule: likelihood of receipt of any enumerated benefits for 12 \ncumulative months in a 36-month period.  \n216. Nowhere does the IFR even acknowledge the ardent public concern about \nthe public health impacts of discouraging use of public benefits that characterized the discussion \nand formal comment on the DHS Rule in the months during which leaked versions and formal \nproposals spread fear in immigrant families who may have waited years to pursue their goals of \nestablishing family stability through LPR status or reunifying with relatives living abroad. Given \nthe voluminous evidence of the“chilling effects” of changes to the DHS Rule, DOS was on \nnotice that it would need to address the dramatic impacts the IFR will have on immigrant \ncommunities and public health more generally. \n217. Finally, DOS fails to address the legitimate reliance interests engendered \nby the Field Guidance.  The Field Guidance, and the long history of public charge on which it is \nbased, has permitted generations of immigrant families to build lives in the U.S. without fearing \nthat their choices, including whether to seek public benefits, may have a negative impact on their \nimmigration status (other than the choice to receive cash assistance or long-term institutional \ncare).  Likewise, sponsors have relied on the Field Guidance to decide that accessing \nsupplemental benefits like health insurance would not impact their ability to sponsor family \nmembers as long as they meet the incomerequirements, whereas the FAM Revisions now \npenalize such use retroactively.  U.S. immigration lawyers and advocates have likewise relied \nupon the simplicity and clarity of the Field Guidance to aid clients in making decisions about \n79\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 82 of 116\ntheir lives and the consequences of using public benefits. There is no evidence that DOS \nconsidered the existence of these reliance interests and how they might affect implementation of \nFAM Revisions and the IFR. \nIII. The IFR, the FAM Revisions, and the Proclamation Are Motivated by Animus \nAgainst Immigrants of Color and Will Have a Heavily Disparate Impact on \nNonwhite Immigrants\n218. The Trump Administration’s immigration policy has been characterized \nby consistently hostile regulatory and sub-regulatory actions justified by inflammatory, false, and \nracist rhetoric.  The changes the Administration has proposed and in many cases implemented to \nthe asylum system, to various deferred-action programs, and to the family-based immigration \nsystem represent not neutral policy choices, but rather a radical reimagining of the nation’s\nimmigration laws. The purpose and effects of this reimagining –often in clear violation of \nCongressional mandate – are to exclude from lawful status immigrants from predominately \nnonwhite countries.\n219. The changes to the public charge rules, as expressed through the Consular \nRules, as well as the now-blocked DHS Rule, originated in a “wish list” published in 2016 by \nCIS”), entitled“A Pen and a Phone: 79 immigration actions the next president can take,” which \nlists numerous proposals for limiting immigration of low-income people and asylum seekers \nfrom non-European countries.  Action #60 on this list urges the next president to “make use of \nthe public charge doctrine to reduce the number of welfare-dependent foreigners living in the \n80\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 83 of 116\nUnited States.”64 The Trump Administration adopted much of the wish list as policy guidance \nupon taking office. \n220. The stated rationale for the Consular Rules, and the now-blocked DHS \nRule—to ensure that immigrants are self-sufficient—is a pretext for discrimination against non-\nwealthy immigrants from predominately nonwhite countries, even those who are complying with \nthe country’s long-standing rules for obtaining lawful permanent residence.  None of these \ndiscriminatory new rules are tailored to serve any compelling government interest.\nA. Disparate Impacts of the Consular Rules\n221. Individually and together, the Consular Rules have and will have a \ndiscriminatory impact on people from poorer countries where most residents are persons of \ncolor, effectively creating a wealth test for entry into the United States. This wealth test will \nhave “racially disparate impacts, as people from countries with low incomes are \ndisproportionately people of color.” 65\n222. Following publication of the FAM Revisions, denials on public charge \ngrounds increased dramatically.  While DOS findings of inadmissibility on public charge \ngrounds totaled 1,033 in fiscal year 2016,12,973 initial public charge denials were issued in \n64 Center for Immigration Studies, A Pen and A Phone8 (Apr. 6, 2016),available at\nhttps://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/79-actions_1.pdf.\n65 Danilo Trisi, Administration’s Public Charge Rules Would Close the Door to U.S. to Immigrants Without \nSubstantial Means, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 2(November 11, 2019), available at \nhttps://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-11-19imm.pdf.\n81\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 84 of 116\nfiscal year 2018 –atwelve-foldincrease.66 The highest increases in denials fell on Mexican \napplicants.67\n223. The FAM Revisions, which have been in effect since January of 2018, \nhave already had a dramatic effect on immigrants from countries where the residents are \npredominately nonwhite, andthe denial rate of Mexicans,in particular, has skyrocketed. While \njust sevenMexican nationals were denied admission on public charge grounds in fiscal year \n2016,5,343Mexican nationals received initial denials on public charge grounds in the first ten \nmonths of fiscal year 2019.68 Intending immigrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti, and \nthe Dominican Republic also saw notable increases in findings of inadmissibility based on public \ncharge grounds.69 In contrast, there was no increase in visa denials for applicants from \npredominantly white countries, or the increase numbered in the single digits.70 See supra ¶¶84,\nn. 20.\n224. Similarly, the IFR, which codifies much of the FAM Revisions and is \nexplicitly meant to be consistent with the currently-enjoined DHS Rule, like that rule, will have a \ndramatically disparate impact on nonwhite immigrants.  For example, as the CBPP has \n66 SeeDOS tables linked to in Ted Hesson, Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State \nDepartment, Politico (Aug. 6, 2019), available at https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-\npoor-mexicans-trump-1637094.\n67 Seeid.\n68 SeeId.\n69 For instance, public charge denials for Pakistani national increased to 563 in the first ten months of 2019, from \njust two denials in fiscal year 2016.  Similarly, public charge denials for Bangladeshi nationals rocketed \nupwards to 1,262 in just the first ten months of fiscal year 2019, from 324 denials in fiscal year 2017.

The IFR’s requirement that applicants meet an unknown level of “English \nlanguage proficiency” will similarly favor immigrants from English speaking countries, which \nare disproportionately white.\n227.

The Proclamation’s rationale – concern for taxpayers – is similarly \npretextual. In 2017, recent immigrants who lacked health insurance, accounted for less than one-\ntenth of 1percent of U.S. medical expenditures.77 But because the Proclamation requires \nimmigrants to purchase expensive health insurance plans unless they can prove they have no \nmedical conditions that could require care, it creates onerous and likely insurmountable financial \nburdens on low-income immigrants, who are likely to be from countries with predominately \n76 Jeanne Batalova et al., Through the Back Door: Remaking the Immigration System via the Expected “Public-\nCharge” Rule, Migration Policy Institute(Aug. 2018),available at\nhttps://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/through-back-door-remaking-immigration-system-expected-public-\ncharge-rule;SeeLegal Aid Justice Center, Comment, at 8 (Dec. 10, 2018) (citing Boundless Immigration Inc., \nLooming Immigration Directive Could Separate Nearly 200,000 Married Couples Each Year (Sept. 24, 2018),\navailable at https://www.boundless.com/blog/looming-immigration-directive-separate-nearly-200000-married-\ncouples/).\n77 Kristina Cooke, Mica Rosenberg, Trump Rule on Health Insurance Leaves Immigrants, Companies Scrambling \nfor Answers, Reuters (October 31, 2019), available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-\ninsurance/trump-rule-on-health-insurance-leaves-immigrants-companies-scrambling-for-answers-\nidUSKBN1XA1G6.\n84\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 87 of 116\nnonwhite populations.78 Those seeking immigrant visas through family-based petitions, who are \nprimarily nonwhite, or through the diversity visa, who are majority African, are particular \ntargets.79\nB.

Our social security checks are on average $1200 a month. RT [retweet] if \nyou agree: If you weren’t born in the United States, you should receive $0 assistance.”91\n232. Often these false and hostile statements are linked directly to hostility to \nimmigrants from predominately nonwhite countries. During the presidential campaign, Trump \ncomplained that the Mexican government was deliberately sending immigrants to the United \nStates “because they don’t want to pay for them. They don’t want to take care of them.”92 In a \nJune 2017 Oval Office meeting, the President is said to have berated administration officials \nabout the number of immigrants who had received visas to enter the country that year, \ncomplaining that 15,000 Haitians “all have AIDS,” and that 40,000 Nigerians would never “go \nback to their huts” after seeing the United States.93\n89 Donald J.

Similarly, President Trump has referred to family-based immigration with \nthe derogatory term “chain migration,” repeatedly calling it a “disaster” and falsely claiming that \nit allows citizens to bring in relatives who are “15 times removed.”94 He has associated family-\nbased immigration preferences with terrorism, using discrete events to launch into attacks on \nwhat he calls the “sick, demented” statutory scheme that has been in place for decades.  He has \ncalled immigrants who arrive pursuant to family preferences “the opposite of [origin countries’]\nfinest,” “truly EVIL,” and “not the people that we want.”95\n234. Other high-ranking officials involved in the decision-making process have \ndemonstrated similar hostility toward nonwhite and low-income immigrants. President Trump’s\nprincipal advisor on immigration policy, Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller, has asserted that \nthe United States’current immigration system “cost[s] taxpayers enormously because roughly \nhalf of immigrant head[s] of households in the United States receive some type of welfare \nbenefit,” and that “a recent study said that as much as $300 billion a year may be lost as a result \nof our current immigration system in terms of folks drawing more public benefits than they’re \npaying in.”96 These statements are apparently based on misleading assertions by CIS, and they\ndo not distinguish between immigrants exempt from public charge determinations, other non-\nLPRs, LPRs, U.S. citizen children of noncitizens, and naturalized citizens. \n94 Meghan Keneally, 8 Times Trump Slammed “Chain Migration” Before It Apparently Helped His Wife’s\nParents Become Citizens, ABC News (Aug. 10, 2018), available at https://abcnews.go.com/US/times-trump-\nslammed-chain-migration-apparently-helped-wifes/story?id=57132429.\n95 Jessica Kwong, Donald Trump Says ‘Chain Migration’Immigrants ‘Are Not the People That We Want’—That \nIncludes Melania’s Parents, Newsweek (Jan. 14, 2019),available at https://www.newsweek.com/donald-\ntrump-chain-migration-immigrants-melania-1291210.\n96 The White House, Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Senior Policy Advisor Stephen Miller\n(Aug. 2, 2017),available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/pressbriefing-press-secretary-\nsarah-sanders-senior-policy-advisor-stephen-miller-080217/.\n88\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 91 of 116\n235. Miller has taken an active role in agency processes focused on furthering \nthe Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant policies. Miller has specifically focused on \nexpanding the definition of public charge, even directing federal agencies to “prioritize” this \nmatter over their “other efforts.”97 Miller’s drive to push the Rule and other anti-immigration \npolicies ahead despite opposition from officials who questioned their legality, practicability, or \nreasonability, was reported to be one of the primary reasons why former DHS Secretary Nielsen \nwas forced to resign, along with other officials at DHS.98 Miller reportedly exerted pressure to \nforce the resignation of USCIS Director Cissna because of the perceived lack of urgency in \nfinalizing the DHS Rule, which Miller predicted would be “transformative.”99 Emails obtained \nthrough a FOIA request show Miller berating Cissna in June 2018 over the perceived delay in \npublishing the proposed public charge rule, with Miller writing “I don’t care what you need to do \nto finish it on time.”100\n236. More recently, emails have surfaced demonstrating Miller’s long-time \naffiliation with white supremacist think tanks. These emails evince hostility toward Latinos, \nimmigrants, and non-white people. For example, in one email, Miller suggested that a novel \npromoting the idea that white people are subject to “genocide” through racial diversity could be \nan effective counterpoint to Pope Francis’pro-refugee rhetoric.

The circumstances the Court found in Hawai’i stand in stark contrast to \nthe facts here.  There, the Court held that (1) the proclamation in that case was consistent with \nand supported “Congress’individualized approach for determining inadmissibility,”id. at 2411, \n(2) the President had ordered DHS and other agencies “to conduct a comprehensive evaluation,” \nthen “set[] forth extensive findings” justifying why “it was in the national interest to restrict \nentry of aliens who could not be vetted with adequate information”—both to protect national \nsecurity and public safety, and to incentivize policy change in their home countries, id.at 2409; \nand (3) that, in order to provide equitable relief from its harms, “the Proclamation creates a \nwaiver program open to all covered foreign nationals seeking entry as immigrants or \nnonimmigrants,” directing “DHS and the State Department to issue guidance elaborating upon \nthe circumstances that would justify a waiver.” Id. at 2422-23.\n242. Here, none of that is so.  The Proclamation’s stated purpose is to protect \nthe country’s health care system and taxpayers “from the burdens of uncompensatedcare” by \n106 See Trump v.Hawai’i,138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018).\n92\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 95 of 116\nsuspending the “entry into the United States of certain immigrants who lack health insurance or \nthe demonstrated ability to pay for their healthcare.” 84 Fed. Reg. 53,991. Rather than introduce \na tailored, targeted country-specific approach intended to “encourage foreign governments to \nimprove their . . . practices”as a national security matter in vetting and information sharing,see\nMuslim Ban, 82 Fed. Reg. 45,162,the Proclamation here is unprecedented in its subject matter \nand its scope: it sweeps in hundreds of thousands of immigrants into a blunt and blanket denial \ndragnet without any articulated or unarticulated foreign policy or national security interest, \nentirely and exclusively on the basis of their ability to afford health insurance. \n243. Nothing in the text of the Proclamation indicates that one of its purposes is \nto improve the “screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with” the visa-\nissuance process,see Muslim Ban, 82 Fed. Reg. 45,162, § 1, or that it is intended to address any \nmatter of national security.  Moreover,8 U.S.C. § 1182(f) requires the President to make factual \nfindings to justify the Proclamation. As alleged above, the Proclamation does not even attempt \nto set forth factual findings to justify its sweepingprohibition and suspension of nearly two \nthirds of prospective immigrants around the world seeking admission to the United States.  \n244. Indeed, the Proclamation is wholly irrational.  There are no factual \nfindings, for instance, explaining how entry of an immigrant who would be fully insured with \ncomprehensive ACA coverage post-arrival, even with financial assistance, could be detrimental \nto the country, or addressingthe Proclamation’s purpose of reducing the number of uninsured\nindividuals.  Nor are there any factual findings explaining how entry of an immigrant who would \nbe underinsured or practically uninsured –for example, someone with visitor insurance or a \nSTLDI plan–would advance the Proclamation’s stated purpose.  If the goal of the Proclamation \nis to address uncompensated care costs lost by hospitals, particularly “uncompensated emergency \n93\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 96 of 116\ncare costs” often suffered by emergency rooms, driving new immigrants towards STLDI and \nsimilar non-comprehensive plans is more likely do the opposite, and is thus patently \nunreasonable. \n245. The limited options for STLDI, emergency travel, or catastrophic \ncoverage provide extremely limited coverage and would likely leave individuals underinsured or \nuninsured for common needs such as prescription drugs, as well as hospitalization or emergency \ncare. STLDI privatehealth care plans in particular are prohibitedunder New Yorkand \nCalifornia state law.107 Oregon, Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia \nhave restricted duration of STLDI plans to three or six months in length, with no extensions or \nrenewals allowed under state law; thus they do not meet the Proclamation’s 364-day coverage \nrequirement, and are not practically viable because they limit the states in which an intending \nimmigrant can live.108 None of these types of plans are offered or purchased on ACA \nExchanges, because visitor and STLDI plans are not required to provide essential health benefits.\nBecause they are non-comprehensive, these types of plans often leave individuals underinsured \nor effectively uninsured.  \n107 SeeN.Y.

TheProclamation’s 364-day minimum coverage requirement also \neffectively prohibits immigrants from switching immediately to a regular, comprehensive plan, \nirrespective of their own interest in doing so, their own financial resources, or any need for \nfinancial assistance.  \n247. By encouraging the entry of immigrants under visitor and STLDI plans, \nand requiring coverage for their first year or longer, the terms of the Proclamation itself \nundermine its stated goal of reducing uncompensatedcosts associated with uninsured health \ncare, in addition to (as alleged above) flouting duly enacted statutes designed to expand access to \naffordable healthcare and reduce uncompensated costs among lawfully present immigrants,\nincluding the ACAand CHIPRA.\n248. Moreover, the Proclamation, which seeks to exclude certain immigrants \nbased on the inability to obtain specific types of health insurance or pay for medical care,not \nonly exceeds the scope of Presidential authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), it violates \nconstitutional separation of powers principles.  The stated intent, terms, and effect of the \nProclamation contravene the goal of family unification and the statutorily mandated totality of \ncircumstances test and public charge provisions under the INA, as well as the express language \nand intent of the ACA and CHIPRA, designed by Congress to extend certain health-care related \nbenefits and provide an essential minimum level of coverage to all eligible and lawfully present \nimmigrants andcitizens in the United States.  The Congress has not authorized the President to \ncontravene other statutes using his section 1182(f) discretion.  If Congress had attempted to do \nso, the delegation in section 1182(f) would itself be constitutionally impermissible.\n95\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 98 of 116\nV. The Rule Will Cause Irreparable Harm to Plaintiffs \n249. Unless enjoined, the Consular Rules will cause each of the individual and \norganizational plaintiffs substantial, concrete, and particularized harm in the form of destroying \ntheir families, penalizing the use of essential benefits for which they and their families are \neligible, and diverting their resources and injuring their mission. These harms flow from the \npredictable and in fact intended consequences of each of the Consular Rules, which defendants \nhave used to erect an “invisible wall” to prevent low-income immigrants from building a \npermanent future in the United States. By definition, immigrants seeking to obtain LPR status \nthrough a family member have extremely close ties to U.S. citizens and permanent residents, and \nmany, like the individual plaintiffs, are already an essential part of the families and communities \nthey have built in the U.S.  For these plaintiffs in particular, application of the Consular Rules \nmeans indefinite separation from family –their beloved spouses and children. \n250. The numbers quantifying the impact of these rules on are staggering.\nSince the FAM Revisions went into effect in January 2018, there has been a twelve-fold increase \nin public charge denials at consular processing.109 If the IFR takes effect, the increase in public \ncharge denials is likely to increase exponentially.  A whopping 81 percent of the world’s\npopulation cannot meet the 125 percent of the U.S. Federal Poverty Guideline threshold test \nimposed by the DOS public charge rule.110 Finally, the Proclamation would result in two-thirds \nof intending immigrants –approximately 375,000 people –being denied entry and admission \n109 SeeDOS tables linked to in Ted Hesson, Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State \nDepartment, Politico (Aug. 6, 2019), available at https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-\nmexicans-trump-1637094.\n110 Danilo Trisi, Administration’s Public Charge Rules Would Close the Door to U.S. to Immigrants Without \nSubstantial Means, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 7-8(November 11, 2019), available at \nhttps://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-11-19imm.pdf.\n96\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 99 of 116\naccording to estimates by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.111 These statistics are not \nmerely aregrettable consequence of a policy shift, but rather, by design, they are the product of \npolicies that fundamentally conflict with the laws adopted by Congress and the balance of \npowers enshrined by the Constitution. \n251. The Consular Rules cause harm to plaintiffs in three main categories: \n(1) the harms caused by a huge increase in immigrant visas refused, both the increase that has \nalready taken place, and the even higher increase to come, and resulting family separation; (2) \nthe harm caused by citizen and LPR sponsors, or persons desiring to be sponsors in the future, \ngiving up or being reluctant to access government benefits for themselves and their family-\nmembers due to the negative weight such receipt is given under the FAM Revisions, as well as \nthe chilling effect on benefits use caused by all three Consular Rules; and (3) the impact of the \nabove on the organizational plaintiffs who must divert resources to meet the pressing needs of \nthe individuals and communities they serve affected by the Consular Rules at the expense of \nengaging in other activities to further their missions.\nA. Increase in Denials and the Resulting Separation of Families\n252. Each of the individual plaintiffs are facing impossible circumstances.  \nThey have built full lives in the U.S., are essential to the well-being of their families and \ncommunities, and want to obtain LPR status so they can enjoy the security of permanent \nresidence. They have invested in the process of seeking a waiver for unlawful presence, and for \nmost, those waivers have been approved based on DHS’s recognition that separation from their \n111 Julia Gelatt and Mark Greenberg, Health Insurance Test for Green-Card Applicants Could Sharply Cut Future \nU.S. Legal Immigration, Migration Policy Institute (Oct. 2019),available at\nhttps://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/health-insurance-test-green-card-applicants-could-sharply-cut-future-us-\nlegal-immigration.\n97\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 100 of 116\nfamilies would cause extreme hardship. Under the pre-January 2018 regulatory framework,they \nwould almost surely be granted immigrant visas.  Now, the Consular Rules make it likelythat\ntheir applications will be denied.  For each of them, the prospect of denial is the prospect of \nindefinite separation from their families and the resulting hardship that they themselves, and \nthose closest to them, will experience should they be separated.\n253. Plaintiffs Alicia Doeand Brenda Doe are likely to be denied a visa under \neach of the three Consular Rules.  The households of Alicia Doe and Brenda Doe both receive \ngovernment benefits that would be counted against them under the FAM,including SSI, SNAP, \ngovernment-funded health insurance, and in the case of Alicia Doe, public housing.  But neither \nAlicia norBrenda receive benefits on their own account.  Both plan to use co-sponsors that do \nnot reside in their households, and followingthe FAM Revisions, DOS has refused to give credit \nto such co-sponsors’ affidavits of support in certain consulates.  They would likewise be \nconsidered likely public charges under the IFR. Each of the households has income, but the \nincome is slightly short of the 125 percent of the FPG standard for their household size.  Neither \nAlicia Doe nor Brenda Doe has substantial, recent work experience, education, training, or \nEnglish language skills.  The focus of all three women has been to take care of disabled family \nmembers.  None of them can afford to meet the requirements of the Proclamation.  Alicia and \nBrenda Doe are currently eligible for State-funded Medicaid but fear signing up because of the \nlikely immigration consequence for their cases.  Of the types of insurance that satisfy the \nProclamation, they either cannot afford such insurance, or the insurance products are not \navailable to them.  Similarly, Diana Doe faces greatly increased risk that she will be deemed \nlikely to become a public charge, because she does not havesubstantial, recent work experience \n98\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 101 of 116\nand, like Alicia and Brenda Doe, her focus has been to care for family members.  Plaintiff Eric \nDoe fears that his wife is also likely to be denied forthe same reasons. \n254. For each of these plaintiffs,the consequences of denial would be a \nsingular, life-altering, and devastating event.  Alicia Doe would lose her husband and her \nchildren to return to El Salvador when her whole life is in New York.  Her husband would \nsomehow need to handle full-time work while caring for their daughter with cerebral palsy, and \ntheir other teenage daughter would lose her mother.  Brenda Doe would likewise lose her family. \nShe would return to the Dominican Republic, where she has not lived for over 20 years. She \nwould say goodbye to her three children, and her husband who has depended on her greatly since \nhe became legally blind in 2015. Her family would not only lose a mother and spouse, but they \nwould lose her capacity to earn wages to contribute to the tight household budget once she \nobtains her green card.  Carl Doe would be forced to return to El Salvador after more than a \ndecade and a half in New York, and would lose his wife and the business he is working so hard \nto build; his wife would lose his crucial financial and emotional support. Multiple generations of \nDiana Doe’s family depend on her, including her mother, her spouse, and her children.  Eric Doe \nwould lose his wife and life-partner who is essential to his ability to continue working despite his \nchronic health problems, and their young children would lose their mother at a critical juncture in \ntheir development. \n255. Plaintiffs would also suffer irreparable harm specifically as a result of the \nProclamation.  Most plaintiffs do not have the funds to purchase the few kinds of privatehealth \ninsurance available to them in the New York marketplace.  But even those with some ability to \npull funds together will be harmed. For example, Carl Doe’s nascent business may be able to \npurchase some forms of substandard, and expensive, health insurance with reserves.  But these \n99\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 102 of 116\nfunds will deplete the business’s small reserves and provide Carl Doe with health insurance that \ncovers less than state-funded public health insurance. These are funds that will never be \nreimbursed to his business, and that put it in a precarious position just as it is launching. \nSimilarly, Diana Doe has some savings, but those are needed for emergency expenses for her \nfamily and to help her survive in Mexico while she is awaiting consular processing.  Spending \nthose non-reimbursable funds on substandard health insurance that covers less than state-funded \nhealth insurance would put her and her family at financial and physical risk.\nA. Sponsors and Would-be Sponsors Foregoing Benefits\nand the Overall Chilling Effect on Benefits Use\n256. The second category of harms flows from two impacts of the Consular \nRules: (a) the FAM Revisions’imposition of an explicit, direct, and unlawfully retroactive \npenalty on an intending immigrant who has used or is using government benefits that are not\ncash or long-term institutional care and their sponsor or household members’use of the same; \nand (b) the chilling effect that all the Consular Rules cause low-income immigrants who are \neligible for benefits, even those who are not subject to the ConsularRules.   \n257. Each of the individual plaintiffs suffers from this category of harm. Alicia \nDoe and Brenda Doe have both chosen to forego accessing state-funded Medicaid for which they \nare eligible based on their approved I-130s because of their justified fears of the immigration \nconsequences.  They also have justified fear that their household members’ benefits receipt will \nbe counted against them.  The benefits are critical to their families’health and sustenance and \notherwise supplement low-wage work and income gaps created by family-members’disabilities.\nThey had no warning that the FAM Revisions would penalize their families’receipt, and giving \nup the benefits is not a realistic or economically wise choice. Yet they are in an impossible bind \n100\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 103 of 116\nbecause receipt of those supplemental benefits will almost certainly lead to their immigrant visa \napplications being denied short of an injunction. Similarly, plaintiff Eric Doe makes a good \nliving for his family but his employers do not provide health insurance. Given his critical health \nneeds –he has a chronic cancer diagnosis –his very survival depends on his continued access to \naffordable health care.  Giving up his state-funded health insurance to make his wife’s\napplication for an immigrant visa more viableis not an option for him. \nB. Diversion of Resources and Frustration of the Organizational Plaintiffs’\nMissions To Assist Struggling Immigrant Families and Communities\n258. Dealing with the grave concerns of sponsors and intending immigrants \nabout the prospect of family separation and the fear of receiving needed benefits is the province \nof the organizational plaintiffs. They are the front-lines for dealing with the concerns of clients \nand the consequences of these policies and will have to deal with them until the Consular Rules\nare enjoined.  In turn, the organizational plaintiffs experience harms in the form of diversion of \nresources –in money, time, and personnel –and frustration of their organizational mission, both \nof which are irreparable.  \n259. The time it takes to provide legal representation to low-income families \nseeking to achieve immigration goals that involve consular processing has become greatly \nincreased due to the Consular Rules, their complexity, and the uncertainty about their \nimplementation.  At the outset, organizational plaintiffs help clients identify achievable goals and \nweigh the risks. They complete immigration paperwork, which requires extra time to anticipate \nconcerns caused by the Consular Rules. They deal with clients where they themselves or their \nfamily members are stuck in their country of origin, sometimes for many months. For example, \nit takes MRNY up to six months to handle consular processing denials.  Organizational plaintiffs \n101\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 104 of 116\nprepare clients for the prospect of removal or permanent exclusion.  Each of these is a sensitive \nand complicated task.  Prior to the FAM Revisions and introduction of the IFR and \nProclamation, the outcome of consular processing was much more predictable. The staff time \n(and the funding it represents) nowneeded to contend with the new regime created by the \nConsular Rules is budgeted to other activities that fulfill the organizational plaintiffs’missions. \n260. For example, CARECEN –NY currently has approximately 400 clients \nwho are applying for immigrant visas and who are already subject to the FAM Revisions and \nwill be subject to the Proclamation and, ultimately,the IFR at their consular interviews.  \nApproximately15of these individuals are anticipated to be scheduled for visa interviews before \nFebruary 2020.  CARECEN–NY’s four attorneys and eleven legal support staff have already \nexpended significant time, and consequently organizational resources, as a result of the Consular \nRules, and CARECEN –NY has been forced to amend its intake and representation protocols \nand procedures in response to the rules.  CARECEN –NY is also paid on a fee for service \nmodel. The extra time spent dealing with consular issues is causing a 20 percent drop in its \nprojected annual budget for 2020. Projected budget losses will significantly impede and reduce \nCARECEN–NY’s ability to serve the directly impacted population and to provide adequate \nlegal assistance for its clients seeking petitions for admission. \n261. ASC has had to change its advice and practice for clients who want to \nobtain LPR status through consular processing, due to the uncertainty and the accompanying risk \nthe Consular Rules will create for clients, who would otherwise be eligible for permanent \nresident status through consular processing with a I-601A waiver.  Taking the steps to obtain \nLPR status is particularly important for ASC’s clients impacted by HIV or AIDS, who cannot \notherwise access needed state services and tools essential to place them on the road to financial \n102\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 105 of 116\nindependence, andfor healthy intending immigrants whose U.S.citizen spouse or children have \nHIV and rely on their hardworking family member.  Because ASC will no longer be able to \nsecure legal status for its vulnerable clients, and public benefits incident to status, ASC faces \nlosing government grants awarded to facilitate family stabilization of immigrant families \nimpacted by HIV.  Finally, in the past,ASC secured I-601A waivers of inadmissibility in order \nto spare U.S.citizen clients with HIV or AIDS the hardship of losing the support of their \nhardworking family members.  Ironically, now the very hardship upon which the waiver is \ngranted is likely to render the family member inadmissible unless the U.S. citizen with HIV \nforegoes benefits related toafamily member’s disability.\n262. CLINIC, whichserves affiliates in 49 states,and its stafffield questions \nabout individual cases form those affiliates,and will have to expend a significant amount of time \nadvisingaffiliates on the impact the Proclamation will have on applicants for immigrant visas.\nProviding proper advice requires learning the complex web of Proclamation-compliant health \ninsurance options for immigrants in markets for 49 states as well as the regulatory framework \ngoverning health insurance in each state.  For example, Proclamation-compliant STLDI plans are \nprohibited under New York and California state law. Other states allow STLDI plans but they \ndo not comply with the Proclamation. The time it will take CLINIC staff to navigate the \nintricacies of 49 state insurance markets and develop local contacts needed to verify the rules and \nproducts available will divert time from other work that CLINIC is planning to perform in the \nway of training and resource development.  CLINIC also could loserevenue from affiliates’\nmembership and training revenue fees due to the impact of all three Consular Rules ifaffiliates \nserve fewer clients, receiveless in fees, and have a reduced amount to spend on the services\nCLINIC provides.\n103\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 106 of 116\n263. In addition to the diversion of time dealing with the legal needs of clients, \norganizational plaintiffs see both the direct consequences and the chilling effect of all three Rules \non the use of benefits. First, the penalties and fear caused by the Consular Rules complicate the \nclient service work described above as clients weigh their immigration options against their \nneeds and their families’ need for benefits. Second,clients giving up benefits means increased \ndemand for the types of free and low-fee services provided by organizational plaintiffs,including \nhealth services, food pantries, and English language classes.  Third,even apart from immigration \ncounseling, clients who are not in the process of immigrating or helping a family-member \nimmigrate have fear that accessing benefits may somehow hurt them or their families, now or in \nthe future, and require extra care and individualized advice to explain how the Consular Rules do \nor do not apply to them specifically.  Fourth, organizational plaintiffs are spending more time \nconducting outreach to clients who are experiencing the chilling effect and may not feel \ncomfortable walking into the doors of an established non-profit organization. \n264. The prospect of denial and family separation predominantly affecting \nimmigrants of color also does fundamental damage to the mission of organizational plaintiffs –\nto increase power in immigrant communities, promote family unity and stability, and achieve \nracial justice.  Their mission is also impaired when due to the illegal Consular Rules there are \nsimply no good options for clients seeking to adjust or who need benefits for which they are \neligible. Clients with a path to obtain LPR status can either stay put and remain without \npermanent status or risk indefinite separation from their families and communities.  Clients who \nneed benefits can either meet their needs and those of their families or go without and still face \ngreat risk of denial based on past use.  Further damage to plaintiffs’mission is caused by the \ndraining of resources from other important goals and client needs. \n104\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 107 of 116\n265. The effects described are already being felt.  In many cases,the harm will \nonly become more pronounced when the IFR and Proclamation go into effect.\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act –Substantively Arbitrary\nand Capricious, Abuse of Discretion, Contrary to Constitution or Statute)\n266. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \neach of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint.\n267. The APA, 5 U.S.C. §706(2), prohibits federal agency action that is, \namong other things, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law”; “contrary to constitutional right”; or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.” \n268.

Defendants DOS, Pompeo, HHS and Azar acted arbitrarily and \ncapriciously, otherwise not in accordance with law, and contrary to constitutional right, and \nabusedtheir discretion, in violation of the APA.\n273. These violations by Defendants DOS, Pompeo, HHS, and Azar have \ncaused and will continue to cause ongoing harm to plaintiffs and the general public.\nCOUNT TWO\n(Violation of Administrative Procedure Act – Procedurally Arbitrary\nand Capricious, Notice and Comment)\n274. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \neach of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint.\n275. The APA, 5 U.S.C. §§553 and 702(2)(D), prohibits federal agency action \nthat affects substantive rights “without observance of procedure required by law.”  \n276. DOS is an “agency” under the APA.  5 U.S.C. §551(A).\n277. In issuing the FAM Revisions, promulgating the IFR, and otherwise \nimplementing the Proclamation, defendants will change the substantive criteria regarding \nevaluating whether an individual is a public charge.  This change will impact plaintiffs’\nsubstantive rights.\n278. The FAM Revisions and the IFR must comply with the APA process for \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.  5 U.S.C. §553.\n279. Under the APA, agencies engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking \nmust, among other things, (a)provide reasonable basis for departing from prior agency actions; \n(b)support their actions with appropriate data and evidence; and (c)provide a reasoned response \nto significant public comments.\n107\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 110 of 116\n280. Defendants DOS andPompeohave failed to comply with these \nobligations. \n281. These violations will cause ongoing harm to plaintiffs.\nCOUNT THREE\n(Violation of the Fifth Amendment –Equal Protection and Due Process)\n282. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in \neach of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint.\n283. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal \ngovernment from denying equal protection of the laws.\n284. The IFR, the FAM Revisions and the Proclamation and the Proclamation \nImplementing Actions target individuals for discriminatory treatment based on their race, \nethnicity, and/or national origin, without lawful justification.\n285. These actions were each motivated, in whole or in part, by a \ndiscriminatory motive and/or a desire to harm a particular group: nonwhite immigrants.\n286. Nonwhite immigrants will be disproportionately harmed by these actions.\n287. The Proclamation targets individuals for discriminatory treatment because\nthey are members of a disfavored group: non-wealthy immigrants who plan to settle permanently \nin the United States, and so is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. \n288. By taking these actions, defendants violated the equal protection and due \nprocess guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.\n289. This violation will cause ongoing harm to plaintiffs.\n108\n\nCase 1:19-cv-11633   Document 1   Filed 12/19/19   Page 111 of 116\nCOUNT FOUR\n(Ultra Vires)\n290.

The President’s attempt to indefinitely ban certain immigrants based on \nthe inability to obtain specific types of health insurance or pay for medical care, and to create a \nnew ground of inadmissibility that Congress has previously considered and chosen not to include \nin the INA, exceeds Congress’s delegated power to the President’s power to suspend the entry of \nnoncitizens and issue reasonable rules for the entry of noncitizens.  \n294. The President’s attempt to ban certain immigrants based on the inability to \nobtain specific types of health insurance or pay for medical care violates constitutional \nseparation of powers principles because it contravenes Congress’s expressed intent to provide a \ncertain minimum level of coverage to all legal immigrants and citizens in the United States and \nto extend certain health care-related benefits to legal immigrants.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:\na.
