    "summary": "<p>This is a case about asylum seekers' right to counsel in refoulment interviews conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services which determine whether an asylum seeker can remain in the United States during their immigration proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On November 5, 2019, asylum seekers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Southern District of California (in San Diego). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of San Diego, sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection for violating the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 551), the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1101), and Plaintiffs&rsquo; rights to procedural and substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment and their right to free speech under the First Amendment. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Federal Government unlawfully deprived them of access to counsel to prepare for hearings that could result in immediate deportation under the Migrant Protection Protocols (also called the \"Remain in Mexico Policy\") along with an injunction allowing access to counsel (or habeas relief if access to counsel would be impractical) and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p><br />The plaintiffs are parents who fled from Guatemala to the United States through Mexico, where they alleged they were robbed and assaulted. They were detained in the United States and faced deportation to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols while their asylum claims were pending in the United States. However, they could avoid deportation if they could establish that their life or freedom would be threatened in Mexico at a \"non-refoulement\" interview. But the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants prevented them from retaining counsel to help them prepare for and represent them in their impending non-refoulement interviews.</p>\r\n<p><br />On the same day they filed suit, the plaintiffs asked the Court for a temporary restraining order to allow them access to retained counsel and filed a motion for class certification. Judge Dana M. Sabraw granted a temporary restraining order to enjoin the government from denying the plaintiffs' access to legal counsel before and during their non-refoulement interview on November 12, 2019. Judge Sabraw also certified a class consisting of &ldquo;all individuals who are detained in CBP custody in California awaiting or undergoing non-refoulement interviews pursuant to what the government calls the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' program and who have retained lawyers&rdquo; on January 14, 2020. On the same day, Judge Sabraw issued a class-wide preliminary injunction in the Plaintiffs' favor. 415 F. Supp. 3d 971.</p>\r\n<p><br />In March of 2020, Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appeal in this case was stayed pending the outcome of a separate Supreme Court case on the same issue, Wolf [or Pekoske] v. Innovation Law Lab. Later, on December 15, 2020, the court of appeals ordered: &ldquo;Submission of this case is vacated pending the Supreme Court&rsquo;s disposition of Wolf, et al. v. Innovation Law Lab, et al., No. 19-1212.&rdquo; The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 19, 2020, under the name &ldquo;Mayorkas v. Innovation Law Lab&rdquo;. On June 21, 2021 (entered on July 23, 2021), the judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with instructions to direct the District Court to vacate as moot the April 8, 2019 order granting a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p><br />On February 2, 2022, the defendant filed for a motion to stay and finding of mootness as the currently implemented version of MPP is separate from the policy Plaintiffs initially challenged, and the current version provides the same or greater access to counsel than that Plaintiffs initially sought. The court on March 14, 2022, denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion to stay and suggestion of mootness and granted the unopposed motion for a 90-day extension to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint. The court held that while the instant case will become moot should the government prevail in Biden v. Texas at the Supreme Court and subsequently terminate MPP, it currently remained live.</p>\r\n<p><br />The government won on appeal at the Supreme Court in Biden v. Texas (2022). The question of that case was whether the Biden administration must continue to enforce the Trump administration&rsquo;s Migrant Protection Protocols, or whether the Biden Department of Homeland Security decision ending the policy has legal effect. The Supreme Court held that the Government&rsquo;s rescission of Migrant Protection Protocols did not violate section 1225 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the resolution constituted valid final agency action.</p>\r\n<p><br />The case went back to the district court, where the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs argue the case is not moot, as a decision in Texas v. Biden may require MPP's reimplementation. On August 16, 2024, both parties asked the court to continue to stay the case for 90 days to allow additional time to continue discussing a possible resolution in this matter. On August 21, 2024, the court stayed the case until November 19, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>The case is currently ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

ECF 112. On January 19, 2024, \n \n \n3  the Parties requested the Court continue to stay this case for purposes of monitoring \n \n \n4  separate ongoing litigation challenging the federal government’s termination of the \n \n \n5  Migrant Protection Protocols (“MPP”) and to allow the Parties to explore a potential \n \n \n6  resolution to this case through settlement. ECF 113. On August 12, 2024, the Court \n \n \n7  again ordered the Parties to file a joint status report indicating how they wish to \n \n \n8  proceed. ECF 114. For the reasons noted below, the Parties respectfully request an \n \n \n9  additional 90-day extension of the stay of proceedings to continue their ongoing \n \n \n10  discussions. \n \n \n11    This case relates to MPP, a program the federal government attempted to \n \n \n12  terminate in 2021. The termination was initially enjoined in separate litigation, but \n \n \n13  the federal government appealed in that case and prevailed at the Supreme Court. See \n \n \n14  Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785 (2022). That case is now on remand in the district court \n \n \n15  pending resolution of cross-motions for summary judgment that have been fully \n \n \n16  briefed since October 2023. See Texas v. Biden, No. 2:21-CV-067-Z (N.D. Tex). \n \n \n17  Since the Parties’ last joint status report, the Parties have continued to monitor the \n \n \n18  district court case, but there have been no new developments and a decision remains \n \n \n19  pending. Plaintiffs continue to dispute that this case is moot based on the attempted \n \n \n20  rescission of MPP because Plaintiffs believe an order granting the plaintiff states’ \n \n \n21  requested relief in Texas v.

Plaintiff-Petitioners (“Plaintiffs”) are parents of a family with five\n25 \nchildren that fled extortion, death threats, and rape in Guatemala. They endured \n26 \nassault, robbery, and humiliation in Mexico en route to the United States. \n27 \n28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.2   Page 2 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    2.  Many other individuals and families have fled their home countries for \n \n2   similar reasons and have faced abuses such as kidnapping, rape, and assault when \n \n3   traveling through Mexico to reach the United States. Indeed, migrants are regularly \n \n4   targeted for abuse in Mexico.  \n \n5    3.  After Plaintiffs sought asylum in the United States, as is their right \n \n6   under international and federal law, the government forced them to return to Mexico \n \n7   during their immigration proceedings, under a new program the government refers \n \n8   to as “Migrant Protection Protocols” (“MPP” or “Remain in Mexico”). \n \n9  4.  Since January 2019, the government has forced certain asylum seekers \n10  to return to Mexico during the pendency of their immigration proceedings pursuant \n11  to MPP.  \n12  5.  Plaintiffs have suffered additional assault, robbery, and harm in \n13  Mexico while their immigration proceedings are pending. \n14  6.  Plaintiffs are now represented by counsel. Through counsel, when they \n15  recently appeared in immigration court, they expressed fear of return to Mexico, \n16  triggering their legal right to a determination whether they can be forced back into \n17  Mexico again. \n18  7.  That determination arises from treaty obligations, implemented by \n19  statute, under which the United States is bound not to return individuals to a country \n20  where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of enumerated grounds. \n21  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). This is referred to as the duty of non-refoulement. \n22  8.  Plaintiffs face an imminent non-refoulement interview with \n23  government officials that could determine whether they live or die if forced to return \n24  to Mexico. \n25  9.  While detaining them pending that interview in deplorable conditions, \n26  the government refuses to allow them to speak confidentially with their counsel to \n27  prepare for the interview, although it routinely allows immigration detainees to do \n28  so in other matters. \n    2    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.3   Page 3 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    10.  The government refuses to allow their counsel to participate in the \n \n2   interview, although it routinely allows counsel to participate in similar interviews in \n \n3   other matters. \n \n4    11.  By policy and practice, the government does the same to numerous \n \n5   other detained individuals and families represented by counsel who fear return to \n \n6   Mexico and face non-refoulement interviews.  \n \n7    12.  Instead of permitting individuals access to their lawyers to prepare for \n \n8   the non-refoulement interviews, during which they must recount extremely traumatic \n \n9  events, CBP disappears individuals for days in its detention facilities, which are \n10  commonly referred to as hieleras, the Spanish word for iceboxes, due to their \n11  infamously cold temperatures. Such detention can last days, and often longer than a \n12  week. Throughout this time, CBP neither permits detained individuals to contact \n13  retained counsel nor infoms attorneys of their clients’ whereabouts.  \n14  13.  During this lengthy, virtually incommunicado detention, CBP subjects \n15  individuals to conditions far from conducive to careful preparation required before a \n16  highly consequential proceeding, including inadequate food and hygiene, exposure \n17  to illnesses, overcrowding, verbal harassment, freezing temperatures, and other \n18  abuses. \n19  14.  Because DHS’s current practice at the California-Mexico border is to \n20  impose MPP predominantly, if not exlusively, against families, as it has in this case, \n21  traumatized individuals must endure these conditions while also struggling to care \n22  for their children, many of whom have suffered harm themselves in Mexico and/or \n23  their home countries. \n24  15.  By the time individuals and families have their non-refoulement \n25  interviews, they have spent days struggling to survive in the hieleras without access \n26  to their lawyers instead of preparing for the life-or-death proceedings.  \n27  16.  As in similar high-stakes proceedings, confidential access to counsel is \n28  important for MPP detainees to prepare for non-refoulement interviews, which turn \n    3    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.4   Page 4 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   on complicated factual and legal questions that vulnerable and traumatized detainees \n \n2   are ill-equipped to address without support from their lawyers. \n \n3    17.  As in similar interviews, the participation of counsel during MPP non-\n \n4   refoulement interviews is important to ensure full development of the record \n \n5   necessary to meet the complex legal standards and ensure accurate determinations. \n \n6    18.  In similar circumstances, the government permits individuals to \n \n7   consult counsel confidentially before high-stakes interviews and allows their \n \n8   attorneys to participate in the interviews. \n \n9  19.  The denial of access to counsel before non-refoulement interviews and \n10  the refusal to allow counsel to participate in such interviews is likely to result in \n11  erroneous return to Mexico of persons with legitmate fears of persecution and \n12  torture in Mexico, endangering their lives and safety. \n13  20.  Plaintiffs bring this case to protect the statutory and constitutional right \n14  of access to retained counsel before and during non-refoulement interviews for \n15  persons facing threats of torture or persecution in Mexico. \n16  21.  Plaintiffs seek emergency relief to protect those rights before and \n17  during their own non-refoulement interviews, which will occur within a few days. \n18  PARTIES \n19  22.  Plaintiffs “Cristian Doe” (“Cristian”) and “Diana Doe” (“Diana”) , \n20  referred to by pseudonym, are seeking asylum in the United States for themselves \n21  and their five children: a 17-year-old daughter, 12–year-old son, 10-year-old son, 9-\n22  year-old son, and 4-year–old son.  \n23  23.  Pending non-refoulement interviews, Plaintiffs are detained in the legal \n24  custody of Defendants named below. \n25  24.  Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of the U.S. \n26  Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), an agency of the United States with \n27  several components responsible for enforcing United States immigration laws. \n28 \n    4    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.5   Page 5 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   Secretary McAleenan is a legal custodian of Plaintiffs and other members of the \n \n2   proposed class. He is sued in his official capacity. \n \n3    25.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is the Acting Director of U.S. \n \n4   Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), a component of DHS.

Venue is proper in the Southern District of California pursuant to 28 \n22  U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Plaintiffs are detained in this district and a substantial part \n23  of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district. \n24  FACTS \n25  I.  Plaintiffs’ Experience \n26  35.  Cristian, Diana, and their children are from Guatemala. They fled their \n27  home in April 2019 after their family was extorted and their 17-year-old daughter \n28  was raped and threatened with death.  \n    6    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.7   Page 7 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    36.  After experiencing rape, the 17-year-old girl suffered extreme trauma. \n \n2   She has expressed a desire to take her life.  \n \n3    37.  Cristian and Diana’s 9-year-old son has been seen and treated in \n \n4   Guatemala for symptoms consistent with leukemia and is currently completely \n \n5   untreated while forced to remain in Mexico, due to the family’s lack of resources.  \n \n6    38.  The 9-year-old boy experiences daily symptoms of his illness \n \n7   including dizziness, nausea, gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue. \n \n8    39.  While traveling through Mexico, Cristian and Diana’s family was \n \n9  assaulted at gunpoint by three men whose faces were covered but who wore \n10  uniforms they perceived to belong to Mexican federal officials, in part due to the \n11  Mexican flag that was stitched onto the sleeves of the uniforms. \n12  40.  One of these officials carried a gun. The others carried machetes. They \n13  pointed their weapons, beat Cristian with a gun, and ordered the family to hand over \n14  all of their belongings. \n15  41.  The assailants ordered Cristian, Diana, and the five children to take all \n16  of their clothes off. One assailant choked the 17-year-old girl while she was \n17  completely undressed. \n18  42.  The assault exacerbated the trauma the 17-year-old girl had \n19  experienced as a result of the rape she suffered in Guatemala. It horrified Diana, \n20  who felt impotent as she was knocked to the ground while trying to defend her \n21  daughter. \n22  43.  The assailants threatened to kill the family if they reported the assault \n23  to anyone. Cristian and Diana reported it to Mexican law enforcement authorities \n24  anyway, hoping to avail themselves of the protection of the Mexican government. \n25  44.  Nothing has come of their complaint, however. Consequently, Cristian \n26  and Diana live in fear every day that someone will find their family and hurt them \n27  while they are forced to live in Mexico. \n28 \n    7    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.8   Page 8 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    45.  U.S. immigration agents took Cristian, Diana, and their children into \n \n2   CBP custody at the Chula Vista Border Patrol station in California on or about \n \n3   August 8, 2019. They immediately requested asylum, as is their right under federal \n \n4   and international law. \n \n5    46.  After the family spent two days in Border Patrol detention, Defendants \n \n6   sent them back into Mexico, subjecting them to MPP. Defendants never asked \n \n7   Cristian, Diana, or their children about their fear of return to Mexico. \n \n8    47.  Although they have a safe place to go in the United States with \n \n9  Cristian’s United States citizen aunt, Defendants have forced the family to remain in \n10  Mexico pursuant to MPP. \n11  48.  Cristian and Diana currently lack permanent shelter in Mexico and \n12  have been unable to access critical medical care for their children. \n13  49.  Since arriving in Tjiuana where they are forced to await their \n14  immigration proceedings, Cristian, Diana, and their children have survived a shoot-\n15  out just outside of where they were staying between people they believe to be drug \n16  traffickers and Mexican military officials. \n17  50.  At their first immigration court hearing, at which they were \n18  unrepresented, Cristian and Diana expressed a fear of return to Mexico. Defendants \n19  detained them and transported them back to Border Patrol custody to await non-\n20  refoulement interviews.   \n21  51.  CBP separated Cristian from Diana and his family and held him in a \n22  different cell.  \n23  52.  While awaiting their interviews, Cristian, Diana, and their children \n24  were subject to extremely cold temperatures, unhygienic conditions, exposure to \n25  illnesses, lights on 24 hours per day, and they were forced to choose between eating \n26  spoiled food and not eating at all, among other abuses. \n27  53.  USCIS interviewed Cristian while CBP kept him handcuffed, such that \n28  he could not raise his hand to properly take the oath USCIS administered.  \n    8    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.9   Page 9 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    54.  USCIS interviewed Diana separately along with her children.  \n \n2    55.  The interviews were telephonic and took place in small rooms inside \n \n3   the Border Patrol station. The interviewers only permitted the family members to \n \n4   answer yes-or-no questions. \n \n5    56.  Non-interviewing immigration officials sat in the small rooms during \n \n6   each interview. \n \n7    57.  The day after the intial non-refoulement interviews, Defendants forced \n \n8   Cristian, Diana, and their children back into Mexico without an explanation about \n \n9  the results of the interview. They continue living in fear in Mexico while awaiting \n10  the adjudication of their asylum claims. \n11  58.  Since their last interviews, Cristian experienced another assault while \n12  on his way to attempt to work as a security guard. Three men dressed in black \n13  robbed Cristian at gunpoint. One of the assailants held a gun to his back. The \n14  assailants stole his money and the immigration documents he was carrying. \n15  59.  Since their last interview and after considerable effort, Cristian and \n16  Diana secured the pro bono representation of Stephanie Blumberg, an immigration \n17  lawyer with Jewish Family Services of San Diego. \n18  60.  Cristian, Diana, and their family had an immigration court hearing \n19  today, November 5, 2019, at 8:30 am. At that hearing, Blumberg conveyed her \n20  clients’ fear of return to Mexico to the immigration judge (IJ). Defendants then took \n21  the family into CBP custody for non-refoulement interviews, which are likely to \n22  occur within several days of the filing of this complaint. \n23  61.  CBP does not allow persons in its custody to meet confidentially with \n24  their attorneys. \n25  62.  CBP does not allow attorneys representing persons in its custody to \n26  visit such persons for the purpose of confidential legal advice. \n27  63.  CBP does not inform attorneys representing persons in its custody \n28  where those persons are held. \n    9    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.10   Page 10 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    64.  CBP does not allow persons in its custody to communicate \n \n2   confidentially by telephone with their counsel. \n \n3    65.  CBP does not allow persons in its custody who are represented by \n \n4   counsel to have their counsel present during or participate in non-refoulement \n \n5   interviews. \n \n6    66.  While in CBP detention pending their non-refoulement interviews, \n \n7   Cristian and Diana have been deprived of the right to communicate confidentially \n \n8   with their counsel to prepare for their non-refoulement interviews. \n \n9  67.  Cristian and Diana will be deprived of the right to have their counsel \n10  present during or participate in their non-refoulement interviews. \n11  II.  Asylum Process Before MPP \n12  68.  Before implementation of MPP, individuals applying for asylum at or \n13  near a port of entry were placed in expedited removal (“ER”) proceedings or in full \n14  removal proceedings before an IJ pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act \n15  (“INA”) § 240. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1), 1229a. \n16  69.  Individuals subject to ER who express a fear of persecution or torture \n17  upon removal are given a Credible Fear Interview (“CFI”) to assess whether there \n18  exists a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum. 8 U.S.C. § \n19  1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n20  70.  Individuals held in detention pending a CFI have the opportunity to \n21  consult confidentially with retained counsel before the CFI. \n22  71.  Individuals who fail a CFI are generally removed promptly through an \n23  ER order. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii).  \n24  72.  Individuals who pass their CFI are taken out of ER proceedings and \n25  placed into INA § 240 removal proceedings, in which they have the opportunity to \n26  present their cases for asylum before an IJ. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(4); \n27  1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30, 235.3.  \n28 \n    10    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.11   Page 11 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    73.  Until MPP, most people who arrived at or near the southern U.S. \n \n2   border to seek asylum were subjected to the ER and CFI process. \n \n3    74.  Those who passed a CFI remained in the United States pending \n \n4   completion of their removal proceedings. They were either held in detention or \n \n5   released into the community. \n \n6    75.  If held in detention, they had the opportunity to consult confidentially \n \n7   with retained counsel. \n \n8    III.   Implementation of MPP  \n \n9  76.  On December 20, 2018, DHS announced the commencement of MPP.  \n10  77.  Under MPP, DHS forces individuals and families who have come to \n11  the United States from a non-contiguous country to seek asylum to return to Mexico \n12  while their claims are adjudicated.  \n13  78.  They must then find temporary refuge, shelter, and basic amenities in \n14  Mexican border cities like Tijuana and Mexicali, where there are insufficient shelter \n15  and resources to accommodate their needs.  \n16  79.  DHS permits such individuals to enter the United States only for \n17  periodic immigration court hearings that are scheduled weeks or months apart from \n18  one another. \n19  80.  DHS applies MPP to individuals and families regardless of whether \n20  they presented at a port of entry or were apprehended after entering the United \n21  States without inspection.   \n22  81.  On or about January 28, 2019, DHS began implementing MPP at the \n23  San Ysidro port of entry.  \n24  82.  Before forcing people back into Mexico pursuant to MPP, the \n25  government purports to notify them of the date and time for their first immigration \n26  court hearing. \n27 \n28 \n    11    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.12   Page 12 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    83.  On the day of their hearing, individuals and families subject to MPP \n \n2   must present themselves for court at the port of entry hours before their immigration \n \n3   court hearing.  \n \n4    84.  Individuals subject to MPP whose removal proceedings are before the \n \n5   San Diego immigration court must present themselves for court at the San Ysidro \n \n6   port of entry as early as 4:00 a.m.  \n \n7    85.  CBP then brings individuals and families into the United States, and \n \n8   ICE transports them, dozens at a time, to the immigration court hearing. Throughout \n \n9  this time, individuals are under the control and custody of DHS. \n10  86.  At the conclusion of the court hearing, DHS ordinarily returns MPP \n11  respondents to Mexico to await their next hearing. \n12  87.  On the date of their next hearing, the process repeats. \n13  IV.   Defendants’ Duty of Non-Refoulement in the Context of MPP \n14  88.  Individuals and families seeking asylum and forced into MPP are often \n15  extremely vulnerable and subject to grave danger in Mexico. \n16  89.  Individuals and families seeking asylum and forced into MPP have \n17  experienced rape, kidnappings, robbery, and other serious harm in Mexico. \n18  90.  By policy and practice, Defendants do not affirmatively ask asylum \n19  seekers whether they fear harm or face persecution or torture in Mexico before \n20  forcing them into MPP.  \n21  91.  If persons seeking asylum express a fear of return to Mexico, they are \n22  referred for a non-refoulement interview with a USCIS asylum officer to determine \n23  whether they are more likely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico. \n24  92.  Once individuals claim a fear of return to Mexico, in an immigration \n25  court hearing or otherwise, Defendants detain them up to a week or more until the \n26  non-refoulement interview occurs.  \n27 \n28 \n    12    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.13   Page 13 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    93.  During such detention, individuals claiming a fear of return to Mexico \n \n2   do not have the opportunity to communicate confidentially with retained counsel, by \n \n3   telephone or in person, to prepare for non-refoulement interviews. \n \n4    94.  When detained pursuant to MPP, Plaintiffs and class members \n \n5   awaiting non-refoulement interviews are not in primary or secondary inspection. \n \n6    95.  Non-refoulement interviews involve discussion of trauma-triggering \n \n7   facts that subject MPP respondents to revictimization.  \n \n8    96.  Non-refoulement interviews also involve highly complex legal \n \n9  questions. For example, to discern the likelihood of persecution in Mexico, asylum \n10  officers assess MPP respondents’ credibility, whether they have suffered past harm \n11  and, if so, whether the harm suffered rises to the level of persecution and occurred or \n12  is likely to occur on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or \n13  membership in a particular social group.  \n14  97.  Asylum officers must also determine whether the entity that inflicted \n15  the harm was an agent of the Mexican government or an entity the Mexican \n16  government is unable to or unwilling to control. \n17  98.  Asylum officers must also determine whether the individual \n18  interviewed is subject to any bars to withholding of removal.  \n19  99.  In the absence of past harm, asylum officers must assess whether the \n20  respondent’s life or freedom would be threatened in Mexico.  \n21  100.  Regarding fear of torture in Mexico, asylum officers must assess \n22  whether the respondent would be subject to severe physical or mental pain or \n23  suffering and whether the harm would be inflicted by, instigated by, consented to, or \n24  acquiesced to by a public official or any other person acting in an official capacity, \n25  and while the respondent is in such entities’ custody or physical control.  \n26  101.  Finally, asylum officers must determine whether the harm would be \n27  specifically intended to hurt the individual or families being interviewed, and \n28 \n    13    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.14   Page 14 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   whether the harm would arise from or be inherent in or incidental to lawful \n \n2   sanctions.   \n \n3    102.  At the conclusion of non-refoulement interviews, asylum officers \n \n4   render their decisions, which are reviewed by supervisory asylum officers. \n \n5   Thereafter, USCIS provides their decisions to CBP. \n \n6    103.  Defendants prohibit attorney presence during or participation in non-\n \n7   refoulement interviews for persons subject to MPP.  \n \n8    104.  If USCIS determines after a non-refoulement interview that individuals \n \n9  or families are more likely than not to be persecuted on account of a protected \n10  ground or tortured if returned to Mexico, the individuals or families will be removed \n11  from MPP and may be released or detained pending the conclusion of their removal \n12  proceedings.  \n13  105.  If USCIS does not so determine, the individuals and families are \n14  returned to Mexico and forced to remain in MPP. \n15  106.  The non-refoulement interview determines where individuals will be \n16  physically located while they go through removal proceedings, but it is not part of \n17  the removal proceedings themselves.  \n18  107.  Denial of access to counsel before and during non-refoulement \n19  interviews is unreviewable and constitutes the agency’s final action regarding access \n20  to counsel. An immigration judge does not review the issue of access to counsel \n21  before and during a non-refoulement interview, and that issue is not made part of the \n22  record of proceedings in the removal proceedings. The denial of access to counsel \n23  before and during a non-refoulement interview cannot be reviewed in a petition for \n24  review of a final order of removal  \n25  108.  A non-refoulement decision is unreviewable and constitutes the \n26  agency’s final action regarding the claim of fear of return to Mexico within MPP. \n27  An immigration judge does not review the non-refoulement decision, which is not \n28 \n    14    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.15   Page 15 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   made part of the record of proceedings in the removal proceedings. The decision \n \n2   cannot be reviewed in a petition for review of a final order of removal. \n \n3     \n  V.  Instead of Providing Access to Counsel, Defendants Subject Plaintiffs to \n4 \n  Deplorable Detention Conditions  \n \n5    109.  DHS conducts non-refoulement interviews in CBP facilities, including \n \n6   at ports of entry and Border Patrol stations. \n \n7    110.  For individuals who express fear of return to Mexico at an immigration \n \n8   court hearing, DHS transports them to await their interview at the port of entry or \n \n9  Border Patrol stations. \n10  111.  Officials at the port of entry or Border Patrol stations contact USCIS to \n11  schedule the interview.  \n12  112.  After being transported to CBP facilities for non-refoulement \n13  interviews, individuals and families, including small children, disappear into CBP \n14  facilities and many go completely incommunicado for days or weeks. \n15  113.  CBP has a policy and practice of denying requests for in-person visits \n16  or confidential telephonic communication with counsel at its holding facilities, \n17  including Border Patrol stations. \n18  114.  This is consistent with CBP’s larger policy and practice of denying \n19  attorneys confidential visitation or telephonic communication with their clients in \n20  CBP custody in California, if not everywhere in the United States.  \n21  115.  Individuals describe CBP hieleras as freezing cold facilities, holding \n22  up to 100 other people in an extremely compact space with little room to walk or lie \n23  down.  \n24  116.  Hielera cells usually contain a single toilet and sink that are exposed to \n25  all in the holding area. \n26  117.  Parents of infants and toddlers report being reprimanded for requesting \n27  basic necessities like diapers or formula. \n28 \n    15    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.16   Page 16 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    118.  Individuals report being exposed to illnesses and children contracting \n \n2   lice and suffering from anxiety in the extremely overcrowded space. They also \n \n3   report rarely being given access to showers, if at all, and being denied toothpaste, \n \n4   hygiene products, and the ability to change their clothing during the several days \n \n5   they are detained.  \n \n6    119.  While detained in the hieleras, individuals do not have an opportunity \n \n7   to make confidential phone calls to their retained counsel.  \n \n8    120.  Defendants do not affirmatively inform lawyers where their clients are \n \n9  detained and they refuse to respond to the lawyers’ requests for such information. \n10  121.  As a result, lawyers are unable to locate, visit, or make confidential \n11  phone calls with their clients to provide counsel and prepare them for the high-\n12  stakes non-refoulement interviews. \n13  122.  CBP officials berate and ridicule individuals who assert their right to \n14  telephone their lawyers. In one case, in response to a mother detained with her 10-\n15  year-old son who asked to speak with her lawyer prior to her non-refoulement \n16  interview, a Border Patrol agent reportedly shouted, “I don’t give a fuck! Who do \n17  you think you are that you can call your attorney?!”  \n18  VI.  Defendants’ Non-Refoulement Interview Procedures in California \n19  123.  In California, USCIS conducts non-refoulement interviews \n20  telephonically, with the respondents in a small windowless room and an asylum \n21  officer on the telephone.  \n22  124.  Pursuant to its written policy, DHS refuses to allow individuals and \n23  families with lawyers to have their lawyers present during the interview. Asylum \n24  officers do not ask if they have lawyers or want them present. \n25  125.  When individuals affirmatively request to have their lawyers present, \n26  asylum officers refuse the request. \n27  126.  Typically, DHS informs individuals and families whether they will be \n28  returning to Mexico or released from MPP hours or days later. DHS does not \n    16    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.17   Page 17 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    provide any documentation memorializing the result of the non-refoulement \n \n2    interview or decision-making process.   \n \n3    127.  DHS also refuses to provide information to lawyers, who usually do \n \n4    not learn what happened to their clients until after they have been released—either \n \n5    returned to Mexico if they did not pass the non-refoulement interview, or granted \n \n6    entry into or detained within the United States if they did. DHS does not provide \n \n7    the lawyers documents or any explanation for the decision. \n \n8    128.  Without the opportunity for meaningful and confidential \n \n9  communication with counsel, individuals who undergo non-refoulement interviews \n10  fail to understand the elaborate legal framework under which USCIS is judging their \n11  claims. They do not know under which part of that framework UCSIS believes their \n12  cases may fall short and require additional testimony. They do not know whether \n13  they may volunteer additional or unsolicited testimony relevant to their claims. Even \n14  if they know that they may do so, they do not know what additional information \n15  would be relevant to volunteer. Many are so traumatized that they experience \n16  difficulty remembering to voluteer information. \n17  129.  The presence of a lawyer to elicit relevant information during the \n18  interview would ensure a full record by eliciting testimony that adjudicators may \n19  overlook and asylum seekers lacking background in U.S. immigration law do not \n20  know they should volunteer. \n21  130.  The ability to confidentially consult with a lawyer prior to the \n22  interview would ensure individuals are better prepared to present all relevant \n23  information to the asylum officer, thereby creating a full record. \n24  131.  The denial of confidential access to counsel before non-refoulement \n25  interviews and the refusal to allow attorneys to participate in such interviews \n26  increases the risk that individuals and families who face a likelihood of persecution \n27  or torture will be wrongfully returned to Mexico. \n28 \n    17    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.18   Page 18 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    132.  To provide such access to and participation by counsel would impose \n \n2   little or no burden on Defendants compared to the gravity of the interests at stake for \n \n3   persons facing a forced return to Mexico and the risk of error arising from denial of \n \n4   such access to and participation by counsel. \n \n5    133.  To the extent Defendants might be burdened by allowing detained \n \n6   individuals subject to MPP to have confidential access to counsel before non-\n \n7   refoulement interviews or the participation of counsel during such interviews, any \n \n8   such burden is a problem of Defendants’ own making by virtue of electing to \n \n9  implement the MPP program or detain persons who express fear of return to Mexico \n10  under that program. \n11  VII.  Access to Counsel is Required in Similar Adjudications \n12  134.  The legal standard that the government asserts applies to MPP non-\n13  refoulement procedures is whether it is more likely than not that the alien would be \n14  persecuted in Mexico on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, \n15  membership in a particular social group, or political opinion or would more likely \n16  than not be tortured.  \n17  135.  That standard is the same as or similar to the legal standards for \n18  granting withholding of removal pursuant to the INA or the Convention Against \n19  Torture (“CAT”). 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b). \n20  136.  According to Defendants, non-refoulement interviews are carried out \n21  pursuant to standards and procedures that are nearly identical to those regulating \n22  CFIs and Reasonable Fear Interviews (“RFIs”). 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(d); 208.31(c). \n23  137.  For example, MPP’s implementing guidance provides the USCIS \n24  officer should conduct the non-refoulement interview in a non-adversarial manner, \n25  separate and apart from the general public. The purpose of the interview is to elicit \n26  all relevant and useful information bearing on whether the alien would more likely \n27  than not face persecution.  \n28 \n    18    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.19   Page 19 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    138.  By comparison, the CFI regulations provide asylum officers “will \n \n2   conduct the interview in a non-adversarial manner, separate and apart from the \n \n3   general public. The purpose of the interview shall be to elicit all relevant and useful \n \n4   information….” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d).  \n \n5    139.  Similarly, the RFI regulations provide asylum officers “shall conduct \n \n6   the interview in a non-adversarial manner, separate and apart from the general \n \n7   public.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c). \n \n8    140.  The statute and regulations governing CFIs, RFIs, and applications for \n \n9  withholding of removal—all of which involve adjudication of persecution or torture \n10  claims—all provide for access to counsel or a representative of the individual’s \n11  choosing before and during the interviews or hearings. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 \n12  C.F.R. §§ 292.5(b); 208.30(d)(4); 208.31(c).  \n13  141.  DHS, through its practice, acknowledges that individuals, including \n14  those in DHS custody, have a right to confidentially consult with counsel before \n15  such adjudications. \n16  142.  In criminal cases, this Court has required CBP to provide attorneys \n17  access to their clients in ports of entry and Border Patrol stations within its \n18  jurisdiction, notwithstanding any assertions of limited capacity and resources. \n19  Provision of such access has not meaningfully impacted Defendants’ ability to \n20  orderly and efficiently process individuals.  \n21  143.  However, Defendants prohibit all confidential access to retained \n22  counsel for persons in their custody before non-refoulement interviews conducted \n23  under MPP and prohibit retained counsel from being present during and \n24  participating in such non-refoulement interviews.  \n25     \n26 \n27 \n28 \n    19    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.20   Page 20 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n2 \n \nI.  Defendants’ Policy and Practice of Denying Access to Counsel to MPP \n \n3  Respondents Awaiting and Undergoing Non-Refoulement Interviews \n \n \n4  144.  Defendant DHS has a written policy mandating a blanket denial of \n \n \n5  access to counsel to individuals subject to MPP who are in its custody while \n \n \n6  awaiting and during non-refoulement interviews. \n \n \n7  145.  Defendant CBP has a longstanding policy and practice of denying \n \n \n8  attorneys visitation or confidential communication with their clients who are \n \n \n9  detained in ports of entry and Border Patrol stations in California.    \n10  146.  Defendant CBP detains all individuals referred for non-refoulement \n11  interviews, and it holds them for up to a week or more under the conditions \n12  described above.  \n13  147.  Since MPP has been implemented, Plaintiffs and numerous other \n14  individuals represented by counsel have been held in CBP custody in California \n15  while awaiting non-refoulement interviews.  \n16  148.  They have all been denied confidential communication with their \n17  attorneys during their confinement, as well as the participation and representation of \n18  their attorneys during their non-refoulement interviews.  \n19  149.  As long as MPP is in operation, Defendants will continue to take \n20  individuals represented by counsel into CBP custody in California for non-\n21  refoulement interviews, deny such individuals confidential communication with \n22  their attorneys before such interviews, and deprive such individuals of the presence \n23  or participation of their attorneys during the interviews.   \n24  II.  This Case Meets the Requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 \n25  150.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and \n26  23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated.  \n27   \n28   \n    20    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.21   Page 21 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    151.  The proposed class is defined as follows: \n   \n2 \n  All individuals who are detained in CBP custody in California \n  awaiting or undergoing non-refoulement interviews pursuant to what \n3 \n  the government calls the “Migrant Protection Protocols” program and \n  who have retained lawyers.  \n4 \n \n  152.  The proposed class is so numerous and membership in the class so \n5 \n \n fluid or transitory that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n6 \n \n  153.  Through September 2019, about 380 individuals forced into the MPP \n7 \n \n program whose cases are before the San Diego immigration court have been \n8 \n \nrepresented by counsel.    \n9 \n154.  All members of the class are equally subject to Defendants’ policy and \n10 \npractice of denying access to counsel while awaiting and during MPP non-\n11 \nrefoulement interviews. \n12 \n155.  Common questions of law or fact exist as to all class members, \n13 \nincluding but not necessarily limited to the following: \n14 \na.  whether they are detained in CBP custody awaiting non-refoulement \n15 \ninterviews as part of MPP; \n16 \nb.  whether they are denied confidential visitation or communication with \n17 \nretained counsel while in custody awaiting the interviews; \n18 \nc.  whether they are denied the participation or representation of their \n19 \nattorneys in the interviews; \n20 \nd.  whether such denial of access to counsel violates the APA; \n21 \ne.  whether such denial of access to counsel violates the INA; \n22 \nf.  whether such denial of access to counsel violates the procedural \n23 \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; \n24 \ng.  whether such denial of access to counsel violates the substantive \n25 \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and \n26 \nh.  whether such denial of access to counsel violates the First \n27 \nAmendment; \n28 \n    21    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.22   Page 22 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    156.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the class as a whole, \n \n2   because both Plaintiffs and the class members have been similarly detained in CBP \n \n3   custody and denied access to counsel while awaiting and during MPP non-\n \n4   refoulement interviews.   \n \n5    157.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.  \n \n6   Plaintiffs have no interests separate from those of the class with respect to the claims \n \n7   and issues in this case.   \n \n8    158.  Counsel for Plaintiffs are experienced in complex class action, civil \n \n9  rights, and immigrants’ rights litigation. \n10  159.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally \n11  applicable to the class by refusing to allow confidential access to retained counsel \n12  while individuals await MPP non-refoulement interviews and refusing to allow \n13  retained counsel to be present or participate in the interviews themselves, thereby \n14  making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate with respect to the class as \n15  a whole. \n16  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM \n17 \nViolation of Statutory Right to Counsel \n18 \n160.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all the allegations above and incorporate \n19 \nthem by reference here. \n20 \n161.  Under the APA, a “person compelled to appear in person before an \n21 \nagency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and \n22 \nadvised by counsel….” 5 U.S.C. § 555(b).  \n23 \n162.  Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are compelled to appear \n24 \nbefore an agency for non-refoulement interviews and are denied the accompaniment, \n25 \nrepresentation, and advice of counsel before and during such interviews, in violation \n26 \nof the APA.  \n27 \n163.  No other statute, including the INA, has superceded the APA’s right to \n28 \ncounsel in the context of non-refoulement interviews. 5 U.S.C. § 559. \n    22    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.23   Page 23 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1    164.  In the alternative, if the INA does supercede the APA’s right to \n \n2   counsel, then Defendants’ policies and practices violate the statutory right to counsel \n \n3   contained in the INA. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362.  \n \n4    165.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of the statutory right to \n \n5   counsel, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer a significant deprivation \n \n6   of their right to counsel while detained and awaiting or undergoing non-refoulement \n \n7   interviews.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law to address \n \n8   the wrongs described herein.  The relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent \n \n9  continued and future irreparable injury. \n \n10 \nSECOND CLAIM  \nViolation of § 706(2) of APA for Agency Action that is in Excess of Statutory \n11 \nAuthority, Not in Accordance with Law, and Arbitrary and Capricious  \n12  166.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all the allegations above and incorporate \n13  them by reference here. \n14  167.  Under the APA, courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \n15  action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n16  accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, \n17  or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n18  168.  Defendants’ policy and practice of denying access to counsel as \n19  described herein is final agency action and otherwise meets the APA’s prerequisites \n20  for judicial review. \n21  169.  Every non-refoulement decision for each Plaintiff and class member is \n22  also final agency action regarding their refoulement claims. \n23  170.  Defendants’ policy and practice of denying access to counsel in non-\n24  refoulement interviews is in excess of statutory authority and not in accordance with \n25  law because it violates Plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional right to counsel. \n26  171.  Defendants’ policy and practice is arbitrary and capricious because it \n27  creates arbitrary distinctions between MPP non-refoulement interviews and nearly \n28  identical fear determination procedures that require access to counsel and because \n    23    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.24   Page 24 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   there is no rational connection between the policy and Defendants’ stated \n \n2   justifications for it. \n \n3    172.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of § 706(2) of the \n \n4   APA, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer a significant deprivation of \n \n5   their right to counsel while detained and awaiting or undergoing non-refoulement \n \n6   interviews. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at law to address \n \n7   the wrongs described herein. The relief sought by Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent \n \n8   continued and future irreparable injury. \n \n9 \nTHIRD CLAIM \nViolation of Procedural Due Process  \n10 \n173.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all the allegations above and incorporate \n11 \nthem by reference here. \n12 \n174.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. \n13 \nConstitution provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or \n14 \nproperty, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. V. \n15 \n175.  Once immigration detainees have retained counsel, procedural due \n16 \nprocess requires that they have adequate opportunities to visit and communicate \n17 \nwith their lawyers confidentially.  \n18 \n176.  Once immigration detainees have retained counsel, procedural due \n19 \nprocess requires that their attorneys be allowed to participate in proceedings such as \n20 \nnon-refoulement interviews. \n21 \n177.  Defendants are violating procedural due process by refusing to allow \n22 \ndetainees to communicate confidentially with their lawyers before non-refoulement \n23 \ninterviews and refusing to allow their lawyers to participate in such interviews. \n24 \n178.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of the procedural \n25 \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to \n26 \nsuffer a significant deprivation of their right to counsel while detained and awaiting \n27 \nor undergoing non-refoulement interviews.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or \n28 \n    24    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.25   Page 25 of 28\n \n \n \n \n1   complete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. The relief sought by \n \n2   Plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and future irreparable injury. \n   \n3 \n  FOURTH CLAIM \n  Violation of Substantive Due Process  \n4 \n \n  179.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all the allegations above and incorporate \n5 \n \n them by reference here. \n6 \n \n  180.  The Due Process Clause has a substantive component prohibiting the \n7 \n \n government from taking certain actions under any circumstances. \n8 \n \n181.  Pretrial detainees have a subs tantive due process right not to be housed \n9 \nunder conditions of confinement that amount to punishment. \n10 \n182.  Conditions of confinement are presumed to amount to punishment if \n11 \nthey are identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those under which pretrial \n12 \ncriminal detainees are held, or if the individual is detained under conditions more \n13 \nrestrictive than those he or she would face upon commitment.  \n14 \n183.  Conditions of confinement that unreasonably restrict civil detainees’ \n15 \nability to consult with their attorneys and to prepare their defense are \n16 \nunconstitutional. \n17 \n184.  Defendants are violating substantive due process by refusing to allow \n18 \ndetainees to communicate confidentially with their lawyers before non-refoulement \n19 \ninterviews and refusing to allow their lawyers to participate in such interviews.  \n20 \n185.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of the substantive \n21 \ncomponent of the Due Process Clause, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to \n22 \nsuffer a significant deprivation of their right to counsel while detained and awaiting \n23 \nor undergoing non-refoulement interviews. Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or \n24 \ncomplete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein. The relief sought by \n25 \nPlaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and future irreparable injury. \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n    25    \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 1   Filed 11/05/19   PageID.26   Page 26 of 28\n \n \n \n  FIFTH CLAIM \n1 \n  Violation of the First Amendment \n  of the United States Constitution \n2 \n \n  186.  The First Amendment guarantees the freedom of speech to all \n3 \n \n persons—including detainees. This protection encompasses the right to make \n4 \n \n telephone calls, exchange correspondence, and receive in-person visitors.  \n5 \n \n  187.  Immigrant detainees held pending a non-refoulement interview possess \n6 \n \n a First Amendment right to receive legal advice from their retained counsel.  \n7 \n \n  188.  Defendants’ policy and practice of denying individuals detained \n8 \n \npending non-refoulement interviews confid ential access to their retained counsel \n9 \nviolates the detainees’ First Amendment right to receive their counsel’s legal advice.  \n10 \n189.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of the First \n11 \nAmendment, Plaintiffs are suffering and will continue to suffer a significant \n12 \ndeprivation of their right to counsel while detained and awaiting or undergoing non-\n13 \nrefoulement interviews.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or complete remedy at \n14 \nlaw to address the wrongs described herein. The relief sought by Plaintiffs is \n15 \nnecessary to prevent continued and future irreparable injury. \n16 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n17 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs-Petitioners respectfully request that the Court:  \n18 \na.  Issue an order certifying this case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 \n19 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;  \n20 \nb.

CLASSWIDE PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \n14  CHAD F. WOLF, Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security; et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n17   \n18  On November 5, 2019, Petitioners filed a motion for class certification and a motion \n19  for temporary restraining order (“TRO”) to allow Petitioners access to their retained \n20  counsel  prior  to  and  during  Petitioners’  non-refoulement  interviews  under  the \n21  Government’s Migrant Protection Protocols Program (“MPP” or “Remain in Mexico”).  \n22  Pursuant to the MPP, asylum seekers arriving at the United States Border by land from \n23  Mexico are returned to Mexico to await the outcome of their immigration proceedings.  \n24  Bound by the duty of non-refoulement, however, Respondents may not return an asylum \n25  seeker to Mexico if the individual can show he or she faces persecution or torture in \n26  Mexico.  Instead, the asylum seeker is taken out of the MPP and paroled or detained in the \n27  United States to await their removal proceedings. \n28 \n1 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1254   Page 2 of 21\n \n1  On November 12, 2019, the Court granted Petitioners’ motion for TRO and ordered \n2  Respondents to allow Petitioners access to their retained counsel prior to and during their \n3  non-refoulement interviews.  Doe v. McAleenan, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2019 WL 6605880, at \n4  *5 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2019).  Petitioner Cristian Doe was interviewed two days later by \n5  an U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) Asylum Officer.  Three attorneys \n6  for Doe were present telephonically.  The Asylum Officer found it is more likely than not \n7  that Petitioners will be persecuted or tortured if they are returned to Mexico.  Consequently, \n8  the Doe family was taken out of the MPP and released from Customs and Border Patrol \n9  (“CBP”) custody.  They are still awaiting the remainder of their immigration case.   \n10    The Court has certified a class action to include similarly situated asylum seekers.  \n11  Petitioners now request classwide injunctive relief to allow for access to retained counsel \n12  prior to and during their non-refoulement interviews.  The matter has been fully briefed \n13  and argued.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court reaffirms its conclusion that \n14  Petitioners have met their burden and that the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), \n15  specifically 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides a right to retained counsel in these circumstances.   \n16  I.   \n17  BACKGROUND \n18    Petitioners’ and Respondents’ declarations provide the following background facts.  \n19  Petitioners are the parents of a family of five children that fled their home country of \n20  Guatemala after suffering extortion, death threats, and rape.  (Mot. for TRO, Declaration \n21  of Cristian Doe (“Cristian Doe Decl.”), at ¶¶ 2, 4).  Like many families, Petitioners traveled \n22  through Mexico to seek asylum in the United States.  (Id. at ¶ 7).  While in Mexico, \n23  Petitioners and their children were threatened at gun point, assaulted, robbed, and stripped \n24  of their clothing.  (Mot. for TRO at 14).  Their attackers, masked men clothed in what \n25  appeared to be Mexican government uniforms, threatened to kill Petitioners if they reported \n26  the incident.  (Id.).  Petitioners and their children were left terrified. (Id.). Upon reaching \n27  the United States, Petitioners immediately requested asylum.  (Id.).   \n28 \n2 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1255   Page 3 of 21\n \n1  Prior to the MPP, asylum seekers arriving at the Southern border were usually placed \n2  in expedited removal proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  If they expressed a fear of \n3  persecution or torture upon removal to their country of origin, the asylum seekers were \n4  given a credible fear interview (“CFI”) to determine whether there was a significant \n5  possibility they would establish eligibility for asylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Before \n6  such interviews, asylum seekers had a right to consult with counsel.  8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(d), \n7  208.31(c).  If the asylum seekers passed their CFIs, they were placed in full removal \n8  proceedings before an Immigration Judge (“IJ”) to present their asylum claims.  8 U.S.C. \n9  §§  1229a(c)(4),  1225(b)(1)(B)(ii);  8  C.F.R.  §§  208.30,  235.3.    While  awaiting  their \n10  removal proceedings, the asylum seekers were often paroled into the United States.     \n11  The process changed in January of 2019 when the Department of Homeland Security \n12  (“DHS”) instituted the MPP: “an unprecedented action” meant to “address the urgent \n13  humanitarian and security crisis at the Southern border.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 2 \n14  at 4).  Pursuant to the MPP, “individuals arriving in or entering the United States from \n15  Mexico—illegally or without proper documentation—may be returned to Mexico for the \n16  duration of their immigration proceedings.”  (Id., Ex. 1 at 1).  Asylum seekers within the \n17  MPP are given “Notice[s] to Appear” for their immigration court hearings and await such \n18  hearings in Mexico.  (Id. at 2).  In effect, the MPP replaces expedited removal proceedings \n19  and CFIs for certain asylum seekers.  (Id., Ex. 2 at 7).  The MPP is authorized by the \n20  Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), which provides that asylum seekers “arriving \n21  on land . . .  from a foreign territory contiguous to the United States” may be returned “to \n22  that territory pending [their immigration] proceeding[s.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C). \n23  In implementing the MPP, DHS officials must act consistent with the principle of \n24  non-refoulement.  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 3 at 11).  This principle, contained in both \n25  Article 33 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees1 and Article 3 of the \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n28 \n1 July 28, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 150.  \n3 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1256   Page 4 of 21\n \n1  Convention Against Torture,2 prohibits the return of an individual to a country in which he \n2  or she would more likely than not be persecuted or tortured.  (Id. at 10–11).  As applied to \n3  the MPP, asylum seekers must first express a fear of returning to Mexico, and those that \n4  do are then detained by CBP pending a non-refoulement interview with USCIS Asylum \n5  Officers.  (Id. at 11 n.4).  During this interview, the Asylum Officer “elicit[s] all relevant \n6  and useful information” regarding the likelihood the asylum seeker will face persecution \n7  and torture upon his or her return to Mexico.  (Id., Ex. 4 at 15).  The interview “can last up \n8  to several hours, during which time the [asylum seeker] is often handcuffed.”  (Mot. for \n9  TRO at 16; Cristian Doe Decl. at ¶¶ 25–26).  If the asylum seeker passes the non-\n10  refoulement interview, he or she is removed from the MPP and is either released on parole \n11  or detained in the United States pending removal proceedings.  (Mot. for TRO at 17).  If \n12  the asylum seeker does not pass, he or she must await the outcome of their removal \n13  proceedings in Mexico. (Id.).   \n14  Pursuant to DHS policy, asylum seekers cannot communicate with retained counsel \n15  prior to or during non-refoulement interviews.3  In practice, asylum seekers are given \n16  sporadic access to counsel—prior to their interviews, asylum seekers may have monitored \n17  calls with their attorneys if the phones are working, and during their interviews, asylum \n18  seekers are “sometimes” given access to counsel “on an ad hoc basis.”  (Id. at 18; Resp. in \n19  Opp’n to Prelim. Inj., Declaration of Ashley B. Caudill-Mirillo (“Caudill-Mirillo Decl.”), \n20  at ¶ 3).  DHS maintains, however, that providing asylum seekers with access to retained \n21  counsel is not required by law.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at 18–19).  \n22 \n                                                \n23 \n2 Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85.  \n24 \n3 USCIS states in its Policy Memorandum concerning the implementation of the MPP, \n25  “[P]rovided the [non-refoulement interviews] are part of either primary or secondary \ninspection, DHS is currently unable to provide access to counsel during the [interviews] \n26 \ngiven the limited capacity and resources at ports-of-entry and Border Patrol stations as well \n27  as the need for orderly and efficient processing of individuals.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, \nEx. 4 at 15).  USCIS does not state in writing whether there is a right to access retained \n28 \ncounsel if the interview occurs outside of primary or secondary inspection.   \n4 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1257   Page 5 of 21\n \n1  In accordance with the MPP, Petitioners and their children were returned to Mexico \n2  to await their immigration proceedings.  (Mot. for TRO at 14).  At their first immigration \n3  court hearing, Petitioners articulated a fear of return to Mexico and were given separate \n4  non-refoulement interviews.  They did not have counsel present.  (Caudill-Mirillo Decl. at \n5  ¶ 5; Cristian Doe Decl. at ¶ 26; Rep. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 9).  Petitioners did \n6  not pass their interviews and were returned to Mexico.  (Caudill-Mirillo Decl. at ¶ 5).  \n7  Petitioners again articulated their fear of returning to Mexico at their third immigration \n8  court hearing, in which retained counsel was present.  (Mot. for TRO at 19).  The family \n9  was then detained by CBP to await a second non-refoulement interview.  (Id.).  Petitioners \n10  were not given confidential access to retained counsel.  (Id.)   \n11  Petitioners filed suit the same day on which they expressed a fear of returning to \n12  Mexico in immigration court.  Petitioners sought a temporary restraining order to enjoin \n13  Respondents from prohibiting access to retained counsel and moved for class certification.  \n14  The Court granted Petitioners’ motion for a temporary restraining order and thereafter \n15  certified  the  class.    The  Court  now  determines  whether  Petitioners  are  entitled  to  a \n16  classwide preliminary injunction that requires Respondents to provide asylum seekers \n17  access to retained counsel prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  \n18  II.   \n19  DISCUSSION \n20  Before addressing the merits of injunctive relief, the Court considers Respondents’ \n21  jurisdictional arguments, including that the INA forecloses judicial review of Petitioners’ \n22  claims and that the rule of non-inquiry bars judicial review of non-refoulement procedures.  \n23  The INA prohibits judicial review of a “decision or action” that is “in the discretion of the \n24  Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  \n25  Respondents assert this jurisdictional bar extends not only to decisions to return asylum \n26  seekers to Mexico pending removal proceedings—which this case does not concern—but \n27  also extends to “the procedures used to arrive at those decisions.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to \n28  Prelim. Inj. at 13).  In support, Respondents cite Gebhardt v. Nielsen, in which the Ninth \n5 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1258   Page 6 of 21\n \n1  Circuit held it did not have jurisdiction to review the plaintiff’s statutory claim attacking \n2  the USCIS’s denial of his I-130 petition because of the INA’s jurisdictional bar.  Gebhardt \n3  v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980, 987 (9th Cir. 2018).  In that case, the Ninth Circuit noted that it \n4  did  not  matter  whether  the  plaintiff  “characterize[d]  his  claims  as  challenges  to  the \n5  substantive  standards  that  the  Secretary  [of  DHS]  use[d]”  or  as  challenges  to  the \n6  Secretary’s ultimate decision.  Id.  Either way, the Court lacked jurisdiction to review the \n7  claim because “[t]he standards by which the Secretary reaches a decision within his or her \n8  ‘sole and unreviewable discretion’—and the methods by which the Secretary adopts those \n9  standards—are just as unreviewable as the Secretary’s ultimate decisions themselves.”  Id. \n10  (citing Ortiz v. Meissner, 179 F.3d 718, 722 (9th Cir. 1999)).  Respondents argue the same \n11  logic applies here: Petitioners’ claims attack “the procedures used to arrive at the ultimate \n12  decisions to return [asylum seekers] to Mexico” and those procedures are not subject to \n13  judicial review.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at 14).   \n14  Respondents’ argument distorts Petitioners’ claim.  Petitioners are not challenging \n15  Respondents’ decisions to return asylum seekers to Mexico or the substantive standards \n16  used to determine whether an asylum seeker will face persecution or torture upon return to \n17  Mexico.  Petitioners’ claim is narrow in its attack on Respondents’ policy prohibiting \n18  access to retained counsel prior to and during non-refoulement interviews—an issue that is \n19  collateral to the outcome of the interview, and therefore within the Court’s jurisdiction.  \n20  See Gebhardt, 879 F.3d at 987 (“[W]e can review a claim in this context only if it \n21  challenges a genuinely collateral action”) (emphasis in original); Hernandez v. Sessions, \n22  872 F.3d 976, 988 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[Section] 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) restricts jurisdiction only \n23  with respect to the executive’s exercise of discretion.”); Make the Road N.Y. v. McAleenan, \n24  405 F. Supp. 3d 1, 31 (D.D.C. 2019) (“[S]ection 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) relates to judicial review \n25  of ‘denials of discretionary relief[,]’ . . . and nothing about Plaintiffs’ claims challenges \n26  relief at all, much less discretionary relief or denials thereof.”) (internal citations omitted).  \n27  To hold otherwise, as Petitioners argue, would be to grant Respondents the unreviewable \n28  freedom to determine the results of non-refoulement interviews with a “Ouija board” or \n6 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1259   Page 7 of 21\n \n1  “prevent persons from speaking” or “bind and gag” asylum seekers during the interview.  \n2  (Rep. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 3).  The Court, therefore, has jurisdiction over \n3  Petitioners’ claim.   \n4  As to Respondents’ argument that the rule of non-inquiry bars judicial review of \n5  Petitioners’ claim, the Court reaffirms its conclusion that the rule of non-inquiry does not \n6  apply because Petitioners are not challenging extradition or return decisions.  (Order \n7  Granting TRO at 5–6 n.2).  Petitioners seek to vindicate rights provided to them under \n8  federal law, specifically the APA, and do not seek relief under the Convention Against \n9  Torture or any extradition statute.   \n10  With  these  findings,  the  Court  considers  whether  Petitioners  are  entitled  to  a \n11  classwide preliminary injunction.  Injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may \n12  only be awarded upon a clear showing that the [petitioner] is entitled to such relief.”  Winter \n13  v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To meet that showing, Petitioners \n14  must  demonstrate  “ ‘[they  are]  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of \n15  preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and that an injunction is \n16  in the public interest.’ ”  Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, \n17  1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).  Petitioners have met each factor.  \n18  A. Likelihood of Success  \n19  “The first factor under Winter is the most important—likely success on the merits.”  \n20  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015).  While Petitioners carry the \n21  burden of demonstrating likelihood of success, they are not required to prove their case in \n22  full at the preliminary injunction stage but only such portions that enable them to obtain \n23  the injunctive relief they seek.  See Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \n24  As explained in the Order granting Petitioners’ motion for TRO, Petitioners contend \n25  they are likely to succeed on the merits because 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) provides asylum seekers \n26  the right to access counsel of their choice prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  \n27  Petitioners argue that because the INA does not contain any statutory provision concerning \n28  access to retained counsel and non-refoulement interviews, the APA provision providing \n7 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1260   Page 8 of 21\n \n1  such access remains in effect.  See 5 U.S.C. § 559 (“Subsequent statute may not be held to \n2  supersede or modify [the APA’s protection of the right to access of retained counsel], \n3  except to the extent that it does so expressly.”).  Respondents argue § 555(b) of the APA \n4  does not apply in any immigration proceeding, the INA provides no right to access retained \n5  counsel prior to or during non-refoulement interviews, non-refoulement interviews occur \n6  during primary and secondary inspections, and finally, even if the INA did not supplant the \n7  APA here, § 555(b) does not apply.  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \n8  In opposition to the preliminary injunction, Respondents revive their argument that \n9  two  Supreme  Court  cases,  Ardestani  v.  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  and \n10  Marcello v. Bonds, hold the INA displaces the APA in all “immigration proceedings”—\n11  immigration being broadly defined.  Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 219 (1991); Marcello v. \n12  Bonds, 349 U.S. 302 (1955).  The Court reaffirms its previous decision: neither case stands \n13  for the proposition Respondents proffer.  The Supreme Court held in Marcello that § 242(b) \n14  of the INA, the precursor to the modern removal proceeding statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, \n15  supplants the APA as the “sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings.”  \n16  Marcello, 349 U.S. at 310.  Relying on its decision in Marcello, the Supreme Court held in \n17  Ardestani that deportation proceedings are not within the scope of the Equal Access to \n18  Justice Act (“EAJA”) because “deportation proceeding[s] [are] not subject to the APA.”  \n19  Ardestani, 502 U.S. at 134.  Both cases emphasize the INA’s “laborious adaptation of the \n20  [APA] to the deportation process” and the INA’s language asserting that it “shall be the \n21  sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings.”  Id. at 134 (quoting Marcello, \n22  349 U.S. at 310).  Distilled to their core holdings, both cases concern solely deportation \n23  proceedings, not all immigration proceedings.   \n24  The problem is the Supreme Court’s language in Ardestani is not specific.  In stating \n25  the question before the Court, the Court writes: “We now consider whether the EAJA \n26  authorizes  the  award  of  attorney’s  fees  and  costs  for  administrative  deportation \n27  proceedings before the INS.”  Id. at 131 (emphasis added).  The Court later replaces the \n28  phrase ‘deportation proceedings’ with ‘immigration proceedings’ and states: “Although \n8 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1261   Page 9 of 21\n \n1  immigration proceedings are required by statute to be determined on the record after a \n2  hearing  . . . , we previously have decided that they are not governed by the APA.”  Id. at \n3  132  (citing  Marcello,  349  U.S.  302).    We  know,  however,  that  not  all  immigration \n4  proceedings ‘are required by statute to be determined on the record after a hearing.’  The \n5  immigration proceeding at issue here, a non-refoulement interview, is undeniably not \n6  determined on the record after a hearing.  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 4 at 15–16).  Do \n7  we take the Supreme Court’s language to mean that all immigration proceedings must be \n8  determined on the record after a hearing?  Or, do we understand the Supreme Court’s \n9  language to concern the narrower category of deportation proceedings?  The Court finds \n10  the latter, most importantly because the Supreme Court’s decision in Marcello requires \n11  such an interpretation.  In comparison, there is no Supreme Court precedent holding the \n12  INA supplants the APA in all immigration proceedings.    \n13  Respondents argue the Court’s reading of these two cases is not correct, for if it was, \n14  then § 555(b) of the APA would necessarily extend to expedited removal proceedings.  (Id. \n15  at 17).  Respondents contend this cannot be right because “courts have repeatedly and \n16  unequivocally concluded the APA right-to-counsel provision does not govern expedited \n17  removal proceedings.”  (Id. at 17 (citing United States v. Barajas, 655 F.3d 1077, 1088 \n18  (9th Cir. 2011); United States v. Quinteros Guzman, No. 3:18-cr-00031-001, 2019 WL \n19  3220576, at *10 (W.D. Va. July 17, 2019))).  Respondents’ argument is a non sequitur \n20  because  expedited  removal  proceedings  and  non-refoulement  interviews  are  not \n21  comparable immigration proceedings. The INA provision concerning expedited removal \n22  proceedings is complex, specialized, and specific to expedited removal proceedings.  See \n23  8 U.S.C. § 1225.  The INA contains no provision concerning non-refoulement interviews.  \n24  This  difference  is  crucial  in  this  context:  the  INA’s  expedited  removal  proceeding \n25  provision supersedes the APA, whereas the INA’s lack of mention of non-refoulement \n26  interview does not.  See 5 U.S.C. § 559 (“Subsequent statute may not be held to supersede \n27  or modify [the APA’s protection of the right to access of retained counsel], except to the \n28  extent that it does so expressly.”); United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538–39 (1955) \n9 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1262   Page 10 of 21\n \n1  (“It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute, rather than \n2  to emasculate an entire section, as the Government's interpretation requires) (internal \n3  quotation omitted); Barajas, 655 F.3d at 1088 (“The cases cited by [the plaintiff] involve \n4  aliens in the more formal removal proceedings, where the regulations provide a right of \n5  counsel, as compared to expedited removal proceedings, where they do not.”); Kim v. \n6  Ashcroft, 340 F. Supp. 2d 384, 393 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“[A]lthough there is no statutory or \n7  regulatory deadline by which [Citizenship and Immigration Services] must adjudicate an \n8  application, at some point, defendants’ failure to take any action runs afoul of section \n9  555(b) [of the APA]”).  Holding the INA fails to supplant the APA for non-refoulement \n10  interview procedures says nothing about whether the INA supplants the APA for expedited \n11  removal proceedings.  \n12  Next, Respondents argue the INA does not provide a right to access retained counsel \n13  prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  Although Respondents agree there is “no \n14  statutory or regulatory provision” addressing the issue, Respondents contend that this \n15  silence buttresses their conclusion that the INA does not provide for a right to access \n16  retained counsel.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at 18).  Respondents cite the Ninth \n17  Circuit’s decision in Barajas in support of their argument.  In that case, the court held that \n18  aliens  do  not  have a  right to  counsel  in  expedited  removal  proceedings  because  the \n19  expedited removal proceeding provision of the INA does not provide for one, unlike the \n20  formal  removal  proceeding  provision,  which  does.    Barajas,  655  F.3d  at  1088.  \n21  Respondents argue the same logic applies here.  The INA is silent on whether asylum \n22  seekers  may  access retained counsel prior  to  and during non-refoulement  interviews, \n23  whereas the INA provides access to retained counsel prior to CFIs and during formal \n24  removal proceedings.  Therefore, Respondents argue, the INA does not provide asylum \n25  seekers access to retained counsel in the non-refoulement interview context.  \n26  Respondents’ argument is not persuasive.  It is impossible to evince from the INA \n27  whether there is a right to counsel in non-refoulement interviews because the INA does not \n28 \n10 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1263   Page 11 of 21\n \n1  mention non-refoulement interviews at all.4  In Barajas, the court’s reasoning necessarily \n2  depends on Congressional consideration of both expedited removal proceedings and formal \n3  removal proceedings. Barajas, 655 F.3d at 1088 (“The cases cited by [the plaintiff] involve \n4  aliens in the more formal removal proceedings, where the regulations provide a right of \n5  counsel, as compared to expedited removal proceedings, where they do not.”); see also 8 \n6  C.F.R. § 287.3 (“Except in the case of an alien subject to the expedited removal provisions \n7  of section 235(b)(1)(A) of the Act, an alien arrested without warrant and placed in formal \n8  proceedings under section 238 or 240 of the Act will be advised of . . . the right to be \n9  represented at no expense of the Government.”). Here, there is no such Congressional \n10  consideration.  Therefore, the Court stands by its prior conclusion that the INA does not \n11  foreclose asylum seekers the right to access retained counsel prior to and during non-\n12  refoulement interviews.   \n13  Respondents  also  argue  the  regulation  prohibiting  individuals  from  accessing \n14  retained counsel during primary and secondary inspection precludes the Court’s conclusion \n15 \n                                                \n16 \n17  4 At oral argument, counsel for Respondents argued the INA’s provision concerning the \nreturn of asylum seekers to contiguous territories pending their immigration proceedings \n18 \nconstitutes a statutory provision concerning non-refoulement interviews.  (Rep. Tr. (Draft) \n19  at 19–20, Dec. 20, 2019); See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(c).  Respondents asked the Court to \ncompare § 1225(b)(2)(c) to § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), which provides for the right to consult \n20 \nwith counsel prior to a CFI.  Respondents argued that the INA’s mention of a right to \n21  consult counsel prior to CFIs and its lack of mention of a right to access counsel in non-\nrefoulement interviews indicates there is no right to counsel in the latter immigration \n22 \nproceeding.  There is one major problem with this argument: § 1225(b)(2)(c) says nothing \n23  about the duty of non-refoulement or the mechanisms by which Respondents comply with \nthis obligation.  It is textually inappropriate to consider § 1225(b)(2)(c) a provision that \n24 \nconcerns non-refoulement interviews whatsoever.  If Respondents’ argument were true and \n25  §  1225(b)(2)(c)  concerned  the  procedures  of  a  non-refoulement  interview,  then,  by \nextension, the lack of mention of non-refoulement interviews in comparison to the detailed \n26 \nprocedures of a CFI could be used to argue Congress did not intend for there to be a duty \n27  of non-refoulement altogether.  Yet, we know this not to be true.  See Article 33 of the 1951 \nConvention Relating to the Status of Refugees; Article 3 of the Convention Against \n28 \nTorture.  Respondents’ argument is not textually sound.   \n11 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1264   Page 12 of 21\n \n1  that § 555(b) of the APA applies to non-refoulement interviews.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. \n2  Inj.  at  19).    Respondents  cite  the  USCIS’s  Policy  Memorandum  concerning  the \n3  implementation of the MPP, which states: “[P]rovided the MPP assessments are part of \n4  either primary or secondary inspection, DHS is currently unable to provide access to \n5  counsel during the assessments given the limited capacity and resources at the ports-of-\n6  entry and Border Patrol stations as well as the need for the orderly and efficient processing \n7  of individuals.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 4, at 15).  Respondents argue that, at the very \n8  least, the regulation forecloses a right to access retained counsel if the non-refoulement \n9  interview occurs during primary or secondary inspection.   \n10  There are two problems with this argument.  First, there is no evidence that a non-\n11  refoulement  interview  has  ever  occurred  during  primary  or  secondary  inspection.  \n12  Respondents’ declarations provide information concerning the number of individuals in \n13  the MPP and the number of individuals crossing the United States-Mexico border. (Resp. \n14  in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj., Declaration of Scott Garrett (“Garrett Decl.”), at ¶ 8 (“Since \n15  [implementation of the MPP] San Diego Sector has processed approximately 6,200 cases \n16  through the program . . . .  El Centro Sector has also processed approximately 6,800 cases \n17  which includes aliens apprehended by Tucson Sector  . . . .  On November 21, 2019, there \n18  were approximately 190 individuals processed by Border Patrol who were scheduled to \n19  appear in immigration court.”), Declaration of Mariza Marin (“Marin Decl.”), at ¶ 27 (“For \n20  fiscal year 2019, through the end of August, the San Ysidro POE processed more than 11 \n21  million northbound pedestrians, more than 13 million northbound vehicles, and more than \n22  34  million  northbound  travelers  altogether  .  .  .  .    San  Diego  OFO  has  processed \n23  approximately 1,110 aliens pursuant to the MPP . . . .  While daily numbers vary, there \n24  were 224 individuals scheduled for their immigration court appearance, of which 116 \n25  showed up for transport to court.”).  None of Respondents’ declarations, however, state \n26  that non-refoulement interviews are, or ever have been, conducted during primary or \n27  secondary inspection.  \n28 \n12 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1265   Page 13 of 21\n \n1  In  fact,  Respondents’  declarations  lend  themselves  to  conclude  the  opposite.  \n2  “Generally,  the  MPP  respondents  are  returned  to  Mexico  within  a  day  or  two  after \n3  encounter.”  (Marin Decl. at ¶ 17).  If an asylum seeker were to articulate a fear of returning \n4  to Mexico before he or she is processed for MPP, the asylum seeker is referred to a USCIS \n5  Asylum Officer.  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 5 at 18–19 (“If an alien who is potentially \n6  amendable to MPP affirmatively states that he or she has a fear of persecution or torture in \n7  Mexico, or a fear of return to Mexico, whether before or after they are processed for MPP \n8  or  other  disposition,  that  alien  will  be  referred  to  a  USCIS  asylum  officer  for \n9  screening . . . .”)).  It is clear that non-refoulement interviews do not occur within primary \n10  or secondary inspection.  They are conducted in separate areas by an officer of a different \n11  agency at a later time.  (Id., Ex. 4 at 15 (“[T]he USCIS officer should conduct the MPP \n12  Assessment interview in a non-adversarial manner, separate and apart from the general \n13  public.”); Cristian Doe Decl. at ¶ 17 (“After the court hearing we were returned to the \n14  [POE] before being transferred to another nearby cold holding cell. We were there for two \n15  or three days  . . . .”).  Respondents have provided no information stating otherwise.5 \n16  The second problem with Respondents’ argument is that primary and secondary \n17  inspection and non-refoulement interviews are separate immigration proceedings with \n18  different purposes.  In primary and secondary inspection, CBP officers “at the inspections \n19  booths . . . ensur[e] and facilitiat[e] lawful trade and travel, and prevent[] the introduction \n20 \n                                                \n21 \n22 \n5 At oral argument, counsel for Respondents pointed to paragraphs 12 and 24 of the Marin \n23  Declaration in support of their argument that non-refoulement interviews occur during \nprimary  and  secondary  inspection.    Paragraph  12  of  the  Marin  Declaration  states: \n24 \n“Amenable aliens arriving at the San Ysidro POE or Calexico POE are initially processed \n25  for MPP at the POE at which they attempted to enter the U.S.”  (Marin Decl. at ¶ 12).  \nParagraph 24 states: “Nor do the ports have the manpower to supervise MPP respondent \n26 \nvisits, as most officers are at the inspection booths in primary and secondary inspection \n27  ensuring  and  facilitating  lawful  trade  and  travel,  and  preventing  the  introduction  of \ncontraband  into  the  United  States.”  (Id.  at  24).    Neither  paragraph  substantiates \n28 \nRespondents’ claim.   \n13 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1266   Page 14 of 21\n \n1  of contraband into the United States.”  (Marin Decl. at ¶ 24); see also Am. Immigration \n2  Lawyers Ass’n v. Reno, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 42 (D.D.C. 1998) (“During the primary \n3  inspection stage, the immigration officer literally has only a few seconds to examine \n4  documents,  run  basic  lookout  queries,  and  ask  pertinent  questions  to  determine \n5  admissibility and issue relevant entry documents.”).  During non-refoulement interviews, \n6  the USCIS Asylum Officer’s purpose is to “elicit all relevant and useful information \n7  bearing on whether the alien would more likely than not face persecution on account of a \n8  protected ground, or torture, if the alien is returned to Mexico . . . .”  (Resp. in Opp’n to \n9  TRO, Ex. 4, at 15).  The Asylum Officer takes into account (1) the credibility of the asylum \n10  seeker’s statements, (2) commitments from the Government of Mexico regarding treatment \n11  and protection of asylum seekers, and (3) whether the alien has engaged in criminal, \n12  persecutory, or terrorist activity.  (Id. at 15–16).  This fact intensive interview can last up \n13  to several hours.  (Cristian Decl. at ¶¶ 25, 26).  Although a non-refoulement interview may \n14  be conducted close in time and space to inspection, the two immigration proceedings are \n15  separate and different—the procedures of one do not extend to the procedures of another.  \n16  Therefore,  the  regulation  prohibiting  right  to  counsel  during  primary  and  secondary \n17  inspection is irrelevant to the issue of whether there is such a right prior to and during non-\n18  refoulement interviews. \n19  Finally, Respondents argue that even if the INA fails to supersede the APA, § 555(b) \n20  of the APA does not apply to non-refoulement interviews.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. \n21  at 19–21).  Section 555(b) contains two distinct provisions on access to retained counsel.  \n22  The first provision states: “A person compelled to appear in person before an agency or \n23  representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel \n24  or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative.”  5 U.S.C. § 555(b).  The \n25  second provision states: “A party is entitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or \n26  other duly qualified representative in an agency proceeding.”  Id.  Respondents argue \n27  Petitioners  are  not  “ ‘compelled  to  appear’  at  non-refoulement  interviews”  and  non-\n28  refoulement interviews are not “agency proceedings.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at \n14 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1267   Page 15 of 21\n \n1  20).  Because the Court finds the first provision of § 555(b) applies, it will not address the \n2  applicability of the second provision. \n3  Prior to non-refoulement interviews, asylum seekers are detained in CBP custody.  \n4  (Cristian Decl. at ¶¶ 2, 22).  During the interview, asylum seekers may be handcuffed.  \n5  (Mot. for TRO, Declaration of A.V.D. (“AVD Decl.”), at ¶ 27).  Although asylum seekers \n6  must articulate a fear of return to Mexico before non-refoulement interviews commence, \n7  they are not “elect[ing] to appear at their non-refoulement interviews.”  (Res. in Opp’n to \n8  Prelim. Inj. at 20).  A non-refoulement interview is merely the next step in a long, multi-\n9  stage immigration process, and it is irrelevant to the applicability of § 555(b) whether or \n10  not Petitioners triggered that process. (See Resp. In Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 4 at 16).  To hold \n11  otherwise would suggest § 555(b) does not apply in workers’ compensation hearings—\n12  hearings that are initiated by the same individuals claiming a right to counsel under § \n13  555(b).  The Ninth Circuit has, however, held otherwise.  See Smiley v. Dir. Office of \n14  Workers Comp. Programs, 984 F.3d 278, 282 (9th Cir. 1993) (“[The plaintiff] had a \n15  statutory right to be advised and represented by counsel. 5 U.S.C.A. § 555(b).”).  Given \n16  the circumstances in which the non-refoulement interview takes place, Petitioners are \n17  “compelled” to appear for the purposes of § 555(b). \n18  The Court’s conclusion that asylum seekers have a right to access retained counsel \n19  prior to and during non-refoulement interviews is required by the text of § 555(b) and § \n20  559 of the APA.  Petitioners have established a likelihood of success on their statutory \n21  claim under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b).6 \n22  /// \n23  /// \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26 \n6 In light of Petitioners’ likelihood of success on their first claim for relief under the APA, \n27  the Court declines to address the balance of Petitioners’ statutory and constitutional claims \nunder the INA and the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  (See \n28 \nClass Action Compl. and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 1, at 23–26).   \n15 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1268   Page 16 of 21\n \n1  B. Irreparable Injury \n2  Turning to the next factor, Plaintiffs must show they are “ ‘likely to suffer irreparable \n3  harm in the absence of preliminary relief.’ ”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 994 \n4  (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).  Respondents argue Petitioners have not \n5  demonstrated an immediate threatened injury, but only a speculative injury.  (Resp. in \n6  Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at 30).  Specifically, Respondents argue that Petitioners’ showing is \n7  lacking because (1) they have not identified “any named class members who would suffer \n8  irreparable  harm  in  the  absence  of  injunctive  relief,  and  (2)  even  if  the  unnamed, \n9  unidentified class members obtained the relief sought and were able to have [an] attorney \n10  present during their interview they could very well still nonetheless be returned to Mexico.” \n11  (Id.).  Petitioners allege that without access to counsel, class members risk the irreparable \n12  harm of a non-reviewable, erroneous decision that forces them to return to Mexico to face \n13  persecution and torture.  (Mot. for TRO at 32–33).   \n14  Petitioners’ declarations provide sufficient evidence to establish a likelihood of \n15  irreparable injury.  Petitioners’ first non-refoulement interview, in which counsel was not \n16  present,  resulted  in  a  negative  assessment  of  fear.    (Caudill-Mirillo  Decl.  at  ¶  5).  \n17  Petitioners’  second  interview,  in  which  counsel  was  present,  resulted  in  a  positive \n18  assessment of fear.  (Id. at ¶ 7).  Respondents suggest Petitioners provided the USCIS \n19  Asylum Officer with information concerning “additional threats” that occurred “between \n20  the first and second interview.”  (Id.).  Petitioners’ counsel, however, notes that during the \n21  interview, she “identif[ied] discrepancies with the interpretation and add[ed] to the record \n22  by eliciting important testimony from [Petitioner] Cristian Doe.”  (Rep. in Supp. of Prelim. \n23  Inj., Declaration of Stephanie Blumberg (“Blumberg Decl.”), at ¶ 5).  The presence of \n24  counsel was clearly helpful to Petitioner Cristian Doe in presenting his fear of return to \n25  Mexico.  Given the stakes of a non-refoulement interview—the return to a country in which \n26  one may face persecution and torture—and the interview’s fact-intensive nature, it is \n27  undeniable that access to counsel is important.    \n28 \n16 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1269   Page 17 of 21\n \n1  The fact that some class members may still be returned to Mexico, despite having \n2  an attorney present during their non-refoulement interview, does not preclude a finding of \n3  irreparable injury.  Petitioners “need not further show that the action sought to be enjoined \n4  is the exclusive cause of the injury.”  M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 728 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n5  It is enough to find that injunctive relief will prevent additional suffering, persecution, and \n6  torture.  See Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 766 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding the \n7  plaintiff satisfied the irreparable injury element because the injunctive relief prevented \n8  “exacerbation  of  the  current  .  .  .  situation  and  additional  suffering”).    In  addition, \n9  deprivation of the right to retained counsel for an interview of this magnitude is an injury \n10  itself.  Accordingly, the Court finds Petitioners have shown a likelihood of irreparable \n11  injury. \n12  C. Balance of Equities \n13  “To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that ‘the \n14  balance of equities tips in his favor.’ ”  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 995 (quoting Winter, 555 \n15  U.S. at 20).  Respondents argue the balance of equities weighs against granting injunctive \n16  relief because “the Government will be required to comply with additional procedural \n17  prerequisites  in  numerous  non-refoulement  interviews  in  California  going  forward.”  \n18  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj. at 31).  Respondents further contend that an injunction \n19  would threaten national security and hinder immigration officers from addressing “the flow \n20  of illegal immigration.”  (Id.). Respondents’ declarations note the heightened security at \n21  border patrol stations, the border patrol’s limited staff and space, and the likelihood of \n22  asylum seekers’ counsel overhearing sensitive information.  (See Garrett Decl. at ¶¶ 14–\n23  17; Marin Decl. at ¶¶ 21–24).   \n24  The balance of equities weighs in favor of granting the preliminary injunction, \n25  despite Respondents’ allegations.  Although Respondents will be required to comply with \n26  additional procedural requirements prior to and during non-refoulement interviews, those \n27  procedural requirements are required by federal law, specifically the APA.  Respondents \n28  “cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense” by being \n17 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1270   Page 18 of 21\n \n1  compelled to the follow the law.  Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1983).  \n2  Furthermore, if injunctive relief is not granted, class members face the possibility of being \n3  forced to return to Mexico to suffer persecution, torture, and potentially death.  The balance \n4  of equities, therefore, favors preventing the violation of “requirements of federal law.”  \n5  Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n6  D. Public Interest \n7  The final factor for consideration is the public interest.  See Hernandez, 872 F.3d at \n8  996 (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1139 (9th Cir. 2009) (“When, as \n9  here, ‘the impact of an injunction reaches beyond the parties, carrying with it a potential \n10  for public consequences, the public interest will be relevant to whether the district court \n11  grants the preliminary injunction.’ ”))  To obtain the requested relief, “[Petitioners] must \n12  demonstrate that the public interest favors granting the injunction ‘in light of [its] likely \n13  consequences,’ i.e., ‘consequences [that are not] too remote, insubstantial, or speculative \n14  and  [are]  supported  by  evidence.’ ”      Id.  (quoting  Stormans,  586  F.3d  at  1139).  \n15  Respondents  contend  that  the  “public  interest  favors  the  efficient  administration  of \n16  immigration laws at the border” and thus, favors the Government.  (Resp. in Opp’n to \n17  Prelim. Inj. at 31 (citing Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 510 (9th Cir. \n18  2019)).  \n19  As explained in the Court’s Order granting Petitioners’ motion for TRO, the public \n20  interest is served by allowing class members access to retained counsel prior to and during \n21  non-refoulement  interviews.    It  would  not  be  “in  the  public’s  interest  to  allow \n22  [Respondents] . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when there are not \n23  adequate  remedies  available.”    Ariz.  Dream  Act  Coal.,  757  F.3d  at  1069  (quoting \n24  Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th Cir. 2012)).  Federal law, specifically the \n25  APA, requires class members to have access to retained counsel prior to and during non-\n26  refoulement interviews.  Respondents have failed to demonstrate how complying with this \n27  legal requirement will impede the efficient administration of immigration laws at the \n28  border.  Furthermore, Respondents’ argument that it lacks the staff and space required to \n18 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1271   Page 19 of 21\n \n1  comply with the APA is not persuasive, for Respondents elected to implement the MPP \n2  and detain asylum seekers in CBP custody pending non-refoulement  interviews.  As \n3  Petitioners note, Respondents “cannot bootstrap [their] choices into justifications for those \n4  choices.”  (Rep. in Supp. of Prelim. Inj. at 8).  Therefore, the public’s interest weighs in \n5  favor of granting injunctive relief.  \n6  E. In-Person Access  \n7  In its Order granting Petitioners’ motion for TRO, the Court asked the parties to \n8  address whether the APA’s right to access retained counsel provided for in-person access \n9  or only telephonic access.  Respondents contend (1) Petitioners did not demand in-person \n10  access  in  their  Complaint,  (2)  courts  have  upheld  restrictions  on  defendants’ \n11  communication with counsel within the Sixth Amendment context, and (3) § 555(b)’s right \n12  to be ‘accompanied’ does not extend to being represented in ‘an agency proceeding.’  \n13  (Resp. in Opp’n of Prelim. Inj. at 22).  Petitioners argue they expressly sought to enjoin \n14  Respondents from “preventing confidential visits” with class members in their Complaint, \n15  and therefore, demanded the appropriate relief from the outset.  (Class Action Compl. and \n16  Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 1, at 27).  Petitioners further argue it is \n17  assumed that § 555(b)’s right to counsel includes in-person access given the importance of \n18  face-to-face communication.  Neither party has provided case law concerning in-person, \n19  as opposed to telephonic, access to counsel within the context of § 555(b) of the APA.  \n20  Before considering the text of § 555(b), the Court must address whether Petitioners \n21  adequately raised the issue of in-person access to counsel in their Complaint.  It “is \n22  axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs.”  Candor v. United States, \n23  1 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 1082 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (internal quotation omitted).  Petitioners’ \n24  Complaint includes the word ‘visit’ nine times.  Petitioners allege that CBP does not “allow \n25  attorneys representing persons in its custody to visit such persons for the purpose of \n26  confidential legal advice,” and CBP has “a policy and practice of denying requests for in-\n27  person  visits  or  confidential  telephonic  communication  with  counsel  at  its  holding \n28  facilities.”  (Class Action Compl. and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 1, at 9, \n19 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 40   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1272   Page 20 of 21\n \n1  15).  Petitioners allege that as a result of CBP’s policy, “lawyers are unable to locate, visit \n2  or make confidential phone calls with their clients.”  (Id. at 16).  Petitioners also note that \n3  the common questions of law and fact as to all class members include “whether they are \n4  denied  confidential  visitation  or  communication  with  retained  counsel.”    (Id.  at  21).  \n5  Finally, Petitioners’ prayer for relief includes a request that the Court enjoin Defendants \n6  from “preventing confidential legal visits.”  (Id. at 27).  Given Petitioners’ allegations and \n7  requests of the Court in their Complaint, the Court finds the question of whether access to \n8  retained counsel includes in-person access is properly before the Court.  \n9  As noted above, § 555(b) of the APA contains two provisions providing access to \n10  retained counsel.  The Court has already found that the first provision applies to non-\n11  refoulement interviews.  This provision reads: “A person compelled to appear in person \n12  before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and \n13  advised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative.”  5 \n14  U.S.C. § 555(b).  The pertinent word is “accompanied.”  Black’s Law Dictionary defines \n15  ‘accompany’ as “[t]o go along with” or “to attend.”  Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. \n16  2019).  This definition suggests § 555(b) envisioned in-person access to counsel.  See also \n17  United States v. McPhaul, 617 F. Supp. 58, 59 (W.D.N.C. 1985) (“Under 5 U.S.C. § \n18  555(b), there is a right to have counsel present whenever a person is compelled to appear.”).  \n19  Although  Petitioners  have  conceded  telephonic  access  to  counsel  during  the  non-\n20  refoulement interviews is sufficient, Petitioners have maintained the need for in-person \n21  access prior to non-refoulement interviews.  (Rep. in Supp. of TRO at 3 n.2).  Therefore, \n22  given the text of § 555(b), class members are entitled to in-person access to retained counsel \n23  prior to their non-refoulement interviews.  \n24  III.   \n25  CONCLUSION AND ORDER \n26  For  these  reasons,  Petitioners’  motion  for  classwide  preliminary  injunction  is \n27  granted.

CLASS CERTIFICATION \n14  CHAD F. WOLF, Acting Secretary of \nHomeland Security; et al., \n15 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n16 \n17   \n18    Pending before the Court is Petitioners’ motion for class certification.  Petitioners, \n19  on behalf of themselves and putative class members, allege Respondents have a practice or \n20  policy of prohibiting asylum seekers access to retained counsel prior to and during non-\n21  refoulement interviews.  Petitioners seek to certify a class of similarly situated individuals \n22  for whom injunctive relief can be entered allowing for such access to retained counsel. \n23  On  November  12,  2019,  the  Court  granted  Petitioners’  motion  for  temporary \n24  restraining order (“TRO”) and ordered Respondents to allow Petitioners access to their \n25  retained counsel prior to and during their non-refoulement interviews.  Doe v. McAleenan, \n26  --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2019 WL 6605880, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2019).  Since the issuance \n27  of that Order, the parties have fully briefed the issue of class certification, and the Court \n28 \n1 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1235   Page 2 of 19\n \n1  has heard the arguments of counsel.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants \n2  Petitioners’ motion for class certification.  \n3  I.   \n4  DISCUSSION1 \n5    Petitioners Cristian and Diana Doe and their five children fled their home country of \n6  Guatemala in April of 2019.  (Mot. for TRO at 14).  While traveling through Mexico, \n7  Petitioners and their children were threatened at gun point, assaulted, robbed, and stripped \n8  of their clothing.  (Id.).  Upon reaching the United States, Petitioners immediately requested \n9  asylum.  (Id.).   \n10  Pursuant  to  the  Migrant  Protection  Protocols  Program  (“MPP”  or  “Remain  in \n11  Mexico”), a program instituted in January of 2019, Respondents returned Petitioners to \n12  Mexico to await their immigration proceedings.  (Id.).  While in Tijuana, the family \n13  survived a shoot-out that occurred outside their temporary shelter.  (Id. at 15).  Because of \n14  this violence and the trauma Petitioners experienced while traveling through Mexico, \n15  Petitioners  expressed  a  fear  of  returning  to  Mexico  during  an  immigration  court \n16  proceeding.  (Id. at 19).  Petitioners were given a non-refoulement interview—which \n17  assesses whether there is a likelihood the asylum seeker will face persecution or torture \n18  upon  return  to  Mexico—by  a  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services \n19  (“USCIS”) Asylum Officer.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Prelim. Inj., Declaration of Ashley Caudill-\n20  Mirillo (“Caudill-Mirillo Decl.”), at ¶ 5).  Petitioners did not pass the non-refoulement \n21  interview.  (Id.).  Petitioners expressed a fear of returning to Mexico again at a later \n22  immigration court hearing.  (Id.).  Pursuant to Respondents’ policy, Petitioners were denied \n23 \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26 \n1 The factual background set out herein is abbreviated.  A full discussion of the facts \n27  relevant to this lawsuit is set out in the Order granting Petitioners’ motion for a classwide \npreliminary injunction filed concurrently herewith and Order granting Petitioners’ motion \n28 \nfor TRO.  Doe, 2019 WL 6605880, at *1–2. \n2 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1236   Page 3 of 19\n \n1  access to their retained counsel prior to and during their non-refoulement interview.  (Mot. \n2  for Class Certification at 14).  \n3  Petitioners  filed  suit  against  Respondents,  alleging  their  policy  violated  the \n4  Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), \n5  and the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  (Class Action \n6  Compl. and Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, ECF No. 1).  Petitioners also filed motions \n7  for TRO and class certification.  The Court granted Petitioners’ motion for TRO, enjoining \n8  Respondents from prohibiting Petitioners access to retained counsel prior to and during \n9  their non-refoulement interview.  Doe, 2019 WL 6605880, at *1.  With counsel present, \n10  Petitioners ultimately passed their second non-refoulement interview.  (Caudill-Mirillo \n11  Decl. ¶ 5).  Petitioners are still awaiting the outcome of their asylum case but are no longer \n12  within the MPP.  (Rep. in Supp. of Prelim. Inj., Declaration of Stephanie Blumberg \n13  (“Blumberg Decl.”), at ¶ 9).   \n14  Petitioners, on behalf of themselves and putative class members, request certification \n15  of the following class:  \n16   \nAll individuals who are detained in CBP custody in California awaiting or \n \n17  undergoing non-refoulement interviews pursuant to what the government \n \ncalls the “Migrant Protection Protocols” program and who have retained \n18 \n \nlawyers. \n19   \n \n20  (Mot.  for  Class  Certification  at  2).    Petitioners  argue  this  proposed  class  meets  the \n21  requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).  Defendants argue \n22  these requirements are not met, Petitioners lack standing, and the class certification motion \n23  is moot.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class Certification at 6).  The only claim currently at issue and \n24  subject to class certification is Petitioners’ APA claim.2  Petitioners’ pending motion for \n25  classwide preliminary injunction is addressed in a separate order.  \n26 \n                                                \n27 \n2 As noted in the Order granting Petitioners’ motion for classwide preliminary injunction, \n28 \nthe Court declines to address the balance of Petitioners’ statutory and constitutional claims \n3 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1237   Page 4 of 19\n \n1     \n2  A. Legal Standard  \n3  “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \n4  on behalf of the individual named parties only.’”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n5  338, 348 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01 (1979)).  To qualify \n6  for the exception to individual litigation, the party seeking class certification must provide \n7  facts sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b).  \n8  Doninger v. Pac. Nw. Bell, Inc., 564 F.2d 1304, 1308–09 (9th Cir. 1977).  “The Rule ‘does \n9  not set forth a mere pleading standard.’ ”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 \n10  (2013) (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350).  “Rather, a party must not only ‘be prepared to \n11  prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact,’ \n12  typicality of claims or defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by Rule 23(a).  \n13  The party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the provisions of Rule \n14  23(b)[.]”  Id. (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350) (internal citation omitted). \n15  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a)  sets  out  four  requirements  for  class \n16  certification—numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. A \n17  showing that these requirements are met, however, does not warrant class certification. The \n18  plaintiff also must show that one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) is met.  \n19  Rule 23(b)(2) allows class treatment when “the party opposing the class has acted or \n20  refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or \n21  corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]”  Fed. R. \n22  Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Because the relief requested in a Rule 23(b)(2) class is prophylactic, \n23  inures to the benefit of each class member, and is based on accused conduct that applies \n24  uniformly to the class, notice to absent class members and an opportunity to opt out of the \n25  class are not required.  See Dukes, 564 U.S. at 361–62 (noting relief sought in a Rule \n26 \n                                                \n27 \nunder the INA and the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution in \n28 \nlight of Petitioners’ likelihood of success on their APA claim.  \n4 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1238   Page 5 of 19\n \n1  23(b)(2) class “perforce affect[s] the entire class at once” and thus, the class is “mandatory” \n2  with no opportunity to opt out). \n3  The  district  court  must  conduct  a  rigorous  analysis  to  determine  whether  the \n4  prerequisites of Rule 23 have been met.  Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982).  \n5  It  is  a  well-recognized  precept  that  “the  class  determination  generally  involves \n6  considerations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff’s \n7  cause of action.’ ”  Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 469 (1978) (quoting \n8  Mercantile Nat’l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. 555, 558 (1963)).  However, “[a]lthough \n9  some inquiry into the substance of a case may be necessary to ascertain satisfaction of the \n10  commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a), it is improper to advance a decision \n11  on the merits at the class certification stage.”  Moore v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., 708 F.2d \n12  475, 480 (9th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted); see also Nelson v. U.S. Steel Corp., 709 F.2d \n13  675, 680 (11th Cir. 1983) (plaintiff’s burden “entails more than the simple assertion of \n14  [commonality and typicality] but less than a prima facie showing of liability”) (citation \n15  omitted).  Rather, a court’s review of the merits should be limited to those aspects relevant \n16  to making the certification decision on an informed basis.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 advisory \n17  committee’s notes.  If a court is not fully satisfied that the requirements of Rule 23(a) and \n18  (b) have been met, certification should be refused.  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161. \n19  Before turning to the requirements of Rule 23(a), the Court addresses Respondents’ \n20  arguments that Petitioners lack standing, and that Petitioners’ claim is moot.  \n21  B. Article III Standing  \n22  Standing is decided as of the “outset of the litigation.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \n23  Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000).  Thus, in determining whether \n24  Petitioners have standing, the Court “must look at the facts as they exist at the time the \n25  complaint was filed.”  Slayman v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., 765 F.3d 1033,1047 \n26  (9th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation omitted).  In a class action, like here, standing is satisfied \n27  “if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements.”  Bates v. United Parcel Serv., 511 \n28  F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860 (9th Cir. \n5 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1239   Page 6 of 19\n \n1  2001)).  Standing requires Petitioners to show (1) they have suffered injury-in-fact—“an \n2  invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \n3  actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,” (2) a causal connection between the \n4  injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of \n5  Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \n6  Respondents contend Petitioners lack standing because Petitioners are no longer at \n7  risk of being returned to Mexico under the MPP.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class Certification at \n8  12–13).    Petitioners  argue  Respondents’  argument  confuses  two  separate  doctrines: \n9  standing and mootness.  (Rep. in Supp. of Class Certification at 3).  \n10  The  doctrine  of  standing  addresses  whether  the  party  invoking  federal  court \n11  jurisdiction has “[t]he requisite personal interest” in the outcome of the case “at the \n12  commencement of the litigation.”  Blair v. Shanahan, 38 F.3d 1514, 1519 (9th Cir. 1994) \n13  (internal quotations omitted).  The doctrine of mootness addresses whether the party’s \n14  personal  interests  “continue[s]  throughout  [the  litigation’s]  existence.”    Id.  (internal \n15  quotations omitted).  In other words, “mootness [is] ‘the doctrine of standing set in a time \n16  frame.’ ”  Id. at 1518–19 (quoting U.S. Parole Comm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 \n17  (1980)).   \n18  As applied here, standing asks whether Petitioners had a personal stake in the \n19  outcome of the litigation at the time they filed their Complaint.  Clearly, Petitioners have \n20  standing: Petitioners suffered the injury of being deprived access to retained counsel prior \n21  to and during their non-refoulement interview, the injury was caused by Respondents’ \n22  policy prohibiting access to counsel, and the injury can be redressed by an injunction \n23  enjoining Respondents from implementing their policy.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  The \n24  fact that Petitioners are no longer in the MPP does not change this analysis.  \n25  Petitioners need not demonstrate a “real or immediate threat that [Respondents] will \n26  again subject [them] to [the MPP].”  B.C. v. Plumas Unified Sch. Dist., 192 F.3d 1260, \n27  1264 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105–10 (1983)).  \n28  Cases like B.C. and Lyons are not applicable to Petitioners’ case, for those cases concern \n6 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1240   Page 7 of 19\n \n1  plaintiffs who were not being subjected to the challenged policies at the time they filed \n2  their complaint.  In B.C., the plaintiff was a student challenging the school’s practice of \n3  using dogs to sniff for drugs on the school campus.  Id. at 1263.  The plaintiff sought \n4  injunctive relief, and the court dismissed his claim for lack of standing, noting he could not \n5  “demonstrate a real or immediate threat that defendants will again subject him to an illegal \n6  dog sniff of his person.”  Id. at 1264.  Similarly, in Lyons, the plaintiff sought injunctive \n7  relief to enjoin Los Angeles police from illegally using chokeholds, and the Supreme Court \n8  held the plaintiff lacked standing because he could not show he was “likely to suffer future \n9  injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”  Lyons, 461 U.S. at 97–98, 105.   \n10  Unlike the plaintiffs in B.C. and Lyons, Petitioners sought injunctive relief while \n11  being subjected to the practice they were challenging.  Petitioners were not challenging \n12  “[p]ast  exposure  to  illegal  conduct.”    (Resp.  in  Opp’n  to  Class  Certification  at  13).  \n13  Petitioners’ injury—deprivation of the right to retained counsel—was concrete, actual, and \n14  continuing at the time they filed their Complaint and moved for TRO.  It was neither \n15  speculative  nor  hypothetical.    Petitioners,  therefore,  do  not  need  to  show  a  real  or \n16  immediate threat that they will again be subjected to the MPP and deprived of access to \n17  retained counsel.  Holding otherwise would drastically change the doctrine of standing.  \n18  C. Mootness \n19  The doctrine of mootness, as explained above, requires that “an actual, ongoing \n20  controversy exist at all stages of federal court proceedings.”  Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, 653 \n21  F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987)).  \n22  “Whether ‘the dispute between the parties was very much alive when suit was filed . . . \n23  cannot substitute for the actual case or controversy that an exercise of this [c]ourt’s \n24  jurisdiction requires.’ ”  Id. (quoting Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 317 (1988)).  A case is \n25  moot “when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable \n26  interest in the outcome” of the litigation.  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969).  \n27  In a class action, however, the class claim “is not automatically moot because the named \n28  representative’s claim is moot.”  Kuahulu v. Empl’rs Ins. of Wausau, 557 F.3d 1334, 1336 \n7 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1241   Page 8 of 19\n \n1  (9th Cir. 1977) (citing Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 754 (1976)).  “If the \n2  district court certifies a class before the plaintiff’s claim becomes moot, ‘mooting the \n3  putative class representative’s claim will not moot the class action.’ ”  Slayman, 765 F.3d \n4  at 1048 (quoting Pitts, 653 F.3d at 1090).   \n5  There is an exception to this rule for claims that “are so inherently transitory that the \n6  trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion for class certification before \n7  the proposed representative’s individual interest expires.”  Pitts, 653 at F.3d at 1090.  \n8  Inherently transitory claims “will certainly repeat as to the class, either because ‘the \n9  individual could nonetheless suffer repeated [harm]’ or because ‘it is certain that other \n10  persons similarly situated’ will have the same complaint.”  Id. (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, \n11  520 U.S. 103, 110 n.11 (1975)).  “Such claims are ‘capable of repetition, yet evading \n12  review,’ and thus do not become moot.”  Slayman, 653 F.3d at 1048 (quoting Pitts, 653 \n13  F.3d at 1090).  In these cases, the district court may apply the ‘relation back’ approach and \n14  certify the class even after the named plaintiff’s claim becomes moot.  Pitts, 653 F.3d at \n15  1090; see also Cnty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 51–52 (1991) (holding that \n16  even though “the class was not certified until after the named plaintiffs’ claims had become \n17  moot,” the district court still had jurisdiction because the class claim was inherently \n18  transitory); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 401 (1975) (holding that the controversy “remains \n19  very  much  alive  for  the  class  of  persons  [the  named  plaintiff]  has  been  certified  to \n20  represent” even if it was “no longer alive as to” the named plaintiff); Wade v. Kirkland, \n21  118 F.3d 667, 670 (9th Cir. 1997) (noting that if the named plaintiff’s claim is inherently \n22  transitory, then “the action qualifies for an exception to mootness even if there is no \n23  indication that [the named plaintiff] or other current class members may again be subject \n24  to the acts that gave rise to the claims”) (emphasis in original).   \n25  Petitioners contend their claim is inherently transitory because they were short-term \n26  detainees  whose  claim  expired  quickly.    (Rep. in  Supp.  of Class  Certification  at  4).  \n27  Respondents argue Petitioners’ claim does not qualify as inherently transitory because (1) \n28  that exception is limited to cases in which there is a reasonable expectation that the plaintiff \n8 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1242   Page 9 of 19\n \n1  will be subjected to the same action again, (2) the Court had enough time to rule on \n2  Petitioners’ motion for TRO, (3) Respondents do not have a litigation strategy in mooting \n3  class members’ claims, and (4) Petitioners are not members of the class they are seeking \n4  to certify.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class Certification at 14–16).  These arguments are addressed \n5  in turn. \n6  First, Respondents argue the inherently transitory exception applies only if the \n7  plaintiff will “be subjected to same action again.”  Alvarez v. Hill, 667 F.3d 1061, 1064 \n8  (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that the individual plaintiff’s claim was not inherently transitory \n9  because there was “no indication [he would] again be subject to the challenged prison \n10  policies”) (emphasis added).  Respondents are incorrect.  In cases concerning class actions, \n11  the named plaintiff need not be subjected to the same action again for the claim to be \n12  inherently transitory.  See Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 399 (noting that in Gerstein, there was \n13  “no  indication  that  the  particular  named  plaintiffs  might  again  be  subject  to  pretrial \n14  detention[,]” yet the Court held the case “not to be moot” because the claim was inherently \n15  transitory); Gomez v. Campbell-Ewald Co., 805 F. Supp. 2d 923, 927–28 (C.D. Cal. 2011) \n16  (noting the requirements of the inherently transitory exception for class claims include: \n17  “(1) where the claim is ‘capable of repetition yet evading review’; and (2) where the claim \n18  is so ‘inherently transitory’ that the trial court will not have enough time to rule on a motion \n19  for class certification before the proposed named plaintiff's individual interest expires”).  \n20  The Court finds no controlling case law requiring it to first conclude Petitioners may be \n21  subjected to the MPP and deprived of access to retained counsel again before it finds \n22  Petitioners’ claim to be inherently transitory.  \n23  Next, Respondents contend the fact the Court ruled on Petitioners’ motion for TRO \n24  undercuts Petitioners’ argument that their claim evades judicial review.  Respondents \n25  misconstrue  the  nature  of  inherently  transitory  claims.    “The  ‘inherently  transitory’ \n26  rationale was developed to address circumstances in which the challenged conduct was \n27  effectively unreviewable, because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long \n28  enough for litigation to run its course.”  Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n9 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1243   Page 10 of 19\n \n1  66, 76 (2013).  Requiring an inherently transitory claim to expire before a court rules on a \n2  TRO is too high of a standard and runs counter to long-standing case law.  See McLaughlin, \n3  500 U.S. at 52 (“Some claims are so inherently transitory that the trial court will not have \n4  even  enough  time  to  rule  on  a  motion  for  class  certification  before  the  proposed \n5  representative's individual interest expires.”); Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 399 (same); Pitts, 653 \n6  F.3d at 1090 (same); Gomez, 805 F. Supp. at 927–28 (same).  \n7  Similarly, Respondents’ third argument—it is not their litigation strategy to moot \n8  putative class members’ claims—also misapprehends the inherently transitory exception \n9  to mootness.  The defense does not need to have a litigation strategy of mooting class \n10  members’ claims for the inherently transitory exception to apply.  Although the inherently \n11  transitory exception may apply when the defense is picking off class members, it by no \n12  means is restricted to such fact patterns.  See Pitts, 653 F.3d at 1091 (“Where, as here, a \n13  defendant seeks to “buy off” the small individual claims of the named plaintiffs, the \n14  analogous claims of the class—though not inherently transitory—become no less transitory \n15  than inherently transitory claims.”).   \n16  Finally, Respondents argue that because Petitioners are no longer subjected to the \n17  MPP and deprived of counsel, they are not class members and the class action cannot \n18  proceed.  As explained above, the inherently transitory doctrine is an exception to the \n19  mootness doctrine—it only applies when a named plaintiff’s claim expires before a class \n20  is certified.  See Pitts, 653 F.3d at 1090.  If Respondents’ argument was correct, then there \n21  would be no set of a facts in which the exception could apply.   \n22  Contrary to Respondents’ arguments, Petitioners’ claim is inherently transitory.  \n23  Upon expressing a fear of returning to Mexico, Petitioners were placed in short-term \n24  detention.  (Mot. for TRO at 18).  They sought an emergency TRO because they feared \n25  their non-refoulement interview was “imminent.”  (Id. at 11, 12).  Petitioners’ fear was \n26  correct—their non-refoulement interview was scheduled two days after the Court ruled on \n27  the TRO.  (Caudill-Mirillo Decl. at ¶ 5).  It is clear the Court would not have had “enough \n28 \n10 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1244   Page 11 of 19\n \n1  time to rule on a motion for class certification before [Petitioners’] individual interest[s] \n2  expire[d].”  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 52.  \n3  D. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) \n4  Rule 23(a) and its prerequisites for class certification—numerosity, commonality, \n5  typicality, and adequacy of representation—are addressed in turn.   \n6  1.  Numerosity \n7  Rule 23(a)(1) requires the class to be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \n8  impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 953 (9th Cir. \n9  2003).  Petitioners need not state the exact number of potential class members; nor is a \n10  specific minimum number required.  Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 \n11  F.R.D. 439, 448 (N.D. Cal. 1994).  Rather, whether joinder is impracticable depends on \n12  the facts and circumstances of each case.  Id. \n13  Petitioners assert that, from January to September of 2019, at least 380 individuals, \n14  represented by retained counsel, were within the MPP and had cases before the San Diego \n15  Immigration  Court.    (Mot.  for  Class  Certification,  Declaration  of  Monica  Langarica \n16  (“Langarica Decl.”), at ¶ 8).  Of these 380 individuals, it is unknown how many had non-\n17  refoulement interviews and were deprived of access to their retained counsel.  Petitioners \n18  do, however, provide declarations of attorneys who were unable to communicate with their \n19  clients prior to and during the clients’ non-refoulement interviews.  (Id., Declaration of \n20  Leah L. Chavarria (“Chavarria Decl.”), at ¶¶ 13, 15–18; Declaration of Vanessa Dojaquez-\n21  Torres (“Dojaquez-Torres Decl.”), at ¶ 26; Declaration of Margaret Cargioli (“Cargioli \n22  Decl.”),  at  ¶  4;  Declaration  of  Siobhan M.  Waldron  (“Waldron  Decl.”), at  ¶¶ 8–10; \n23  Declaration of Lisa Knox (“Knox Declaration”), at ¶¶ 4, 9).  From this information, counsel \n24  for Petitioners approximated the class size at 46 people.  (Rep. Tr. (Draft) at 47, Dec. 20, \n25  2019).  Therefore, Petitioners provide an adequate approximation that class members are \n26  sufficiently numerous and demonstrate joinder of all members would be significantly \n27  difficult and impracticable.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see also Rivera v. Holder, 307 F.R.D. \n28  539, 550 (W.D. Wash. 2015) (holding a class of 40 aliens was sufficiently numerous, \n11 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1245   Page 12 of 19\n \n1  “especially  given  the  transient  nature  of  the  class  and  the  inclusion  of  future  class \n2  members”); Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors v. Walters, 111 F.R.D. 595, 599 (N.D. Cal. \n3  1986) (“[W]here the class includes unnamed, unknown future members, joinder of such \n4  unknown individuals is impracticable and the numerosity requirement is therefore met, \n5  regardless of class size.”) (internal quotations omitted); Orantes-Hernandez v. Smith, 541 \n6  F. Supp. 351, 370 (C.D. Cal. 1982) (“Where the exact size of the class is unknown but \n7  general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the numerosity requirement \n8  is satisfied.”).  Accordingly, Petitioners satisfy the numerosity requirement.  \n9  2.  Commonality  \n10  The second element of Rule 23(a) requires the existence of “questions of law or fact \n11  common to the class[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  This element has “ ‘been construed \n12  permissively,’ and ‘[a]ll questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.’ ”  \n13  Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Hanlon v. \n14  Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998)).  “However, it is insufficient to \n15  merely allege any common question[.]”  Id.  Instead, Petitioners must allege the existence \n16  of  a  “common  contention”  that  is  of  “such  a  nature  that  it  is  capable  of  classwide \n17  resolution[.]”  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350.  As summarized by the Supreme Court: \n18  What matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common ‘questions’—even \nin droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common \n19 \nanswers  apt  to  drive  the  resolution  of  the  litigation.  Dissimilarities  within  the \n20 \nproposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of commons \n21  answers. \nId. (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 \n22 \nN.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). \n23 \n  Petitioners argue commonality is satisfied because “they challenge a single [p]olicy \n24 \napplied equally to all individuals in the non-refoulement process in California.”  (Mot. for \n25 \nClass Certification at 20).  The Court agrees.  First, the class is asserting the same legal \n26 \nclaim, namely whether Respondents’ practice of prohibiting putative class members access \n27 \nto retained counsel prior to and during non-refoulement interviews violates the APA.  \n28 \n12 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1246   Page 13 of 19\n \n1  Second,  the  facts  underlying  the  putative  class  members’  claims  are  the  same:  each \n2  individual class member came to the United States to seek asylum, was placed in the MPP, \n3  expressed a fear of returning to Mexico, retained an attorney, and was refused access to \n4  that attorney prior to and during his or her non-refoulement interview.  (Id.).  Third, putative \n5  class members suffered the same legal injury: they were deprived of access to their retained \n6  counsel.  Fourth, class members are challenging the same Government policy of refusing \n7  asylum seekers access to retained counsel prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  \n8  Finally, class members are seeking the same relief: a declaration that Respondents’ conduct \n9  is unlawful and an injunction requiring Respondents to allow asylum seekers access to their \n10  retained counsel prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  Given the number of \n11  common questions of law and fact, Petitioners satisfy the commonality requirement.  See \n12  Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 3331 F.R.D. 529, 538 (S.D. Cal. 2018) \n13  (“[C]ommonality only requires a single significant question of law or fact[,] . . . and that is \n14  particularly so where a suit challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of \n15  the putative class members.”) (internal quotations omitted). \n16    Respondents contend Petitioners’ class flunks the commonality requirement because \n17  the class includes individuals detained “as part of the primary or secondary inspection.”3  \n18  As the Court noted in the Order granting preliminary injunction, Respondents provide no \n19  evidence that a non-refoulement interview has ever occurred during primary or secondary \n20  inspection.  (Order Granting Prelim. Inj. at 12).  In comparison to primary and secondary \n21  inspection, non-refoulement interviews are conducted in separate areas, at different times, \n22  by officers of a different agency.  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 4 at 15 (“[T]he USCIS \n23  officer  should  conduct  the  MPP  Assessment  interview  in  a  non-adversarial  manner, \n24 \n                                                \n25 \n26 \n3 As noted above, the Court declines to address the balance of Petitioners’ statutory and \n27  constitutional claims under the INA and the First and Fifth Amendments to the United \nStates  Constitution.    The  Court,  therefore,  will  not  address  Respondents’  arguments \n28 \npertaining to those claims.  \n13 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1247   Page 14 of 19\n \n1  separate and apart from the general public.”); Mot. for TRO, Declaration of Cristian Doe \n2  (“Cristian Doe Decl.”), at ¶ 17 (“After the court hearing we were returned to the [POE] \n3  before being transferred to another nearby cold holding cell. We were there for two or three \n4  days . . . .”)).  Furthermore, according to the MPP Guiding Principles: \n5  If an alien who is potentially amenable to MPP affirmatively states that he   \nor she has a fear of persecution or torture in Mexico, or a fear of return to   \n6 \nMexico,  whether  before or  after  they are  processed  for  MPP  or  other   \n7 \ndisposition,  that  alien  will  be  referred  to  a  USCIS  asylum  officer  for   \n8  screening . . . .   \n9     \n(Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, Ex. 5 at 18–19 (emphasis added)).  Regardless of when they \n10 \nexpress a fear of returning to Mexico, asylum seekers are “referred to a USCISM asylum \n11 \nofficer for screening.”  (Id. at 19 (“Aliens who return to the POE for their scheduled hearing \n12 \nand affirmatively state a fear of return to Mexico will be referred to USCIS for screening \n13 \nprior to any return to Mexico.”)).  Given this information, it is clear that the time in which \n14 \nan asylum seeker expresses a fear of returning to Mexico does not affect the procedure of \n15 \nnon-refoulement interviews.   \n16 \n3.  Typicality  \n17 \nThe next requirement of Rule 23(a) is typicality, which focuses on the relationship \n18 \nof facts and issues between the class and its representatives.  “[R]epresentative claims are \n19 \n‘typical’ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need \n20 \nnot be substantially identical.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020.  “The test of typicality is whether \n21 \nother members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct \n22 \nwhich is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class members have been \n23 \ninjured by the same course of conduct.”  Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 \n24 \n(9th Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The typicality requirement \n25 \nwill occasionally merge with the commonality requirement, Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d \n26 \n657, 687 (9th Cir. 2014), because “[b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether \n27 \nunder the particular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether \n28 \n14 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1248   Page 15 of 19\n \n1  the named plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the \n2  class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.”  Dukes, 564 U.S. \n3  at 349 n.5. \n4  Petitioners primarily rely on the arguments raised on commonality to support a \n5  showing  of typicality,  while  also  emphasizing that the putative  class  representatives, \n6  Cristian and Diana Doe, fit the pattern of the putative class members’ experiences.  (Mot. \n7  for Class Certification at 23).  Respondents argue typicality is not satisfied because (1) \n8  Petitioners’ claim is not typical of the class because the proposed class includes asylum \n9  seekers who were not paroled into the United States for an immigration court hearing, as \n10  well as asylum seekers who articulate a fear of returning to Mexico “later in the removal \n11  proceeding process,” and (2) Petitioners’ claim is moot.  \n12  First, Respondents’ argument that the putative class includes both individuals who \n13  have not attended an immigration court hearing and individuals who articulate a fear of \n14  returning to Mexico later in removal proceedings distorts the non-refoulement interview \n15  process.  As the Court addressed in reference to the commonality requirement, when and \n16  where an asylum seeker expresses a fear of returning to Mexico does not change the non-\n17  refoulement procedure—the asylum seeker is always “referred to a USCIS asylum officer \n18  for screening” upon an expression of fear of returning to Mexico.  (Resp. in Opp’n to TRO, \n19  Ex. 5 at 18–19).  The issue of whether some class members have been “paroled into the \n20  United States” for an immigration court hearing and some have not is a distinction without \n21  a discernable or material difference in the context of typicality.  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class \n22  Certification at 21 (quoting Mot. for TRO at 23)).  All putative class members’ claims—\n23  that the Respondents’ policy of prohibiting access to retained counsel prior to and during \n24  non-refoulement interviews violates the APA—are the same.  \n25    Second, Respondents argue Petitioners do not satisfy typicality because Petitioners’ \n26  claim  is  moot.    Given  that  Petitioners’  claim  is  inherently  transitory,  Respondents’ \n27  argument is misplaced.  In determining whether Petitioners’ claim is typical of a putative \n28  class member’s claim, the Court invokes the relation back doctrine and asks whether \n15 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1249   Page 16 of 19\n \n1  typicality was satisfied as of the filing of the complaint.  See Pitts, 653 F.3d at 1092 \n2  (holding that certification of inherently transitory claims “relates back to the filing of the \n3  complaint”); see also Nw. Immigrant Rights Project v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration \n4  Servs., 325 F.R.D. 671, 696 (W.D. Wash. 2016) (considering whether typicality was met \n5  “as of the filing of the complaint” for an inherently transitory class claim); Rivera, 307 \n6  F.R.D. at 550 (W.D. Wash. 2015) (holding typicality was “easily satisfied” in a class action \n7  with an inherently transitory claim); Lyon v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, 300 F.R.D. \n8  628, 640 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (same).  As stated above, Petitioners’ claim was typical of the \n9  class as of the filing of the Complaint. \n10  4.  Adequacy of Representation \n11  The final requirement of Rule 23(a) is adequacy.  Rule 23(a)(4) requires a showing \n12  that “the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” \n13  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  This requirement is grounded in constitutional due process \n14  concerns; “absent class members must be afforded adequate representation before entry of \n15  a judgment which binds them.”  Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020 (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 \n16  U.S. 32, 42–43 (1940)).  In reviewing this issue, courts must resolve two questions: “(1) \n17  do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \n18  members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously \n19  on behalf of the class?”  Id. (citing Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, \n20  512 (9th Cir. 1978)).  The named plaintiffs and their counsel must have sufficient “zeal and \n21  competence” to protect the interests of the rest of the class.  Fendler v. Westgate-Cal. Corp., \n22  527 F.2d 1168, 1170 (9th Cir. 1975). \n23  Petitioners satisfy Rule 23(a)(4)’s adequacy requirement.  Petitioners have shown \n24  they do not have any conflicts of interest with other class members.  Petitioners’ Complaint \n25  seeks the same relief as the class: an injunction requiring Respondents to allow individuals \n26  access  to  retained  counsel  prior  to  and  during  non-refoulement  interviews  and \n27  corresponding declaratory relief.  Petitioners have also demonstrated they will protect the \n28  interests of the class.  Furthermore, there is no conflict between Petitioners’ counsel and \n16 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1250   Page 17 of 19\n \n1  the members of the proposed class, and counsel has demonstrated they will prosecute the \n2  case vigorously on behalf of the class.  \n3  Respondents argue Petitioners cannot demonstrate adequacy because Petitioners \n4  “would derive no benefit from any injunctive relief . . . awarded.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class \n5  Certification at 22).  This argument, like Respondents’ argument concerning typicality, \n6  does not address the inherently transitory nature of Petitioners’ claim.  The Court again \n7  invokes the relation back doctrine and asks whether adequacy was satisfied at the filing of \n8  the complaint.  See Padilla v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf’t, No. 18-928, 2019 WL \n9  1056466, at *4 (W.D. Wash. March 6, 2019) (holding the class representatives would \n10  adequately represent the class, despite their claim being moot, because their claim was \n11  inherently transitory); McLaughlin v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, No. 15-02904, 2016 WL \n12  3418337, at *6 (N.D. Cal. June 22, 2016) (same); Lyon, 300 F.R.D. at 636–39 (same); \n13  Franco-Gonzales v. Napolitano, No. 10-02211, 2011 WL 11705815, at *14 (C.D. Cal. \n14  Nov.  21,  2011)  (same).    As  stated,  Petitioners  are  adequate  class  representatives.  \n15  Accordingly, the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4) is satisfied.  \n16  E. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b) \n17  Having satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a), the next issue is whether Petitioners \n18  have shown that at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) is met.  Amchem Products, \n19  Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614–15 (1997).  Petitioners assert they have met the \n20  prerequisites of certification for a class under Rule 23(b)(2).  \n21  Under Rule 23(b)(2), class certification may be appropriate where a defendant acted \n22  or refused to act in a manner applicable to the class generally, rendering injunctive and \n23  declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  The \n24  Supreme Court has noted: \n25  The key to the (b)(2) class is “the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory \nremedy warranted—the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or \n26 \ndeclared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.”  [citation \n27 \nomitted].  In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or \n28  declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It does not \n17 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1251   Page 18 of 19\n \n1  authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to \na different injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant. \n2 \nDukes, 564 U.S. at 360.  \n3 \n  Petitioners  argue  this  case  satisfies  the  requirements  of  Rule  23(b)(2)  because \n4 \nRespondents are subjecting “all class members to the [p]olicy by denying them access to \n5 \ncounsel while they are awaiting their non-refoulement interviews, and then denying them \n6 \nthe participation and representation of their counsel during the interviews themselves.”  \n7 \n(Mot. for Class Certification at 26).  Respondents contend Petitioners cannot satisfy Rule \n8 \n23(b)(2) “[b]ecause of the class members’ various differences, which affect the viability of \n9 \nthe legal claims Petitioners purport to bring.”  (Resp. in Opp’n of Class Certification at 25).  \n10 \nRespondents further argue that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) precludes the Court from granting \n11 \nclasswide injunctive relief.  (Id.). \n12 \n  Contrary to Respondents’ argument, Petitioners have demonstrated that certification \n13 \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate here.  Rule 23(b)(2)’s “requirements are unquestionably \n14 \nsatisfied when members of a putative class seek uniform injunctive or declaratory relief \n15 \nfrom policies or practices that are generally applicable to the class as a whole.”  Parsons, \n16 \n754 F.3d at 688 (citing Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir. 2010)).  That is \n17 \nsurely the case here: putative class members seek the same injunctive and declaratory \n18 \nrelief, and Respondents’ policy of prohibiting access to retained counsel prior to and during \n19 \nnon-refoulement interviews is generally applicable to the entire class.  In other words, \n20 \nPetitioners and putative class members seek “relief from a single practice.”  Rodriguez, \n21 \n591 F.3d at 1126.  Accordingly, the Court finds Petitioners’ case is particularly suited for \n22 \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).  \n23 \n  Section 1252(f)(1) does not bar classwide injunctive relief in this case.  In pertinent \n24 \npart, § 1252(f)(1) states: “no court . . . shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or \n25 \nrestrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter,” referring to §§ 1221–\n26 \n1232.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).  Respondents contend the relief Petitioners are seeking \n27 \n“imposes additional requirements on the Government before it exercises its authority in 8 \n28 \n18 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 39   Filed 01/14/20   PageID.1252   Page 19 of 19\n \n1  U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C)[,]” and “[t]hus, Petitioners are asking . . . to enjoin 8 U.S.C. § \n2  1225(b)(2)(C) on a classwide basis.”  (Resp. in Opp’n to Class Certification at 25).  \n3  Respondents’ argument is not persuasive.  Section 1225(b)(2)(C) states: “the Attorney \n4  General may return the alien to [a foreign territory contiguous to the United States] pending \n5  a proceeding under section 1229a . . . .”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C).  The relief Petitioners \n6  seek does not enjoin § 1225(b)(2)(C).  Petitioners are not challenging the legality or the \n7  implementation  of  the  MPP  or  any  decision  to  return  an  asylum  seeker  to  Mexico.  \n8  Furthermore, § 1225(b)(2)(C) is silent as to non-refoulement interviews, and the relief \n9  Petitioners seek relates only to non-refoulement interviews.  (See Order granting Prelim. \n10  Inj. at 7–10).  Therefore, § 1252(f)(1) does not apply to Petitioners’ request for classwide \n11  relief.  \n12  II.   \n13  CONCLUSION AND ORDER \n14    For  these  reasons,  Petitioners’  motion  for  class  certification  is  granted  as  to \n15  Petitioners’ APA statutory claim.  Specifically, the Court certifies the following class under \n16  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2): \n17   \nAll individuals who are detained in CBP custody in California awaiting or \n \n18  undergoing non-refoulement interviews pursuant to the “Migrant Protection \n \nProtocols” program and who have retained lawyers. \n19 \n \n \n20  Petitioners  are  appointed  as  Class  Representatives,  and  Counsel  from  the  ACLU \n21  Foundation of San Diego and Imperial Counties are appointed as counsel for this Class \n22  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g).   \n23    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n24   \n25  Dated:  January 14, 2020   \n26 \n27 \n28   \n19 \n19-cv-2119-DMS (AGS) ",

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nORDER \n14  KEVIN K. McALEENAN, Acting \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland \n15 \nSecurity; et al., \n16 \nRespondents-Defendants. \n17 \n \n18 \n  This matter comes before the Court on Petitioners’ motion for temporary restraining \n19 \norder (“TRO”) to allow Petitioners access to their retained counsel prior to and during \n20 \nPetitioners’ non-refoulement interviews under the Government’s recently implemented \n21 \nMigrant Protection Protocols Program (“MPP” or “Remain in Mexico”).  Under the MPP, \n22 \nasylum seekers like Petitioners who enter or seek admission to the United States by land \n23 \nfrom Mexico may be returned to Mexico where they must await the outcome of their \n24 \nimmigration proceedings.  An exception to the MPP exists where an asylum seeker can \n25 \nshow he or she faces persecution or torture in Mexico, a showing they attempt to make \n26 \nduring their non-refoulement interview.  If successful, the individual is taken out of MPP \n27 \nand paroled or detained in the United States for the duration of their removal proceedings.   \n28 \n1 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.992   Page 2 of 11\n \n1  Petitioners  await  their  non-refoulement  interview  but  allege  Respondents  are \n2  wrongfully denying them their right of access to retained counsel, both prior to and during \n3  their interview, in violation of their statutory rights under the Administrative Procedure \n4  Act (“APA”) and their rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States \n5  Constitution.    Respondents  have  agreed  not  to  conduct  Petitioners’  non-refoulement \n6  interviews pending the Court’s determination of the present motion.  Respondents argue \n7  the Court should deny the motion as the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter, and in \n8  any  event,  there  is  no  right  of  access  to  retained  counsel  prior  to  or  during  a  non-\n9  refoulement interview.   \n10  The matter has been fully briefed and argued.  For the reasons set forth below, the \n11  Court concludes Petitioners have met their burden and are entitled to a TRO allowing them \n12  access to their retained counsel before and during their non-refoulement interviews.  The \n13  APA, specifically 5 U.S.C. § 555(b),  provides a right of access to retained counsel for such \n14  interviews.   \n15  I.   \n16  BACKGROUND  \n17  Petitioners’  declarations  in  support  of  their  motion  provide  the  following \n18  background facts.  Petitioners are the parents of a family of five children that fled their \n19  home country of Guatemala after suffering extortion, death threats, and rape.  (Mot. for \n20  TRO at 14).  Like many families, they traveled through Mexico to seek asylum in the \n21  United States.  (Id.)  While in Mexico, Petitioners and their children were threatened at gun \n22  point, assaulted, robbed, and stripped of their clothing.  (Id.)  Their attackers, masked men \n23  seemingly clothed in Mexican government uniforms, threatened to kill Petitioners if they \n24  reported the incident.  (Id.)  These threats have left Petitioners and their children terrified.  \n25  (Id.)  \n26    Upon entering the United States, Petitioners immediately requested asylum. (Id.)  \n27  Prior to December 2018, asylum seekers like Petitioners were placed in expedited removal \n28  (“ER”) proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  If they expressed a fear of persecution or \n2 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.993   Page 3 of 11\n \n1  torture upon removal to their country of origin, the asylum seekers were given a credible \n2  fear interview (“CFI”) to determine whether there was a significant possibility they were \n3  eligible for asylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  If they passed the CFI, they were placed \n4  in full removal proceedings before an immigration judge (“IJ”) to present their asylum \n5  case.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(4), 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  After December 2018, however, the \n6  MPP was instituted and the process changed. \n7    As noted, asylum seekers arriving on land from Mexico are now required under the \n8  MPP to remain in Mexico while their immigration proceedings are pending.  (Res. to Mot. \n9  for TRO, Exs. 1, 4).  If an asylum seeker expresses fear of returning to Mexico, then he or \n10  she is detained by Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) pending a non-refoulement \n11  interview with a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) asylum officer to \n12  determine whether they are more likely than not to face persecution or torture in Mexico.  \n13  (Mot. for TRO at 16.)  While awaiting a non-refoulement interview, an asylum seeker does \n14  not have the ability to communicate confidentially with retained counsel.  (Id. at 17–18.)  \n15  Furthermore, retained counsel may not be present during non-refoulement interviews, \n16  which are conducted telephonically and can last up to several hours.  (Id. at 16, 17–18.)  \n17  See Compl., ¶ 144 (Respondent Department of Homeland Security “has a written policy \n18  mandating a blanket denial of access to counsel to individuals subject to MPP who are in \n19  its custody while awaiting and during non-refoulement interviews.”))  If an individual \n20  passes the non-refoulement interview, they are removed from MPP and either released on \n21  parole or detained in the United States, pending removal proceedings.  Mot. for TRO at 17.  \n22  If the individual does not pass, they must await the outcome of their removal proceedings \n23  in Mexico.  (Id.) \n24    In accordance with the MPP, Petitioners were returned to Mexico to await the \n25  outcome of their removal proceedings.  (Id.)  While in Tijuana, Petitioners survived a \n26  shoot-out that occurred outside their temporary shelter.  (Id. at 15.)  Because of this \n27  violence  and  the  trauma  Petitioners  experienced  while  traveling  through  Mexico, \n28  Petitioners expressed a fear of returning to Mexico during an immigration proceeding on \n3 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.994   Page 4 of 11\n \n1  November 5, 2019.  (Id. at 19.)  Bound by the duty of non-refoulement, the United States \n2  placed Petitioners and their children in CBP detention to await their non-refoulement \n3  interviews.    (Id.)    During  their  detention,  Petitioners  have  not  been  allowed  to \n4  confidentially communicate with their retained counsel.  (Id.)  The same day on which they \n5  expressed a fear of returning to Mexico, Petitioners commenced the present action and filed \n6  the subject motion. \n7  II. \n8  DISCUSSION \n9  Petitioners seek a TRO allowing them access to their retained counsel while in CBP \n10  custody and during their non-refoulement interviews.  Before turning to the merits and \n11  other injunctive relief factors, the Court addresses Respondents’ various jurisdictional \n12  arguments, including that there is no case or controversy under Article III, § 2 of the United \n13  States Constitution as the case is moot and that Petitioners are not “in custody” for purposes \n14  of habeas review under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.   \n15  Under Ninth Circuit law, the completion of activity is not the hallmark of mootness.  \n16  See, e.g., Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. Alexander, 303 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002) \n17  (holding plaintiffs’ challenge to a timber sale is not moot, despite the completion of the \n18  sale).  A case is moot “only where no effective relief for the alleged violation can be given.”  \n19  Id. (citing Cantrell v. City of Long Beach, 241 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2001)). Here, the \n20  relief Respondents offered was both incomplete and inadequate.  The day after Petitioners \n21  filed their motion for TRO, Respondents offered Petitioners the opportunity to speak with \n22  their counsel over the phone for 45 minutes and the telephonic presence of counsel during \n23  their non-refoulement interview. (Res. to Mot. for TRO at 13; Rep. to Respondents Res. at \n24  3).  Petitioners’ counsel requested confidential communication with their clients consistent \n25  with Petitioners’ asserted statutory and constitutional rights to counsel, and Respondents \n26  refused.  (Res. to Mot. for TRO at 13).  Consequently, Petitioners’ counsel declined the \n27  offer.  (Id.)  Petitioners remain in CBP detention and Respondents’ policy prohibiting \n28 \n4 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.995   Page 5 of 11\n \n1  access to retained counsel remains in effect.  Therefore, effective relief for the alleged \n2  violation may still be given and the issue is not moot.  \n3  Respondents’ argument that Petitioners are not “in custody” for purposes of 28 \n4  U.S.C. § 2241 also fails.  “Section 2241 requires a petitioner to be “in custody” at the time \n5  of filing for the federal courts to have jurisdiction over a habeas petition.”  Smith v. U.S. \n6  Customs & Border Patrol Prot., 741 F.3d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. 2014).  A petitioner is “in \n7  custody” if he is subject to conditions that “significantly confine and restrain his freedom.”  \n8  Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 243 (1963).  Petitioners are currently being held in \n9  CPB detention facilities.  (Mot. for TRO at 18).  Their freedom is clearly confined and \n10  restrained: they cannot come and go as they please, they have little room to walk, and they \n11  allege  they  are  subjected  to  cold  temperatures  and    lack  access  to  basic  necessities, \n12  including  toothpaste,  hygiene  products,  and  changes  of  clothing.    (Id.  at  18–19.)  \n13  Respondents argue this kind of detention does not constitute “custody” because it is brief \n14  and incidental to Petitioners’ removal proceedings.1  Neither of these reasons, however, \n15  confronts  whether  Petitioners  are  subject  to  conditions  that  significantly  confine  and \n16  restrain their freedom.  Given the allegations at issue, Petitioners are “in custody” for \n17  purposes of § 2241.2   \n18 \n                                                \n19 \n1  Respondents also argue that if Petitioners are returned to Mexico under the MPP, then \n20 \nthey will not be considered “in custody.”  This argument is beside the point.  At the time \n21  of their filing, Petitioners were in CBP custody, not in Mexico.  (Mot. for TRO at 19.) \n2  Respondents have raised other related meritless jurisdictional and procedural arguments, \n22 \nincluding that Petitioners seek an advisory opinion and allege only speculative injury.  As \n23  discussed, the alleged deprivation of a statutory and constitutional right to counsel is a \nredressable injury.  Seeking a determination that the right of access to retained counsel \n24 \nexists and has been violated under the circumstances does not invite an advisory opinion.  \n25  Respondents also argue that Petitioners have no private right of action to sue for anything \narising from the non-refoulement interview process, as the process was established to \n26 \nsatisfy “non self-executing” treaty obligations, citing among other things the Convention \n27  Against Torture Act.  But Petitioners are not suing under a treaty or related Act.  Their \nclaims arise under the APA and the Constitution of the United States.  Finally, Respondents \n28 \nargue that judicial review of international non-refoulement obligations is prohibited, citing \n5 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.996   Page 6 of 11\n \n1    With these findings, the Court turns to the TRO.  The purpose of a TRO is to preserve \n2  the status quo before a preliminary injunction hearing may be held; its provisional remedial \n3  nature is designed merely to prevent irreparable loss of rights prior to judgment.  Granny \n4  Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers, 415 U.S. 423, 439 \n5  (1974).  The standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is identical to the standard \n6  for issuing a preliminary injunction.  Lockheed Missile & Space Co., Inc. v. Hughes \n7  Aircraft  Co.,  887  F.  Supp.  1320,  1323  (N.D.  Cal.  1995).    Injunctive  relief  is  an \n8  “extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is \n9  entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  \n10  To meet that showing, Petitioners must demonstrate “‘[they are] likely to succeed on the \n11  merits, that [they are] likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, \n12  that the balance of equities tips in [their] favor, and that an injunction is in the public \n13  interest.’”  Am. Trucking Ass’ns v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) \n14  (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20).3  Each factor is met.  \n15  /// \n16 \n                                                \n17 \n18 \nthe rule of “non-inquiry” and Prasoprat v. Benov, 421 F.3d 1009, 1016 (9th Cir. 2019) \n19  (stating  courts  must  refrain  from  second-guessing  executive  branch  determinations \n“whether extradition should be denied on humanitarian grounds or on account of the \n20 \ntreatment that the fugitive is likely to receive upon his return to the requesting state.”)  This \n21  strawman argument fares no better than Respondents’ other arguments.  Petitioners are not \nchallenging an executive branch decision to return Petitioners to Mexico. Rather, they are \n22 \nseeking to vindicate rights provided to them under federal law. \n23  3  The Ninth Circuit applies separate standards for injunctions depending on whether they \nare prohibitory,  i.e. they prevent future conduct, or mandatory, i.e.  “they go beyond \n24 \n‘maintaining the status quo[.]’”  Hernandez v. Sessions, 872 F.3d 976, 997 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n25  To the extent Petitioners are requesting mandatory relief, that request is “subject to a higher \nstandard than prohibitory injunctions,” namely that relief will issue only “when ‘extreme \n26 \nor very serious damage will result’ that is not capable of compensation in damages,’ and \n27  the merits of the case are not ‘doubtful.’”  Id. at 999 (quoting Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. \nv. Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co., 571 F.3d 873, 879 (9th Cir. 2009)).  Under either standard, \n28 \nPetitioners have met their burden for the reasons set out above.   \n6 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.997   Page 7 of 11\n \n1  A. Likelihood of Success \n2  “The first factor under Winter is the most important—likely success on the merits.” \n3  Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015).  While Petitioners carry the \n4  burden of demonstrating likelihood of success, they are not required to prove their case in \n5  full at this stage but only such portions that enable them to obtain the injunctive relief they \n6  seek.  See Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).   \n7  Here, Petitioners argue they are likely to succeed on the merits because under the \n8  APA “default provision,” they have a right of access to counsel of their choice during and \n9  before their non-refoulement interview.  See 5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (“A person compelled to \n10  appear in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, \n11  represented, and advised by counsel . . . .”).  Respondents argue that the Immigration and \n12  Nationality Act (“INA”) supersedes the APA default provision, citing Marcello v. Bonds, \n13  349 U.S. 302, 309 (1955), and Ardestani v. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 133 (1991), and that under \n14  the INA, Petitioners are not permitted access to retained counsel before or during their \n15  interview.   \n16  There  are  two  flaws  in  Respondents’  argument.    First,  neither  Marcello  nor \n17  Ardestani stands for the proposition that the INA supersedes the APA in all immigration \n18  proceedings.  The Supreme Court in Marcello held that § 242(b) of the INA, the precursor \n19  to the modern removal proceeding statute in 28 U.S.C. § 1229a, supplants the APA as “the \n20  sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings.”  Marcello, 349 U.S. at 310.  \n21  The Court cited the INA’s “laborious adaption of the [APA] to the deportation process, \n22  the specific points at which deviations from the [APA] were made, the recognition in the \n23  legislative history of this adaptive technique and of the particular deviations, and the \n24  direction in the statute . . . ”  in determining the INA, and not the APA, governed.  Id.  The \n25  Court in Ardestani, relying on its decision in Marcello, held that because plaintiff’s \n26  deportation proceedings were not subject to the APA, plaintiff could not seek attorney fees \n27  under the Equal Access to Justice Act.  Ardestani, 502 U.S. at 134.  Both cases deal \n28  specifically with deportation proceedings, not immigration proceedings in general.  This \n7 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.998   Page 8 of 11\n \n1  distinction is  significant: the  INA  lays  out  “a  specialized’  and  “very  particularized” \n2  procedure for deportation proceedings, indicating congressional intent to displace the APA \n3  in the context of deportation proceedings.  Marcello, 349 U.S. at 308–09.  Where the INA \n4  is silent, however, there is no evidence of such congressional intent. See, e.g., Shaughnessy \n5  v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 51 (1955) (holding that the INA does not supersede the APA’s \n6  right  to  judicial  review  because  there  is  no  language  in  the  INA  which  “expressly \n7  supersedes or modifies” § 10 of the APA).  In other words, if the INA does not provide \n8  the procedure, the APA default provisions necessarily still apply.  See 5 U.S.C. § 559 \n9  (“Subsequent statute may not be held to supersede or modify [the APA’s protection of the \n10  right of access to retained counsel], except to the extent that it does so expressly.”). \n11  The second flaw in Respondents’ argument is that even if the INA did supplant the \n12  APA here, the INA does not address whether Petitioners have a right of access to counsel \n13  prior to and during non-refoulement interviews.  Respondents note that under the INA, \n14  asylum seekers may consult with retained counsel prior to and during a CFI, but not during \n15  expedited removal proceedings or primary or secondary inspections.  See 8 C.F.R. § \n16  208.30(d)(4) (stating that an asylum seeker may consult with a person prior to and during \n17  her CFI); United States v. Barajas-Alvarado, 655 F.3d 1077, 1088 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding \n18  “no legal basis for [the claim] that non-admitted aliens who have not entered the United \n19  States have a right to representation” during expedited removal proceedings).  By contrast, \n20  there are no provisions addressing whether asylum seekers have access to retained counsel \n21  prior  to  and  during  a  non-refoulement  interview.    (Res.  to  Mot.  for  TRO  at  21).  \n22  Respondents argue this lack of mention necessarily means that asylum seekers do not have \n23  such a right.  The Court, however, disagrees.  Where the INA is silent, the APA default \n24  provisions necessarily apply; to hold otherwise would be to render the default provisions \n25  obsolete.  See 5 U.S.C. § 559 (stating subsequent statute may not supersede or modify the \n26  APA unless “it does so expressly.”).   \n27  Access to retained counsel for a non-refoulement interview, which is undisputedly \n28  not a part of formal removal proceedings, is not addressed in the INA.  The INA, therefore, \n8 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.999   Page 9 of 11\n \n1  has not expressly superseded the APA’s default provision concerning access to retained \n2  counsel.  Consequently, § 555(b) of the APA applies.4  For these reasons, the Court finds \n3  there is a likelihood of success on Petitioners’ statutory claim under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n4  555(b).5   \n5  B. Irreparable Injury and Balance of Equities \n6  Turning to the next three factors, Petitioners must show they are “‘likely to suffer \n7  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief[,]’” and demonstrate that “‘the balance \n8  of equities tips in [their] favor.’”  Hernandez, 872 F.3d at 995 (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at \n9  20).  Petitioners have met their burden.   \n10  Petitioners allege that without access to counsel, they risk the irreparable harm of a \n11  non-reviewable erroneous decision that forces them to return to Mexico to face persecution.  \n12  Petitioners  emphasize  the  complexity  of  non-refoulement  interviews  that  they—as \n13  unsophisticated migrants in stressful and foreign circumstances—do not understand; and \n14 \n                                                \n15 \n4  The  issue  of  whether  access  to  retained  counsel  includes  confidential,  in-person \n16 \ncommunication, as opposed to telephonic communication, has not been briefed in this case.  \n17  The parties should be prepared to address this issue in their preliminary injunction briefing.  \nFor the purposes of these Petitioners, however, the Court orders confidential, in-person \n18 \naccess to retained counsel prior to Petitioners’ non-refoulement interviews.  See 5 U.S.C. \n19  § 555(b) (“A person compelled to appear in person before an agency or representative \nthereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel . . . .”) (emphasis \n20 \nadded); Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defining accompany as “to go along with \n21  (another)” or “to attend); United States v. McPhaul, 617 F. Supp. 58, 59 (W.D.N.C. 1985) \n(“Under 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), there is a right to have counsel present whenever a person is \n22 \ncompelled to appear.”).  Petitioners seem to concede confidential, in-person access to \n23  counsel  is  not  required  during  the  non-refoulement  interview  because  “attorney \nparticipation in that interview does not require confidentiality and the interview itself is \n24 \ntelephonic, placing counsel on equal footing with the adjudicators.” (Rep. to Respondents \n25  Res. at 3 n.2).  \n5  In light of Petitioners’ likelihood of success on their first claim for relief under the APA, \n26 \n5 U.S.C. § 555(b) (right of access to retained counsel), the Court declines to address the \n27  balance of Petitioners’ statutory and constitutional claims under the APA and First and \nFifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  (See Class Action Complaint and \n28 \nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Second through Fifth Claims for Relief, ECF No. 1.) \n9 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.1000   Page 10 of 11\n \n1  that without access to their counsel, their ability to answer questions and meaningfully \n2  participate  in  the  interview  is  significantly  impaired.    Given  the  high  stakes  of  the \n3  interview, the Court finds Petitioners have shown likelihood of irreparable harm.  \n4  The same reasoning suggests the balance of hardships tips in Petitioners favor.  In \n5  Respondents’ opposition, they raise the specter of national security, but fail to show how \n6  allowing access to counsel threatens security.  At oral argument, Respondents’ counsel \n7  referenced logistical difficulties in allowing access to counsel, but provided no evidence in \n8  support.  On the other hand, Petitioners face potential persecution and harm should they be \n9  returned to Mexico.  The balance of these factors tips decidedly in favor of Petitioners.  \n10  C. Public Interest \n11  The final factor for consideration is the public interest.  See Hernandez, 872 F.3d at \n12  996.  To obtain the requested relief, “[p]laintiffs must demonstrate that the public interest \n13  favors granting the injunction ‘in light of [its] likely consequences,’ i.e., ‘consequences \n14  [that are not] too remote, insubstantial, or speculative and [are] supported by evidence.’”  \n15  Id. (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1139 (9th Cir. 2009)).   \n16  Here, the public interest is served by allowing Petitioners’ access to retained counsel \n17  prior to and during their non-refoulement interviews.  It would not be “‘in the public’s \n18  interest to allow the [government] . . . to violate the requirements of federal law, especially \n19  when there are not adequate remedies available.’”  Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 \n20  F.3d 1053, 1069 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Melendres v. Arpaio, 695 F.3d 990, 1002 (9th \n21  Cir. 2012)).  Given the procedural protections provided by the APA and the lack of \n22  appealability of the non-refoulement interview, the public’s interest weighs in favor of \n23  granting Petitioners motion.  \n24  III.   \n25  CONCLUSION \n26    For these reasons, Petitioners’ motion for temporary restraining order is granted.  \n27  Respondents  may  not  conduct  Petitioners’  non-refoulement  interviews  without  first \n28  affording them access to their retained counsel both before and during any such interview.   \n10 \n3:19-cv-2119-DMS-AGS \n\nCase 3:19-cv-02119-DMS-AGS   Document 18   Filed 11/12/19   PageID.1001   Page 11 of 11\n \n1  Pending  before  the  Court  are  Petitioners’  motions  for  class  certification  and \n2  preliminary injunction.
