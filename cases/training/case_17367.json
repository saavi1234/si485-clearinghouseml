Complete information, including a checklist of actions regarding the WDPA NexGen CM/ECF implementation, can be found at here . Currently, multiple attorneys within a firm may share a single PACER account. Shared PACER accounts cannot be used by WDPA e-filing attorneys once the WDPA NextGen CM/ECF system is implemented. Each attorney must have an individual upgraded PACER account that will be linked to the e-filing account. If you have an upgraded PACER account, no action is required until after the WDPA NextGen CM/ECF upgrade on May 26, 2020. You have an upgraded PACER account if you (1) e-file in another NextGen court, or (2) created your PACER account after August 10, 2014. If neither of these are true, you must upgrade your legacy PACER account before you will be able to link your PACER account to your current WDPA CM/ECF account for your new NextGen CM/ECF account. Further informational notices will be sent later, but if you have questions about upgrading your PACER account, please contact the PACER Service Center at 800-676-6856. (Administrator, ) (ADI)"

          "description": "IMPORTANT NOTICE: The United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania will be upgrading its current CM/ECF system to the Next Generation of CM/ECF on May 26, 2020. Complete information, including a checklist of actions regarding the WDPA NexGen CM/ECF implementation, can be found here. Preparing for NextGen is a two-step process. The first step is to upgrade any legacy PACER accounts. Each attorney must have an individual upgraded PACER account in order to electronically file after our conversion to NextGen. The second step will be to link that upgraded PACER account with your WDPA CM/ECF account after the Court goes live with NextGen. To link your account, you will need your current e-filing credentials from our Court. If your CM/ECF login contains a special character (such as &, @, $, *), you will need to change it as logins with those characters will be unable to link to PACER accounts. No later than Thursday, May 21, 2020, you should log into both PACER and the current version of CM/ECF to (1) review and record your current e-filing credentials for both, as you will need to know them in order to e-file after May 23, 2020 and (2) ensure that your primary email address to receive Notices of Electronic Filings (NEF) is accurate. Failure to provide an accurate email address may result in a delay in receiving NEFs after the Court converts to NextGen. (Administrator, ) (ADI)"

Plaintiffs submitted via email, and Defendants responded, various discovery issues with electronic documents and a 30(b)(6) deposition. A robust discussion took place, during which Plaintiffs argued that Defendants have refused to produce the requested discovery and have even refused to cooperatively develop a list of search terms and identify who will be searched. Defendants argued that the requests were not relevant, were overly burdensome and not proportional. The Court decided that the discovery was relevant, and the issue in dispute is the proportionality of the discovery. The Court strongly suggests the appointment of an e-discovery special master and advised that the Western District had a system for this as well as a list of qualified persons. Plaintiffs were agreeable to this, but Defendants were not. The parties were encouraged to review this and potential masters on the Court's website. While this is under consideration, counsel are to meet and confer and 1) jointly develop a list of search terms; 2) develop a custodian list and 3) run the search terms to see how many hits there were. This would be done for both TSA and DEA separately. Defendant argued that even running it would be overly burdensome. The Court ordered counsel to complete steps 1 and 2 and if they could not agree, develop separate lists, and discuss doing step 3. They were to also discuss with their clients the concept of an e-discovery special master. The Court determined that the relevant time frame for the e-discovery for now would be from 2014 to the date of filing the Complaint. A zoom conference is set for August 9, 2022, at 10:00 AM to discuss progress and next steps. There was also an issue with a 30(b)(6) deposition regarding the bounding box. The Court found that the issues regarding the bounding box are relevant. Specifically, things such as how the parameters for triggering it were determined, did this include identifying cash and why, etc. Defendants are to identify a 30(b)(6) witness on this topic. Counsel for Dawkin informed the court that he intends to move for 50(b) partial judgement to have him removed from the case. The Court advised Plaintiff's counsel and Ms. Mason to have a conversation to try to reach an agreement. If not possible, Dawkin may file whatever motion he believes necessary.

The parties have had a meet and confer in accordance with the Court's instructions at the 7/18/22 conference. Search terms are still under discussion. There is a debate as to custodians for both DEA and TSA, which was explained to the Court. This remains under discussion. The parties have agreed to appoint a special master for discovery and are checking with retired Magistrate Judge John Facciola to see if he is available. The Court knows Judge Facciola well and thinks he would be an excellent choice. There are 2 follow up 30(b)(6) depositions that are in process of being scheduled, one being the representative as to the bounding box issues. It was noted that this phase of discovery is on policy as outlined in sections 1,2,5 and 6 of paragraph 9 of the Rule 26(f) Report. Plaintiff will serve discovery on the areas outlined in sections 3 and 4 of that report within the next 30-60 days. Defendants advise that this may raise additional issues as to burden. These issues can also be discussed with the Special Master. The parties are to file an E-discovery Status Report by 9/7/22 detailing whether Judge Facciola is available and, if not, their second choice for a Special Master, status of the 30(b)(6) depositions and any outstanding discovery issues. This filing will include a proposed draft of the order appointing the special master, outlining his/her duties pursuant to Rule 53. A telephone conference is set for 9/13/22 at 2 PM. Counsel are to call into the conference by dialing 888-363-4749 and entering the access code 6019141. If asked for a security code, use * to bypass.

The court will consider the arguments and discuss the case with Judge Horan before issuing a scheduling order. Defendant Dawkins is dismissed from the case without prejudice but will remain on the docket so his counsel is informed of activity.

    "summary": "<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized and confiscated $82,373 in cash from the plaintiff&rsquo;s carry-on as she boarded a domestic flight in Pennsylvania in August 2019. Visiting her father for the weekend, she had learned that he had stored his life savings, in cash, in numerous envelopes hidden in his home. She offered to deposit the money in a new account she planned to create for him, but the cash was seized before she could deposit it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 2020, she and her father filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the agencies had confiscated her father's property without suspecting or accusing her of a crime. The plaintiffs, represented by the Institute for Justice, claimed that the TSA had acted beyond its statutory authority (49 U.S.C. &sect;114 and &sect;&sect;44901-2), and that both the TSA and the DEA had violated her Fourth Amendment rights, by confiscating her property without probable cause. The case was assigned to District Judge Marilyn J. Horan and referred to Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan.<br />&nbsp;<br />The plaintiffs sought certification of two classes: a &ldquo;TSA Class&rdquo; of air travelers from January 15, 2014 onward whose property or person was seized by the TSA because of a \"large amount\" of currency in their possession; and a &ldquo;DEA Class&rdquo; of air travelers from January 15, 2014 onward whose property was seized by the DEA because they were traveling with at least $5,000 in currency. For both classes, the plaintiffs sought class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief against the agencies. Individually, they sought the return of the $82,373, along with compensatory damages and costs and fees.<br />&nbsp;<br />In February 2020, the DEA offered, without explanation, to return the money.<br />&nbsp;<br />On May 29, 2020, the agencies moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Magistrate Judge Lenihan recommended that the agencies' motions to dismiss be denied in part and granted in part on January 7, 2021.<br />&nbsp;<br />Magistrate Judge Lenihan rejected the agencies' argument that only the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction over this case, finding that the district court had jurisdiction because the plaintiffs were challenging an informal TSA policy rather than a formal administrative order. Magistrate Judge Lenihan also concluded that the plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations of cash seizures qualified for standing under a substantial risk standard. The forty alleged incidents of cash seizures suggested a regular pattern of conduct sufficient to survive the government's motion to dismiss.<br />&nbsp;<br />Magistrate Judge Lenihan further recommended that plaintiffs' claim against the individual agent responsible for the seizure did not appear sufficient to overcome the agent&rsquo;s qualified immunity defense and should therefore be dismissed. Finally, the plaintiff's claim for relief in the form of lost interest on the confiscated $82,373 should be dismissed because the United States is immune from interest awards.<br />&nbsp;<br />On March 30, 2021, Judge Horan adopted Magistrate Judge Lenihan's recommendations regarding the dismissed claims. As of March 9, 2022, the parties were proceeding through discovery.</p>",

On January 7, 2021, the \nMagistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation, recommending that the Government \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 55, be denied as to Counts I through III and granted as \nto Count IV and that Defendant Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 47, be granted.  (ECF \nNo. 66).  The parties were informed that written Objections to the Report and Recommendation \nwere due by February 11, 2021.  (ECF No. 68).  Government Defendants, Transportation \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 2 of 8\nSecurity Agency (TSA), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), TSA Administrator David P. \nPekoske, and DEA Acting Administrator Timothy J. Shea, and the United States, filed timely \nwritten Objections regarding the Magistrate Judge’s decision to deny Counts I through III of \ntheir Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF No. 72).  Plaintiffs, Rebecca Brown, Auguste Terrence Rolin, \nStacy Jones-Nasr, and Matthew Berger, filed timely written Objections regarding the Magistrate \nJudge’s decision to grant Agent Dawkin’s motion to dismiss their Fourth Amendment Bivens \nclaim.  (ECF No. 71).  DEA Agent Steve Dawkin filed timely written Objections regarding the \nMagistrate Judge’s application, though not the result, of the Plaintiffs’ Bivens claim against him \nin his individual capacity as well as the Magistrate Judge’s decision regarding qualified \nimmunity.  (ECF No. 70). \nFor the reasons that follow, and after de novo review, the Court finds that the written \nObjections do not undermine the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, except as provided \nherein.  The Court will adopt the Report and Recommendation as the Opinion of the Court to \ndeny the Government Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Counts I through III and to grant said \nMotion as to Count IV.  However, the Court will not adopt the entire Report and \nRecommendation as the Opinion of the Court regarding the new Bivens context, but will still \ngrant Agent Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss Count V.  The Court will likewise reject the Report \nand Recommendation’s qualified immunity analysis as moot in light of the dismissal of Count V, \nthe only claim against Agent Dawkin.   \nI.  DISCUSSION \nThe filing of timely objections requires the district judge to “make a de novo \ndetermination of those portions of the report . . . to which objection is made.”  28 U.S.C. § \n636(b)(1); Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1106 n.3 (3d Cir. 1989); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 3 of 8\nInitially, the Court finds no error in the Magistrate Judge’s application of the standard of law.  \nThe Government Defendants have articulated three Objections to the Magistrate Judge’s Report \nand Recommendation regarding Counts I through III of their Motion to Dismiss.  The Plaintiffs \nhave articulated three Objections and Agent Dawkin has articulated two Objections to the \nMagistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation regarding Agent Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss.    \nAlthough Agent Dawkin agrees with his dismissal from the case, he argues the Magistrate \nJudge’s analysis and interpretation of the applicable law was flawed.  Each Objection will be \naddressed in turn. \nA. Government Defendants’ Objections\nThe Government Defendants’ Objections contend that Counts I through III of the \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should have been dismissed.  The Government Defendants argue \nthat the Plaintiffs lack standing and that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Finally, they assert that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for which relief \ncan be granted.  \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Standing\nAs regards standing, Plaintiffs have alleged that they wish to travel with large amounts of \ncash and, because of TSA’s alleged seizure policies, they are forced to refrain from traveling \nwith such cash.  (ECF No. 66, 3).  Pursuant to Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 568 U.S. \n398, 414 n.5 (2010), standing can be found based on a “substantial risk” that the alleged harm \nwill occur rather than a “certainly impending” standard.  (ECF No. 66, 4).  Judge Lenihan was \ncorrect in concluding that the Plaintiffs’ allegations of cash seizures rose above the level of “a \nhandful of incidents” to qualify for standing under a substantial risk standard.  As such, the \nGovernment Defendants’ Objection, that the Plaintiffs lack standing, will be overruled. \n3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 4 of 8\n2. Jurisdiction\nAs regards this Court’s jurisdiction, the Government Defendants maintain that \njurisdiction lies with the United States District Court for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.  \n(ECF No. 72, 9).  While 49 U.S.C. § 46110 confers jurisdiction to the Circuit Courts of Appeals \nfor judicial review of a TSA order, this statute contemplates jurisdiction over formal \nadministrative orders rather than informal policies or practices. The Plaintiffs’ First Amended \nComplaint challenges an informal TSA policy rather than any formal administrative order.  (ECF \nNo. 66, 7-8). As such, the Government Defendants’ objection, asserting that this Court lacks \njurisdiction to hear the Plaintiffs’ claims, is overruled. \n3. Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted\nThe Government Defendants’ next Objection argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in \nrecommending that the Plaintiffs’ substantive claims for relief should not be dismissed pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 72, 12).  The Government Defendants characterize the Plaintiffs \nallegations of cash seizures as a series of “isolated incidents” rather than a consistent agency \npractice.  (ECF No. 72, 13-14).  The Plaintiffs have alleged at least 40 incidents of cash seizures, \nwhich suggests a regular pattern of conduct which, at this stage, is sufficient to survive the \nGovernment Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF No. 75, 17).  Therefore, the Government \nDefendants’ Objection is overruled. \nB. Plaintiffs’ and Defendant Dawkin’s Objections\nPlaintiffs, Terrence Rolin and Rebecca Brown, and Defendant, Agent Steve Dawkin, \neach filed objections to the Report and Recommendation concerning Agent Dawkin’s Motion to \nDismiss.  The Plaintiffs challenge three aspects of the Report and Recommendations. They \nchallenge the Magistrate Judge’s (1) finding of qualified immunity regarding the seizure of Ms. \n4 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 5 of 8\nBrown’s person, (2) application of the Bivens framework as regards Defendant Dawkin, and (3) \nanalysis of special factors within the Bivens framework.  Agent Dawkin’s Objections agree with \nthe Recommendation to grant his Motion to Dismiss Count V, which dismissed him from the \ncase.  However, Agent Dawkin objects to the Magistrate Judge’s qualified immunity analysis \nregarding the alleged seizure of Plaintiffs’ cash.  Agent Dawkin also objects to the Magistrate \nJudge’s application of the new context analysis of the Bivens framework.  This Opinion will \ndiscuss the Bivens analysis before turning to the issue of qualified immunity. \n1.  Bivens Analysis \nBoth the Plaintiffs and Agent Dawkin object that the Magistrate Judge incorrectly applied \nthe Bivens framework.  (ECF No. 70, 3; ECF No. 71, 12).  As a threshold matter, the Report and \nRecommendation was correct in noting that “[a]lthough Bivens has become ‘a fixed principle in \nthe law,’ its judicial expansion is ‘disfavored,’ and accordingly Bivens is not to be extended to a \n“new context’ if ‘special factors’ counsel hesitation.  Ziglar v. Abbasi, 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 \n(2017).”  (ECF No. 66, 15).  The Supreme Court has explained the proper framework for the \nBivens analysis: \nWhen asked to extend Bivens, we engage in a two-step inquiry.  We first inquire \nwhether the request involves a claim that arises in a new context or involves a \nnew category of defendants. . . . When we find that a claim arises in a new \ncontext, we proceed to the second step and ask whether there are any ‘special \nfactors that counsel hesitation’ about granting the extension. \n \nHernandez v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 743 (2020).  The Supreme Court has also offered guidance \nas to whether a case presents a new Bivens context: \nIf the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by \nthis Court, then the context is new. . . . A case might differ in a meaningful way \nbecause of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the \ngenerality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to \nhow an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 6 of 8\nstatutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating the risk of \ndisruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches . . . . \nAbbasi, 137 S. Ct. at 1859-60.  Although these factors are instructive, they do not present \nan “exhaustive list” for determining whether a case presents a new Bivens context.  Id.   \nThe Magistrate Judge noted that “Count V of the FAC presents a ‘classic’ Bivens case – \nan asserted Fourth Amendment violation in a routine law enforcement context.” (ECF No. 66, \n15).  Having given thorough analysis to the history, context, and development of the law \nconcerning Bivens claims, this Court disagrees with the Magistrate Judge’s above premise and \nwill therefore reject the Report and Recommendation to the extent it notes that Count V presents \na “classic” Bivens case.  The Bivens claim allegations against Defendant Dawkin present Bivens \nin a new context.  This case is distinguishable from a classic Bivens case because it took place at \nan airport, it involved a seizure of cash, and Agent Dawkin was operating under an alleged DEA \npolicy.  Although the Plaintiffs’ claim does involve their Fourth Amendment rights, this is a new \nBivens context requiring judicial restraint.  Because this is a new Bivens context, the Court must \nnext conduct the special factors analysis to determine if it is appropriate to extend Bivens in this \ncase. \nAfter noting that the Plaintiffs’ claim was a classic Bivens case, the Magistrate Judge’s \nreport performed and applied the special factors analysis and concluded that “in the final \nanalysis, the intended forfeiture setting and the alleged controlling policy . . . and the associated \nprospect of administrative and/or injunctive relief constitutes a sufficiently weighty special factor \nto bar an implied damages remedy.”  (ECF No. 66, 18).  Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge’s \nReport and Recommendation correctly recommended that there is no legal basis to recognize a \nBivens claim in this case and that Defendant Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss Count V of the First \nAmended Complaint be granted.   As such, the Plaintiffs’ Objection is overruled as to the Report \n6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 7 of 8\nand Recommendation rejecting their Bivens claim, and the Defendant Dawkin’s Objection to the \nMagistrate’s reference that Count V presents a classic Bivens case is sustained such that said \nreference is rejected and the Recommendation for dismissal of Count V will be accepted. \n2. Qualified Immunity\nPlaintiffs object to the Magistrate Judge’s finding of qualified immunity to dismiss Ms. \nBrown’s claim against Defendant Dawkin for his seizure of her person.  (ECF No. 71, 7).  Agent \nDawkin objects to the Magistrate Judge’s qualified immunity analysis for the seizure of the \nPlaintiffs’ cash.  (ECF No. 70, 6).  The Magistrate Judge performed her qualified immunity \nanalysis before she assessed the viability of Plaintiffs’ Bivens claim against Agent Dawkin.  The \nBivens analysis is a threshold inquiry, which should be addressed first prior to a qualified \nimmunity analysis involving the resolution of constitutional issues.  Bistrian v. Levi, 912 F.3d \n79, 88-89 (3d Cir. 2018).  As Agent Dawkin points out in his Objections, resolving the Bivens \nclaim prior to discussing the issue of qualified immunity “is in line with the principle of \nconstitutional avoidance, which ‘generally counsel[s] against resolving constitutional issues \nwhen the parties’ dispute can be resolved on other grounds.’  United States v. Norwood, 819 F. \nApp’x 124, 125-26 (3d Cir. 2020).”  (ECF No. 70, 7).  In light of the Recommendation for \ndismissal of Count V, the qualified immunity analysis should not have been performed.  Because \nthe Magistrate Judge should have first examined the Bivens claim and then only assessed the \nqualified immunity defense if the Bivens claim survived, this Court rejects the qualified \nimmunity portion of the Report and Recommendation.  Because the Bivens analysis resolved \nAgent Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss Count V, the Plaintiffs’ and Mr. Dawkin’s respective \nObjections to the rejected aspects of the Report and Recommendation concerning qualified \nimmunity are moot. \n7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-MJH-LPL   Document 78   Filed 03/30/21   Page 8 of 8\nII. CONCLUSION\nFollowing a thorough review of the record, except for the following aspects of the Report \nand Recommendation which are being rejected, this Court concurs with and accepts the \nMagistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation.  The Report and Recommendation will be \nrejected as regards: (1) the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation which notes this \ncase as a classic Bivens claim, and (2) the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation \nregarding qualified immunity in relation to the dismissed Count V Bivens claims.  Accordingly, \nwith the acceptance of the remainder of the Report and Recommendation, the Government \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss will be denied for Counts I through III and will be granted for \nCount IV.  Agent Dawkin’s Motion to Dismiss at Count V will be granted.  A separate order to \nfollow. \nDATE: _M__a_rc_h_ _3_0_, _2_0_2_1____  __________________________ \nMarilyn J.

This civil rights lawsuit asks whether the government may seize a 79-year-old \nman’s  life  savings  without  any  indication  of  criminal  activity,  pursuant  to  unlawful  and \nunconstitutional federal agency policies or practices that violate the rights of thousands of air \ntravelers each year.  \n2.  In  addition  to  seeking  the  return  of  their  unconstitutionally  seized  cash  and \ncompensatory damages, Named Plaintiffs Rebecca Brown and August Terrence “Terry” Rolin \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a nationwide class of individuals who have been \nor will be subjected to unlawful and unconstitutional cash seizure policies or practices at airports \nacross the country.  \n3.  The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (“DEA”) have policies or practices of seizing cash from travelers at airports \nwithout reasonable suspicion or probable cause and based solely on the amount of cash. TSA’s \npolicy or practice exceeds the agency’s statutory authority and violates the Fourth Amendment. \nDEA’s policy or practice violates the Fourth Amendment.  \n4.  In late August 2019, Terry entrusted his daughter, Rebecca, with $82,373 in cash—\nhis and his parents’ life savings—so she could deposit it into a new bank account for him. They \nplanned to use the money for his health care and other needs, including replacing his teeth and \nfixing his truck.  \n5.  Rebecca was visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend to see Terry and attend a family \ncelebration. She intended to fly back to her home in Massachusetts with the cash and deposit it \ninto a new joint bank account. She placed the cash in a purse in her carry-on luggage and went to \nthe Pittsburgh airport early in the morning on August 26, 2019. She did not check any luggage.  \n  1 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 3 of 52\n6.  When she went through TSA transportation security screening at the Pittsburgh \nairport, TSA Screeners pulled aside Rebecca’s carry-on luggage solely because they observed via \nX-Ray that it contained a “large” amount of cash. They did not further inspect her carry-on luggage \nor the cash to see if it was concealing any dangerous or prohibited items. \n7.  After the TSA Screeners completed the security screening of Rebecca’s carry-on \nluggage containing her cash, they told her they were going to hold on to her luggage until law-\nenforcement officers could arrive.  \n8.  The TSA Screeners questioned Rebecca about why she had so much cash in her \ncarry-on luggage and asked her to produce her ID and proof of her travel arrangements to and from \nPittsburgh. Rebecca provided her ID and boarding passes, which the TSA Screeners took and \nphotocopied. \n9.  Rebecca did not feel free to leave and believed she was being held by TSA. Even \nif the TSA Screeners had told her she was free to leave, she could not realistically have left her \ncarry-on luggage with her father’s life savings and her other possessions. She was, in fact, \neffectively seized along with her luggage. \n10.  As determined by TSA’s transportation security screening, Rebecca had no items \nthat could threaten transportation security—weapons, explosives, or incendiaries—in her luggage \nor on her person. She also had no illegal drugs or any other contraband.  \n11.  There was no indication of suspicious or criminal activity in Rebecca’s behavior or \nthe way she was traveling with cash, which was in a purse in her carry-on luggage.  \n12.  Nevertheless, after TSA seized her and her luggage for approximately 10-20 \nminutes, Rebecca was questioned by a Pennsylvania state trooper and then by his supervisor about \nwhy she was traveling with the cash.  \n  2 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 4 of 52\n13.  Rebecca was honest and forthcoming with the troopers and explained that she was \ntaking the cash home with her to deposit in a new bank account for her father. After answering \ntheir questions, Rebecca was eventually allowed to leave with her carry-on luggage, including the \ncash.   \n14.  But after she arrived at her boarding gate, the same trooper and a DEA agent \napproached her, pulled her aside, and questioned her further about the cash. She truthfully \nexplained to the DEA agent that she was traveling with the cash to deposit it in the bank for her \nfather and why she was doing so.  \n15.  Despite Rebecca’s explanation, and without probable cause, the DEA agent seized \nTerry’s life savings because it was greater than $5,000 and was thus considered a “suspicious” \namount under DEA’s policy or practice regarding the seizure of cash from travelers at airports. \n16.  DEA has continued to hold Terry’s life savings since August 26, 2019, and has \ntaken actions to permanently keep the money using civil forfeiture. \n17.  Neither Terry nor Rebecca has been arrested for or charged with any crime.  \n18.  The initial and continued seizure of Terry’s life savings since August 26, 2019, has \nprevented him from replacing his teeth and repairing his truck, among other expenses.  \n19.  Terry’s and Rebecca’s story is not unique. What happened to them illustrates the \nsystematic policies or practices of TSA and DEA: seizing cash from air travelers based solely on \nthe presence of what these agencies believe to be “large” or “suspicious” amounts of cash.  \n20.  These policies or practices of TSA and DEA violate the Fourth Amendment.  \n21.  TSA’s policy or practice also exceeds TSA’s statutory authority, which is limited \nto transportation security and does not extend to investigating potential crimes unrelated to \ntransportation security.  \n  3 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 5 of 52\n22.  On behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, Terry and Rebecca bring this \nclass-action  lawsuit  to  recover  their  property  and  put  these  systematic  unlawful  and \nunconstitutional policies and practices to an end.  \nJurisdiction  \n23.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. \n24.

Two individual claims for the return of their seized cash, with interest, and \nfor compensatory damages.  \nB.  Named Plaintiff August Terrence Rolin  \n32.  Named Plaintiff August Terrence Rolin (“Terry”) is an adult citizen of the United \nStates and is a resident of Morgan, Pennsylvania.  \n33.  Terry is a 79-year-old retiree and is the father of Named Plaintiff Rebecca Brown.  \n34.  Terry has joint ownership with Rebecca of the $82,373 in U.S. currency that \nDefendants seized on August 26, 2019. \n35.  Terry, with Rebecca, brings: \na.

Defendant Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”)  \n36.  TSA  is  a  federal  agency  charged  with  protecting  the  nation’s  transportation \nsystems, particularly air travel. 49 U.S.C. § 114(d)-(e). \n37.  TSA is not a general law-enforcement agency. Most of its employees are not law-\nenforcement officers and do not have general law-enforcement authority or duties.  \n38.  Pursuant to its statutory mandate, TSA conducts transportation security screenings \nof passengers and their luggage at U.S. airports. See 49 U.S.C. §§ 114(e), 44901. \n39.  TSA must promulgate regulations requiring air carriers to refuse to transport a \npassenger or their luggage if the passenger “does not consent to a search under section 44901(a) \nof this title establishing whether the passenger is carrying unlawfully a dangerous weapon, \nexplosive, or other destructive substance” or if the passenger “does not consent to a search of the \nproperty establishing whether the property unlawfully contains a dangerous weapon, explosive, or \nother destructive substance.” 49 U.S.C. § 44902(a)(1)-(2). \n40.  TSA  conducts  the  transportation  security  screenings  described  in  49  U.S.C. \n§ 44902(a). \n41.  Pursuant to its statutory mandates, TSA’s authority to conduct transportation \nsecurity  screenings  is  limited  to  “the  inspection  of  individuals  and  property  for  weapons, \nexplosives, and incendiaries.” 49 C.F.R. § 1540.5. \n42.  TSA employees who conduct these transportation security screenings at airports \n(“TSA  Screeners”)  include  Transportation  Security  Officers  and  Supervisory  Transportation \nSecurity Officers. \n  6 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 8 of 52\n43.  TSA  Screeners  are  not  law-enforcement  officers,  do  not  have  general  law-\nenforcement authority or duties, and are not permitted to engage in general law-enforcement \ninvestigations. \n44.  Transportation security screenings at airport checkpoints by TSA Screeners are \nadministrative searches conducted for the limited purpose of ensuring transportation security. They \nare not, by law, searches conducted for general law-enforcement purposes. \n45.  In contravention of this limited authority and duties, upon information and belief, \nTSA Screeners follow a TSA policy or practice of seizing travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, \npersonal effects, and/or persons after TSA Screeners have concluded the transportation security \nscreening and determined that no items that pose a threat to transportation security are present. \n46.  Upon information and belief, TSA Screeners base these seizures on whether the \ntraveler appears to be traveling with a “large” amount of currency.  \n47.  Upon information and belief, what TSA Screeners consider to be a “large” amount \nof currency may vary, but is usually approximately $10,000 or more, or what appears to TSA \nScreeners to be approximately $10,000 or more, based on visual inspection or the X-Ray image of \ncarry-on luggage. \n48.  Upon information and belief, TSA Screeners make these seizures without regard \nfor whether reasonable suspicion or probable cause exists for the seizures.  \n49.  Upon information and belief, TSA Screeners make these seizures in order to hold \nthe traveler’s currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or person until law-enforcement \nofficers can arrive and investigate. \n50.  Upon information and belief, TSA has been engaging in this policy or practice for \nthe entirety of the period described in Plaintiffs’ proposed TSA Class definition. \n  7 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 9 of 52\n51.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to this policy or practice, TSA seized Terry’s \nand Rebecca’s cash, Rebecca’s carry-on luggage and its contents, Rebecca’s ID and boarding \npasses, and Rebecca herself on August 26, 2019.  \nD.  Defendant David P. Pekoske \n52.  Defendant Pekoske is the current Administrator of TSA. \n53.  As Administrator of TSA, Pekoske is responsible for overseeing the operations of \nTSA, including the policy or practice at issue here. \n54.  Pekoske is sued in his official capacity.  \nE.  Defendant Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”)  \n55.  DEA is a federal agency charged with enforcing the controlled substances laws and \nregulations in the United States. 21 U.S.C. § 878.   \n56.  A substantial portion of DEA’s activities involve the seizure of currency that it \nbelieves is connected to controlled substances, including at airports across the country. \n57.  Upon information and belief, DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency \nfrom travelers at U.S. airports without probable cause, based solely on the presence of currency on \ntheir person or in their carry-on luggage.   \n58.  Upon information and belief, DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency \nfrom travelers at U.S. airports without probable cause, based solely on the presence of $5,000 or \nmore on their person or in their carry-on luggage. \n59.  Upon information and belief, after seizing currency from air travelers in this \nmanner, DEA typically attempts to initiate the civil forfeiture of the property under the Civil Asset \nForfeiture Reform Act (“CAFRA”). \n  8 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 10 of 52\n60.  Upon information and belief, DEA has been engaging in this policy or practice of \nseizing currency from travelers at U.S. airports without probable cause for the entirety of the period \ndescribed in Plaintiffs’ proposed DEA Class definition. \n61.  Upon information and belief, pursuant to DEA’s policy or practice, one or more \nDEA agents seized Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash on August 26, 2019.  \nF.  Defendant Uttam Dhillon \n62.  Defendant Dhillon is the current Acting Administrator of DEA. \n63.  As  Acting  Administrator  of  DEA,  Dhillon  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the \noperations of DEA, including the policy or practice at issue here. \n64.  Dhillon is sued in his official capacity.  \nG. Defendant DEA Agent “Steve,” Last Name Unknown  \n65.  Upon information and belief, the DEA agent who, pursuant to the DEA policy or \npractice described above, seized Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash on August 26, 2019, in violation of \ntheir Fourth Amendment rights is named Steve, last name unknown (“Steve”). \n66.  Upon information and belief, DEA Agent Steve’s phone number is 412-475-3678. \n67.  Steve’s full identity is currently unknown, but Plaintiffs expect that his identity will \nbe uncovered in the course of discovery. \n68.  Steve is sued in his individual capacity pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named \nAgents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). \nH. Defendant United States of America \n69.  Defendant United States of America is the national federal government established \nby  the  United  States  Constitution.  As  such,  it  is  subject  to  limitations  imposed  by  the \nConstitution—including, as relevant here, the Fourth Amendment. \n  9 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 11 of 52\n70.  The constitutional violations at issue here involve the actions of federal agencies \nand employees and are therefore ultimately chargeable to the federal government itself.  \nFactual Allegations \nA.  Terry and his family stored cash in their family home.  \n71.  Terry is 79 years old and lives in Morgan, Pennsylvania.  \n72.  Terry grew up in a mining community southwest of Pittsburgh, where his parents \npurchased the family home in South Fayette, Pennsylvania, in the 1920s with money earned from \nhis father’s mining wages.  \n73.  After graduating from college in the 1960s, Terry worked for a railroad company \nuntil workplace knee and shoulder injuries forced him to retire in 1994. Since 1994, Terry has been \nreceiving Railroad Retirement benefits.  \n74.  In 2005, after his wife passed away, Terry moved back into the family home with \nhis mother. \n75.  When his mother passed away in 2006, Terry purchased the family home from his \nother family members and continued living there. \n76.  Terry’s parents lived through the Great Depression, so instead of keeping most of \ntheir money in bank accounts, they had a habit of storing cash in envelopes hidden throughout the \nfamily home, particularly in the unfinished basement.  \n77.   Terry adopted this same habit long ago, and after moving back into the family \nhome, he continued to store cash there.  \n78.  Each  month  since  his  retirement,  Terry  receives  about  $2,700  in  Railroad \nRetirement payments deposited into his PNC bank account.  \n  10 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 12 of 52\n79.  Terry regularly withdrew a portion of his Railroad Retirement payments from the \nbank and stored the cash in the family home, stuffed into envelopes. Generally, these envelopes of \ncash were stored in spaces between the walls and rafters in the unfinished basement.   \n80.  Envelopes of cash hidden by Terry’s mother were also still in the family home at \nthe time of her passing. \n81.  Over the years, between envelopes of cash stashed away by Terry and his mother, \ntens of thousands of dollars accumulated within the walls of the family home. \n82.  In 2018, Terry and Rebecca decided that with Terry’s progressing age and declining \nhealth, the family home was too much for him to maintain.  \n83.  Terry sold the longtime family home in November 2018, and moved into a small \napartment located in Morgan, Pennsylvania. He still lives in the apartment.  \n84.  In the course of Terry’s move, the cash stored in the family home was placed into \nvarious moving boxes, dispersed somewhat sporadically throughout Terry’s belongings as more \nenvelopes of cash turned up in the crevices of the family home.  \n85.  Because of his health problems, Terry took months to slowly unpack his belongings \nin his new apartment. While unpacking, he would periodically find the envelopes of cash. He \neventually stored all of the cash in one large tupperware container in the apartment.  \n86.  Terry continues to occasionally store cash in his new apartment.  \nB.  Terry entrusted the stored cash with his daughter, Rebecca. \n87.  After a substantial amount of cash accumulated in the tupperware container, Terry \nbecame concerned about the security of his family’s life savings. To better safeguard his family’s \nlife savings, Terry asked his family for help.   \n  11 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 13 of 52\n88.  In August 2019, Terry’s daughter, Rebecca, who lives in Massachusetts, flew to \nPittsburgh for the weekend for her brother’s wedding reception and to visit with Terry. \n89.  Rebecca, who works full time, was only in town for the weekend; she arrived on \nFriday, August 23, 2019, and departed early on the morning of Monday, August 26, 2019.  \n90.  Terry decided that he should give Rebecca power of attorney so that she could help \ncare for him. \n91.  Terry and Rebecca also decided the best course of action would be to deposit the \ncash into a new joint bank account shared with Rebecca so that she could help him use the money \nto pay for his much-needed dental care and to fix his truck, among other health care needs and \nprojects. \n92.  Terry and Rebecca would have joint ownership of and access to the new bank \naccount, but the primary purpose of the account would be to help with Terry’s health care and \nother expenses.  \n93.  Terry and Rebecca only finalized their plan for the cash on Saturday after the banks \nhad closed, and Rebecca was not able to take physical possession of the cash until Sunday night. \n94.  There was no time for Rebecca to deposit the cash in a bank before her flight left \non Monday morning, so she planned to take it with her and deposit it in the new bank account after \nshe arrived back home in Massachusetts. \n95.  Rebecca was excited to use the funds to improve her aging and ailing father’s \nquality of life. Some of the money was immediately earmarked for urgent dental care—namely \nreplacing Terry’s teeth and caring for his gum disease—and for fixing Terry’s old truck, which is \nhis primary mode of transportation and is badly in need of repairs.  \n  12 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 14 of 52\n96.  With Terry’s consent, some of the money was also earmarked to pay off a tax debt \nRebecca owes the IRS.  \n97.  Rebecca and one of her brothers also decided to give their father something his life \nwas lacking: a hobby. They planned to use some of the money to buy Terry an old hobby truck to \nrepair and tinker with.  \n98.  Rebecca’s  brother found a 1972 Chevrolet C10 Stepside for sale online that \nRebecca was going to look at the following weekend. They were excited to give their father a \nhobby to keep him engaged and occupied in his later years.  \n99.  Terry did not know that his children were planning to buy him a hobby truck as a \nsurprise. \nC.  TSA seized Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash at the transportation security screening \ncheckpoint.  \n \n100.  Rebecca  had  an  early  flight  back  to  Boston,  Massachusetts,  departing  from \nPittsburgh International Airport on the morning of August 26, 2019. \n101.  Because she did not have time to deposit the cash before leaving Pittsburgh, \nRebecca researched on the Internet whether she could lawfully fly with the cash. She learned that \nflying domestically with any amount of cash is legal.  \n102.  She packed Terry’s cash inside a purse in her carry-on luggage, which was a beach \nbag with her belongings. She did not bring any luggage to check. \n103.  When she got to the airport, Rebecca was directed to an alternate transportation \nsecurity screening checkpoint several minutes away from the primary transportation security \nscreening checkpoint. \n104.  While she went through the transportation security screening checkpoint, a TSA \nScreener was alerted to the presence of cash in Rebecca’s luggage.  \n  13 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 15 of 52\n105.  Upon information and belief, a TSA Screener saw the cash in the X-Ray image of \nRebecca’s carry-on luggage. \n106.  Rebecca’s carry-on luggage was pulled aside by TSA Screeners, but no TSA \nScreener ever opened or physically inspected Rebecca’s carry-on luggage or the purse inside \ncontaining the cash.  \n107.  Upon information and belief, the TSA Screeners had no safety concerns about \nRebecca’s carry-on luggage, as evidenced by that fact that no TSA Screener ever physically \nexamined the contents of her carry-on luggage or the purse inside containing the cash. \n108.  Upon  information  and  belief,  TSA  had  completed  its  transportation  security \nscreening at this point. \n109.  After Rebecca’s carry-on luggage was pulled aside, a TSA Screener questioned \nRebecca about the cash inside. Rebecca explained why she had the cash—that she was taking it to \ndeposit in a bank account for her father, who had accumulated the cash in savings. \n110.  A TSA Screener also asked her for her ID and proof of her travel arrangements to \nand from Pittsburgh. Rebecca provided her ID and boarding passes, as requested. A TSA Screener \ntook the documents she provided and photocopied them. \n111.  Upon  information  and  belief,  TSA  was  pursuing  no  transportation  security \nobjectives  when  TSA  Screeners  questioned  Rebecca  about  the  cash,  demanded  her  travel \ndocuments and ID, and photocopied those documents.  \n112.  Upon  information  and  belief,  TSA  was  pursuing  no  transportation  security \nobjectives when TSA Screeners seized Rebecca’s carry-on luggage and cash and held it until law \nenforcement arrived. \n  14 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 16 of 52\n113.  Rebecca was not permitted to retrieve her carry-on luggage and continue to her \ngate. \n114.  Rebecca did not feel free to leave. She believed that both she and her luggage were \nbeing held by TSA. TSA Screeners also had her ID and boarding passes. \n115.  Even if TSA had told her she was permitted to leave, it would not have been \npractical or reasonable for Rebecca to leave the transportation security screening checkpoint \nwithout her and her father’s cash, her carry-on luggage and its contents, and her ID. \n116.  Upon information and belief, the mere presence of the cash in Rebecca’s carry-on \nluggage was the only reason that the TSA Screeners seized Rebecca’s carry-on luggage and cash, \nseized Rebecca herself, questioned her about the cash, and asked for her ID and proof of her travel \narrangements to and from Pittsburgh. \n117.  Upon information and belief, based solely on the presence of the cash in Rebecca’s \ncarry-on luggage, the TSA Screeners called a Pennsylvania state trooper to the scene.  \n118.  TSA made Rebecca wait approximately 10-20 minutes for the state trooper to arrive \nwhile TSA held her and her father’s cash, her carry-on luggage and its contents, and her ID and \nboarding passes.  \n119.  During this period of time, Rebecca’s and her father’s cash, Rebecca’s carry-on \nluggage and its contents, and Rebecca’s ID and boarding passes were seized by TSA.  \n120.  During this period of time, Rebecca herself was also seized by TSA.  \n121.  When the state trooper finally arrived, he again questioned Rebecca. She repeated \nher explanation of the cash’s origin, purpose, and destination. \n122.  The state trooper then called his supervisor, a lieutenant, and Rebecca had to wait \nan additional 10-15 minutes to repeat herself a third time to the lieutenant.  \n  15 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 17 of 52\n123.  After this third round of questioning, the TSA Screeners permitted Rebecca to \nretrieve her carry-on luggage, cash, and other possessions, and resume her trip.  \n124.  By the end of these encounters, TSA had held Rebecca and her possessions for \napproximately 30 minutes or more. \n125.  Rebecca  found  it  extremely  embarrassing  to  be  held  and  questioned  for \napproximately 30 minutes or more in front of other travelers because it appeared she had done \nsomething wrong or illegal.  \n126.  Despite these delays, Rebecca made it to her gate with time to spare and began \nworking on her laptop.  \nD.  DEA seized Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash. \n127.  But Rebecca was soon approached at the gate by the same state trooper who \nquestioned her earlier, this time accompanied by another man in a blue polo shirt. \n128.  The man in the blue polo said his name was Steve, that he was a DEA agent, and \nthat he had some questions for her. \n129.  Rebecca felt like she had no choice but to comply with his demands. \n130.  The two men escorted Rebecca to a less crowded part of the gate area to question \nher. \n131.  Rebecca did not feel free to leave. She also needed to remain near the gate in order \nto board her flight. \n132.  Steve asked Rebecca to show him the cash in the purse in her carry-on luggage. \nRebecca felt like she had no choice but to comply with his demands and showed him the cash.  \n133.  Upon information and belief, Steve decided to seize the cash as soon as he saw the \namount, pursuant to DEA’s policy or practice of seizing currency totaling more than $5,000 when \n  16 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 18 of 52\nfound in the possession of travelers at airports regardless of whether there is probable cause for \nthe seizure. \n134.  Steve then questioned Rebecca about why she was traveling with the cash. For the \nfourth time, Rebecca explained the origins of the cash and why she was traveling with it.  \n135.  After hearing Rebecca’s explanation, Steve asked to speak with Terry to verify \nwhat she had just told him.  \n136.  Rebecca informed Steve that her father was elderly, would still be asleep at 7:00 \na.m., and would likely be confused by the call, but Steve insisted that she call Terry so that Steve \ncould talk to him. \n137.  Terry has age-related memory and cognitive issues, and he typically sleeps until \nlate morning or noon. Terry was woken up by the phone call and was groggy, confused, and upset \nwhen he answered the phone.  \n138.  Terry also did not know that his children were planning to buy him a surprise hobby \ntruck, so he could not corroborate those facts.  \n139.  For these reasons—Terry being awoken several hours early; Terry’s cognitive \nissues; and Terry being unaware of Rebecca’s planned surprise—Terry had difficulty answering \nall of Steve’s questions.  \n140.  After speaking with Terry, Steve told Rebecca that “your answers don’t match.”  \n141.  Steve then took the cash and searched the rest of Rebecca’s beach bag.  \n142.  Steve seized all of Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash, totaling $82,373 in U.S. currency.  \n143.  Rebecca was not arrested or charged with any crime, and was finally permitted to \nboard her flight to Boston, deeply embarrassed by her fellow passengers and other onlookers \n  17 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 19 of 52\nstaring at her during this entire encounter because it appeared she had done something wrong or \nillegal.  \n144.  Rebecca was the last passenger to board her flight and was not able to call her father \nbefore her flight departed. When she landed, she had several missed calls and voicemails from her \ndistraught father, who did not know what was happening to his daughter or where she may have \nbeen taken.   \n145.  Terry and Rebecca have been unable to recover their money for more than four \nmonths.  \n146.  Terry and Rebecca received CAFRA notices for the entire $82,373 dated October \n11, 2019, from DEA indicating DEA’s intention to permanently keep their cash through civil \nforfeiture. \n147.  Upon information and belief, Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash was seized and is being \nforfeited without any articulable reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  \n148.  Upon information and belief, at the time of the seizure, neither Terry nor Rebecca \nwas under investigation for any criminal activity.  \n149.  Neither Terry nor Rebecca has been arrested for or charged with any crime related \nto or arising from any circumstances surrounding the seizure of their cash.  \n150.  It is not a crime to travel with any amount of currency, and there are no legal \nrequirements to report to the government that one is traveling domestically with any amount of \ncurrency.  \nIndividual Injuries to the Named Plaintiffs \n151.  Terry and Rebecca have a joint ownership interest in the $82,373 in cash that \nDefendants seized and that DEA seeks to forfeit.  \n  18 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 20 of 52\n152.  Rebecca also has a possessory interest in the seized cash. \n153.  TSA’s ultra vires and unconstitutional seizure of Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash after \nthe transportation security screening had concluded violated their Fourth Amendment rights to be \nfree from unreasonable seizures. \n154.  TSA’s ultra vires and unconstitutional seizure of Rebecca’s carry-on luggage, ID, \nboarding passes, and other possessions after the transportation security screening had concluded \nviolated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.  \n155.  TSA’s ultra vires and unconstitutional seizure of Rebecca’s cash, carry-on luggage, \nID,  boarding  passes,  and  other  possessions  after  the  transportation  security  screening  had \nconcluded constituted a seizure of Rebecca herself and violated her Fourth Amendment right to be \nfree from unreasonable seizures. \n156.  DEA’s  unconstitutional  seizure  of  Terry’s  and  Rebecca’s  cash  violated  and \ncontinues to violate their Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures.  \n157.  DEA’s continued and ongoing seizure of Terry’s and Rebecca’s money constitutes \nan ongoing injury to Terry and Rebecca. \n158.  Throughout the time Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash has been in DEA’s possession, \nTerry and Rebecca have been unable to make use of their money. \n159.  Terry’s and Rebecca’s inability to use the seized money has resulted in ongoing \npain and suffering to Terry and Rebecca, including but not limited to Terry’s inability to pay to \nreplace his teeth, care for his gums, and fix his truck.  \n160.   Terry is suffering serious physical pain caused by not being able to replace his \nteeth. It is painful for him to eat, and he can only eat soft foods that he does not have to chew. But \nfor the seizure of the cash, Terry and Rebecca would have spent some of the money on dental \n  19 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 21 of 52\nprocedures to replace Terry’s teeth and care for his gums so that he could eat normally and without \npain. \n161.  Terry is suffering from the deprivation of the financial resources to repair his truck, \nwhich is badly rusted and needs a new body and interior repairs. But for the seizure of the cash, \nTerry and Rebecca would have spent some of the money to repair Terry’s truck, which is his \nprimary mode of transportation. \n162.  Terry is suffering from the ongoing deprivation of the enjoyment and use of his life \nsavings, materially impacting his quality of life. But for the seizure of the cash, Rebecca would \nhave spent some of the money to buy Terry a hobby truck to tinker with, and they would have \nspent some of the money on other expenses that would improve Terry’s quality of life, such as \nhealth care. \n163.  Rebecca’s inability to use the money has deprived her of the planned payment of \nher tax debt, which is accordingly accruing interest. But for the seizure of the cash, Rebecca would \nhave paid off her tax debt and it would not have continued to accrue interest.  \n164.  Terry suffered emotional distress, pain, and suffering caused by the stress of not \nknowing what happened to his daughter for several hours on the day of the seizure. \n165.  Terry continues to suffer emotional distress, pain, and suffering caused by the \nongoing deprivation of his and his parents’ life savings.  \n166.  Rebecca suffered and continues to suffer emotional distress, pain, and suffering \ncaused by the insult and humiliation of the circumstances and manner of the unlawful seizure of \nher and her father’s cash and life savings.  \n167.  Rebecca suffered and continues to suffer emotional distress, pain, and suffering \ncaused by her father’s ongoing physical pain and suffering due to not having the dental and medical \n  20 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 22 of 52\ncare he needs, and from her concerns about her father’s safety while driving his truck, which is \nbadly in need of repairs.  \n168.  Terry and Rebecca have been deprived of their preferred method of managing and \nmoving Terry’s cash once it accumulates again or when Terry finds additional envelopes of cash \nas he continues unpacking moving boxes. Because Rebecca regularly visits Terry over the \nweekend, when banks are typically closed, it would be easiest for her to simply take the cash back \nhome with her and deposit it when the bank opens.  \n169.  But for the seizure of their cash at the Pittsburgh airport on August 26, 2019, \nRebecca would continue to fly home to Massachusetts with the cash and deposit it there to ensure \nthat it is deposited in the correct accounts and to avoid the re-accumulation of a large amount of \ncash in Terry’s apartment. \nTSA Class Action Allegations \n170.  Congress gave TSA statutory authority to operate under 49 U.S.C. § 114, which \nmakes the agency “responsible for security in all modes of transportation.” 49 U.S.C. § 114(d). \nThis  includes  the  authority  to  conduct  air  transportation  security  screening  operations. \n49 U.S.C. § 114(e). TSA is statutorily charged with developing “policies, strategies, and plans for \ndealing with threats to transportation security.” 49 U.S.C. § 114(f)(3). \n171.  TSA’s authority over air transportation security is set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 44903. \n172.  TSA’s authority to screen passengers and property is set forth in 49 U.S.C. § 44901. \n173.  TSA’s statutory authority is so narrowly limited to these purposes that Congress \nfelt it was necessary to specifically authorize TSA to keep loose change and other money that is \nincidentally left behind at transportation security screening checkpoints. See 49 U.S.C. § 44945. \n  21 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 23 of 52\n174.  Transportation security screenings at airport checkpoints by TSA Screeners are \nadministrative searches conducted for the limited purpose of ensuring transportation security. They \nare not, by law, searches conducted for general law-enforcement purposes. \n175.  TSA’s screening procedures are designed to assess whether air passengers or their \nluggage are a threat to transportation security by screening for dangerous items. \n176.  The scope of TSA transportation security screenings is limited to “the inspection of \nindividuals and property for weapons, explosives, and incendiaries.” 49 C.F.R. § 1540.5; see also \n49 U.S.C. § 44902. \n177.  Air travelers “may not have a weapon, explosive, or incendiary, on or about the \nindividual’s person or accessible property.” 49 C.F.R. § 1540.111. \n178.  A weapon, explosive, or incendiary is specifically defined by TSA in an exhaustive \nlist at 70 Fed. Reg. 9878 (Mar. 1, 2005), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-\n2005-03-01/pdf/05-3977.pdf.  TSA’s  exhaustive  list  of  defined  weapons,  explosives,  or \nincendiaries does not include “cash,” “currency,” or “money.” \n179.  Once TSA Screeners have determined that none of the defined prohibited items are \npresent and that the traveler and their carry-on luggage and personal effects do not present a threat \nto transportation security, the transportation security screening has concluded, and TSA Screeners \ndo not have authority to further detain the traveler, their carry-on luggage, or their personal effects. \n180.  Currency is not a weapon. \n181.  Currency is not an explosive. \n182.  Currency is not an incendiary.  \n183.  Currency is not a threat to transportation security or air travel safety.  \n  22 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 24 of 52\n184.  Air travelers carrying large amounts of currency do not, on that basis, present any \nthreat to transportation security or air travel safety.   \n185.  No statute or regulation identifies “cash” or “currency” as a threat to transportation \nsecurity or air travel safety. \n186.  No statute or regulation identifies “cash” or “currency” as a dangerous or prohibited \nitem for air travelers.  \n187.  TSA  provides  an  online  list  of  items  which  are,  or  are  not,  prohibited.  See \nTransportation Security Administration, What Can I Bring?, https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-\nscreening/whatcanibring/all-list (last visited Jan. 10, 2020). There are currently 457 items on the \nlist. \n188.  Nowhere on this list of 457 items are “cash,” “currency,” or “money” mentioned, \nlet alone identified as prohibited items.  \n189.  TSA  Operations  Directive  400-54-6  (Oct.  29,  2009)  and  TSA  Management \nDirective No. 100.4 (Sept. 1, 2009) are agency policies that purport to provide binding guidance \nto TSA Screeners regarding their statutory and regulatory authority and duties with respect to the \ndetection of currency at transportation security screening checkpoints.  \n190.  TSA admits that “[t]raveling with large amounts of currency is not illegal,” and that \nthe only relevance of currency to transportation security screenings is that “[l]arge amounts of \ncurrency (‘bulk currency’) can . . . conceal a weapon, explosives, or other items that may pose a \nthreat to transportation security.” TSA Operations Directive 400-54-6 (Oct. 29, 2009).  \n191.  Accordingly, “large quantities of currency discovered at the checkpoint, either on \na person or in accessible property, may need closer examination to ensure prohibited items are not \n  23 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 25 of 52\nsecreted and to clear the person or property to enter the sterile area.” TSA Operations Directive \n400-54-6 (Oct. 29, 2009). \n192.  If that additional screening is completed uneventfully and no prohibited items are \ndiscovered, the transportation security screening has concluded and the traveler is free to enter the \nsterile (secured) area of the airport. \n193.  TSA also admits that “[s]creening may not be conducted to detect evidence of \ncrimes unrelated to transportation security.” TSA Management Directive No. 100.4 (Sept. 1, \n2009). \n194.  Neither TSA Operations Directive 400-54-6 (Oct. 29, 2009) nor TSA Management \nDirective No. 100.4 (Sept. 1, 2009) purports to expand TSA Screeners’ authority or duties beyond \ntheir  statutory  and  regulatory  bounds—i.e.,  administrative  screenings  limited  to  threats  to \ntransportation security.  \n195.  Indeed, no TSA directive could expand TSA Screeners’ authority or duties beyond \ntheir statutory and regulatory bounds. \n196.  TSA Screeners have no statutory authority to seize people or property based on the \npresence of currency. \n197.  TSA Screeners also do not have statutory authority to seize other items that do not \npose a threat to transportation security, including potential contraband or potential evidence of a \ncrime unrelated to transportation security. \n198.  Because of the limits of their statutory authority, if TSA Screeners encounter \npotential contraband or potential evidence of a crime unrelated to transportation security, they are \nsupposed  to  notify  law-enforcement  personnel  rather  than  seize  the  property  or  personally \ninvestigate. \n  24 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 26 of 52\n199.  But in contravention of those statutory and regulatory bounds, upon information \nand belief, TSA follows a policy or practice of having TSA Screeners seize travelers’ currency, \ncarry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons after TSA has determined that no items that \npose a threat to transportation security are present and the transportation security screening has \nconcluded. \n200.  Upon information and belief, TSA follows this policy or practice based on the \npresence of what TSA Screeners consider “large” amounts of currency on travelers or in their \ncarry-on luggage. \n201.  But traveling with “large” amounts of currency is not illegal, and an air traveler’s \nmere possession of “large” amounts of currency, by itself, does not give rise to reasonable \nsuspicion of a crime.  \n202.  Upon information and belief, these TSA seizures of travelers’ currency, carry-on \nluggage, personal effects, and/or persons, while temporary, can sometimes last from several \nminutes to more than 30 minutes after the transportation security screening is complete. \n203.  During this time, although TSA Screeners may tell travelers that they are free to \nleave, as a practical matter, travelers may not leave without their seized currency, carry-on luggage, \nand/or personal effects. \n204.  These temporary TSA seizures of travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, and/or \npersonal effects meaningfully interfere with these travelers’ possessory interest in their property. \nFor example, while TSA Screeners seize their currency and/or carry-on luggage, travelers cannot \ntake their currency and/or carry-on luggage with them to their boarding gate, use items in their \ncarry-on luggage, or use the currency to purchase items in the airport. \n  25 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 27 of 52\n205.  Travelers typically keep valuable or important personal effects and property in their \ncarry-on  luggage  that  they  cannot  realistically  leave  behind,  including  cell  phones,  laptop \ncomputers and tablets, wallets, credit cards, passports and other identification documents, travel \ndocuments, appointment books, medications, essential toiletries, and clothes. This is particularly \ntrue while going through TSA transportation security screening, because travelers are typically \ninstructed by TSA to remove everything from their pockets and are typically not permitted to have \nanything on their person that will cause TSA metal detectors or other screening devices to alert. \n206.  Because these TSA seizures are of a traveler’s valuable or important possessions, \nwhich typically include their currency and their carry-on luggage (including their personal effects \nstored in their carry-on luggage), the traveler is effectively seized when their property is seized.   \n207.  TSA’s policy or practice of seizing travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, personal \neffects, and/or persons after the transportation security screening has concluded is ultra vires \nbecause  it  exceeds  TSA’s  statutory  authority  to  exercise  administrative  powers  related  to \ntransportation security and to conduct “day-to-day Federal security screening operations for \npassenger air transportation and intrastate air transportation,” 49 U.S.C. § 114(e)(1), which TSA \ndefines as “the inspection of individuals and property for weapons, explosives, and incendiaries,” \n49 C.F.R. § 1540.5.  \n208.  TSA’s policy or practice of seizing travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, personal \neffects, and/or persons after the transportation security screening has concluded and without \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause also violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against \nunreasonable searches and seizures by seizing property and persons beyond the time and scope of \nthe mission for which the agency’s initial lawful administrative search was initiated. \n  26 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 28 of 52\n209.  To remedy the ongoing statutory and constitutional violations caused by TSA’s \npolicy or practice, Plaintiffs seek class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). Plaintiffs seek a declaration that TSA’s policy or practice exceeds the \nagency’s statutory and regulatory authority and violates the Fourth Amendment rights of travelers. \nPlaintiffs accordingly seek an injunction prohibiting TSA from seizing travelers’ currency, carry-\non luggage, personal effects, and/or persons at transportation security screening checkpoints—\nbased  on  the  presence  of  currency  on  their  person  or  in  their  carry-on  luggage—after  the \ntransportation security screening has concluded.  \n210.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. Individual challenges to TSA’s unlawful and unconstitutional \npolicy or practice will, by their nature, often become moot by the return of property, and in any \nevent the costs associated with bringing individual challenges are often prohibitive of a full and \nfair process for vindicating individuals’ statutory and constitutional rights. A class action will \nallow for effective, class-wide relief to remedy these ongoing and repeated ultra vires actions by \nTSA that also violate the Fourth Amendment.  \n211.  Plaintiffs propose the following class definition for the “TSA Class”: \n“All air travelers who, from January 15, 2014, until the present, either have had or will \nhave their currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or person seized by TSA Screeners at \ntransportation security screening checkpoints—based on the presence of a ‘large’ amount of \ncurrency on their person or in their carry-on luggage—after the transportation security screening \nhas concluded.”  \n212.  This action meets all the Rule 23(a) prerequisites for maintaining a class action.  \n  27 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 29 of 52\n213.  Numerosity under Rule 23(a)(1): The putative class is so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable. \na.  TSA is responsible for the security of nearly 440 airports, and over 25,000 \nflights per day.  \nb.  Every day in 2018, TSA screened over two million passengers, with a total of \n813.8 million passengers screened over the course of the year. \nc.  Every day, TSA screens 5.5 million carry-on items for weapons, explosives, \nand incendiaries. \nd.  In  2018  alone,  TSA  Screeners  detected  and  seized  4,239  firearms  at \ntransportation security screening checkpoints. \ne.  In  2015,  TSA  confiscated  more  than  22,000  “dangerous  items”  at \ntransportation security screening checkpoints. \nf.  Upon information and belief, air travelers bring what TSA considers to be a \n“large” amount of currency into the secured area of an airport (which is legal) \nfar more often than they attempt to bring guns or other dangerous items into \nthe secured area of an airport (which is illegal). \ng.  Upon information and belief, TSA Screeners are likely to detect when an air \ntraveler brings what TSA considers to be a “large” amount of currency \nthrough a transportation security screening checkpoint. \nh.  TSA Screeners regularly detect and temporarily seize “large” amounts of \ncurrency and/or carry-on luggage containing “large” amounts of currency \nfrom travelers at transportation security screening checkpoints in order to \n  28 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 30 of 52\nhold it until law enforcement can arrive and investigate the person traveling \nwith the currency.  \ni.  Upon information and belief, TSA Screeners frequently question air travelers \nabout why they have a “large” amount of currency and temporarily seize the \ntraveler’s currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or their person \nafter the transportation security screening has concluded.  \nj.  Upon information and belief, many of these seizures are based on TSA \nScreeners becoming aware that a traveler possesses a “large” amount of \ncurrency on their person or in their carry-on luggage during the transportation \nsecurity screening. \nk.  Upon information and belief, many of these seizures were based on travelers’ \npossessing what TSA Screeners estimated to be $10,000 or more. \nl.  Upon information and belief, the number of current and future class members \nis in the thousands.  \nm. Upon information and belief, the members of the proposed class are dispersed \nacross the United States, with many living far from the location where TSA \nseized their currency.  \n214.  Commonality under Rule 23(a)(2): This action presents questions of law and fact \ncommon to the putative class, resolution of which will not require individualized determinations \nof the circumstances of any particular plaintiff. Common questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  Does TSA have a policy or practice of having TSA Screeners seize travelers’ \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons—based on the \n  29 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 31 of 52\npresence of a “large” amount of currency on their person or in their carry-on \nluggage—after the transportation security screening has concluded?  \nb.  Are TSA Screeners authorized under statute to seize travelers’ currency, \ncarry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons—based on the presence of \na “large” amount of currency on their person or in their carry-on luggage—\nafter the transportation security screening has concluded?  \nc.  Does an air traveler’s possession of a “large” amount of currency, by itself, \nconstitute reasonable suspicion or probable cause?  \nd.  Does  TSA’s  policy  or  practice  of  seizing  travelers’  currency,  carry-on \nluggage, personal effects, and/or persons—based on the presence of a “large” \namount of currency on their person or in their carry-on luggage—after the \ntransportation  security  screening  has  concluded  and  without  reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause violate the Fourth Amendment?  \n215.  Typicality under Rule 23(a)(3): The Named Plaintiffs’ claims seeking declaratory \nand injunctive relief from the challenged TSA policy or practice are typical of the claims of the \nputative class. \na.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claim regarding TSA’s ultra vires and unconstitutional \npolicy or practice affects the other members of the class. \nb.  The Named Plaintiffs seek the same class relief for themselves and all other \nmembers of the class:  \ni.  a declaration that TSA Screeners do not have statutory authority to \nseize travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or \npersons (even temporarily)—based on the presence of currency on \n  30 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 32 of 52\ntheir person or in their carry-on luggage—after the transportation \nsecurity screening has concluded;  \nii.  an injunction prohibiting TSA Screeners from seizing travelers’ \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons (even \ntemporarily)—based on the presence of currency on their person or \nin  their  carry-on  luggage—after  the  transportation  security \nscreening has concluded; \niii.  a declaration that TSA’s policy or practice of seizing travelers’ \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons (even \ntemporarily—based on the presence of currency on their person or \nin  their  carry-on  luggage—after  the  transportation  security \nscreening  has  concluded  and  without  reasonable  suspicion  or \nprobable cause violates the Fourth Amendment; and  \niv.  an injunction prohibiting TSA from seizing travelers’ currency, \ncarry-on  luggage,  personal  effects,  and/or  persons  (even \ntemporarily)—based on the presence of currency on their person or \nin  their  carry-on  luggage—after  the  transportation  security \nscreening  has  concluded  and  without  reasonable  suspicion  or \nprobable cause.  \n216.  Adequacy of Representation under Rule 23(a)(4): The interests of the putative \nclass are fairly and adequately protected by the Named Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \n  31 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 33 of 52\na.  The Named Plaintiffs adequately represent the putative class because their \ninterests are aligned with the class’s and there are no conflicts of interest \nbetween the Named Plaintiffs and members of the putative class. \nb.  The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class members are ably represented pro \nbono by the Institute for Justice (“the Institute”). The Institute is a nonprofit, \npublic-interest  law  firm  that,  since  its  founding  in  1991,  has  litigated \nconstitutional issues nationwide. The Institute has a particular expertise in \nlitigating to protect property rights, including challenging civil-forfeiture \nprograms on constitutional grounds. In bringing this action, the Institute has \ndone extensive work to identify and investigate Plaintiffs’ claims. \n217.  This action also meets the requirements of, and is brought in accordance with, \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). TSA has acted, or refused to act, on grounds generally \napplicable to the class. Final declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate with respect to all of \nthe members of the class.  \n218.  Finally, this action is a Rule 23(b)(2) action where the putative class is only seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and thus is not required to satisfy the ascertainability requirement. \nSee Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 563 (3d Cir. 2015). However, even if the ascertainability \nrequirement applied, the members of the class are ascertainable because TSA records such as \nIncident Reports—which are prepared whenever law enforcement is notified about a traveler by \nTSA—should be able to identify travelers affected by the above-referenced TSA policy or practice.   \nDEA Class Action Allegations \n219.  Every year, DEA conducts tens of thousands of seizures of currency, including \nhundreds or even thousands of seizures of currency from travelers at U.S. airports. \n  32 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 34 of 52\n220.  From 2009 to 2013, DEA seized over $2 billion in currency. \n221.  DEA made more than 80,000 seizures of currency from FY 2007 to FY 2016, which \nis approximately 80% of all federal seizures of currency by DOJ agencies during that period. \n222.  From 2009 to 2013, DEA interdiction Task Force Groups, which operate at airports \nand other mass transportation facilities, seized $163 million in more than 4,000 individual currency \nseizures.  \n223.  DEA has operated an “airport interdiction task force” at one or more U.S. airports \nsince at least 1975. \n224.  DEA sometimes refers to its airport interdiction activities as “Operation Jetway.” \nOperation Jetway is also the name of DEA’s transportation interdiction training course. \n225.  The Operation Jetway airport interdiction program was established in 1993 with \nDEA as the lead agency, to provide standardized training and to collect and analyze arrest and \nseizure data from federal, state, and local drug interdiction units working at airports and other mass \ntransportation facilities. \n226.  In 2001, DEA collected data on Operation Jetway airport interdiction operations at \n77 U.S. airports. \n227.  Upon information and belief, DEA now operates an Operation Jetway airport \ninterdiction program at every major commercial airport in the United States. \n228.  A 2017 report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) \nreviewed a sample of 100 DEA currency seizures that “appeared to have occurred without a court-\nissued warrant and without the presence of narcotics” and “found that 85 of the 100 seizures \noccurred as a result of interdiction operations at transportation facilities, such as airports . . . .” \n  33 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 35 of 52\nOffice of Inspector General,  Review of the Department’s Oversight of Cash Seizure and Forfeiture \nActivities at iii (Mar. 2017) (“2017 OIG Report”), https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/e1702.pdf. \n229.  The 2017 OIG Report found that DEA could verify that “only 29 of the 85 \ninterdiction seizures, had (1) advanced or been related to ongoing investigations, (2) resulted in \nthe initiation of new investigations, (3) led to arrests, or (4) led to prosecutions.” 2017 OIG Report \nat iii. \n230.  Of  the  85  DEA  interdiction  seizures  reviewed  by  the  OIG  at  transportation \nfacilities, more than half of those currency seizures—46 of the 85—occurred at airports. See 2017 \nOIG Report at 22. \n231.  The 2017 OIG Report found that: “DEA agents and task force officers may also \ninitiate contacts that lead to seizures after receiving information from airport security screeners \nthat a large volume of currency was packaged within an individual’s carry-on or checked luggage.” \n2017 OIG Report at 23. \n232.  Upon information and belief, DEA agents participating in Operation Jetway \nairport interdiction operations at U.S. airports follow a DEA policy of seizing any currency \nfound that totals more than $5,000.  \n233.  Upon information and belief, DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency \nfrom travelers at U.S. airports based on the presence of a threshold amount of currency that DEA \nconsiders “suspicious,” regardless of whether there is probable cause. \n234.  Upon information and belief, DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency \nfrom travelers at U.S. airports based solely on whether they have at least $5,000, regardless of \nwhether there is probable cause. \n  34 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 36 of 52\n235.  This  policy  or  practice  violates  the  Fourth  Amendment’s  prohibition  against \nunreasonable searches and seizures.  \n236.  To  remedy  the  ongoing  constitutional  violations  caused  by  DEA’s  policy  or \npractice, Plaintiffs seek class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2). Plaintiffs seek a declaration that DEA’s policy or practice violates the Fourth \nAmendment. Plaintiffs accordingly seek an injunction prohibiting DEA from seizing luggage or \ncurrency  at  any  airport  in  the  United  States  in  the  absence  of  articulable  circumstances \ndemonstrating probable cause, which must be more than the mere presence of currency itself.  \n237.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication  of  this  controversy.  Individual  challenges  to  DEA’s  unconstitutional  policy  or \npractice will, by their nature, often become moot by the return of property, and in any event the \ncosts associated with bringing individual challenges are often prohibitive of a full and fair process \nfor vindicating individuals’ constitutional rights. A class action will allow for effective, class-wide \nrelief to remedy this ongoing and repeated violation of the Fourth Amendment.  \n238.  Plaintiffs propose the following class definition for the “DEA Class”: \n“All air travelers who, from January 15, 2014, until the present, either had or will have \ntheir currency seized by DEA at a U.S. airport because they were or are traveling with at least \n$5,000 in currency, pursuant to DEA’s policy or practice of making such seizures regardless of \nwhether there is probable cause for the seizure.”  \n239.  This action meets all the Rule 23(a) prerequisites for maintaining a class action.  \n240.  Numerosity under Rule 23(a)(1): The putative class is so numerous that joinder of \nall members is impracticable. \n  35 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 37 of 52\na.  Upon information and belief, DEA regularly seizes currency from travelers at \nU.S. airports.  \nb.  For  example,  from  2006-2016,  DEA  seized  more  than  $200  million  in \ncurrency from at least 5,200 people at the nation’s 15 busiest airports.  \nc.  Upon information and belief, many DEA seizures of currency at airports are \nbased on information from TSA Screeners that the travelers possessed a \n“large” amount of currency on their person or in their carry-on luggage. \nd.  Upon information and belief, many of these seizures were based on travelers \npossessing more than DEA’s $5,000 threshold for seizing currency from \ntravelers at airports regardless of whether there was probable cause for the \nseizure. \ne.  Upon information and belief, the number of current and future class members \nis in the thousands.  \nf.  Upon information and belief, the members of the proposed class are dispersed \nacross the United States, with many living far from the location where DEA \nseized their currency.  \n241.  Commonality under Rule 23(a)(2): This action presents questions of law and fact \ncommon to the putative class, resolution of which will not require individualized determinations \nof the circumstances of any particular plaintiff. Common questions include, but are not limited to: \na.  Does DEA frequently conduct seizures of currency from travelers at airports \nbased on information from TSA Screeners that the travelers possessed a \n“large” amount of currency on their person or in their carry-on luggage? \n  36 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 38 of 52\nb.  Does DEA have a policy or practice of seizing currency from travelers at \nairports because the currency exceeds a particular threshold amount (such as \n$5,000) that DEA deems “suspicious,” regardless of whether there is probable \ncause for the seizure?  \nc.  Does an air traveler’s possession of $5,000 or more in currency, by itself, \nconstitute reasonable suspicion or probable cause?  \nd.  Does DEA’s policy or practice violate the Fourth Amendment?  \n242.  Typicality under Rule 23(a)(3): The Named Plaintiffs’ claims seeking declaratory \nand injunctive relief are typical of the claims of the putative class. \na.  The Named Plaintiffs’ claim regarding DEA’s unconstitutional policy or \npractice affects the other members of the class. \nb.  The Named Plaintiffs seek the same class relief for themselves and other \nmembers of the class:  \ni.  a declaration that DEA’s airport currency seizure policy or practice \nviolates the Fourth Amendment; and  \nii.  an injunction prohibiting DEA from seizing currency from travelers \nat  airports  because  it  exceeds  a  particular  currency  threshold, \nregardless of whether there is probable cause for the seizure.  \n243.  Adequacy of Representation under Rule 23(a)(4): The interests of the putative \nclass are fairly and adequately protected by the Named Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \na.  The Named Plaintiffs adequately represent the putative class because their \ninterests are aligned with the class’s and there are no conflicts of interest \nbetween the Named Plaintiffs and members of the putative class. \n  37 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 39 of 52\nb.  The Named Plaintiffs and the putative class members are ably represented pro \nbono by the Institute for Justice (“the Institute”). The Institute is a nonprofit, \npublic-interest  law  firm  that,  since  its  founding  in  1991,  has  litigated \nconstitutional issues nationwide. The Institute has a particular expertise in \nlitigating to protect property rights, including challenging civil-forfeiture \nprograms on constitutional grounds. In bringing this action, the Institute has \ndone extensive work to identify and investigate Plaintiffs’ claims. \n244.  This action also meets the requirements of, and is brought in accordance with, \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). DEA has acted, or refused to act, on grounds generally \napplicable to the class. Final declaratory and injunctive relief is appropriate with respect to all of \nthe members of the class.  \n245.  Finally, this action is a Rule 23(b)(2) action where the putative class is only seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and thus is not required to satisfy the ascertainability requirement. \nSee Shelton v. Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554, 563 (3d Cir. 2015). However, even if the ascertainability \nrequirement applied, the members of the class are ascertainable because DEA maintains records \nof its currency seizures and forfeitures. \nClass Claims \nCount I \nClass Claim for Ultra Vires Agency Action Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 \n(Against TSA, TSA Administrator Pekoske in his official capacity,  \nand the United States of America) \n \n246.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth \nin preceding paragraphs 1-245.  \n  38 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 40 of 52\n247.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against TSA, TSA Administrator Pekoske in his official \ncapacity, and the United States of America under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n701-706.  \n248.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on behalf of themselves and the TSA Class under Federal \nRule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(2)  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  TSA,  TSA \nAdministrator Pekoske in his official capacity, and the United States of America.  \n249.  TSA’s statutory authority to conduct screenings of air travelers is limited  to \nconducting administrative searches to ensure transportation security; by law, these transportation \nsecurity screenings are not for general law-enforcement purposes.  \n250.  TSA’s transportation security screenings may not go beyond their limited purpose \nof searching for threats to transportation security.  \n251.  No statute or regulation authorizes TSA Screeners to engage in searches, seizures, \nor investigations for general law-enforcement purposes. \n252.  No statute or regulation authorizes TSA Screeners to seize property that does not \nthreaten transportation security. \n253.  No statute or regulation authorizes TSA Screeners to seize potential contraband or \npotential evidence of a crime unrelated to transportation security.  \n254.  No statute or regulation authorizes TSA Screeners to seize or question travelers \nafter the transportation security screening has concluded.  \n255.  No statute or regulation authorizes TSA Screeners to seize or question travelers to \ninvestigate potential crimes that do not threaten transportation security.  \n256.  TSA’s  challenged  policy  or  practice—having  TSA  Screeners  seize  travelers’ \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or their person, based on the presence of currency \n  39 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 41 of 52\non their person or in their carry-on luggage,  after the transportation security screening has \nconcluded—exceeds TSA’s statutory authority to conduct administrative searches for threats to \ntransportation security.  \n257.  TSA’s challenged policy or practice is ultra vires because it is “in excess of \nstatutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \n258.  TSA’s ultra vires policy or practice affects every member of the TSA Class—i.e., \nevery instance in which, after concluding the transportation security screening, TSA Screeners \nseize a traveler’s currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or their person based on the \npresence of currency on their person or in their carry-on luggage. \n259.  As a direct and proximate result of TSA’s ultra vires policy or practice, the Named \nPlaintiffs and other members of the TSA Class have suffered or will suffer the same injury. \n260.  Therefore, class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to remedy \nTSA’s unlawful policy or practice, which will otherwise continue.   \nCount II \nClass Claim for Unconstitutional Action Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706  \nand the Fourth Amendment \n(Against TSA, TSA Administrator Pekoske in his official capacity,  \nand the United States of America) \n \n261.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth \nin preceding paragraphs 1-245. \n262.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against TSA, TSA Administrator Pekoske in his official \ncapacity, and the United States of America under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n701-706 and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n263.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on behalf of themselves and the TSA Class under Federal \nRule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(2)  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  TSA,  TSA \n  40 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 42 of 52\nAdministrator Pekoske in his official capacity, and the United States of America for violation of \ntheir Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n264.  Even when the government has lawfully initiated a search or seizure, it may not \nextend  that  search  or  seizure  to  pursue  broader  or  different  investigatory  purposes  absent \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause. \n265.  TSA airport transportation security screenings are administrative searches that may \nnot be conducted for general law-enforcement purposes; they may not go beyond their limited \npurpose of searching for threats to transportation security.  \n266.  Once TSA completes the administrative search of an air traveler and their carry-on \nluggage and does not detect any threats to transportation security, TSA may not continue to search \nor seize the air traveler, their carry-on luggage, or their currency without reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause.  \n267.  It is legal to travel with any amount of currency, and there are no legal requirements \nto report to the government that one is traveling domestically with any amount of currency. \n268.  An air traveler’s possession of any amount of currency, by itself, is not suspicious \nor indicative of criminal activity; it does not give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  \n269.  After  TSA  determines,  in  the  scope  of  a  lawful  administrative  search  at  a \ntransportation security screening checkpoint, that nothing on a traveler’s person or in a traveler’s \ncarry-on luggage presents a threat to transportation security, the Fourth Amendment prohibits TSA \nfrom (1) extending that administrative search for other purposes or (2) seizing the traveler’s \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or person without reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause. \n  41 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 43 of 52\n270.  Seizing a traveler’s currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or person, \neven briefly or temporarily, is a meaningful interference with that traveler’s possessory interest in \ntheir property and freedom of movement. \n271.  Even if travelers are told they are free to leave the transportation security screening \ncheckpoint without their carry-on luggage or their currency, they are effectively seized by the \ninterference with their property, particularly if it includes valuable or important property such as \ncurrency or other personal effects typically packed in carry-on luggage.  \n272.  Plaintiffs challenge TSA’s policy or practice of seizing travelers’ currency, carry-\non luggage, personal effects, and/or persons—based on the presence of currency on their person \nor in their carry-on luggage—after the transportation security screening has concluded, and \nwithout reasonable suspicion or probable cause. \n273.  TSA’s seizure of currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons \npursuant to this policy or practice violates the Fourth Amendment, even if the seizure is only \ntemporary. \n274.  For example, TSA’s temporary seizure of Rebecca’s carry-on luggage and personal \neffects after the transportation security screening concluded violated the Fourth Amendment \nbecause it was beyond the scope of TSA’s administrative search for threats to transportation \nsecurity and was not based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause. This seizure was conducted \npursuant to TSA’s challenged policy or practice. \n275.  For example, TSA’s temporary seizure of Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash after the \ntransportation security screening concluded violated the Fourth Amendment because it was beyond \nthe scope of TSA’s administrative search for threats to transportation security and was not based \n  42 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 44 of 52\non reasonable suspicion or probable  cause. This seizure was conducted pursuant to TSA’s \nchallenged policy or practice. \n276.  For example, TSA’s temporary seizure of Rebecca’s person after the transportation \nsecurity screening concluded violated the Fourth Amendment because it was beyond the scope of \nTSA’s administrative search for threats to transportation security and was not based on reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause. This seizure was conducted pursuant to TSA’s challenged policy or \npractice. \n277.  TSA’s  unconstitutional  policy  or  practice  affects  every  member  of  the  TSA \nClass— i.e., every instance in which TSA seizes a traveler’s currency, carry-on luggage, personal \neffects, and/or person—based on the presence of currency on their person or in their carry-on \nluggage—after  the  transportation  security  screening  has  concluded,  and  without  reasonable \nsuspicion or probable cause. \n278.  As a direct and proximate result of TSA’s unconstitutional policy or practice, the \nNamed Plaintiffs and other members of the TSA Class have suffered or will suffer the same injury, \nincluding the deprivation of their constitutional rights and the interference with their property \nrights and freedom of movement.  \n279.  Therefore, class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to remedy \nTSA’s unconstitutional policy or practice, which will otherwise continue. \nCount III \nClass Claim for Unconstitutional Action Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706  \nand the Fourth Amendment \n(Against DEA, DEA Acting Administrator Dhillon in his official capacity,  \nand the United States of America) \n \n280.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth \nin preceding paragraphs 1-245. \n  43 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 45 of 52\n281.  Plaintiffs bring this claim against DEA, DEA Acting Administrator Dhillon in his \nofficial capacity, and the United States of America under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701-706 and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n282.  Plaintiffs bring this claim on behalf of themselves and the DEA Class under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) for declaratory and injunctive relief against DEA, DEA Acting \nAdministrator Dhillon in his official capacity, and the United States of America for violation of \ntheir Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  \n283.  It is legal to travel with any amount of currency, and there are no legal requirements \nto report to the government that one is traveling domestically with any amount of currency. \n284.  An air traveler’s possession of any amount of currency, by itself, is not suspicious \nor indicative of criminal activity; it does not give rise to reasonable suspicion or probable cause.  \n285.  DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency from travelers at U.S. airports \nwithout probable cause based solely on the presence of the currency itself.  \n286.  DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency from travelers at U.S. airports \nbased on the presence of a threshold amount of currency that DEA considers “suspicious,” \nregardless of whether there is probable cause for the seizure. \n287.  DEA follows a policy or practice of seizing currency from travelers at U.S. airports \nbased solely on whether they have at least $5,000 in currency, regardless of whether there is \nprobable cause for the seizure. \n288.  DEA’s policy or practice violates the Fourth Amendment right to be free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures.  \n289.  Pursuant  to  this  unconstitutional  policy  or  practice,  DEA  seized  Terry’s  and \nRebecca’s cash without probable cause.  \n  44 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 46 of 52\n290.  As a direct and proximate result of DEA’s policy or practice, the Named Plaintiffs \nand other members of the DEA Class have suffered or will suffer the same injury, including the \ndeprivation of their constitutional rights and the deprivation and/or loss of their currency.  \n291.  DEA’s unconstitutional policy or practice affects every member of the DEA \nClass—i.e., every instance in which DEA seizes currency from a traveler at a U.S. airport because \nthey were or are traveling with at least $5,000 in currency, regardless of whether there is probable \ncause for the seizure. \n292.  Therefore, class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to remedy \nDEA’s unlawful policy or practice, which will otherwise continue.   \nIndividual Claims \n \nCount IV \nIndividual Claim Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g)  \nand 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for Return of Plaintiffs’ Property Currently Held \nin Violation of the Fourth Amendment \n(Against DEA, DEA Acting Administrator Dhillon in his official capacity,  \nand the United States of America)  \n \n293.  The  Named  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation set forth in preceding paragraphs 1-245. \n294.  The Named Plaintiffs bring this claim for the return of their seized cash (or an \nequivalent amount in U.S. currency) against DEA, DEA Acting Administrator Dhillon in his \nofficial capacity, and the United States of America under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure \n41(g), this Court’s general equity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and the Fourth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.  \n295.  Terry and Rebecca are both aggrieved, injured, and harmed by the unlawful and \nunconstitutional seizure of their property—the seized cash—and by the continued deprivation of \nthat property. \n  45 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 47 of 52\n296.  DEA’s seizure and continued retention of Terry’s and Rebecca’s cash violated and \ncontinues to violate the Fourth Amendment because the warrantless seizure and retention were and \nremain without probable cause to believe that Terry or Rebecca engaged in any criminal activity, \nor that the cash was connected to any criminal activity, and no exception to the warrant requirement \napplied or applies to the initial seizure or the retention of the seized cash.  \n297.  Terry  and  Rebecca  are  entitled  to  the  immediate  return  of  their  cash  (or  an \nequivalent amount in U.S. currency) in the amount of $82,373, plus interest.  \nCount V \nIndividual Bivens Claim for Compensatory Damages \nUnder the Fourth Amendment \n(Against DEA Agent Steve, Last Name Unknown) \n \n298.  The  Named  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation set forth in preceding paragraphs 1-245. \n299.  The  Named  Plaintiffs  bring  this  claim  for  compensatory  damages  against \nDefendant DEA Agent Steve, last name unknown, in his individual capacity, under Bivens v. Six \nUnknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and the Fourth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution. \n300.  DEA Agent Steve’s last name and identity are currently unknown to Terry and \nRebecca but will be revealed in the course of this litigation.  \n301.  DEA  Agent  Steve  violated  Terry’s  and  Rebecca’s  clearly  established  Fourth \nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by seizing their cash without \na warrant or probable cause.  \n302.  As a direct and proximate result of DEA Agent Steve’s unconstitutional actions, \nTerry and Rebecca have suffered injuries, as set forth in the preceding paragraphs—particularly \n  46 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 48 of 52\nthe section entitled “Individual Injuries to the Named Plaintiffs”—and as may further be developed \nin discovery or at trial.  \n303.  An award of compensatory damages plus interest—in amounts to be determined in \ndiscovery or at trial—is necessary to remedy the injuries caused by DEA Agent Steve’s violation \nof Terry’s and Rebecca’s Fourth Amendment rights. \nRequest for Relief \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Certify the TSA Class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) consisting \nof: “All air travelers who, from January 15, 2014, until the present, either have had or will have \ntheir currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or person seized by TSA Screeners at \ntransportation security screening checkpoints—based on the presence of a ‘large’ amount of \ncurrency on their person or in their carry-on luggage—after the transportation security screening \nhas concluded.”   \nB.

Issue class-wide declaratory relief against Defendants TSA, TSA Administrator \nPekoske in his official capacity, and the United States of America declaring unconstitutional under \nthe Fourth Amendment TSA’s policy or practice of seizing (even temporarily) air travelers’ \ncurrency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons—based on the presence of currency \non their person or in their carry-on luggage—after the transportation security screening has \nconcluded and without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. \nF.  Issue class-wide injunctive relief against Defendants TSA, TSA Administrator \nPekoske in his official capacity, and the United States of America enjoining TSA from seizing \n(even temporarily) air travelers’ currency, carry-on luggage, personal effects, and/or persons—\nbased  on  the  presence  of  currency  on  their  person  or  in  their  carry-on  luggage—after  the \ntransportation security screening has concluded and without reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause. \nG.  Issue  class-wide  declaratory  relief  against  Defendants  DEA,  DEA  Acting \nAdministrator  Dhillon  in  his  official  capacity,  and  the  United  States  of  America  declaring \nunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment DEA’s policy or practice of seizing air travelers’ \n  48 \n\nCase 2:20-cv-00064-LPL   Document 1   Filed 01/15/20   Page 50 of 52\ncurrency at U.S. airports because they are traveling with currency in excess of $5,000 (or any other \nthreshold amount of currency), regardless of whether there is probable cause for the seizure.  \nH.  Issue  class-wide  injunctive  relief  against  Defendants  DEA,  DEA  Acting \nAdministrator Dhillon in his official capacity, and the United States of America enjoining DEA \nfrom seizing air travelers’ currency at U.S. airports because they are traveling with currency in \nexcess of $5,000 (or any other threshold amount of currency), regardless of whether there is \nprobable cause for the seizure.  \nI.
