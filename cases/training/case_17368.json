    "summary": "<p>On January 15, 2020, six individual plaintiffs, along with the Tahirih Justice Center and Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Trump Administration&rsquo;s new policy of removing asylum seekers to Guatemala pursuant to an &ldquo;asylum cooperative agreement&rdquo; (ACA). The individual plaintiffs wereare noncitizens who came to the U.S. seeking asylum and were subsequently removed to Guatemala pursuant to the new policy. Represented by the National Immigrant Justice Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Human Rights First, the plaintiffs allegedsued the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security violatedunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), and the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs alleged that the government&rsquo;s new policy violated the APA, INA, FARRA, and the Suspension Clause. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order paroling the individual plaintiffs into the U.S. and vacating their removal orders, as well as attorneys fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.</p>\r\n<p>The U.S. signed ACAs with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in the summer of 2019, and on November 19, 2019, the government issued an Interim Final Rule establishing procedures for the removal of asylum seekers from the U.S. to those three countries. On November 20, the government issued written guidance implementing its ACA with Guatemala and began removing non-Guatemalan asylum seekers there. The plaintiffs challenged the Rule, as well as the agency guidance implementing the Guatemala ACA, arguing that they unlawfully deniedy individuals the right to apply for asylum in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs brought the following claims: 1) the Rule violated the INA&rsquo;s safe third country provision, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1158(a)(2)(A), which requires an individualized likelihood-of-persecution determination in every case prior to removal to a third country; and which it also requires that any receiving nation be equipped to provide asylum seekers access to full and fair asylum procedures;. 2) the Rule violated the withholding of removal statute, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1231(b)(3), and FARRA, which bar the removal of individuals to countries where they would face torture or persecution on account of a protected ground.; 3) the Rule violated the expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1225(b), by denying access to a credible fear interview, and by depriving asylum seekers of numerous procedural safeguards created by Congress;. 4) the Rule violated the APA because it wasis arbitrary and capricious and it was issued without the use of notice-and-comment procedures;. 5) the Rule violated the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it subjecteds individuals to expedited removal to third countries without the constitutionally required level of federal court review of an expedited removal order.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs submitted an administrative record, followed by a motion for summary judgment and a motion for permanent injunction on February 28, 2020. Several amicus briefs were filed, including one from seventeen states and the District of Columbia which argued the Rule harmed States&rsquo; interests in economic contribution, enforcing their own laws, and family unity. The government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 25, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>President Trump transitioned out of office and was replaced by President Biden on January 20, 2021. The Biden administration suspended and initiated processes to terminate the Trump-era agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The parties submitted a joint motion to hold the case in abeyance on February 22, 2021.</p>\r\n<p>The court issued an order to stay the case on March 15, 2021 based on the parties&rsquo; representations that the government would review the policies at issue in the case and engage in ongoing discussion with the plaintiffs without further litigation. The parties have continued to file joint status reports.The plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment is due by February 28, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The case is technically ongoing. As of December 20, 2023, this case is stayed.&nbsp;</p>",

The United States has a longstanding commitment to protect people fleeing \npersecution.  Congress has guaranteed that noncitizens who arrive or are physically present in the \nUnited States may apply for asylum, subject to three narrow exceptions.  One of those exceptions \nis that noncitizens may be denied the opportunity to apply for asylum in the United States and \ninstead be removed to seek protection elsewhere pursuant to a \"safe third country\" agreement. \nThat exception only applies if strict statutory requirements are met, including that the asylum \nseeker would have a full and fair opportunity to seek asylum in the \"safe third country\" and \nwould not face persecution or torture there. \n2.  For years, our only safe third country agreement was with Canada, a safe nation \nwith a robust asylum system.  Then, last summer, the United States signed three new \"asylum \ncooperative agreements\" (\"ACAs\") with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador-extremely \ndangerous, refugee-producing countries with asylum systems that are skeletal at best. \n3.  On November 19, 2019, the government issued an Interim Final Rule titled \n\"Implementing Bilateral and Multilateral Asylum Cooperative Agreements Under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act\" (the \"Rule\").  The Rule establishes procedures for the removal \nof asylum seekers to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, and to any other countries with \nwhich the United States signs future ACAs.  The Rule's aim is to permit the \"distribution of \nhundreds of thousands of asylum claims\" to other countries.  84 Fed. Reg. at 63,994. \n4.  On November 20, the government issued written guidance implementing its ACA \nwith Guatemala and began removing non-Guatemalan asylum seekers there. \n5.  This lawsuit challenges the Rule, as well as agency guidance implementing the \nGuatemala ACA (the \"USCIS Guidance\"), which unlawfully slam our nation's doors on people \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 7 of 54\nfleeing horrific violence and other forms of persecution by denying them the right to apply for \nasylum in the United States and shipping them to dangerous countries where there is virtually no \nchance they will find refuge.  Indeed, the Rule has already put the Individual Plaintiffs in this \ncase, and others like them, in harm's way by removing them to Guatemala and forcing them to \ndecide between remaining there, where they fear for their lives, and returning to the countries \nfrom which they fled persecution. \n6.  The Rule and the USCIS Guidance allow for the removal of vulnerable asylum \nseekers to a different dangerous country from that which they fled, even one where they have \nnever set foot.  For example, under the Rule and Guatemala ACA, the United States could deport \nan Afghan or Mexican asylum seeker to Guatemala.  Moreover, the Rule and the USCIS \nGuidance provide for their removal without adequate measures to ensure that they will be safe \nand have access to asylum or other protection from persecution. \n7.  The nations that have signed ACAs so far-Guatemala, El Salvador, and \nHonduras-are impoverished, unstable, and among the most dangerous places in the world. \nKnown collectively as Central America's Northern Triangle, they have extremely high murder \nrates, rampant gender-based violence, and virtually no ability to receive asylum seekers.  Indeed, \nall three countries generate large numbers of refugees due to epidemic levels of violence and \ninstability typically seen in war zones.  In 2017 and 2018, the Northern Triangle countries were \nthree of the top four countries of origin for individuals granted asylum in the United States. \n8.  The government's willingness to sign ACAs with these countries illustrates that \nits true goal is not to promote burden sharing while ensuring the safety of refugees.  Rather, the \nRule and ACAs simply tum away asylum seekers and pass the buck to other countries, regardless \n2 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 8 of 54\nof what happens to the individuals.  As one asylum officer said, \"This agreement [with \nGuatemala] feels like a pretext to get rid of as many asylum claims as possible.\" 1 \n9.  Because of the Rule, vulnerable asylum seekers are shut out of the United States \nand left to seek protection in countries with barely functioning asylum systems that cannot \nadequately protect them.  And if the receiving country rejects an individual's claim, that \nindividual likely cannot get another chance at asylum in the United States.  The result is a deadly \ngame of musical chairs that leaves many desperate asylum seekers without a safe haven, in \nviolation ofU.S. and international law. \n10.  The only escape valve from this trap is for an asylum seeker to demonstrate that \nthey are more likely than not to face persecution or torture in every one of the possible receiving \ncountries that the government designates.  Yet under the Rule, an asylum seeker will only get the \nopportunity to demonstrate this likelihood of harm if they volunteer, without ever being asked, \nthat they are afraid of being sent to one or more of those countries.  And even if an asylum \nseeker does affirmatively express such a fear, they must then demonstrate their likelihood of \npersecution or torture during a rushed interview almost immediately after a harrowing journey to \nthe United States; without time to prepare, research, or compile documentation; without talking \nto a lawyer or being represented by one during the interview; and without review of the decision \nby an immigration judge. \n11.  Moreover, although called a \"threshold screening interview,\" 84 Fed. Reg. at \n64,008, the Rule applies the more-likely-than-not standard, which is higher than even the \nultimate burden to win asylum and is otherwise reserved for decisions on claims for \n1 Hamed Aleaziz, Asylum Officers Were Told ofK  illings and Violence in Guatemala. They Were \nOrdered to Send People There Anyway., BuzzFeed News (Nov. 21, 2019), \nhttps:/ /tinyurl.com/Buzzfeed-GuatemalaGuidance. \n3 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 9 of 54\n\"withholding of removal\"-a more limited form of protection against persecution-made after a \nfull evidentiary removal hearing before an immigration judge with the rights to counsel, to \npresent and cross-examine witnesses, and to both administrative and judicial review.  The Rule's \nbare bones procedures, by contrast, are woefully inadequate to ensure that those who risk \npersecution, torture, or death in receiving countries will not be erroneously removed to danger \nthere. \n12.  The Rule and USCIS Guidance cast aside our asylum laws, which reflect \nCongress's carefully considered balance between effectuating our broad, historic commitment to \nprotecting refugees fleeing persecution and torture-a commitment with origins in the 1951 \nUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees-and ensuring fairness and \nefficiency in the asylum process.  First, it violates the Immigration and Nationality Act's \n(\"INA\") safe third country provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), which requires an individualized \nlikelihood-of-persecution determination in every case prior to removal to a third country. \nSecond, the Rule violates the withholding of removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which bar the removal of individuals to \ncountries where their lives or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground or \nwhere they would be tortured, and their implementing regulations.  And third, the Rule violates \nthe expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), by denying access to a credible fear interview, \nand by depriving asylum seekers of numerous procedural safeguards that Congress created as \nprerequisites to the imposition of an expedited removal order in their cases. \n13.  Additionally, the Rule and USCIS Guidance violate§ 1158(a)(2)(A)'s \nrequirement that any receiving nation must be equipped to provide asylum seekers \"access to full \nand fair procedures for determining [their] claim[s] to asylum.\"  The Rule prohibits case-by-case \n4 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 10 of 54\nconsideration of this requirement and instead calls for a categorical designation that a country \nmeets this standard with respect to all asylum seekers before ACA removals to that country \nbegin.  But ACA removals to Guatemala are well underway and are set to begin to Honduras, \nand no such designations for those countries have been issued publicly.  In the absence of any \nlawful categorical designation, the lack of individualized consideration of this statutory \nrequirement violates the statute.  And to the extent that some secret, categorical designations \nhave been made, they have failed to account for the dire security situations and failing asylum \nsystems in the receiving countries, as required by statute.  At the very least, any designation that \nfails to adequately consider these highly relevant factors would be arbitrary and capricious in \nviolation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").  With the government refusing to even \naddress these essential statutory requirements, there are no limits on where it might send asylum \nseekers.  Indeed, the government is already using the Rule to remove gay men-like the lead \nPlaintiff in this case-to Guatemala, a country that persecutes LGBT persons, as the U.S. State \nDepartment has recognized. \n14.  The Rule is also arbitrary and capricious in violation ofthe APA because it \ninexplicably fails to include even the most basic safeguards to ensure that individuals are not \nreturned to countries where they face persecution, and departs without acknowledgment or \nexplanation from the procedures otherwise used by the government to protect against removal to \npersecution or torture. \n15.  In addition, the agencies issued the Rule without prior notice and opportunity for \npublic comment, and effective immediately, in violation ofthe APA's procedural requirements. \n5 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 11 of 54\n16.  Finally, the Rule subjects individuals to expedited removal to third countries \nwithout the constitutionally required level of federal court review of an expedited removal order, \nand so violates the Suspension Clause. \n17.  In short, the Rule recklessly subverts our legal framework for accepting refugees \ninto a machinery for casting them off into circumstances as perilous as those they fled. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This case arises under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq.; the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, \net seq., and its implementing regulations; the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, Pub. L. No. 10-277, div. G, Title XXII,§ 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified \nas Note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231); and the United States Constitution.  This Court has subject matter \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). \n19.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because Defendants are agencies of \nthe United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity and reside in \nthis District, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in \nthis District.  Venue is further appropriate under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). \nPARTIES \n20.  The Individual Plaintiffs are noncitizens who came to the United States to seek \nasylum and were unlawfully removed to Guatemala pursuant to the Rule, the USCIS Guidance, \nand the Guatemala A CA. 2  The Organizational Plaintiffs are organizations that serve asylum \nseekers. \n21.  PlaintiffU.T. is a gay man from El Salvador.  When U.T. was a young child, a \nmale relative sexually abused him.  As he grew up, he struggled to come to terms with his sexual \n2 The Individual Plaintiffs are seeking leave to proceed under their initials in this case, and have \nfiled a separate motion under seal as to that issue, with declarations setting forth the details \n6 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 12 of 54\norientation due to his family's and his country's homophobic views.  U.T. moved within El \nSalvador looking for a place where he could be open about his sexual orientation, but he never \nfound a place where he was safe.  He fled El Salvador after an MS-13 gang member solicited \nhim for sex and threatened him.  When U. T. finally came out to his parents, they disowned him; \nhis mother said she would rather be dead than have a gay son.  Now, U.T. fears that he will be \nattacked or killed for his sexual orientation if he tries to live openly as a gay man in El Salvador. \n22.  U.T. travelled through Guatemala en route to the United States and, while there, \nwas subjected to homophobic slurs on the street.  When he entered the United States, border \nofficials told him that because of the Guatemala ACA, he would be removed to Guatemala. \nWhen U.T. told the officer that he did not want to go to Guatemala because it is not safe for gay \npeople there, the officer said he would have an interview to explain.  In that interview, which \nlasted less than an hour, U.T. tried to explain his fear of removal to Guatemala.  Not long after \nthis interview, U.T. was removed to Guatemala, where he was given 72 hours to decide whether \nto pursue asylum in Guatemala.  U.T. decided to apply for asylum in Guatemala, but because that \ncountry is also unsafe for gay people, Guatemalan officials advised him to go to Mexico, where \nthey said he could apply for asylum.  U.T. is in Mexico for now, but he remains uncertain how or \nwhere to find safety. \n23.  PlaintiffE.R. fled his native Honduras after members of the MS-13 gang \nrepeatedly attacked him and threatened his life.  Gang members came to E.R. 's workplace and \ntold him that he could either sell drugs for the gang, become the gang's mechanic, or pay an \nextortion payment.  When he explained that he was not the owner of the business and he had no \nprovided here.  They are referred to in this complaint using their initials, but their true names \nhave been provided in conjunction with the motion to proceed under pseudonym. \n7 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 13 of 54\nability to decide to pay, the gang members attacked him.  The first time, they hit him over the \nhead with a bat.  On another occasion, they stabbed him multiple times with a broken bottle. \nEach of these incidents caused significant injury and required hospitalization.  E.R. knew that he \ncould not go to the local police to report these problems because the police in his community \nwork with the gang, and reporting them would only make things worse. \n24.  E.R. fled Honduras and was detained when he entered the United States.  Border \nofficials told him that because of the Guatemala ACA, he would be removed to Guatemala. \nE.R., however, said that he was afraid of going to Guatemala.  E.R. knew that the MS-13 could \nlocate him there.  He also insisted that he had evidence to support his claim for asylum, but \nofficials told him that he did not need to present that evidence and instead asked him only about \nGuatemala.  E.R. was removed to Guatemala in December 2019, about 10 days after he entered. \nOnce in Guatemala, E.R. was given 72 hours to decide whether to apply for asylum in \nGuatemala.  E.R. did not believe that he would be safe in Guatemala because the MS-13 can \nreach him there.  He also felt pressure to leave the shelter where he stayed temporarily and did \nnot have any support in Guatemala to help protect him.  He is now in hiding in Honduras \ntemporarily, but believes he is not safe there either.  E.R. remains uncertain how or where to find \nsafety. \n25.  PlaintiffH.R. is a Salvadoran woman who was forced to flee her country after the \nMS-13 gang killed two ofher siblings and began threatening her teenage daughter.  H.R. and her \nfamily reported her siblings' murders to the police.  After the police failed to investigate the \nmurders, H.R. and her family began seeking answers on their own.  The gang threatened H.R. \nand her family with death and told them to stop investigating.  H.R. and her children attempted to \nrelocate within El Salvador, but they did not feel safe.  H.R. fled El Salvador with her two \n8 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 14 of 54\nchildren after the MS-13 attempted to force her teenage daughter into a relationship with a gang \nmember. \n26.  H.R. and her children traveled through Guatemala, where they stood out as \nmigrants.  Police demanded their documents, and extorted money from them upon learning that \nthey were migrants.  Feeling unsafe in Guatemala, they continued on to Mexico.  H.R. became \nseparated from her teenage daughter in Mexico, and her daughter is now in a migrant shelter for \nchildren in the United States.  H.R. and her son J.R. crossed the border into the United States on \nDecember 24,2019.  An asylum officer interviewed H.R. and told her that because of the ACA, \nshe would be removed to Guatemala or El Salvador.  H.R. explained her fear of return to El \nSalvador and Guatemala and attempted to present evidence to the officer, but she and her son \nwere removed to Guatemala on January 6, 2020.  After being removed to Guatemala, H.R. was \ngiven 72 hours to decide whether to apply for asylum in Guatemala.  H.R. had no resources or \nability to protect herself and her child in Guatemala, and she was anxious to get documents from \nEl Salvador to secure her daughter's release from detention in the United States.  So, she \nreturned to El Salvador temporarily, where she fears for her and her son's lives.  H.R. remains \nuncertain how or where she and her child can find safety. \n27.  Plaintiff J.R. is the minor son ofPlaintiffH.R.  He traveled to the United States \nwith H.R., intending to seek asylum with her, and he was removed to Guatemala with H.R. \n28.  PlaintiffM.H. is a woman from Honduras who fled to the United States with her \nminor daughter, H.D.  Both M.H. 's common-law husband and her sister-in-law worked in the \ntransportation business in Honduras and were forced to pay extortions to local gangs in order to \nwork.  They were murdered one year apart from one another.  In May 2019, M.H. was threatened \nby a man who owned and operated taxis in the same city where her husband and sister-in-law \n9 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 15 of 54\nworked and who had detailed information about her, her daughter, and the murders of her \nhusband and sister-in-law.  In November 2019, when M.H. paid a briefvisit to Guatemala, she \nreceived an alarming text message from an unknown person letting her know that the person \nknew she was away from her home but was nevertheless close by.  Fearing for her and her \ndaughter's safety, M.H. and H.D. fled to the United States. \n29.  M.H. and her daughter entered the United States in December 2019, presented \nthemselves to immigration officials, and requested asylum.  Officials told M.H. that because of a \nnew policy, she and her daughter would be removed to Guatemala.  M.H. explained that she had \nbeen threatened while in Guatemala, and she asked for an opportunity to obtain a lawyer and \npresent evidence that she had brought with her.  Officials refused to allow her time to obtain a \nlawyer, denied her an opportunity to present evidence in connection with her claims, and \nremoved her to Guatemala.  There, M.R. learned that she had 72 hours to decide whether to stay \nin Guatemala and apply for asylum or return to Honduras.  Feeling that she had no means to \nremain safe or support herself in Guatemala, M.H. and her daughter returned temporarily to \nHonduras.  M.H. remains uncertain how or where she and her daughter can find safety. \n30.  PlaintiffH.D. is the minor child ofPlaintiffM.H.  She traveled to the United \nStates with her mother, intending to seek asylum with her.  Both were removed from the United \nStates to Guatemala under the ACA. \n31.

Federal Law Provides Several Forms of Protection for Individuals Fleeing \nPersecution and Torture. \n45.  Federal law provides three primary forms of protection for individuals fleeing \npersecution and torture: asylum under 8 U.S.C. § 1158; withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3); and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), see 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1208.16-18. \nAsylum \n46.  Asylum affords protection to individuals who have a \"well-founded fear of \npersecution\" on account of one or more of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, \npolitical opinion, or membership in a particular social group.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).  A \n\"well-founded fear of persecution\" is defined as a ten percent chance of persecution.  INS v. \nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 430, 440 (1987).  Past persecution gives rise to a presumption \nof a well-founded fear and thus of asylum eligibility. \n47.  Subject to several narrow exceptions, including the safe third country exception at \nissue here, \"[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the \n13 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 19 of 54\nUnited States ... , irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with \nthis section or, where applicable, [8 U.S.C. §] 1225(b).\"  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(l). \n48.  There are three principal ways to seek asylum.  First, a noncitizen not in removal \nproceedings may file an \"affirmative\" application to USCIS, and complete an interview with an \nasylum officer.  8 C.F.R. §§ 208.2(a), 208.9.  Second, a noncitizen in regular removal \nproceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, may submit a \"defensive\" asylum application to the immigration \njudge as a form of relief from removal, 8 C.F.R. § 208.2(b).  Third, a noncitizen who has been \nplaced in \"expedited removal\"-a truncated removal process that may be applied to certain \nnoncitizens who arrive at the border or enter without inspection, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)-may \nalso raise an asylum claim.  The noncitizen may do so by expressing fear of removal and \nundergoing a \"credible fear\" interview with an asylum officer to screen for asylum eligibility. \nBy statute, the asylum officer must apply a low threshold screening standard, not the ultimate \nasylum standard.  Any noncitizen who satisfies that low bar must be referred to regular removal \nproceedings, where they can apply for asylum. \nWithholding of Removal and Protection Under the Convention Against Torture \n49.  Like asylum, withholding of removal protects individuals facing persecution on \naccount of a protected ground.  The withholding provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), bars the \ngovernment from \"remov[ing] an alien to a country if ... the alien's life or freedom would be \nthreatened in that country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion.\" Whereas winning asylum requires showing a ten \npercent chance of persecution, being granted withholding requires showing that persecution is \nmore likely than not-a much higher bar.  INS v. Stevie, 467 U.S. 407,429-30 (1984).  The \nwithholding statute bars removal to any country as to which this showing is made, not just an \n14 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 20 of 54\nindividual's home country.  Just as with asylum, a showing of past persecution creates \npresumptive eligibility for relief. \n50.  A noncitizen in regular removal proceedings-even one who is ineligible for \nasylum-may apply for withholding of removal before an immigrationjudge. \n51.  A noncitizen who expresses a fear of removal during expedited removal is \nscreened for withholding eligibility by an asylum officer who applies a low threshold screening \nstandard. \n52.  Immigration regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") \nlikewise prohibit the removal of a noncitizen to any country where \"it is more likely than not that \nhe or she would be tortured.\"  8 C.P.R. § 208.16(c)(2). \n53.  The withholding of removal statute and the CAT regulations also implement \ninternational treaty obligations not to send noncitizens to countries where they face persecution \nor torture, known as non-refoulement obligations.  The Supreme Court has held, see Stevie, 467 \nU.S. at 421, 426 n.20, that the withholding statute addresses the requirement in Article 33 of the \n1951 Refugee Convention that no signatory \"expel or return ('refouler') a refugee in any manner \nwhatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on \naccount of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political \nopinion.\"  The CAT regulations address the requirement in Article 3 of the CAT that \"[n]o State \nParty shall expel, return ('refouler') or extradite a person to another State where there are \nsubstantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\" \n54.  These prohibitions on refoulement encompass both direct refoulement-sending \nasylum seekers directly to countries where they face persecution or torture-and indirect \n15 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 21 of 54\nrefoulement-sending asylum seekers to countries that then send them onward to persecution or \ntorture. \n55.  An asylum officer cannot decide claims for withholding of removal and CAT \nprotection.  Only an immigration judge can make these ultimate determinations of whether a \nnoncitizen's removal to a given country is prohibited by our non-refoulement obligations under \nthe Refugee Convention and the CAT.  8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a), (c)(4). \nII.  Given the Importance of Preventing Refoulement, Congress and Agencies Created \nNumerous Procedural Safeguards in Removal Proceedings. \n56.  The Rule challenged here denies noncitizens subject to an ACA the opportunity to \napply for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.  As explained further below, it \ndoes so by creating new procedures that apply to individuals in expedited removal proceedings, \nwhere it imposes an extra-statutory process outside of the mandated credible fear interview \nframework, and to individuals in regular removal proceedings.  Those procedures depart \ndrastically from the safeguards that Congress and federal agencies have long required to ensure \nthat bona fide asylum seekers are not removed to persecution or torture. \n57.  Generally, noncitizens subjected to expedited removal are ordered removed by an \nimmigration officer \"without further hearing or review.\"  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(i).  But \nCongress crafted an exception for individuals who express fear of removal. \n58.  To determine if that exception applies, immigration officers must affirmatively \nask noncitizens whether they have \"any fear or concern about being returned to [their] home \ncountry or being removed from the United States.\"  Form I-867 AB; 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b )(2)(i) \n(requiring immigration officers to use Form I-867 AB).  A noncitizen who expresses such a fear \nis entitled to a \"credible fear\" interview.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B). \n16 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 22 of 54\n59.  At the credible fear interview, the asylum officer must affirmatively \"elicit all \nrelevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of \npersecution or torture.\"  8 C.P.R. § 208.30(d). \n60.  Because the credible fear interview is a threshold screening device, noncitizens \nneed not satisfy the ultimate standards for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT protection. \nInstead, they need only show a \"significant possibility\" that they could establish eligibility in a \nfull removal hearing.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(v); 8 C.P.R.§ 208.30 (e)(2)-(3).  Because \nasylum requires a showing of a one in ten chance of persecution, it follows that a \"significant \npossibility\" of eligibility for asylum is just a fraction of that.  The standard is also met by \ndemonstrating past persecution. \n61.  The reason for applying a lower standard at this threshold screening stage is \nstraightforward.  Asylum, withholding, and CAT claims are highly fact-specific and take \nsignificant time, resources, and expertise to develop, and often require expert testimony and \nextensive evidence about country conditions.  They also often involve complex legal questions. \nBut credible fear interviews occur while individuals are detained, within days of their arrival, and \noften when they are still traumatized from the dangers they fled and their journeys to the United \nStates.  It is impossible to present fully developed protection claims in this context.  Thus, \nCongress created a low threshold at the credible fear stage to ensure that potentially valid \nprotection claims could be developed properly before an immigration judge, so that bona fide \nasylum seekers would not be summarily removed. \n62.  If the asylum officer finds a \"significant possibility\" that the individual \"could \nestablish eligibility for asylum,\" the individual is placed in regular removal proceedings, where \n17 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 23 of 54\nthey will have the opportunity to develop a full record supporting their protection claims before \nan immigration judge. \n63.  In addition to expedited removal, there are two other statutory summary removal \nprocesses to which certain noncitizens may be subjected: administrative removal of non-\npermanent residents convicted of aggravated felonies, and reinstatement of removal of certain \npreviously removed noncitizens who return to the United States without authorization.  8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1228(b), 1231(a)(5).  Although noncitizens subject to these proceedings are not permitted to \napply for asylum, if they express a fear of persecution or torture, they are screened for potential \nentitlement to withholding of removal and CAT protection.  As in credible fear interviews, the \nultimate standard for entitlement to withholding of removal and CAT protection-more likely \nthan not-is not applied in these screenings.  The threshold screening standard for these \nsummary removal processes is called \"reasonable fear,\" which can be satisfied either by \ndemonstrating past persecution or by meeting the lower standard for a grant of asylum, which is \na ten percent chance of future persecution or torture.  Reasonable fear interviews provide similar \nbasic procedural safeguards to credible fear interviews, including the right to consult with and be \nrepresented by counsel and immigration judge review.  See 8 C.F .R. § § 208.31 (c), (g).  A \nnoncitizen who passes this screening can present their withholding and CAT claims before an \nimmigration judge. \n64.  In regular removal proceedings, noncitizens have the right to counsel, to present \nevidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to administrative and judicial review. \nIII.  The Safe Third Country Provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), Sets Out a Narrow \nException to the Right to Apply for Asylum. \n65.  Congress created the safe third country provision at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A) as \none of three narrow exceptions to the right to seek asylum.  (The two other exceptions affect \n18 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 24 of 54\nindividuals who fail to apply within one year of their arrival, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and those \nwho had a previous application denied, id. § 1158(a)(2)(C), and are not at issue in this case). \nUnder the safe third country provision, an individual may not apply for asylum \"if the Attorney \nGeneral determines that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral \nagreement, to a country (other than the country of the alien's nationality or, in the case of an \nalien having no nationality, the country of the alien's last habitual residence) in which the alien's \nlife or freedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in \na particular social group, or political opinion, and where the alien would have access to a full and \nfair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection, unless the \nAttorney General finds that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United \nStates.\" \n66.  The safe third country provision may not be applied to unaccompanied children. \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(E). \nThe Safe Third Country Agreement with Canada \n67.  Congress enacted the safe third country provision in 1996 in light of negotiations \ninitiated by Canada, which had long sought such an agreement with the United States. \n68.  Canada is a global leader in refugee protection.  In 2001, the year before our safe \nthird country agreement with Canada was signed, it processed more than 44,000 asylum \napplications. 3  Between 2000 and 2019, Canada processed more than 28,000 applications per \nyear on average. 4 \n3 Statistics Canada, Just the Facts: Asylum Claimants (May 17, 2019), \nhttps://www150.statcan.gc.caln1/pub/89-28-0001/2018001/article/00013-eng.htm. \n4 !d.; Government of Canada, Asylum Claims by Year-2019 (last modified Dec. 18, 20 19), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/CanadaAsylumClaims2000-2019. \n19 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 25 of 54\n69.  Canada re-initiated negotiations on a safe third country agreement in 2001.  That \nprocess included public meetings with U.S. government officials and the Office of the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees (\"UNHCR\"), publication of the draft agreement, and a hearing on \nthe issue before the House Immigration Subcommittee. \n70.  During the negotiations, the State Department looked to the European Union's \nDublin Regulation governing the transfer of asylum seekers, which revealed \"how tremendously \ncomplex, and potentially problematic, it is to implement these types of arrangements for bona \nfide refugees.\"5 \n71.  The United States signed the safe third country agreement with Canada on \nDecember 5, 2002.  Subject to several exceptions-including a generous family unification \nexception-that agreement provides that an asylum seeker who arrives at a land port of entry on \nthe U.S.-Canada border may be removed to the other country to apply for asylum.  The \nagreement entered into force on December 29, 2004, one month after the United States issued \nprocedural regulations adopted pursuant to regular notice-and-comment procedures. \nRecent Agreements With Northern Triangle Countries \n72.  For more than sixteen years after signing the agreement with Canada, the United \nStates did not enter into any other safe third country agreement.  However, between June and \nSeptember 2019, the U.S. government signed three new \"asylum cooperative agreements\" \n(\"ACAs\") with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. \n73.  The context of these ACAs contrasts sharply with the U.S.-Canada safe third \ncountry agreement.  Unlike Canada, which is a stable democracy that accepts large numbers of \n5 US. & Canada Safe Third Country Agreement: Hearing Before the H  Subcomm. on Immigr., \nBorder Security, and Claims, 107th Cong. 17 (Oct. 16, 2002) (statement of Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State Kelly Ryan). \n20 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 26 of 54\nasylum seekers and has low levels of violence, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras have \nepidemic levels of violence and produce large numbers of asylum seekers fleeing to the United \nStates and other countries, as discussed below. \nIV.  The Interim Final Rule Creates a Procedural Framework That Is Inconsistent With \nthe Safeguards Required in Removal Proceedings. \n74.  On November 19,2019, Defendant Attorney General Barr and Defendant Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security Wolf promulgated the Rule, \"Implementing Bilateral and \nMultilateral Asylum Cooperative Agreements Under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"  84 \nFed. Reg. 63,994.  The Rule creates a procedural framework for removals under the Guatemala, \nHonduras, and El Salvador agreements and any future ACAs by instituting new procedures that \napply to individuals in regular and expedited removal proceedings. \n7 5.  Defendants issued the Rule without following the AP A requirements of notice \nand comment rulemaking followed by a 30-day implementation period.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(B), (d). Instead, they asserted the good cause and foreign affairs exceptions to these \nrequirements.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(l), (b)(B), (d)(3). \nThe Rule Makes Onerous New Changes to Regular Removal Proceedings \n76.  The Rule amends DOJ regulations governing regular removal proceedings by \nauthorizing immigration judges to order asylum seekers removed to ACA countries before \nhearing the merits oftheir asylum, withholding, and CAT claims as to their home countries.  As \nto any ACA countries to which removal is proposed, the immigration judge would have to \ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the applicant would be persecuted or tortured \nthere.  Thus, to avoid being ordered removed, an applicant would have to present evidence and \nsatisfy the more-likely-than-not standard as to every possible ACA country. \n21 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 27 of 54\n77.  By requiring noncitizens to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal or \nCAT protection as to every ACA-signatory country to which the government argues they can be \nremoved, before they have a chance present their asylum claims on the merits, the Rule imposes \nsevere new substantive and practical burdens on asylum seekers and the attorneys and legal \nservices organizations who represent them. \n78.  Additionally, while the safe third country provision confers on immigration \njudges in regular removal proceedings the authority to apply a broad \"public interest\" exception \nin cases where that provision could otherwise bar asylum, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), the Rule \nconstrains that power, and asserts that immigration judges may apply that exception only with \nthe permission of DHS attorneys. \nThe Rule Creates New Expedited Removal Procedures thatLack the Safeguards of the \nStatutory Credible Fear Interview P1·ocess \n79.  For individuals in expedited removal, the Rule strips away essential procedural \nsafeguards that Congress created to protect asylum seekers from refoulement to countries where \nthey may be persecuted or tortured.  If the government deems an asylum seeker in expedited \nremoval proceedings potentially removable under an ACA, the asylum seeker is diverted away \nfrom the normal credible fear process into a new process created by the Rule.  Instead of \nreceiving a credible fear interview, the Rule provides that the asylum seeker \"shall be provided \nwritten notice that if he or she fears removal to the prospective receiving country because of the \nlikelihood of persecution on account of a protected ground or torture in that country ... the alien \nshould affirmatively state to the officer such a fear of removal.\"  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009.  The \nRule does not explain when such notice will be provided, who shall provide it, whether it must \nbe in the noncitizen's language, or how notice is to be given if the noncitizen is illiterate.  Unlike \n22 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 28 of 54\nin the credible fear regulations, there is no requirement under the Rule that the officer \naffirmatively ask noncitizens whether they fear harm in the receiving country. \n80.  If the noncitizen does not affirmatively state a fear of removal to an ACA country, \nno assessment of whether they are at risk of persecution or torture in that country ever happens. \nIf the noncitizen does express such a fear, an asylum officer will assess their risk of persecution \nor torture in the ACA country in what the Rule calls a \"threshold screening interview.\"  84 Fed. \nReg. at 64,008-64,009. \n81.  In that interview, the Rule provides that the officer will \"determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the alien would be persecuted on account of a protected ground or \ntortured in that country,\" 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009-which is the ultimate standard for receiving \nwithholding or CAT relief in a full removal hearing before an immigrationjudge, not the lower \nscreening standard used in credible fear or reasonable fear interviews.  Only if the noncitizen \nmeets that ultimate standard as to every ACA country to which they are susceptible to removal, \nsee id., will the noncitizen then receive a normal credible fear interview regarding their fear of \nremoval to their home country. \n82.  Thus, a noncitizen subject to an ACA will receive a credible fear interview-and \nhave the chance of developing and presenting her asylum claims to an immigration judge-only \nif they both affirmatively express a fear of removal to the ACA country and manage to satisfy \nthe ultimate standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief by showing that they are more \nlikely than not to be persecuted or tortured in the ACA country. \n83.  Unlike in credible fear interviews, moreover, the noncitizen subjected to an ACA \ninterview must make this much greater evidentiary showing without any opportunity to consult \nwith or be represented by counsel. \n23 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 29 of 54\n84.  The absence of an opportunity to consult with or be represented by counsel also \ncontrasts sharply with expedited removal pursuant to the U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country \nAgreement.  Regulations implementing that agreement-which applies only to individuals who \npresent at a port of entry along the northern border-permit consultation with and representation \nby counsel in connection with the screening interviews in which asylum officers determine \nwhether to apply that agreement.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4); 65 Fed. Reg. 76,121, 76,129 (Dec. 6, \n2000) (final rule). \n85.  If, after the ACA interview, the asylum officer determines that the noncitizen does \nnot meet the more-likely-than-not standard, the noncitizen cannot apply for asylum, withholding \nof removal, or CAT protection in the United States, and is subject to immediate removal to the \nACA country once a supervisory asylum officer signs off on the decision. \n86.  The asylum officer's determination that a noncitizen is barred from applying for \nasylum and may be removed to a third country under an ACA is final.  The Rule forbids an \nimmigration judge from reviewing that determination.  Thus, the asylum officer renders a \nconclusive determination that the noncitizen's removal complies with the withholding and CAT \nstatutes. \n87.  The only way for a noncitizen subject to an ACA to avoid removal to the ACA \ncountry is to abandon their asylum claim and accept a removal order to their home country-\nwhich, of course, is the country from which they are seeking asylum in the first place. \nUSCIS Guidance Concerning the Guatemala ACA Further Increases the Burden on \nAsylum Seekers \n88.  On November 19, 2019, the same day the Rule was published in the Federal \nRegister, USCIS distributed written guidance for asylum officers on conducting interviews \nconcerning the Guatemala ACA.  That USCIS Guidance provided the background and legal \n24 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 30 of 54\nframework for the agreement and its implementation and an explanation of the threshold \nscreening process, exceptions to the agreement, how to elicit evidence to support an exception, \nthe process for reviewing an asylum officer's decision about the applicability of an AeA, and \nwhat happens after the interview with an asylum officer. \n89.  The USeiS Guidance sets forth details about the procedures Defendants apply to \nremove non-Guatemalan asylum seekers to Guatemala under the AeA. \n90.  First, eBP officers processing individuals at the border make the initial \ndetermination as to whether a noncitizen falls under an AeA. To be removed under the \nGuatemala AeA, the noncitizen initially had to be a national of Honduras or El Salvador and \nmust not have been convicted of a felony in the United States or any crime in Guatemala.  (The \nlist of amenable nationalities can be modified; Defendants have publicly stated that no \nnationalities are exempt.  See infra~ 136.). \n91.  eBP then gives the noncitizen a \"Tear Sheet\" stating, inter alia, that they could be \nremoved to Guatemala, that they will be referred to an asylum officer over the phone or in person \nto determine whether they meet an exception to the Guatemala AeA, and that they \"may express \na fear of removal to Guatemala or a fear of persecution or torture in Guatemala.\" \n92.  Additionally, the users Guidance provides that in AeA interviews-unlike in \nwithholding of removal adjudications in regular removal proceedings, or in threshold evaluations \nof potential withholding eligibility in credible fear and reasonable fear interviews \ndemonstrating past persecution in Guatemala does not create a presumption of future \npersecution.  Instead, such a showing will just count as \"strong evidence\" of the likelihood of \nfuture persecution.  The asylum officer cannot determine that a noncitizen is more likely than not \nto face persecution based solely on past persecution. \n25 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 31 of 54\n93.  Along with the users Guidance, asylum officers have been provided training \nmaterials that describe pervasive violence committed with impunity in Guatemala. 6 \n94.  On January 10, 2020, Defendants announced that they had fmalized the \nimplementing agreement for the ACA with Honduras.  The details of that agreement and any \nguidance to asylum officers regarding application of the ACA with Honduras have not yet been \nmade public. \nV.  The Government Is Removing Asylum Seekers to Guatemala, and Is Poised to Begin \nRemovals to Honduras, Without the Required Determinations that Their Asylum \nSystems Provide Access to Full and Fair Procedures. \n95.  The safe third country statute prohibits the government from removing an asylum \nseeker to a third country without first determining that the country will provide the asylum \nseeker with a full and fair procedure for seeking asylum.  8 U.S.e. § 1158(a)(2)(A). \n96.  Neither the Rule nor the users Guidance permits asylum officers to consider this \nstatutory requirement on a case-by-case basis. \n97.  Instead, the Rule states: \"Prior to implementation of an AeA, the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of Homeland Security ... will evaluate and make a categorical \ndetermination whether a country to which aliens would be removed under such an agreement \nprovides 'access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent \ntemporary protection.\"'  84 Fed. Reg. at 63,997 (quoting 8 U.S.e. § 1158(a)(2)(A)). \n98.  However, the government has not publicly issued any such categorical \ndesignation concerning Guatemala or any other country. \n6 Hamed Aleaziz, A Controversial Plan To Deport Mexican Asylum-Seekers To Guatemala Has \nBeen Paused, BuzzFeed News (Jan. 8, 2020), \nhttps://www. buzzfeednews.com/a rticle/hamedaleaziz/mexican-asylum-seekers-guatemala-plan \npaused. \n26 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 32 of 54\n99.  If the government has made, but not disclosed, a categorical decision that \nGuatemala provides access to \"full and fair\" asylum procedures, that designation did not and \ncannot have adequately considered the security situation in Guatemala, the impact of that \ninsecurity on refugees' ability to remain and seek protection in Guatemala, or the actual \nfunctioning of Guatemala's brand new, very limited, and failing asylum system. \n100.  The administration has never adequately evaluated Guatemala's capacity, in terms \nof infrastructure or personnel, to accept and process asylum seekers before beginning to remove \nasylum seekers there. 7 \n101.  The government also has not issued any categorical \"full and fair\" designation \nconcerning Honduras or El Salvador, despite its announcement that it plans to begin removals to \nHonduras under that ACA imminently. \nVI.  The Current ACA Countries-Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador-Are \nExtremely Dangerous and Unfit for Asylum Seekers. \n102.  El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are experiencing epidemic levels of \nviolence comparable to those typically seen in war zones. \n103.  Violence against women, children, and members of the LGBT community by \narmed criminal groups has escalated dramatically in the Northern Triangle countries, and those \ngovernments have been unable or unwilling to provide effective protection. \n104.  Consequently, large numbers of asylum seekers are fleeing life-threatening \nsituations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, 8 and thousands have been granted asylum in \n7 Nicole Narea, Trump's Agreements in Central America Are Dismantling the Asylum System as \nWe Know It, Vox (Nov. 20, 2019), https://www.vox.com/2019/9/26/20870768/trump-agreement \nhonduras-guatemala-el-salvador-explained. \n8 See, e.g., Dep't of Homeland Sec'y, Office oflmmigration Statistics, Annual Flow Report, \nRefugees and Asylees: 2017 7-8, Mar. 2019, \nhttps:/ /www .dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Refugees_  Asylees_  2017. pdf. \n27 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 33 of 54\nthe United States.

For most asylum seekers, seeking protection in Guatemala is not an option.  The \ncountry lacks a full and fair asylum processing system, and is often even more dangerous for \nmigrants than it is for Guatemalans, who have fled the country in large numbers. \n106.  Guatemala had the twenty-sixth-highest homicide rate in the world in 2017, and \nthe seventh-highest for females. 10  The U.S. State Department warns that \"[v]iolent crime, such \nas armed robbery and murder, is common.\"11  \"Gang activity, such as extortion, violent street \ncrime, and narcotics trafficking, is widespread,\" and Guatemalan police often \"lack the resources \nto respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.\"12  Accordingly, the State Department \nadvises Americans to \"[e]xercise increased caution in Guatemala due to crime,\" and to \n\"reconsider travel\" to six of Guatemala's twenty-two departments where approximately 40% of \nGuatemala's population lives, including where Guatemala City is located, due to high levels of \nmurder and other violent crime. 13 \n107.

Guatemala is also very poor, hindering its ability to support and provide a full and \nfair process to asylum seekers and making it difficult for asylum seekers to survive there during \nthe pendency of their proceedings and beyond.  Its per capita gross domestic product was an \nestimated $8,200 in 2017, \"roughly half the average for Latin America and the Caribbean.\"21 \nMore than half of the population is below the national poverty line, and 23% live in extreme \npoverty.  Nearly half of Guatemala's children under age five are chronically malnourished, one \nof the highest malnutrition rates in the world. \n111.  Guatemala's asylum system is also brand new and barely functioning.  Its new \nmigration code was approved in 2016 and the implementing regulations pertaining to asylum \nwere issued in early 2019.  Before the official creation of this new system, Guatemala accepted \njust 370 asylum seekers in 15 years, including individual family members. \n112.  Last year, the U.S. State Department found that while Guatemalan \"laws provide \nfor the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system for \nproviding protection to refugees,\" UNHCR has \"reported that identification and referral \nmechanisms for potential asylum seekers were inadequate.'m \"Both migration and police \nauthorities lacked adequate training concerning the rules for establishing refugee status.\"23 \n113.  According to UNHCR, only 466 people applied for refugee status in Guatemala \nbetween January 2018 and July 2019.24  Even with this small number of applications, more than \nninety percent had not yet been decided by August 2019.25 \n21 CIA World Factbook, Guatemala (Dec. 4, 2019), https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the \nworld-factbookl geos/ gt.html. \n22 U.S. State Dep't, Guatemala 2018 Human Rights Report 13, https://www.state.gov/wp \ncontent/uploads/2019/03/GUATEMALA-2018.pdf. \n23 /d. \n24 David C.

There are very few officials working on the asylum process in Guatemala, and \nstaff usually are not familiar with the rights of refugees and asylum seekers.  There are \nsignificant limits on where asylum seekers can submit applications and attend interviews, and \nthere are frequent check-in requirements.  Asylum applicants are also not permitted to be \nrepresented by attorneys during their interviews.  The system lacks adequate infrastructure, and \ndoes not have capacity to provide competent translation or interpretation services for non-\nSpanish speaking asylum seekers.  Moreover, Guatemala has failed to implement a system for \nasylum applicants to access basic social services such as shelter and education. \n115.  UNHCR has warned that Guatemala does not have the capacity to significantly \nexpand its asylum program. \n116.  On June 18, 2019, less than six weeks before the signing of the Guatemala ACA, \nGuatemala's foreign minister acknowledged that Guatemala does not have adequate resources to \nreceive asylum seekers. 26 \nEl Salvador and Honduras Are Also Not Safe for Asylum Seekers and Lack Functioning \nAsylum Sys-tems \n117.

Between 2008 and mid-2019, Honduras's immigration agency received fewer \nthan 300 asylum applications and recognized only 50 people as refugees. 30  The country received \njust nine asylum applications in 2016.31  That year, a U.N. monitor reported that Honduran \n\"immigration and asylum policies and practices fail to live up to international standards required \nfor those fleeing violence or persecution.\"32  In 2017, UNHCR reported that the nation had yet to \n\"develop[] [or] implement[] ... guidelines for the identification of persons with protection needs \nin order to guarantee effective access to asylum procedures.'m \n28 See, e.g., U.S. State Dep't, El Salvador 2018 Human Rights Report 1, 16, Mar. 2019, \nhttps://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/EL-SALVADOR-2018.pdf; U.S. State \nDep't, Honduras 2018 Human Rights Report 1, 14, Mar. 2019, https://www.state.gov/wp \ncontent/uploads/2019/03/HONDURAS-2018.pdf. \n29 Sharyn Alfoni, \"Our Whole Economy is in Shatters\": El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele \non the Problems His Country is Facing, CBS News (Dec. 15, 2019), \nhttps:/ /tinyurl.com/ElSalvadorProblems. \n30 Yael Schacher, Senior U.S. Advocate, Refugees International, Letter to USCIS Asylum Div. \nChiefA  ndrew Davidson & EOIR Ass 't Dir.

In addition to the profound dangers and institutional deficiencies that make each \nNorthern Triangle country unsuitable to serve as a safe third country for asylum seekers, there \nare grave risks in removing asylum seekers from one of these countries to another. \n121.  Much of the epidemic violence that has caused individuals to flee El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Honduras is carried out by gangs, such as the MS-13 and Mara 18, that are \ntransnational and have tens of thousands of members throughout the Northern Triangle. 34 \n122.  Additionally, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras-along with Nicaragua-\nform the \"Central America-4 Free Mobility Agreement,\" a regional free movement accord that \npermits unchecked land travel between the four countries, without visas or passports.  This \nfreedom of movement between the Northern Triangle countries-which have a combined area \nsmaller than Michigan-makes it easy for a gang or other motivated persecutor to pursue a \nvictim anywhere within the region.  As such, there is little practical difference between removing \nan asylum seeker from any one of these countries to another, rather than back to her home \ncountry. \nVII.  The ACA Rule Is Inconsistent with International Law Regarding Safe Third \nCountry Agreements. \n123.

UNHCR guidance on safe-third-country-type transfer agreements affirms that the \n\"primary responsibility to provide protection rests with the State where asylum is sought.\"36 \nUNHCR also advises that such agreements are not permissible as a means for a country to \n\"divest itself of responsibility\" for asylum seekers. 37  Asylum should not be refused \"solely on \nthe ground that it could be sought from another State,\" and an asylum seeker should not be \nrequired \"to seek asylum in a country with which he has not established any relevant links.\"38 \n126.  Before removing an asylum seeker to a third country, UNHCR advises that it is \nincumbent on the sending country \"individually to assess whether the third state will: (re)admit \nthe person, grant the person access to a fair and efficient procedure for determination of refugee \nstatus and other international protection needs, permit the person to remain while a determination \nis made, and accord the person standards of treatment commensurate with the 1951 Convention \nand international human rights standards, including-but not limited to-protection from \nrefoulement.\"39 \n35 UNCHR, Statement on New U.S. Asylum Policy, Nov. 19, 2019, https://www.unhcr.org/en \nus/news/press/2019/11/5dd426824/ statement-on-new-us-asylum-policy.html. \n36 UNHCR, Guidance Note on Bilateral and/or Multilateral Transfer Arrangements of Asylum \nSeekers ,-r 1, May 2013, https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/51af82794.pdf; accordUNHCR, Legal \nConsiderations Regarding Access to Protection and a Connection Between the Refugee and the \nThird Country in the Context of Return or Transfer to Safe Third Countries ,-r 2, Apr. 2018, \nhttps://www.refworld.org/pdfid/5acb33ad4.pdf. \n37 UNHCR, Guidance Note on Bilateral and/or Multilateral Transfer Arrangements of Asylum \nSeekers ,-r 6, May 2013, https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/51af82794.pdf. \n38 UNHCR, Note on Asylum ,-r 11, Aug. 30, 1979, \nhttps:/ /tinyurl.com/UNHCRNote0nAsylum1979. \n39 UNHCR, Legal Considerations Regarding Access to Protection and a Connection Between the \nRefugee and the Third Country in the Context of Return or Transfer to Safe Third Countries ,-r 4, \nApr. 2018, https:/ /www.refworld.org/pdfid/5acb33ad4.pdf. \n34 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 40 of 54\n127.  For a transferring state to determine whether such requisite \"standards are \navailable\" in a proposed safe third country, the transferring state must assess not just the \nreceiving state's \"international legal obligations,\" but also \"its domestic laws and the actual \npractice of implementation\" to ensure that the state's \"actual practice indicat[es] consistent \ncompliance with its international legal obligations.\"40 \n128.  In addition to meeting baseline non-refoulement obligations, the receiving country \nmust be able to provide \"effective protection,\" which includes the requirement that \"there is no \nreal risk to the life of the person in the third State,\" whether or not on account of a protected \nground.41 \n129.  UNHCR has also made clear that \"[t]he burden of proof does not lie with the \nasylum-seeker (to establish that the third country is unsafe), but rather with the country which \nwishes to remove the asylum-seeker from its territory (to establish that the third country is \nsafe).\"42 \n130.

Initially, Defendants applied the new ACA procedures \nonly to adult male Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers.  However, Defendants have \nquickly expanded the geographic scope of the Guatemala ACA's application and the types of \nindividuals subject to it.  The program is now being carried out across at least two sectors, and \nmen, women, and children, including families, are being removed. \n132.  On November 21, Defendants removed a non-Guatemalan asylum seeker to \nGuatemala.  That individual, a young Honduran man, later stated that he had to sign a piece of \npaper that he did not understand, and was not informed that he was being removed to Guatemala \nuntil he was being taken to the plane that would deport him. 44 \n133.  Between November 21 and December 20, Defendants removed approximately 40 \nHonduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala.  This group included single men, young \nwomen, and families. \n134.  During that same period, approximately 20 more asylum seekers were pressured \ninto withdrawing their asylum applications and accepting removal to their countries of origin \nwhen confronted with the threat of deportation to Guatemala. \n135.  On or around December 9, Defendants expanded the program's geographic reach \nand began applying the Guatemala ACA to Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers in the Rio \nGrande Valley in southern Texas. \n136.  On December 19, Defendant Cucinelli stated that \"all populations\" of asylum \nseekers are being considered for removal to Guatemala, \"including Mexican nationals.\" \nMexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that if Mexican asylum seekers are subjected to \n44 Sofia Menchu, Honduran Migrant Sent Back Under New US.

In the early days of January 2020, while much of the Guatemalan government and \ncivil society was closed, Defendants increased removals.  As of January 13, 2020, approximately \n140 individuals had been removed to Guatemala under the Rule. 47 \n138.  Removals to Honduras appear to be imminent.  On January 10, Defendants \nannounced that they were prepared to move forward with implementation of the Honduras ACA. \nIX.  Guatemala Has Proven Totally Unprepared to Receive Asylum Seekers Under Its \nACA. \n139.  When ACA removals to Guatemala began on November 21, the Guatemalan \ngovernment had not yet developed any coherent plan to ensure that asylum seekers deported \nunder the agreement would be able to access asylum procedures. \n140.  On November 18, a briefing prepared for Defendant Wolf stated: \"There is \nuncertainty as to who will provide orientation services for migrants as well as who will provide \nshelter, food, transportation, and other care.\" \n141.  At present, those removed to Guatemala are being provided short-term \naccommodations by nonprofit shelters in Guatemala City--one of the most dangerous places in \nthe country-which are not designed to accommodate this population.

Upon their arrival in Guatemala, asylum seekers removed under the ACA are \ngranted preliminary authorization to stay in the country for just 72 hours. \n143.  Within those 72 hours, ACA deportees must decide whether to return to their \nhome countries or remain in Guatemala and attempt to apply for asylum there.  However, many \nindividuals have not received adequate information or instructions about the process of applying \nfor asylum in Guatemala to allow them to make an informed decision just days after their \ndisorienting deportation to an unexpected country. \n144.  And asylum seekers removed to Guatemala face significant pressure to return to \ntheir countries of origin.  They frequently lack stable shelter and resources in Guatemala and face \nwell-known dangers similar to those they fled in their home countries.  In fact, one woman \nremoved to Guatemala reported that she came upon a crime scene with a dead body just blocks \nfrom the migrant shelter where she was staying temporarily. They also must assess the unlikely \nprospects for protection from either Guatemala's untested asylum system or its notoriously \ncorrupt, ineffectual police. \n145.  The United States has also provided substantial funds to support efforts in \nGuatemala to offer ACA deportees transportation back to their home countries.  This offer of \nfree transportation intensifies the pressure that these individuals already face to return to their \ncountries of origin. \n38 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 44 of 54\n146.

The ACA Rule and USCIS Guidance Cause Serious, Irreparable Harms to \nPlaintiffs. \n147.  Absent declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will be severely and irreparably \nharmed by the Rule and USCIS Guidance.  The Individual Plaintiffs will be severely limited in \ntheir ability to access protection from persecution and torture, as they have been prevented from \napplying for asylum or any other form of protection in the United States and removed to a \ncountry where they face grave dangers and serious barriers to obtaining protection.  They cannot \nlive safely either in Guatemala or in their home countries. \n148.  Plaintiff Las Americas is a nonprofit legal services organization dedicated to \nserving low-income immigrants, including asylum seekers.  A core component of Las Americas' \nmission is to provide immigration counseling and legal services to asylum seekers detained by \nDHS in the El Paso area and subjected to expedited removal proceedings.  Las Americas' goal in \nthat work is to ensure that as many asylum seekers as possible have a fair chance of passing their \ncredible fear screenings so that they will have the opportunity to present their asylum claims on \nthe merits in full removal proceedings.  Normally, Las Americas is able to fulfill this part of its \nmission by counseling and/or representing detained asylum seekers in preparation for credible \nfear interviews, representing individuals during those interviews, and, when necessary, seeking \nimmigrationjudge review of negative credible fear determinations.  By removing asylum seekers \nwithout any credible fear interview and without any opportunity to consult with or be represented \nby counsel, the Rule and USCIS Guidance frustrate Las Americas' mission of providing legal \n48 Jason Hopkins, Trump's Latest Asylum Deal is Working Just as the Administration Intended, \nDaily Caller (Dec. 13, 2019), https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/13/all-asylum-seekers-returning-to \nhome-country/. \n39 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 45 of 54\nservices to detained asylum seekers subjected to expedited removal proceedings.  By preventing \ndetained asylum seekers from making it through the credible fear process, these ACA policies \nalso negatively impact Las Americas' ability to represent individuals in connection with parole \nand bond requests, and in full removal proceedings. \n149.  The Rule and US CIS Guidance also require Las Americas to expend significant \nresources to attempt to address the frustration of their mission.  Additionally, these policies \njeopardize funding streams contingent on the organization's work representing individuals \nduring the credible fear process. \n150.  PlaintiffTahirih Justice Center is a nonprofit and non-partisan organization that \nprovides free legal immigration services, including asylum services, to survivors of gender-based \nviolence.  Tahirih's mission is to provide free holistic services to immigrant women and girls \nfleeing violence such as rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation/cutting, forced \nmarriage, and human trafficking, and who seek legal immigration status under U.S. law.  Tahirih \noffers legal representation and social services for individuals who seek protection, including \nasylum, in their immigration proceedings. \n151.  Asylum accounts for approximately 40% of Tahirih' s immigration services. \nTahirih's asylum clients come from all over the globe, and under the terms of the Rule, the vast \nmajority ofthose clients would be categorically ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, \nand CAT relief in the United States.  Even as currently applied to nationals of El Salvador and \nHonduras, the Rule will severely compromise Tahirih's asylum work.  In 2018,21.4% of \nTahirih's clients were from Honduras and 18.6% were from El Salvador.  Another 8.4% of \nTahirih's asylum clients came from Guatemala in 2018.  These individuals would be subject to \nremoval to Honduras or El Salvador once the agreements with those countries are operational. \n40 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 46 of 54\n152.  The Rule and USCIS Guidance frustrate Tahirih's mission of providing legal \nservices to protect women and girls fleeing violence.  For example, the Rule prevents Tahirih's \nprimary client-base from ever having the chance to apply for asylum or other forms of \nprotection.  The Rule's more-likely-than-not standard is so high, and the procedures established \nby the Rule so bare bones and inadequate, that very few gender-based violence survivors will \npass the \"screening\" interview.  Most gender-based violence survivors from Honduras and El \nSalvador thus will be removed before Tahirih ever has the chance to represent or otherwise serve \nthem in their immigration proceedings. \n153.  The provisions ofthe Rule concerning regular removal proceedings will also \nfrustrate Tahirih's mission and force it to divert additional staff time and other resources.  In \nparticular, Tahirih will have to significantly increase the resources it expends on each asylum \nclient, because clients will have to be prepared to prove before an immigration judge that they \nare more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured in every country with which the United \nStates has signed an ACA.  Satisfying that more-likely-than-not standard is a resource-intensive \nprocess, because staff attorneys must gather detailed expert evidence and testimony about \ncountry conditions.  Prior to the Rule, Tahirih generally had to prepare clients only to meet the \nlower asylum standard and only as to their country of origin.  Attempting to satisfy the more \nlikely-than-not standard as to any number of different countries will be incredibly burdensome in \nterms of staff time and organizational resources, and will limit the number of clients Tahirih is \nable to serve. \n154.  The Rule will also affect Tahirih's funding.  Tahirih receives certain funding that \ncan be used to provide immigration services only in specified geographic locations within the \nUnited States.  Because the Rule prevents Tahirih' s client base from entering the country to seek \n41 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 47 of 54\nasylum or other forms of protection, Tahirih will be unable to use existing funding to provide the \nasylum services it has previously provided under such geographically-limited grants. \n155.  The Rule's immediate promulgation denied Tahirih and Las Americas the \nopportunity to comment on the Rule before it into effect, and denied them the ability to prepare \nfor its serious and harmful impacts. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation ofthe Safe Third Country Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), \nand the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n156.  The INA's safe third country provision forbids the government from removing an \nindividual to a third country pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement unless it first \n\"determines that ... the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of' a \nprotected ground.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A).  It thus requires that the government make a \nlikelihood-of-persecution determination in every case prior to removing an individual under a \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A) agreement. \n157.  In expedited removal proceedings, the Rule and USCIS Guidance do not require \nsuch a determination in every case.  Instead, they require a likelihood-of-persecution assessment \nonly if the individual affirmatively informs an asylum officer that they have a fear of removal to \nthe relevant third country. \n158.  Section 1158(a)(2)(A) also requires that before the government may remove an \nasylum seeker to a \"safe third country\" pursuant to a bilateral agreement, it must first determine \nthat the third country would provide the asylum seeker \"access to a full and fair procedure for \ndetermining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.\" \n42 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 48 of 54\n159.  The Rule and users Guidance provide for the expedited removal of asylum \nseekers without any case-by-case determination that the receiving country will provide those \nasylum seekers with access to full and fair asylum procedures.  The Rule states that a designation \nwill be made addressing this requirement on a categorical basis, but no such categorical \ndesignation has been issued as to any of the current AeA countries.  Nor has any such \ndesignation, or the basis for it, been communicated to Plaintiffs or to the public.  To the extent \nany such designation has been made, it does not account for whether those countries are, in \nreality, capable of providing full and fair access to protection, as required by the statute. \n160.  The safe third country provision also confers on immigration judges the authority \nto apply the provision's public interest exception in regular removal proceedings.  The Rule \nerroneously provides that immigration judges lack this independent authority and may instead \nonly apply that exception with the permission of DHS counsel. \n161.  For these reasons and others, the Rule and users Guidance therefore violate 8 \nU.S.e. § 1158(a)(2)(A). \n162.  As a result, the Rule and USers Guidance are contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.e. \n§ 706(2)(A). \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Withholding of Removal Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and Implementing \nRegulations; the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, § 2242, 112 Stat. \n2681-822, 105th Cong. 2d Sess. (1998), and Implementing Regulations; \nand the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n163.  The INA's withholding of removal provision, 8 U.S.e. § 1231(b)(3), bars removal \nof an individual to a country where it is more likely than not that they would face persecution. \n43 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 49 of 54\n164.  Section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n(\"FARRA\") bars removal of an individual to a country where it is more likely than not that they \nwould be subjected to torture.  See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16(c)(2), 1208.16(c)(2). \n165.  Longstanding regulations implement these statutory provisions and the obligation \nnot to send an individual to persecution or torture.  For instance, only an immigration judge can \ndetermine whether an individual faces such a risk of persecution or torture and is entitled to \nwithholding of removal or CAT protection after full removal proceedings in immigration court. \n8 C.F.R. § 208.16(a), (c)(4); id. § 1208.16(a), (c)(4).  And past persecution creates a rebuttable \npresumption of eligibility for withholding of removal.  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16(b)(1)(i), \n1208.16(b) (1 )(i). \n166.  The Rule and USCIS Guidance are inconsistent with, and seek to bypass, these \nand other statutory and regulatory provisions.  Among other things, for individuals in expedited \nremoval, they require a.sy~um officers, not immigration judges, to make the ultimate withholding \ndetermination, i.e., whether an individual is more likely than not to be persecuted in a third \ncountry, and deny the opportunity for immigration judge review.  They also provide that, in \ndetermining whether an individual is more likely than not to be persecuted in the receiving \ncountry, past persecution shall not establish a presumption of future persecution. \n167.  Because the Rule and USCIS Guidance abandon the safeguards set out in \nstatutory provisions and regulations designed to ensure the critical protection against \nusers \nnonrefoulement, the Rule and  Guidance violate 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), the FARRA, and \ntheir implementing regulations. \nusers \n168.  As a result, the Rule and  Guidance are contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n44 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 50 of 54\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Credible Fear Statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l), and Implementing \nRegulations) \n169.  Under the INA, if a noncitizen placed in expedited removal proceedings indicates \nto an immigration officer either a fear of persecution or an intention to apply for asylum, the \nnoncitizen must be referred to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview, after which the \nasylum officer must determine whether the noncitizen has a credible fear of persecution.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(A)(ii), (B).  '\"[C]redible fear of persecution' means that there is a \nsignificant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in \nsupport of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could \nestablish eligibility for asylum.\" /d. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(v). \n170.  A noncitizen \"who is eligible for such interview may consult with a person or \npersons of the alien's choosing prior to the interview or any review thereof,\" 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b) (1 )(B)(iv), and that \"person ... may be present at the interview and may be permitted \n... to present a statement at the end ofthe interview,\" 8 C.P.R.§ 208.30(d)(4).  Following the \ncredible fear interview, \"if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of \npersecution,\" the noncitizen is entitled to \"request ... prompt review by an immigration judge of \n[that] determination.\"  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(l)(B)(iii)(I), (III). \n17 1.  This credible fear interview process, with its attendant safeguards, is the only \nmechanism in expedited removal proceedings by which the government may remove an \nindividual who has expressed a fear of persecution or intention to apply for asylum.  Only \nremoval proceedings \"specified in\" the INA may supplant regular removal proceeding before an \nimmigrationjudge.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3). \n45 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 51 of 54\n172.  While the safe third country provision creates a bar that may be applied to asylum \nseekers, if applied in expedited removal, it must be done through the statutory credible fear \ninterview process, with its attendant procedural safeguards.  Nothing in the safe third country \nprovision purports to create an alternate expedited removal mechanism. \n17 3.  Because the Rule and users Guidance provide for the expedited removal of \nasylum seekers without application of the low credible fear standard, right to consultation and \nrepresentation by counsel, immigration judge review, and the other required safeguards, it \nviolates 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b) (1 ). \n174.  As a result, the Rule and users Guidance are contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the APA, Arbitrary and Capricious-Failure to Acknowledge Departures) \n17 5.  An agency violates the AP A where it fails to acknowledge, or cannot show \"good \nreasons\" for, departing from prior policy.  Several of the procedures set out in the Rule and \nusers Guidance are unacknowledged or unjustified departures from prior agency policies \nregarding screening for claims of protection from removal because of the risk of persecution or \ntorture.  Several are also uJtiustified departures from the procedures set out in the regulations \nimplementing the U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement. \n176.  The Rule and USCrS Guidance are arbitrary and capricious.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the APA, Arbitrary and Capricious) \n177.  The APA   requires reasoned and reasonable policy-making. \n46 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 52 of 54\n178.  Defendants have adopted procedures so ill-suited to achieving their non-\nrefoulement obligation as to render the Rule and USCIS Guidance arbitrary and capricious. \n179.  To the extent they have made such non-public categorical designations, \nDefendants' designations of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador as providing asylum seekers \naccess to full and fair procedures for determining protection claims are also arbitrary and \ncapricious.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n180.  Among other reasons, any such designations are arbitrary and capricious because \nDefendants failed to articulate reasoned explanations for their decisions; considered factors that \nCongress did not intend to be considered; entirely failed to consider important aspects of the \nproblem; and offered explanations that run counter to the evidence before the agencies. \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation ofthe APA, Notice And Comment, 30-Day Grace Period) \n181.  The APA   requires notice and opportunity for comment prior to the promulgation \nof regulations.  5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c).  Defendants failed to provide notice and an opportunity \nto comment prior to the Rule's effective date. \n182.  The APA requires that a regulation be published \"no less than 30 days before its \neffective date.\"  5 U.S.C. § 553(d).  Defendants failed to comply with this requirement. \n183.  Defendants have not articulated reasons sufficient to show good cause why these \nrequirements are inapplicable, nor is the foreign affairs exception applicable. \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Suspension Clause, Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2, of the U.S. Constitution) \n184.  Article 1, § 9, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution provides that the \"Privilege \nof the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or \nInvasion the public Safety may require it.\" \n47 \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 3   Filed 01/15/20   Page 53 of 54\n185.  The Rule subjects individuals to expedited removal to third countries without the \nconstitutionally required level of federal court review of an expedited removal order. \n186.  Depriving individuals ofthe right to seekjudicial review of an expedited removal \norder violates the Suspension Clause. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the following relief: \na.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that the Rule and USCIS Guidance are \ncontrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and/or unconstitutional; \nb.

These \npolicies purport to implement a provision of the asylum statute that Congress carefully crafted to \npermit such removals only to a “safe third country”—a term of art in international refugee law \nthat requires a transferring country to ensure that the receiving country will in fact provide a safe \nhaven.  Congress incorporated these requirements into the safe third country provision to \nfacilitate a limited transfer arrangement with Canada, a nation renowned for welcoming refugees.  \nThe government has now hijacked that provision to deport people fleeing violence to adjacent \nrefugee-producing countries that are far from safe.  Its explicit goal is to offload “hundreds of \nthousands” of asylum seekers, and its barebones procedures guarantee that many will be harmed.   \nLast summer, the government signed agreements with Guatemala, Honduras, and El \nSalvador.  No doubt aware that they cannot plausibly be deemed safe third country agreements, \nthe government calls them “asylum cooperative agreements” (“ACAs”).  Guatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador form Central America’s Northern Triangle, an area smaller than Michigan with \na free-movement pact that allows persecutors to pursue victims across the region.  These \ncountries suffer from some the world’s highest homicide rates, as well as epidemic levels of \ngender-based, anti-LGBT, and gang violence.  All three have also been among the top five origin \ncountries of individuals granted asylum in the United States since 2015.  None of them have \nfunctioning asylum systems that can operate at any kind of meaningful capacity.   \nSince November, the government has removed more than 700 Honduran and Salvadoran \nasylum seekers—men, women, and children—to Guatemala.  Six of those people are the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 13 of 58\nIndividual Plaintiffs, who fled beatings, death threats, and other serious harms in their home \ncountries.  The government intends to also use the procedures challenged here to send asylum \nseekers to Honduras and El Salvador.  Instead of protecting asylum seekers, it will merely \nshuffle them among countries presenting the very same dangers they fled.  These actions \ndisregard the safeguards Congress built into U.S. laws to protect asylum seekers and the solemn \ntreaty obligations those laws are intended to uphold. \nWhen Congress added the safe third country provision, it also provided for the expedited \nremoval of certain individuals.  In doing so, it built in a bedrock safeguard to ensure that asylum \nseekers are not removed to persecution or torture: the credible fear interview process.  The \ncredible fear procedure defines the absolute minimum that Congress found necessary to comply \nwith our international obligations, and is all that stands between many asylum seekers and being \ncast away to horrific violence.   \nThe joint Interim Final Rule (“Rule”) issued by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and \nthe Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) falls far below that minimum.  It deports people \nto danger using an extra-statutory mechanism that unlawfully circumvents the expedited removal \nstatute’s critical protections.  It also illegally violates the substantive protections of the safe third \ncountry provision itself and statutes codifying the United States’ non-refoulement obligations.  In \naddition, the Rule fails the arbitrary and capricious test for reasoned decisionmaking, and it was \nunlawfully issued without the required notice and comment procedures.  Plaintiffs therefore ask \nthe Court to vacate and permanently enjoin the Rule and the related agency guidance. \nThe Court should also vacate and enjoin the categorical designations (the “Designations”) \nmade by DHS and DOJ that Guatemala is a “safe third country.”  The Designations assert in \nconclusory fashion that Guatemala offers safety and meaningful access to asylum.  They do so \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 14 of 58\nwithout considering the factors required by law or grappling with key evidence in the \nadministrative record that Guatemala is “among the most dangerous countries in the world” and \ncould not even handle the small number of asylum applications it previously received.  Like the \nRule, these Designations are arbitrary and capricious and violate the safe third country provision.   \nPlaintiffs request that the Court order Defendants to parole the Individual Plaintiffs back \ninto the United States, vacate their removal orders, and provide them with credible fear \nproceedings in accordance with the law or place them in regular removal proceedings. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and the Convention Against Torture.  \nIt is a fundamental commitment of the United States to protect refugees fleeing harm.  \nThis commitment is reflected in statutory law, including the provisions offering asylum, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158; withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); and in regulations implementing the \nConvention Against Torture (“CAT”), 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16-18. \nA.  Asylum. \nAsylum protects individuals who reach the United States and have a “well-founded fear \nof persecution” on account of a protected ground: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or \nmembership in a particular social group.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A).  A “well-\nfounded fear of persecution” requires a mere ten percent chance of suffering serious harm.  INS \nv. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 430, 440 (1987).  Past persecution gives rise to a \npresumption of a well-founded fear, and thus eligibility for asylum.  8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1). \nThe asylum laws brought the United States into compliance with its international \nobligations under the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.  Cardoza-Fonseca, \n480 U.S. at 437-38.  Generally, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 15 of 58\nwho arrives in the United States . . . , irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  But asylum is subject to several limits, including a one-year filing \ndeadline and eligibility bars for individuals with certain criminal convictions.  See id. \n§ 1158(a)(2), (b)(2).     \nB.  Non-refoulement Obligations: Withholding of Removal and CAT Protection. \n \nWithholding of removal (“withholding”) and CAT protection implement the United \nStates’ “non-refoulement” obligations under international law not to send any person to a country \nwhere that person would face persecution or torture.  See 1951 Convention Relating to the Status \nof Refugees, art. 33, July 28, 1951, 189 U.N.T.S. 150;1 United Nations Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, art. 3, Dec. 10, \n1985, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85.  These protections may thus be available even to those denied asylum.  \nBoth obligations encompass direct refoulement—sending individuals directly to countries where \nthey face persecution or torture—as well as indirect refoulement—sending them to countries \nwhere they are sent onward to persecution or torture.  See, e.g., DHSFF104, 364, 816-17, 832.2      \nThe Supreme Court has held that the withholding statute addresses the Refugee \nConvention’s prohibition of refoulement.  INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 426 n.20 (1984).  \nWithholding bars the government from removing a person to any country where his or her “life \nor freedom would be threatened” on account of any of the same five protected grounds as \nasylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).  And as with asylum, past persecution generates a presumption \n                                                           \n1 The United States is not a party to the 1951 Convention, but is a party to its 1967 Protocol, \nwhich incorporates, inter alia, Article 33.  INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 427 (1999). \n2 The government provided plaintiffs with five separate administrative records.  This brief refers \nto those records using the abbreviations in the government’s pagination.  “DOJIFR” and \n“DHSIFR” refer to the respective DOJ and DHS records concerning the Rule itself.  “USCIS” \nrefers to the record concerning the Guidance documents.  “DOJFF” and “DHSFF” refer to the \nagencies’ respective categorical Designations concerning Guatemala.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 16 of 58\nof future persecution for withholding eligibility.  8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(1)(i).  But withholding \nimposes a higher standard of proof: individuals must show that it is more likely than not that they \nwill be persecuted.  Stevic, 467 U.S. at 429-30.  The CAT statute and regulations address the \nCAT’s non-refoulement requirement by prohibiting the removal of a person to any country \nwhere “it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2); \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242(b), 112 \nStat. 2681, 2681-82.   \nOnly an immigration judge (“IJ”)—not an asylum officer—can make the ultimate \ndecision of whether these obligations prohibit an individual’s removal to a given country.  Id. \n§ 1208.16(a), (c)(4).  If a person establishes withholding or CAT eligibility, the IJ must grant \nprotection.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. at 420.  Both forms of protection \nprohibit removal not just to the person’s home country, but to any proposed country of removal \nas to which the required showing is made.  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)-(c).   \nII.  Regular and Expedited Removal Proceedings. \nRemoval proceedings before an IJ under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a are the default mechanism for \ndetermining whether individuals may be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(“INA”).  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3).  In removal proceedings, an individual is entitled to a full \nhearing before an IJ, with time to gather and present evidence and the right to be represented by \ncounsel and cross-examine witnesses.  Id. § 1229a(b)(4).  And if the IJ denies asylum, \nwithholding, or CAT relief, the individual can appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and \nthen to the relevant federal court of appeals.  Id. §§ 1101(a)(47)(B), 1129(c)(5), 1252(a)(1). \nThe primary alternative removal procedure specified in the INA is expedited removal \nproceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  Congress created expedited removal in 1996.  See \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 17 of 58\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208 \nDiv. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (Sept. 30, 1996).  Expedited removal currently applies to certain \nindividuals arriving at ports of entry or who recently entered the country without inspection and \nare apprehended near the border.  See Make the Road N.Y. v. McAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1 \n(D.D.C. 2019), appeal pending, No. 19-5298 (D.C. Cir., filed Oct. 31, 2019). \nCongress crafted protections in these proceedings to avoid erroneously deporting asylum \nseekers to danger.  DHS must ask all persons in expedited removal if they fear being removed.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(i); DHSIFR752, 835.  Only those who do not express fear can be \nremoved “without further hearing or review.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Those who \nexpress fear “shall” receive an interview with an asylum officer, id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), to \ndetermine if they have a “credible fear of persecution,” id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  They cannot be \nremoved without first receiving this credible fear interview.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B). \nCongress also did not require individuals to establish their ultimate entitlement to \nprotection during the credible fear interview.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii), (v).  Instead, they need \nonly show “a significant possibility” of later meeting the ultimate standard for relief in a full \nremoval hearing.  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).  Because asylum requires a showing of a one in ten \nchance of persecution, a “significant possibility” of asylum eligibility is just a fraction of that.  \nCongress designed this “low screening standard,” 142 Cong. Rec. S11491-02 (daily ed. Sept. 27, \n1996) (statement of Sen. Hatch, a principal sponsor), such that “there should be no danger that an \nalien with a genuine asylum claim” would be summarily removed to persecution.  H.R. Rep. No. \n104-469, pt. 1, at 158 (1996); see also 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, 10,320 (Mar. 6, 1997) \n(acknowledging that “[t]he credible fear standard sets forth a low threshold of proof of potential \nentitlement to asylum”).  The low standard recognizes that the credible fear interview usually \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 18 of 58\noccurs within days of an often-traumatized asylum seeker’s arrival.  The person has “ordinarily \nbeen detained since his or her arrival in the United States and is therefore likely to be more \nunprepared, more vulnerable, and more wary of government officials.”   Zhang v. Holder, 585 \nF.3d 715, 724 (2d Cir. 2009).   Individuals who satisfy the credible fear screening threshold are \nplaced in regular removal proceedings before an IJ.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii); § 8 C.F.R. \n208.30(f). \nThe credible fear process has other important protections.  For example, the interviews \nare “nonadversarial” and asylum officers must affirmatively “elicit all relevant and useful \ninformation” bearing on the individual’s eligibility for relief.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d).  Individuals \nalso have the right to consult with counsel and have counsel present at the interview.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4); 65 Fed. Reg. 76,121, 76,129 (Dec. 6, 2000).  \nFollowing the interview, “if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of \npersecution,” the individual is entitled to “prompt review by an immigration judge of [that] \ndetermination.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I), (III). \nIII.  The Safe Third Country Provision. \nThe safe third country provision states that a person may be denied the right to apply for \nasylum if “the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a \ncountry,” other than the person’s country of origin, where (1) “the alien’s life or freedom would \nnot be threatened on account of [a protected ground]”; and (2) “the alien would have access to a \nfull and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection”; \nunless (3) “the Attorney General finds that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive \nasylum in the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A).  Congress enacted the safe third country \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 19 of 58\nprovision in 1996 in reponse to Canada’s longstanding desire to negotiate such an agreement.3  \nAs with the credible fear safeguards in the same 1996 legislation, Congress sought to “ensur[e] \nthat no alien will be returned to persecution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 175 (1996).   \nFollowing the enactment of the safe third country provision, and after extensive \nnegotiations, the United States entered into an agreement with Canada, a safe, stable nation with \na world-renowned asylum system.  See Declaration of Alondra Martinez (“Martinez Decl.”), Ex. \n1 (United States-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, Dec. 5, 2002 (“Canada Agreement”)).  \nThe Canada Agreement is narrow.  It prevents asylum seekers from accessing the U.S. asylum \nsystem at ports of entry on the Canadian border (unless they have family members in the United \nStates), by allowing DHS to transfer them back to Canada to seek asylum.  Id., art. 4.  It works in \nthe opposite direction as well.  Id.  The agreement also provided that the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR”) would monitor its implementation.  Id., art. 8(3). \nDHS and DOJ began applying the Canada Agreement after issuing regulations through \nnotice-and-comment procedures.  DHSFF714-23 (final rules); DHSFF907-14 (proposed rules).  \nThat rulemaking “specifically recognize[d] that Canada offers a generous system of refugee \nprotection, and has a tradition of assisting refugees and displaced persons abroad.”  DHSFF714.   \nIV.  Northern Triangle Agreements and the Interim Final Rule. \nA.  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador “Asylum Cooperative Agreements.” \nAfter more than 16 years with no additional safe third country agreements, last summer \nthe government signed “asylum cooperative agreements” (“ACAs”) with Guatemala, Honduras, \nand El Salvador, DOJIFR79-95.  Only the Guatemala ACA has been put into effect.  Unlike the \n                                                           \n3 U.S. & Canada Safe Third Country Agreement: Hearing Before the H. Subcomm. on \nImmigration, 107th Cong., at 16 (Oct. 16, 2002) (“2002 Cong. Hearing”) (statement of Kelly \nRyan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State), available at https://tinyurl.com/tvhm55y. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 20 of 58\nCanada Agreement, it is not reciprocal, applies to individuals whether or not they arrive at ports \nof entry, has no exceptions for family reunification, and does not provide for UNHCR review of \nits implementation.  Id. at 92-94.  \nMost critically, Guatemala, like Honduras and El Salvador, lacks a functioning asylum \nsystem and is a dangerous and impoverished country that cannot provide safety to its own \ncitizens, much less asylum seekers from elsewhere.  Indeed, the three countries produce the \nmajority of refugees seeking safety in the U.S.  Id. at 54-60; DHSIFR803; DHSFF682, 1233. \nB.  Interim Final Rule and USCIS Guidance. \nOn November 19, 2019, without notice and comment, DHS and DOJ jointly issued the \nInterim Final Rule (the “Rule”) that creates a procedural framework for removals under the three \nnew ACAs and any future agreements.  84 Fed. Reg. 63,994 (Nov. 19, 2019); USCIS387-402.  \nThe Rule, which went into effect immediately, denies individuals subject to an ACA the \nopportunity to apply for asylum, withholding, and CAT protection in the United States.  Id. at \n64,000.  Its stated purpose is to “distribut[e] hundreds of thousands of asylum claims” to other \ncountries.  Id. at 63,994.  \nThe Rule applies to asylum seekers in regular and expedited removal proceedings.  Id. at \n63,998.  For regular removal, the Rule amends the regulations to authorize IJs to order \nindividuals removed to any applicable ACA country before hearing their claim for asylum, \nwithholding, and CAT protection as to their home country.  Id. at 64,010-11.  If the individual \nfears harm in the proposed ACA country of removal (e.g., Guatemala), the Rule provides that the \nIJ should determine whether it is more likely than not that the person would be persecuted or \ntortured in that country.  Id.  That is, individuals must prove entitlement to withholding or CAT \nprotection as to Guatemala just to have the chance to apply for asylum in the United States.  Id.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 21 of 58\nMoreover, once other ACAs are effective, individuals will have to satisfy the more-likely-than-\nnot standard as to every possible ACA country.  Id.  Although the safe third country provision \ngrants IJs authority to apply a broad “public interest” exception, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), \nthe Rule asserts that IJs may do so only with the permission of DHS.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,010-11.    \nFor expedited removal proceedings, the Rule entirely bypasses the credible fear process.  \nUnder the Rule, asylum seekers subjected to expedited removal who express fear of removal to \ntheir home countries do not automatically get the credible fear interview Congress guaranteed \nthem.  Id. at 64,008-09.  Instead, they receive only written notice that they may be removed to a \nthird country.  Id. at 64,009.  The Rule does not require asylum officers to ask asylum seekers \nwhether they fear removal to the ACA receiving country.  Id. at 63,998.  If an individual does not \naffirmatively express such a fear, they are summarily removed there with no assessment of \nwhether they are at risk of persecution or torture.  Id.   \nEven those who do express fear of removal to the the ACA country do not get a credible \nfear interview.  Rather, asylum officers assess their risk of persecution or torture in the ACA \ncountry in what the Rule calls “threshold screening interviews.”  Id. at 64,008.  But these are not \n“screenings” at all.  Instead, individuals must meet the ultimate withholding or CAT standard: \nthat they are more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured in the ACA country.  Id. at 64,009.  \nThis is far higher than even the one-in-ten chance of persecution required for an ultimate grant of \nasylum.  They must meet this high burden for every ACA country to which they might be \nremoved, and the Rule forbids them from being represented by counsel as they attempt to do so.  \nId. at 64,003, 64,009.  Only those who make this showing get credible fear interviews.  And the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 22 of 58\nasylum officer’s determination that an individual is barred from asylum and may be removed to a \nthird country under an ACA is final—the Rule prohibits IJ review.  Id. at 64,004.4 \nC.  USCIS Guidance.  \nOn November 19, 2019 and January 4, 2020, USCIS issued written guidance (the \n“Guidance”) to asylum officers regarding the Guatemala ACA.  USCIS278-312, 348-80; see also \nid. at 313-19.  The Guidance states that Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) makes the \ninitial determination of whether individuals who express fear of removal to their home countries \nfall under an ACA.  Id. at 283, 353.  Under the Guidance, the Guatemala ACA currently can be \napplied to a national of Honduras or El Salvador who has not been convicted of a felony in the \nUnited States or any crime in Guatemala, but the amenable nationalities are subject to change at \nany time.  Id. at 287; see also id. at 380-81.  CBP is to give those selected for ACA removal \n“Tear Sheets” stating that they may be removed to Guatemala and will be referred to an asylum \nofficer for an interview.  Id. at 283-85, 353-55, 374; see also id. at 1 (tear sheet).   \nThe Guidance reiterates that an “[i]ndividual is not entitled to a consultant”—i.e., to \ncounsel—in an ACA interview.  Id. at 282, 352.  It specifically instructs asylum officers “not to \nactively probe or question whether an asylum seeker has a fear of removal to Guatemala.”  Id. at \n363, 374.  The Guidance also provides that, for “threshold screening interviews,” showing past \npersecution in Guatemala does not create a presumption of future persecution there, but is \ninstead only “strong evidence” of the likelihood of future persecution.  Id. at 295, 366. \n  \n                                                           \n4 The Canada Agreement regulations also bypass the credible fear process, and do not provide \nfor any individualized non-refoulement assessment.  Instead, the screening only concerns \nexceptions to that agreement, such as that for family unity.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(6)(iii).  Those \nprocedures are not at issue here and, of course, Canada does not present the type of dangers \npresented by the current ACA countries. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 23 of 58\nD.  The Categorical Designations and Guatemala ACA Implementation.  \nOn October 16 and November 7, 2019, DHS and DOJ, respectively, issued categorical \ndesignations that Guatemala meets the safe third country provision’s requirements (the \n“Designations”).  DHSFF1282-83; DOJFF6-7.  The government began removing adult Honduran \nand Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala on November 21, 2019.  DOJFF112; USCIS287, \n331-33.  On December 10, the program expanded to include parents with children, USCIS375, \nand is currently operational in at least two Border Patrol sectors.      \nV.  Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador Are Unsafe for Asylum Seekers and Lack \nFunctioning Asylum Systems. \n \nAccording to the agencies’ own administrative record, “[a] surging tide of violence \nsweeping” the Northern Triangle in recent years “has forced thousands of women, men, and \nchildren to leave their homes every month,” fleeing “murder, extortion, and rape.”  DHSFF682.  \nThe three countries “have among the world’s highest murder rates.”  DHSIFR738.  The State \nDepartment specifically warned that “Guatemala remains among the most dangerous countries in \nthe world,” with a “high murder rate . . . driven by narco-trafficking activity, gang-related \nviolence, a heavily armed population, and police/judicial system unable to hold many criminals \naccountable.”  DHSFF1233.  Women in all three countries “face a startling degree of violence \nthat has a devastating impact on their daily lives,” with “increasing violence from criminal armed \ngroups [often] occur[ing] alongside repeated physical and sexual violence at home.”  Id. at 682.  \nUnchecked anti-LGBT violence is also widespread.  USCIS21-25; DHSFF616, 695.   \nMaterials DHS provided to asylum officers explain that Honduran and Salvadoran \nmigrants transiting Guatemala suffer “abuses and mistreatment by [police]” and “extortion, theft, \nand assault by migrat[ion] authorities.”  USCIS11; see also DHSFF112, 548, 683.  Moreover, the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 24 of 58\nthree countries are parties to a free-movement pact that allows the region’s gangs and other \npersecutors to easily pursue their victims across borders.  USCIS19, 26; DHSFF1255, 1260.  \nThe record also reflects that none of the three countries has a functioning asylum system.  \nGuatemala’s system has only seven dedicated employees, and just three or four who interview \napplicants.  DHSFF1231, 1253.  It can process just 100 to 150 claims per year and already has a \nbacklog of over 400 cases.  DHSFF1231.  The relevant Honduran agency has only twelve \nemployees, just three of whom adjudicate claims.  DHSFF1254.  El Salvador’s asylum agency \nhas no budget and no staff.  Id.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n  “[W]hen ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court may grant summary \njudgment only if one of the moving parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on material \nfacts that are not genuinely disputed.”  Spirit of Sage Council v. Norton, 294 F. Supp. 2d 67, 81 \n(D.D.C. 2003), vacated in part as moot, 411 F.3d 225 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  In APA cases, the Court \n“review[s] the administrative record directly to determine whether the agency has complied with \nthe APA.”  Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Troy Corp. v. Browner, 120 F.3d 277, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  \n To obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff must show (1) irreparable injury; \n(2) remedies available at law are inadequate; (3) the balance of hardships favor the plaintiff; and \n(4) “that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  Sierra Club v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Agric., 841 F. Supp. 2d 349, 356 (D.D.C. 2012) (citation omitted).  \nJURISDICTION \n  The Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and also has \njurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Section 1252(e)(3) confers jurisdiction on this Court to \ndetermine whether a “regulation issued to implement [the expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 25 of 58\n§ 1225(b)]” is unconstitutional, “[in]consistent with the applicable provisions of this \nsubchapter,” or “otherwise in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  The policies challenged \nhere purport to implement expedited removal.  Plaintiffs brought their challenge within sixty \ndays of the implementation of those policies.  See id. § 1252(e)(3)(B).   \nPlaintiffs have standing.  The Individual Plaintiffs, six adults and children, sought asylum \nin the United States after fleeing Honduras and El Salvador, where they suffered threats, \nbeatings, and other grave harms.  See SUF ¶¶ 126-36.5  They were all removed to Guatemala \nunder the Rule, Guidance, and Designations.

Las Americas \nnormally devotes 35 percent of its work to representing asylum seekers in expedited removal.  \nSUF ¶ 156.  The Rule impedes Las Americas’ ability to serve these individuals by precluding \nthem from credible fear interviews and preventing representation by counsel at ACA “threshold \nscreening interviews.”  Id. ¶ 160.

Defendants’ policies also jeopardize Las Americas’ funding tied to \nrepresenting individuals in credible fear interviews and in regular removal proceedings—which \nthose removed under the Rule never reach.

Roughly 40 percent of Tahirih’s clients come from Honduras and El \nSalvador.  Defendants’ policies will prevent Tahirih from serving asylum seekers from those \ncountries who are removed under the Rule in expedited removal before they can have their \nclaims assessed.  Id. ¶¶ 148-50.  Those who are not summarily removed face heavier burdens in \nregular removal proceedings, which will strain Tahirih’s resources.  Id. ¶ 151.  As with Las \nAmericas, Defendants’ policies also threaten Tahirih’s per-case funding.  Id. ¶ 152.  Moreover, \nalthough Tahirh submitted comments on the Rule after it issued, the agencies’ failure to follow \nnotice and comment procedures deprived Tahirih of the opportunity to do so before the Rule \ntook effect.  Id.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Rule, Guidance, and Designations are Unlawful. \nA.  The Rule and Guidance Violate the INA. \nCongress wove critical procedural protections into the INA at every turn, to ensure that \nasylum seekers are not erroneously removed to persecution or torture.  The Rule bypasses three \nsets of essential guardrails: the detailed credible fear procedures Congress mandated for all \nasylum seekers placed in expedited removal; the multiple layers of substantive protections \ninscribed in the safe third country provision itself; and the ultimate backstops against \nrefoulement codified in the withholding and CAT statutes.  The Rule replaces them with an \nextra-statutory scheme that places asylum seekers at an unacceptably high risk of removal to \ndanger. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 27 of 58\n1.  The Rule Violates the Credible Fear Statute. \n \nFirst, the Rule contravenes the INA’s requirement that asylum seekers in expedited \nremoval can be removed only through the credible fear process.  Only procedures “specified in” \nthe INA itself may supplant regular removal proceedings.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3) (“Unless \notherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding” before an IJ “shall be the sole and exclusive \nprocedure for determining” inadmissibility and removability) (emphasis added).  Expedited \nremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) is such an exception—and that statute’s credible fear \nprocedures must be complied with when an asylum seeker is in expedited removal proceedings.  \nBy statute, if a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings indicates “either an intention \nto apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution,” an officer “shall refer the alien for an interview \nby an asylum officer under [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)] subparagraph (B).”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).  The only interview under § 1225(b)(1)(B) is that to \ndetermine whether a noncitizen “has a credible fear of persecution.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).  \nThe credible fear provisions mandate application of the low “significant possibility . . . \n[of] eligibility” standard, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), and guarantee rights to consultation, id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iv), and IJ review, id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III).  The regulations confirm these \nrights and require asylum officers “to elicit all relevant and useful information” in determining \nwhether an asylum seeker can demonstrate credible fear.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d), (d)(4) (emphasis \nadded); see 65 Fed. Reg. at 76,129.  Asylum seekers are entitled to “prompt review by an \nimmigration judge” of adverse credible fear determinations.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III).  \nThe INA admits of no exception to these requirements.  If the government applies the \nsafe third country provision in expedited removal, it must follow credible fear procedures. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 28 of 58\nYet the Rule diverts asylum seekers from the credible fear process into an extra-statutory \n“threshold screening interview.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,008.  Asylum seekers routed into this \nmisleadingly-named “screening” are generally removed without ever receiving credible fear \ninterviews: these individuals receive credible fear interviews only if they affirmatively express \nfear of removal to every applicable ACA country—and then also demonstrate that they are more \nlikely than not to be persecuted or tortured in each of them.  Id. at 63,998, 64,009.6  Only if they \nmeet this heavy burden will the asylum officer “proceed to a credible fear interview.”  Id. at \n64,009.  The Rule’s “threshold screening interview” procedure thus conflicts with the credible \nfear statute, which dictates that DHS “shall refer” every asylum seeker in expedited removal \nproceedings for a credible fear interview applying the low credible fear screening standard, not \nthe ultimate standard for obtaining protection.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).  \nThe Rule also unlawfully dispenses with other critical procedural protections set out in \n§ 1225(b)(1) and its implementing regulations, such as representation by counsel and IJ review.  \nDefendants cannot forgo these requirements just by changing the label on their interview \nprocedures.  Accordingly, the Rule violates the INA.   \n2.  The Rule and Guidance Violate the Safe Third Country Provision. \n  In crafting the carefully-qualified limitations on asylum access in 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), \nwhich includes the “safe third country” provision, Congress sought to “ensur[e] that no alien will \nbe returned to persecution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 175 (1996).  The statute therefore \npermits third-country removal only if the receiving country is “safe” and has a “full and fair” \nasylum process, and the asylum seeker would not face persecution or torture on account of a \n                                                           \n6 Each ACA excludes unaccompanied children and individuals who arrive in the United States \nwith valid visas or do not need visas to enter.  See DOJIFR81, 87-88, 93.  However, these groups \nare already not subject to expedited removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b)(1), \n1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7), 1232(a)(5)(D); see also id. § 1158(a)(2)(E). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 29 of 58\nprotected ground in the receiving country.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A).  Congress also provided a \ndiscretionary exception for cases where “it is in the public interest” for the individual to receive \nasylum here.  Id.  The statute thus contains three essential requirements that apply whether an \nindividual is in regular or expedited removal proceedings: the government must (1) assess an \nasylum seeker’s risk of persecution in the third country every case, with the government bearing \nthe burden of proof; (2) find the individual will have full and fair access to asylum in a safe \nreceiving country; and (3) even if the first two requirements are met, assess whether the public \ninterest should permit the individual to apply for asylum in the United States.  See id.  \nDefendants’ policies conflict with all three requirements.  \nFirst, the Rule and Guidance contravene the statute by failing to ensure that all \nindividuals will be free from persecution upon removal and, instead, assessing that danger only \nwhen “the alien affirmatively states a fear of removal to [the third] country.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n63,998; accord USCIS363, 374 (“[T]he [asylum officer] should not actively probe or question \nwhether the individual has a fear of removal to Guatemala.”).  This means that asylum seekers \nwho do not affirmatively inform the asylum officer of a fear are subject to removal without any \ndetermination concerning risk of persecution.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,002.  The Rule and \nGuidance therefore compel removals that the statute expressly forbids.  “When a statute requires \nan agency to make a finding as a prerequisite to action,” acting without making that finding \n“violate[s] the statute.”   Gerber v. Norton, 294 F.3d 173, 185-86 (D.C. Cir. 2002).   \nThe Rule further contravenes this first statutory requirement by erroneously placing the \nburden of proof on the asylum seeker “to demonstrate it is more likely than not that he or she \nwould be subject to persecution . . . or to torture in [the receiving] country.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n63,998.  The Rule reasons that this burden of proof applies because the safe third country \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 30 of 58\nprovision “mirrors the standard for protection contained in the INA’s withholding-of-removal \nprovision.”  Id. at 63,999.  That is incorrect.  The withholding statute requires applicants to prove \nthat their “life or freedom would be threatened.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  \nConversely, the safe third country provision requires the agency to assure that “the alien’s life or \nfreedom would not be threatened.”  Id. § 1158(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  This language \nactually tracks the text of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(2)(C), which permits termination of asylum status \nwhen “the Attorney General determines,” inter alia, that an asylee “may be removed . . . to a \n[third] country . . . in which the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened.”  Id. \n§ 1158(c)(2)(C) (emphasis added).  Whereas the applicant bears the burden to secure \nwithholding, the government bears the burden to terminate asylum.  8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f); \nNtangsi v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 1007, 1012 (8th Cir. 2007).  The Rule impermissibly “give[s] the \nsame statutory text different meanings” in sections 1158(a)(2)(A) and 1158(c)(2)(C).  See Clark \nv. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005). \nSecond, the Rule and Guidance fail to provide any opportunity for an individual to \ncontest whether she would have access to full and fair asylum procedures in the receiving \ncountry—regardless of whether others might.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A) (requiring \ndetermination of whether “the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure”) (emphasis \nadded).  While an “agency may rely on its rulemaking authority to determine issues that do not \nrequire case-by-case consideration,” it equally must permit individualized consideration of issues \nthat require it.  Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458, 467 (1983).  The overall safety of another \ncountry and the functioning of its asylum system may well be the “type of general factual issue \n[that] may be resolved . . . fairly through rulemaking.”  See id. at 468.  But some individuals may \nbe unsafe or otherwise lack effective access to protection due to their particular circumstances, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 31 of 58\nsuch as their sexual orientation.  See, e.g., SUF ¶¶ 126, 142.  The statute requires the agencies to \npermit individuals to raise such concerns, and to address them when raised.  Because neither the \nRule nor the Guidance permit such individualized consideration of barriers to accessing asylum, \nthey violate the statute. \nThird, the Rule violates the plain text of the safe third country provision by barring IJs in \nregular removal proceedings from applying the public interest exception, and instead \n“reserv[ing]” that discretion solely to DHS attorneys.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,010-11.  The \nagencies acknowledge that IJs, exercising authority delegated by the Attorney General, can \nadjudicate other elements of a safe third country determination in regular removal proceedings.  \nSee id.  Nothing in the safe third country provision’s text or structure offers any basis for the \nagencies’ assertion that it somehow “reserves to [DHS]” authority to apply the exception.  Id. at \n64,010.  To do so would again “give the same statutory text different meanings,” Clark, 543 U.S. \nat 386, by reading “the Attorney General” in two conflicting ways in the same sentence: first (“if \nthe Attorney General determines”) as authorizing both DOJ IJs and DHS asylum officers to \nassess risk of persecution and torture; but then (“unless the Attorney General finds that it is in the \npublic interest”) as applying only to DHS.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A); see also id. \n§ 1103(a)(1) (charging DHS with administering and enforcing the INA “except insofar as [the \nstatute] relate[s] to the powers, functions, and duties conferred upon the . . . Attorney General”) \n(emphasis added); id. § 1103(g)(1) (confirming Attorney General’s continuing “authorities and \nfunctions” over matters previously adjudicated in immigration court).  Repeated legislative \nefforts to amend the statute to actually reserve to DHS the authority to apply the exception \nconfirms that it does not now do so.  See H.R. 1153, 114th Cong. § 12 (2015); H.R. 391, 115th \nCong. § 12 (2017). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 32 of 58\n3.  The Rule and Guidance Violate the Withholding and CAT Statutes. \nEven if not already bound to follow the credible fear procedures and the requirements of \nsafe third country provision itself, the agencies would still be required, at a minimum, to comply \nwith the withholding and CAT statutes.  These statutes codify “general anti-refoulement \nprovision[s]” that “are not limited to instances in which an alien has had a full removal hearing,” \nsee Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, --- F.3d ----, 2020 WL 964402, at *14 (9th Cir. Feb. 28, 2020), \nand thus provide the minimum requirements for ACA removals as well.  \nThe Rule and Guidance contravene these statutes by failing to provide sufficient \nprotection against refoulement.  Most significantly, the Rule permits asylum seekers to be \nremoved to an ACA country without asylum officers ever asking individuals whether they fear \nremoval to that country.  84 Fed. Reg. at 63,998; USCIS363, 374.  However, requiring “aliens, \nunprompted and untutored in the law of refoulement, [to] volunteer that they fear” removal to a \nthird country fails to “satisf[y] our anti-refoulement obligations.”  Innovation Law, 2020 WL \n964402, at *15.  Moreover, the Rule applies the ultimate more-likely-than-not standard of proof \nfor withholding and CAT, rather than a true screening standard, and yet bypasses the critical \nsafeguards required whenever that ultimate standard is applied.  See infra at 22-26.  These \nthreadbare procedures fail to provide sufficient protection against refoulement.    \nB.  The Expedited Removal Procedures in the Rule and Guidance Are Arbitrary \nand Capricious Under the APA. \nThe expedited removal procedures in the Rule and Guidance are also arbitrary and \ncapricious under the APA, for two reasons.  First, the agencies failed to acknowledge or explain \ntheir numerous departures from the safeguards deemed essential in all prior interview procedures \nassessing whether individuals may face persecution or torture.  Second, the agencies failed to \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 33 of 58\nconsider the obvious danger that stripping away those safeguards will result in erroneous \nremovals, in violation of the United States’ non-refoulement obligations.  \n1.  Failure to Explain Departures from Prior Practices. \nThe agencies failed to acknowledge or explain the elimination of six key safeguards \nintended to ensure compliance with non-refoulement obligations.  “[T]he requirement that an \nagency provide reasoned explanation for its action . . . demand[s] that it display awareness that it \nis changing position.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  An \nagency cannot “depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on \nthe books.”  Id.  The Rule and Guidance repeatedly violate these prohibitions. \n(i) Failure to Ask About Fear of Removal.  In credible fear interviews, asylum officers \nmust “elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible \nfear of persecution or torture.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d).  The Rule eliminates this mandate and \ninstead provides that, if the noncitizen “does not affirmatively state a fear of persecution or \ntorture” in the third country, the interview ends and the individual is “subject to removal.”  84 \nFed. Reg. at 64,002.  The agencies do not explain this change.   \n(ii) Failure to Apply a True Screening Standard.  Normally, asylum seekers in expedited \nremoval proceedings need only demonstrate a “significant possibility” that they could win \nprotection to proceed to a full hearing before an IJ.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v); 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.30(e)(3); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c), (e); 84 Fed. Reg. 8478, 8485 (Feb. 19, 1999).  \nNever before have the agencies required individuals seeking protection from removal to satisfy \nthe ultimate withholding or CAT standards in summary asylum officer interviews.  This \nfundamental change is unexplained. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 34 of 58\nThe agencies invoke the more-likely-than-not standard because that is what “applies in \nthe withholding-of-removal context.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 63,999.  But they do not explain why they \nadopted the ultimate standard IJs apply in adjudicating withholding and CAT claims in regular \nremoval proceedings, with a full hearing and judicial review, rather than a low screening \nstandard, as in every other expedited removal context.   \nThe agencies irrationally attempt to distinguish the withholding and CAT assessments \nmade pursuant to the Rule on the basis that they involve removals to third countries, rather than \nto asylum seekers’ home countries.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,001.  The agencies suggest that applying \nthe ultimate standard is justified because asylum seekers will “not necessarily have preexisting \nties or any preexisting reason to fear persecution or torture” in an ACA country.  Id. at 64,001-\n02.  But this is a non sequitur: for those who do have reason to fear harm, the withholding and \nCAT analyses are just as complex.  And the Rule only affords fear assessments to those who \n“affirmatively state[] a fear of removal to the [ACA] country.”  Id. at 64,002 (emphasis added).  \nMoreover, the agency’s own record shows that many Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers \ndo have reasons to fear harm in Guatemala.  See, e.g., USCIS19 (collecting evidence of “gang \nmembers moving among the Northern Triangle countries”); id. at 22 (“Central American \nmigrants [in Guatemala suffer] abuses and mistreatment by [police]” and “extortion, theft, and \nassault by migrat[ion] authorities”); id. at 26 (“LGBTI asylum-seekers from Honduras [and] El \nSalvador” do not request asylum in Guatemala due to “the high levels of violence and \ndiscrimination against LGBTI people” there).  See also Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Fed. Highway \nAdmin., 956 F.2d 309, 314 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (agency action resting on unsupported premise is \narbitrary and capricious).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 35 of 58\n(iii) Asylum Officer Adjudication of the Ultimate Merits of Fear Claims.  Relatedly, the \nagencies do not explain how to square the Rule’s requirement that asylum officers decide the \nultimate merits of withholding and CAT claims with longstanding regulations forbidding just \nthat.  Withholding regulations state that “[a]n asylum officer shall not decide whether . . . the \nremoval of an alien to a country where the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened must be \nwithheld.”  8 C.F.R. § 208.16(a) (emphasis added).   The CAT regulations similarly provide that \nan “immigration judge . . . shall” determine CAT eligibility.  8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(4) (emphasis \nadded).  These requirements are critical because withholding and CAT protection are the final \nbackstops against refoulement, where the consequences of error are matters of life and death.    \nThe agencies may not “simply disregard rules that are still on the books.”  Fox \nTelevision, 556 U.S. at 515.  Yet, the agencies never even acknowledge these conflicting \nregulations, much less explain why they should be disregarded here.    \n(iv) Eliminating the Presumption Established by Past Persecution.  In the withholding \ncontext—which the agencies describe as mirroring the safe third country provision—a showing \nof past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.  See 8 C.F.R. \n§§ 208.16(b)(1)(i).  Yet the Guidance directs that past persecution in Guatemala does not \nestablish a presumption of future persecution there.  USCIS295, 366.  Here too, there is no \nexplanation for this departure, which makes it far more difficult for even asylum seekers from \nother countries who have been harmed in Guatemala to meet the heightened “screening” burden.    \n(v) Prohibition of Counsel.  Next, the agencies fail to acknowledge or explain their \ndeparture from existing interview procedures affording access to counsel.  In a credible fear \ninterview, the asylum seeker may consult with counsel, and counsel may attend the interview.  8 \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 36 of 58\nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4); 65 Fed. Reg. at 76,129; see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c)(4).  The Rule and \nGuidance eliminate these rights to counsel.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,003; USCIS282, 374. \nInstead of acknowledging this departure from other fear screenings, the Rule cites the \nregulations concerning the Canada Agreement—which permit consultation with counsel—as the \nrelevant baseline.  The agencies say that such consultation is unnecessary here because the ACAs \n“incorporate fewer and less complex exceptions” than the Canada Agreement’s family unity \nexemptions.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,003 & n.11; see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(6)(iii)(B)-(C).  But \nthat explanation is based on a false premise.  The Rule’s fear screening—not included in the \nCanada procedures—is unquestionably more complex than whether an asylum seeker’s uncle is a \nU.S. lawful permanent resident.  See, e.g., Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 255 & n.4 (4th \nCir. 2019) (describing “both the ‘future likely mistreatment’ and ‘acquiescence’ prongs of the \nCAT inquiry” as “fact-intensive”); Zhang v. Gonzales, 426 F.3d 540, 548 (2d Cir. 2005) \n(assessing persecutor’s motive is “a complex and contextual factual inquiry”).7 \n(vi) Elimination of IJ Review.  Finally, in all other summary removal contexts designed \nto comply with non-refoulement obligations, asylum officers’ negative fear screening \ndeterminations are subject to IJ review.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g) (credible fear screenings); id. \n§ 208.31(g) (reasonable fear screenings).  The Rule prohibits such review without \nacknowledgment or explanation.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,003-04. \nInstead, the agencies again point to the Canada regulations and irrationally attempt to \ndistinguish DOJ’s conclusion in that context that IJ review would be required here.  Id. at 64,004.  \nDOJ reasoned that IJ review was unnecessary for the Canada procedures because asylum officers \n                                                           \n7 The Canada regulations also provide a right to counsel during the screening interview itself.  8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4), (e)(6).   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 37 of 58\nwould not be evaluating “the merits of . . . asylum claims” or other issues “call[ing] for the kind \nof expert judgment exercised by immigration judges in conducting credible fear reviews.”  69 \nFed. Reg. 10,627, 10,630 (Mar. 8, 2004).8  Under the present Rule, by contrast, “an asylum \nofficer does need to determine whether the alien would more likely than not be persecuted or \ntortured.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,004 (emphasis added).  The agencies then claim that assessing the \nmotives behind past persecution “in the asylum seeker’s home country” is “complex,” but that \n“evaluating whether an asylum seeker would face [future] persecution or torture in a [third] \ncountry . . . is more straightforward.”  Id.  They provide no explanation for this conclusory and \nbaseless assertion.  See, e.g., Alvarez Lagos, 927 F.3d at 255 & n.4 (noting fact-intensive nature \nof CAT determinations); Zhang, 426 F.3d at 548.   \n2.  The Agencies Failed to Consider the Grave Risks of Stripping Away \nSafeguards Designed to Prevent Refoulement. \n \nThe agencies also “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983), \nbecause they did not “adequately analyze the . . . consequences” of their actions on asylum \nseekers, Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 932 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  To \nmake a reasoned decision that passes muster under the APA, the agency must “analyze the \nimpact” of policy change on affected individuals.  Nat’l Lifeline Ass’n v. Fed. Commc’ns \nComm’n, 921 F.3d 1102, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Removing asylum seekers is “replete with \ndanger.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 449.  Consequently, one of Congress’s explicit goals in \n                                                           \n8 As noted above, the Canada screening procedure contains no individualized non-refoulement \nassessment, and only concerns exceptions to that agreement, such as that for family unity.  8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(e)(6)(iii).   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 38 of 58\ncrafting the safe third country provision was to “ensur[e] that no alien will be returned to \npersecution.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 175 (1996).   \nThe agencies were therefore “required to grapple with the lapse in legal safeguards that \n[their] reversal of policy triggered.”  Mozilla Corp. v. FCC, 940 F.3d 1, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2019); \nGresham v. Azar, No. 19-5094, --- F.3d ----, 2020 WL 741278, at *6-7 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 14, 2020) \n(finding that “[f]ailure to consider whether [a] project will result in [Medicaid] coverage loss is \narbitrary and capricious,” as coverage is a “principal objective of Medicaid”); Nat’l Lifeline \nAss’n, 921 F.3d at 1111 (holding arbitrary and capricious agency rule that “fail[ed] to consider \nthe impact of the change on the [policy’s] ‘primary purpose’ or otherwise explain how it is \ncompatible with that purpose”).  But the Rule does not address the obvious risks of refoulement \nin a process stripped of the safeguards used in other summary removal contexts, or weigh those \nrisks against the Rule’s supposed benefits.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,001-04.    \nThis failure is made more egregious by the extreme dangers and threadbare asylum \nsystems in the current ACA countries.  The agencies’ own record shows that the three countries \nhave among the world’s highest murder rates; are especially dangerous for women, children, \nLGBT individuals, and migrants; and lack asylum systems operating at any meaningful capacity.  \nDHSFF107, 437, 683, 1231, 1253-54.  All this evidence was in front of the agencies well before \nthey issued the Rule.  But they did not grapple with any of it in enacting a Rule intended to serve \nas the procedural framework for “hundreds of thousands” of eventual removals to these \ncountries—and potentially others just as dangerous and unprepared.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,995; \nsee also DHSFF598 (“Latin America and the Caribbean” is “one of the world’s most violent \nregions”).  The Rule is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 39 of 58\nC.  The Lack of Any Judicial Review of Expedited Removal Orders Issued Under \nthe Rule Violates the Suspension Clause.   \n \n “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in \nCases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”  U.S. Const. art. 1, § 9, cl. 2.  \nRemoval is a restraint on liberty that triggers habeas corpus.  Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 U.S. 651, 660 (1892) (“An alien immigrant, prevented from landing . . . , and thereby \nrestrained of his liberty, is doubtless entitled to a writ of habeas corpus to ascertain whether the \nrestraint is lawful.”).  “Because of [the Suspension] Clause, some ‘judicial intervention in \ndeportation cases’ is unquestionably ‘required by the Constitution.’”  INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. \n289, 300 (2001) (emphasis added) (quoting Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235 (1953)).   \nCases from the “finality era” between 1891 and 1952—during which Congress enacted a \nseries of statutes eliminating all judicial review of deportation—demonstrate that the Suspension \nClause guarantees judicial review of the legality of removal orders.  Thuraissigiam v. DHS, 917 \nF.3d 1097, 1109 & n.11, 1113-15 (9th Cir.), cert. granted, 140 S. Ct. 427 (2019).  These \nprovisions prevented judicial intervention “except insofar as it was required by the Constitution.”  \nHeikkila, 345 U.S. at 234-35.  But during this period, courts continued to exercise habeas review \nover removal orders.  Id. (collecting cases).  While the finality provisions eliminated judicial \nreview of factual determinations, the Supreme Court nonetheless reviewed legal challenges in \nhabeas.  See Nishimura Ekiu, 142 U.S. at 660.   \nMore recently, the Supreme Court has twice reaffirmed that the Suspension Clause \nrequires review of legal claims.  St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 301-02 (“at the absolute minimum, the \nSuspension Clause protects the writ ‘as it existed in 1789,’” including review of “erroneous \napplication or interpretation of statutes”); Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 779 (2008) (a \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 40 of 58\nperson must have “a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to ‘the \nerroneous application or interpretation’ of relevant law”) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 302). \nThe Rule does not permit judicial review of legal challenges to expedited removal orders \nto ACA countries.  Individuals who do not affirmatively express fear or fail to meet the ultimate \nwithholding or CAT standard are removed without further review.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009.  \nUnder the government’s interpretation of the INA, individuals may not seek judicial review of \nwhether an expedited removal order is lawful.  Thuraissigiam, 917 F.3d at 1103-04, 1119 \n(discussing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2)).  Critically, individuals cannot even obtain judicial review of \nwhether DHS complied with the Rule’s procedures.  This violates the Suspension Clause.    \nD.  The Guatemala Designations Are Unlawful. \n \nApart from the procedural mechanisms set forth in the Rule and Guidance, both DOJ and \nDHS issued categorical designations concluding that Guatemala meets the statutory requirements \nto be a safe third country.  DOJFF6-7; DHSFF1282-83.  Those designations violate the safe third \ncountry provision and run afoul of the APA’s demand for reasoned decisionmaking.  \nThe government may remove an asylum seeker to a third country only after \n“determin[ing] that . . . the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a \nclaim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.”  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A) (emphasis \nadded).  Courts invariably interpret constitutional or statutory provisions concerning “access” to \nprocedures or services to require meaningful and effective access.  E.g., Broudy v. Mather, 460 \nF.3d 106, 117 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (the “right of [access to the courts] not only protects the ability to \nget into court, but also ensures that such access be adequate, effective, and meaningful”) \n(internal quotations omitted); Am. Council of the Blind v. Mnuchin, 878 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 41 of 58\n2017) (Rehabilitation Act provision addressing access to federal benefits demands “meaningful \naccess”).   \nCongress’s concerns with “access to a full and fair [asylum] procedure” and (in the \nsection heading) “safe[ty]” establish two critical requirements for assessing any potential safe \nthird country.  See Merit Mgmt. Grp., LP v. FTI Consulting, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 883, 893 (2018) \n(section headings give “cues as to what Congress intended”) (internal quotation mark omitted); \nsee also Matter of B-R-, 26 I. & N. Dec. 119, 122 (BIA 2013) (explaining that “safe third country \nprovision[] . . . limit[s] an alien’s ability to claim asylum in the United States when other safe \noptions are available”) (emphasis added).  First, the country must have a functioning system that \naffords individuals meaningful and effective access to protection in practice.  Second, refugees \nmust be able to safely remain in the country while applying for asylum and after receiving it.   \nIndeed, the phrase “safe third country” is a term of art in international refugee law that \npredates the provision’s enactment.  See Martinez Decl., Ex. 2 (UNHCR, Position on \nReadmission Agreements, “Protection Elsewhere,” and Asylum Policy, Aug. 1, 1994 (“UNHCR, \nProtection Elsewhere”)).9  “When a statute uses a term of art from a specific field of law, [courts] \npresume that Congress adopted ‘the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in \nthe body of learning from which it was taken.’”  Comcast Cable Commc’ns, LLC v. FCC, 717 \nF.3d 982, 989 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (quoting FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. \n284, 292 (2012)).   \nWhen the safe third country provision was enacted—as now—international refugee law \nrequired any country considering transferring asylum seekers to a “safe third country” to take \n                                                           \n9 UNHCR “provides significant guidance in construing the [Refugee] Protocol, to which \nCongress sought to conform.”  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 439 n.22.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 42 of 58\n“all feasible steps . . . to make certain that protection will actually be provided” in the receiving \nstate.  UNHCR, Protection Elsewhere (emphasis added); see also Canada Agreement, pmbl. \n(acknowledging that parties “must ensure in practice” that asylum seekers are identified and \nindirect refoulment is avoided) (emphasis added).10  UNHCR has consistently interpreted the \nsafe third country concept to require the sending country to assess the receiving country’s \n“actual practice of implementation” of its asylum laws, and ensure that its “actual practice” \ncomplies with international law obligations.  DHSFF822-23 (emphases added).  Signing relevant \ntreaties and adopting procedures on paper is not enough.  Id. at 822-23, 883, 1262-63; see also \n84 Fed. Reg. at 64,000 & n.10 (citing these UNHCR guidance documents as setting forth \n“international refugee law principles”).11  UNHCR likewise instructs that “real risk to the life of \nthe person in the third State” is a “critical factor” in assessing whether a refugee will be able to \nreceive “effective protection” and “enjoy asylum.”  DHSFF883, 1263. \n1.  The Designations Violate the Safe Third Country Provision.  \n  \nThe Designations do not consider the actual operation of Guatemala’s asylum system or \nthe dangers that asylum seekers face there.  That failure violates the INA.  See Nat’l Lime Ass’n \n                                                           \n10 While negotiating the Canada Agreement, the State Department “consulted with UNHCR” \nbecause UNHCR “advise[s] the U.S. Government . . . in a supervisory capacity.”  2002 Cong. \nHearing, supra note 3, at 58 (testimony of Kelly Ryan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State). \n11 The agencies also assert that their actions align with the European Union’s transfer framework.  \n84 Fed. Reg. at 64,000.  But consistent with UNHCR’s guidance, the EU framework requires \nassessment of the actual functioning of the receiving country’s asylum system.  The one \nEuropean case in the administrative record notes that asylum seekers’ “transfer to Greece was \nprecluded by systemic flaws in [Greece’s] asylum procedure.”  DHSFF869.  Greece was held \nunable to satisfy its non-refoulement obligations “in practice.”  See Joined Cases C-411/10 & C-\n493/10, N.S. v. Sec’y of State for the Home Dep’t, 2011 E.C.R. I-13905, at ¶ 86-87; accord \nM.S.S. v. Belgium & Greece, 2011-I Eur. Ct. H.R. 255, at ¶ 300. \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 43 of 58\nv. EPA, 233 F.3d 625, 634-35 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (agency violated statute “by failing to consider” \nissues “the [statute] requires [it] to consider”).  \nThe statute requires the agencies to consider the actual operation of the receiving \ncountry’s protection system.  But here, the agencies’ designations address only Guatemala’s \nformal law and nowhere consider its asylum system’s actual operations or capacity.  See \nDOJFF6-7; DHSFF1282-83.  Yet the record contains extensive evidence of that system’s \ndeficiencies, including a State Department “Assessment of the Guatemalan Asylum System,” \nwhich describes serious structural defects.12  DHSFF1227-34.  The Guatemalan agency that first \nreviews asylum applications has only seven employees, just three or four of whom interview \napplicants.  Id. at 1231, 1253.  That agency makes a recommendation to an interagency \ncommission that meets irregularly, has no dedicated asylum staff, lacks training on asylum law, \nand renders “gut decisions.”  Id. at 1229, 1231.  The commission then forwards its \nrecommendation to a second interagency body consisting of high-ranking officials—newly \ncreated in March 2019—which likewise meets infrequently and has no dedicated asylum staff.  \nId. at 1229-30.  Theoretically, this last body issues final decisions, but it did not resolve a single \nclaim in its first five months.  Id. at 1166; see also id. at 1231. \nThe agencies’ own record establishes that, “[h]istorically, Guatemala has had capacity to \nprocess about 100-150 [asylum] cases per year.”  Id. at 1231.  The State Department reported that \nunder the cumbersome three-part process now in place, Guatemala will be unable to increase that \nnumber.  Id.  And the system already had a backlog of 400 cases in June 2019, a month before the \nACA was signed.  Id..  Yet the agencies signed off on a plan to send many more asylum seekers \n                                                           \n12 The State Department assessment also calls into question the facial sufficiency of Guatemala’s \nasylum laws, explaining that UNHCR warned that “[Guatemala’s] Migration Code . . . may not \nbe fully compatible with the principles of non-refoulement.”  DHSFF1232.   \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 44 of 58\nto Guatemala—and have now sent more than 700—without assessing the system’s capacity or the \npotential impact of drastically increasing application volume.   \nThe agencies also entirely failed to consider or address whether Guatemala is safe in \nreality, as required by statute, despite ample record evidence that asylum seekers face grave risks \nthere.  The State Department has long been recognized as “[t]he obvious source of information \non general conditions in [a] foreign country.”  Chen v. Dep’t of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d \nCir. 2006) (quoting Zamora v. INS, 534 F.2d 1055, 1062 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.)).  In its \nassessment of Guatemala’s viability as a safe third country, the State Department reported: \nGuatemala remains among the most dangerous countries in the world[] . . . . \nGuatemala’s high murder rate appears driven by narco-trafficking activity, gang-\nrelated violence, a heavily armed population, and police/judicial system unable to \nhold many criminals accountable.  . . . . Gang members usually punish non-\ncompliant victims with violent assault or murder, and their family members are also \nvictimized as punishment. \n \nDHSFF1233.13   \nOther information in the agencies’ own record is similarly alarming, particularly with \nrespect to dangers facing migrants, women, children, racial minorities, and LGBT people.  \nMigrants in Guatemala are “victims, at the hands of organized crime groups, gangs (maras) and \neven some police officers, immigration officers and other civil servants, of crimes including \nkidnapping, extortion, robbery, forced recruitment, sexual abuse, [and] physical violence.”  Id. at \n107; accord id. (noting “extortion carried out by officers of the National Civil Police during \nimmigration controls and proceedings”); id. at 548 (“migrants are victims of many abuses, such \n                                                           \n13 Notably, the administrative record does not contain any of the State Department’s annual \nreports on human rights conditions in Guatemala (or Honduras or El Salvador), which \nextensively catalogue other violence and abuses.  Although those reports are recognized as \n“‘usually the best available source[s] of information’ on country conditions,” Chen, 471 F.3d at \n341 (quoting Zamora, 534 F.2d at 1062), the agencies apparently did not consult them.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 45 of 58\nas extortion, robbery and even disappearances”); id. at 683 (migrants “report being victims of \nsuccessive forms of extortion and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence . . . at \nthe hands of different actors, including government authorities”).   \nWomen in Guatemala “face a startling degree of violence that has a devastating impact \non their daily lives.”  Id. at 682.  Similarly, “violence against LGBTI persons is a structural \nissue.”  Id. at 616; see also id. at 695 (noting “violence suffered by [LGBTI] persons”); id. at 437 \n(expressing concern about violence against, inter alia, “women, children, indigenous peoples, \nafrodescendants, [and] LGBTI persons”).   \n Guatemala’s “homicide rate . . . continues to be one of the highest in . . . one of the \nworld’s most violent regions,” id. at 598, and the impunity rate for homicide exceeds 98 percent, \nid. at 462.  Moreover, persecutors such as the Northern Triangle’s pervasive transnational gangs \npursue targets freely across the region.  Id. at 1255, 1260; USCIS19, 26.  And as the agencies are \naware, in recent years, Guatemala has consistently been among the top countries of origin for \nindividuals granted asylum in the United States.  DOJIFR665.     \nInstead of grappling with any of this extensive contrary evidence, both agencies \nconcluded that asylum seekers can “safely remain” in Guatemala while their claims are \nadjudicated, apparently because a provision of the country’s immigration code purports to \n“guarantee[] that all migrants are not subject to ‘any form of violence[.]’”  DOJFF7; accord \nDHSFF1283.14  But a mere legal prohibition of violence cannot satisfy the statutory requirement \nto consider whether asylum seekers can, in reality, safely remain in the country and enjoy \nprotection.  The agencies’ complete failure to engage with evidence bearing on the critical \n                                                           \n14 Notably, the Designations entirely fail to address whether asylum seekers can remain safely in \nGuatemala and “enjoy protection” should they be granted asylum.  See DHSFF1263 (refugees \nmust “be able to enjoy asylum” in the receiving country).  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 46 of 58\nquestion of safety—to say nothing of the particular dangers facing women, children, racial \nminorities, and LGBT persons—violates the safe third country statute.  See Gerber, 294 F.3d at \n185 (“conclusory recitation” cannot “satisfy a statutory requirement” to consider certain factors). \n2.  The Agencies’ Categorical Designations Are Arbitrary and Capricious.  \n \nThe Designations also violate the APA for three reasons.  First, “agencies need to address \n‘important aspect[s] of the problem.’”  Gresham, 2020 WL 741278, at *6 (quoting State Farm, \n463 U.S. at 43); see D&F Afonso Realty Tr. v. Garvey, 216 F.3d 1191, 1195 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(“we must strike down agency action if the agency failed to consider relevant factors”); Mozilla \nCorp., 940 F.3d at 67 (agency “required to grapple with the lapse in legal safeguards” triggered \nby policy).  Under the safe third country provision, the actual functioning of Guatemala’s asylum \nsystem and the ability of asylum seekers to safely remain there in practice are, at minimum, \n“relevant factors” and “important aspect[s] of the problem” the agencies must address.  State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43.15   Because the agencies “left these serious concerns unaddressed,” their \ndesignations were arbitrary and capricious.  Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 710 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014).  \nSecond, the agencies failed to adequately explain their decisions.  “[A]n agency ‘must \nexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Sorenson Commc’ns Inc., \n                                                           \n15 Even the agencies’ own record recognizes this.  See DHSFF822 (whether a state can serve as a \nsafe third country “cannot be answered without looking at the state’s international legal \nobligations, its domestic laws and [its] actual practice of implementation”) (emphasis added); \nid. at 883 (whether there is a “risk to the life of the person in the third State” is a “critical \nfactor[]” in assessing whether a potential safe third country can provide effective protection); id. \nat 1262-63 (“review of the actual practice of the State and its compliance with [international \nrefugee] instruments is an essential part of this assessment”); id. at 1263 (refugees must “be able \nto enjoy asylum” in the receiving country, and “[t]he obligation to ensure that conditions in the \nreceiving State meet these requirements in practice rests with the transferring State”). \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 47 of 58\n755 F.3d at 707 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43); see D&F Alfonso Realty Tr., 216 F.3d at \n1194-95 (explaining that agency must “adequately explain its result”).  The Designations fail this \ntest.  They state in conclusory fashion that Guatemala’s asylum system is “robust” and \n“sufficient,” and that asylum applicants have “a meaningful opportunity” to apply, and can \n“safely remain in Guatemala.”  DHSFF1282-83; DOJFF6.  But the agencies never explain how \nthey reached those conclusions; the designations merely catalog the paper rights and procedures \nset forth in Guatemala’s asylum laws and regulations.  DHSFF1282-83; DOJFF6-7.  That is not \nreasoned decisionmaking.  See Gresham, 2020 WL 741278, at *7 (dismissing concerns about \nimportant problem “in a conclusory manner is not a hallmark of reasoned decisionmaking”); see \nalso Fox v. Clinton, 684 F.3d 67, 75 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“no deference” owed to agency action \nbased on “purported expertise” where agency’s explanation for action “lacks any coherence”).   \nThird, an agency cannot simply “ignore evidence” in the record “contradicting its \nposition.”  Butte Cty. v. Hogen, 613 F.3d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  Rather, the agency must \n“adequately . . . address relevant evidence before it.”  El Rio Health Ctr. v. HHS, 396 F.3d 1265, \n1278 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  The agencies violated this core principle, as the Designations fail to even \nacknowledge the existence of substantial record evidence undermining their conclusions about \nGuatemala, see supra at 32-34—let alone explain why the Designations are nonetheless justified.  \nE. The Government Unlawfully Bypassed Notice-and-Comment Procedures. \n \nThe government violated the APA by fundamentally changing asylum procedures \nwithout allowing prior notice and comment.  The public comment period is designed to “foster \nthe fairness and deliberation that should underlie a pronouncement of such force.”  United States \nv. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 230 (2001) (quotation marks omitted).  The Rule asserts that none \nwas required under the APA’s foreign affairs and good cause exceptions.  Neither applies. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 48 of 58\n1.  The Foreign Affairs Exception Does Not Apply. \n“‘[I]mmigration matters typically implicate foreign affairs’ at least to some extent.”  City \nof N.Y. v. Permanent Mission of India to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 202 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting \nYassini v. Crosland, 618 F.2d 1356, 1360 n.4 (9th Cir. 1980)).  Courts thus narrowly cabin the \nforeign affairs exception’s application to immigration rules, so the exception does not \n“‘becom[e] distended’” and “eliminate[] public participation in this entire area of administrative \nlaw.”  Id.16  In the immigration context, agencies must show that notice-and-comment \nprocedures would “provoke definitely undesirable international consequences.”  Id.; accord \nEBSC v. Trump II, 2020 WL 962336, at *20; Am. Ass’n of Exps. & Imps. v. United States, 751 \nF.2d 1239, 1249 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  The government failed to carry this burden.  \nFirst, the government claims that bypassing notice and comment was appropriate because \nthe Rule “puts into effect” the Northern Triangle ACAs.  84 Fed. Reg. 64,005.  But the Rule does \nnot “put[] into effect” any ACA.  It is a regulatory vessel that sets out procedures to govern all \nremovals made pursuant to the safe third country provision—including future agreements—\nexcept the Canada Agreement.  84 Fed. Reg. at 63,996, 64,004.  The Rule was issued months \nago, and yet the Honduras and El Salvador ACAs have not been “put[] into effect.”   \nThe agencies’ reliance on International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Peña, 17 F.3d 1478, \n1486 (D.C. Cir. 1994), is thus misplaced.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,005.  There, the United States \nand Mexico agreed to implement a requirement regarding commercial drivers’ licenses by a \ncertain deadline, and the agency promulgated a rule implementing that specific accord.  Int’l \n                                                           \n16 The Rule’s reliance on Permanent Mission, 84 Fed. Reg. 64,005, is misplaced.  In rejecting a \nnotice-and-comment challenge, the Second Circuit explicitly distinguished that case from the \nimmigration context, where “[t]he dangers of an expansive reading of the foreign affairs \nexception . . . are manifest.”  Permanent Mission, 618 F.3d at 202.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 49 of 58\nBhd. Of Teamsters v. Pena, 17 F.3d at 1480-81.  That rule “did no more than implement an \nagreement between the United States and Mexico.”  Id. at 1486.  Here, the Rule does not \nimplement any agreement; it creates generic procedures to govern all future ACA removals. \nSecond, the government’s speculation that following notice-and-comment procedures \n“could impact” hypothetical future negotiations because hypothetical future partners “may be \nmore hesitant to negotiate” without the Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. 64,005 (emphases added), is \ninsufficient to demonstrate “definitely undesirable international consequences.”  EBSC v. Trump \nII, 2020 WL 962336, at *20-21.  The United States successfully negotiated ACAs with \nGuatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador without any regulations even proposed, much less in \nplace.  Any “connection between [future] negotiations . . . and the immediate implementation of \nthe Rule is . . . ‘not apparent’” in the record.  Id. at *21.17  \nThe government unsuccessfully attempts to sidestep the closest analogue—the \nregulations governing removals under the Canada Agreement—by claiming that it cannot afford \nto wait the two years that elapsed between the signing of that agreement in December 2002 and \nthe issuance of the final rules in November 2004.  84 Fed. Reg. at 64,005.  But only a fraction of \nthat delay was due to notice and comment, which began with the issuance of proposed rules in \nMarch 2004.  69 Fed. Reg. 10,620 (Mar. 8, 2004); 69 Fed. Reg. at 10,627.  The agencies \nidentified no reason they could not complete notice and comment more quickly here.   \n2.  The Good Cause Exception Does Not Apply. \nGood cause is a “meticulous and demanding” standard, on which agencies receive no \ndeference.  Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  It is “limited \n                                                           \n17 The government also asserts a need to quickly address a “crisis” at the southern border as \nmeeting the foreign affairs exception.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 64,005.  This Court should reject that \ncontention for the same reasons it should refuse to find good cause, as addressed below.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 50 of 58\nto emergency situations,” and must be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.”  \nTenn. Gas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 969 F.2d 1141, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1992).   \nThe Rule falls far short of this demanding standard.  Courts have repeatedly rejected this \nadministration’s “speculative” assertions that providing for public comment would prompt a \n“‘surge’ across the southern border.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Coalition v. Trump (“EBSC v. Trump I”), \n932 F.3d 742, 776 (9th Cir. 2018); see also EBSC v. Trump II, 2020 WL 962336, at *20; E. Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Barr, 934 F.3d 1026, 1028 (9th Cir. 2019).  The Rule, standing alone, \n“does not change eligibility for asylum” for any particular person; “that change is not effected \nuntil the Rule is combined with” other Executive action—here, the necessary categorical \ndesignations and ACA-specific agency guidance.  See EBSC v. Trump I, 932 F.3d at 777.   \nMoreover, the government’s claims lack record support.  See Sorensen Commc’ns Inc., \n755 F.3d at 707 (agency must “provide evidence of [the purported] exigency”); Tenn. Gas \nPipeline Co., 969 F.2d at 1145 (agency “provided little factual basis” for prediction construction \ncompanies would accelerate activities in advance of rule’s implementation).  The Rule cites an \nOctober 2018 newspaper article that contains a single, unverified assertion that smugglers told \nmigrants when DHS halted a different policy of separating families at the border and encouraged \nthem to migrate before the policy’s reinstatement.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,006.  The article \ncontains no evidence that any migrants altered their plans in response to this “sales pitch.”  See \nDOJIFR899.  The Rule points to another article to suggest that Central Americans rushed to \nenter the United States between President Trump’s election and inauguration.  84 Fed. Reg. at \n64,007.18  But CBP’s own data shows that the number of apprehensions at the southern border \n                                                           \n18 The Rule incorrectly states that this article attributes the claim to “Central American officials.”  \n84 Fed. Reg. at 64,007.  While the article does not say that, it does attribute the rise in “migration \nfrom Central America” to “gang-related violence.”  DOJIFR738.   \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 51 of 58\ndeclined in those months.  SUF ¶ 167.  A third article states only that unnamed U.S. officials \n“suspect” that Mexico’s issuance of humanitarian visas “may have influenced” some Hondurans \nto migrate there.  DHSIFR821.  “Absent additional evidence,” the agencies’ proffered inference \n“is too difficult to credit.”  See EBSC v. Trump I, 932 F.3d at 777.   \nThat difficulty is underscored by the government’s own actions.  If the government \nactually feared that “the announc[ing] that [it] ha[d] arranged for other countries” to receive \nasylum seekers would cause a surge at the border, see 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,006, the President \nwould not have held a press conference to announce the Guatemala ACA, four months before it \nwas put to use.  SUF ¶ 169.  DHS even posted its own “fact sheet” discussing all three \nagreements—in English and Spanish—weeks before it commenced ACA removals.  USCIS2-3; \nSUF ¶ 170.  Notably, each month between the announcement of the first ACA and the Rule’s \nissuance, the number of apprehensions at and between ports of entry again declined.  SUF ¶ 168.   \nFinally, the agencies’ citations to past interim final rules, 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,007, “have \nno relevance,” since “good cause is determined on a ‘case-by-case’ basis.”  California v. Azar, \n911 F.3d 558, 575-76 (9th Cir. 2018).   \nII.   A Permanent Injunction Is Necessary to Prevent Ongoing Irreparable Harm. \n \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Suffering Irreparable Harm. \n \nIndividual Plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding, and \nCAT protection and removed to Guatemala pursuant to the Rule, Guidance, and Designations.  \nThey suffer from ongoing harm that is “both certain and great,” Wisc. Gas Co. v. F.E.R.C., 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and will continue to suffer harm absent a permanent injunction.  \nIndividual Plaintiffs fled brutal attacks, death threats, and the murder of family members.  \nU.T., a gay man, suffered childhood sexual abuse and marginalization because of his sexuality, \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 52 of 58\nand fears for his life in El Salvador because he refused a gang leader who solicited him for sex. \nSUF ¶ 126.  In Honduras, MS-13 gang members hit E.R. in the head with a bat, badly cut him , \nand threatened to kill him and his family.  Id. ¶ 128.  M.H. and H.D., mothers from Honduras \nand El Salvador respectively, fled with their children after gangs murdered their relatives and \nthreatened their lives.  Id. ¶¶ 130, 134.  When they sought protection in the United States, \nIndividual Plaintiffs were instead removed to a country where they again feared for their lives.  \nId. ¶¶ 127, 129, 132, 135.  Unable to find protection, they are now in hiding.  Id.   \n  Guatemala is not safe for the Individual Plaintiffs or other asylum seekers.  See generally \nSUF ¶¶ 103-21 (addressing dangerous conditions in Guatemala); Id. ¶¶ 126-36 (addressing harm \nto Individual Plaintiffs).  It is a refugee-producing country with extremely high rates of violence, \nid. ¶ 121—particularly against women, children, and LGBTI persons, id. ¶¶ 109-14.  As of \nDecember 2016, 12,554 Guatemalans were recognized as refugees globally, 11,328 of whom had \nbeen granted asylum in the United States.  Id. ¶ 103 (citing UNHCR, Eligibility Guidelines for \nAssessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Guatemala 46 (Jan. 2018) \n(“UNHCR Protection Guidelines”)); see also DOJIFR665 (listing Guatemala among the top four \ncountries of origin for individuals granted asylum between 2015 and 2017); SUF ¶ 121.  Many \nGuatemalans receive asylum after suffering, for example, unchecked gang violence or \nhomophobic attacks.  UNHCR Protection Guidelines at 38-55; see SUF ¶¶ 109, 114-15 (violence \nagainst LGBT people); 106, 110 (gang violence); 86, 108 (describing impunity for crimes).     \nAsylum seekers from other countries face particular dangers in Guatemala due to their \nstatus as migrants, including extortion, kidnapping, and physical and sexual violence by \nGuatemalan authorities and organized crime groups that operate with impunity.  DHSFF107, \n360, 548, 683; SUF ¶¶ 85, 116-19.  In addition, Individual Plaintiffs and other Northern Triangle \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 53 of 58\nasylum seekers are in danger in Guatemala because the countries are part of a free movement \nzone that allows persecutors to reach victims throughout a region smaller than Michigan. See \nUSCIS19, 26; DHSFF1255, 1260; SUF ¶ 120; see also SUF ¶ 99 (explaining that migrant shelter \ndirector has received death threats from persecutors targeting shelter residents).  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers have already faced violence, abuse, and \ndiscrimination in Guatemala.  U.T. endured homophobic slurs while transiting Guatemala after \nfleeing El Salvador.  SUF ¶ 127.  When he was removed to Guatemala and asked officials about \nasylum, they advised him to go to Mexico because Guatemala is not safe for gay men.  Id.; see \nalso id. ¶¶ 114-16 (addressing anti-LGBT violence).  While Plaintiffs H.R. and J.R. were en \nroute to the United States, Guatemalan police singled them out as migrants, and extorted and \nthreatened them.  Id. ¶ 131; see id. ¶ 118 (addressing extortion of migrants).  Shortly after being \nremoved to Guatemala under the Rule, a gay client of Plaintiff Las Americas narrowly escaped a \nhomophobic assault.  Id. ¶ 142.  A Honduran teen transiting Guatemala with her one-year old \nchild was tracked and kidnapped by the same gang that targeted them in Honduras.  Id. ¶¶ 139-\n40.  These examples bear out UNHCR’s warning that the Rule “could result in the transfer of \nhighly vulnerable individuals to countries where they may face life-threatening dangers.”  Id. \n¶ 102 (also stating that the Rule is “at variance with international law”).  \nAdditionally, Individual Plaintiffs cannot effectively access or enjoy asylum in \nGuatemala because Guatemala’s asylum system barely functions.  See id. (UNHCR describing \nGuatemala’s asylum system as “nascent”); see also id. ¶¶ 44, 47, 49, 53-56, 63-65 (overview of \nthe system).  It is a cumbersome, inefficient process involving multiple interagency bodies.  See \nid. ¶¶ 45-52.  Between January 2018 and August 2019, Guatemala’s migration office received \n466 asylum applications; at the end of that period, 423 were still pending.  Id. ¶ 97.  As of \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 54 of 58\nSeptember 30, Guatemala’s asylum office still had just seven employees, and four or fewer of \nthem adjudicated asylum claims.  Id.; see also DHSFF1253, 1231.  It is projected to take at least \nthree years to clear the current backlog.  DHSFF1231. \nTo make matters worse, Guatemala has given Individual Plaintiffs and other asylum \nseekers just 72 hours to decide whether to apply for asylum or leave the country.  SUF ¶¶ 92, \n127, 129, 132, 135.  They must make this choice after receiving confusing, inadequate \ninformation about the asylum process.  Id. ¶ 101.  U.T. was sent on to Mexico.  Id. ¶ 12.  Without \nsafety or connections in Guatemala, E.R., H.R., J.R., M.H., and H.D. had to return to the \ncountries they recently fled, where they fear for their lives.  Id. ¶¶ 129, 132, 135.  Indeed, very \nfew of the hundreds removed to Guatemala under the Rule have been able to pursue asylum \nthere.  Id. ¶ 95.  Like Individual Plaintiffs, most have instead been forced to return to their home \ncountries or seek safety elsewhere.  Id.   \nDepriving Individual Plaintiffs of the opportunity to apply for protection in the United \nStates and removing them to a country where they face persecution, torture, and other dangers—\nincluding indirect refoulement—constitutes irreparable harm.  See, e.g., DHSFF1232 (noting \nUNHCR concern that Guatemalan law is not fully compatible with non-refoulement principle); \nDevitri v. Cronen, 289 F. Supp. 3d 287, 296-97 (D. Mass. 2018) (significant risk of persecution \nif removed is irreparable harm); Orantes-Hernandez v. Meese, 685 F. Supp. 1488, 1504-05 (C.D. \nCal. 1988) (removal to violent country without opportunity to apply for asylum and withholding \nis irreparable harm); Nunez v. Boldin, 537 F. Supp. 578, 586-87 (S.D. Tex. 1982) (“Deportation \nto a country where one’s life would be threatened obviously would result in irreparable injury.”).  \n  The Rule has also caused and will cause Organizational Plaintiffs Tahirih and Las \nAmericas irreparable harm.  Both organizations share a mission of providing legal services to \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 55 of 58\nasylum seekers.  To continue serving individuals who may be subject to the Rule, they have \ndiverted substantial resources to more burdensome and costly forms of advocacy, including \nsending staff to Mexico.  SUF ¶¶ 153-54, 161.  Such trips are now necessary for them to \ncontinue serving asylum seekers subject to the Rule.  Id. ¶¶ 153-54, 161.  \n  The Rule also impedes Las Americas’ ability to serve asylum seekers in expedited \nremoval by denying them credible fear interviews and not providing for access to counsel, \nmaking it extremely burdensome for Las Americas’ to assist them.  Id. ¶¶ 160-61.   \nAdditionally, because both organizations serve asylum-seeking clients in regular removal \nproceedings through dedicated sources of funding, the Rule threatens them financially.  Id. \n¶¶ 151, 164.  Approximately 40 percent of Tahirih’s asylum clients in 2018 came from El \nSalvador and Honduras and, thus, a substantial portion of their client population is at risk of \nbeing processed under the Rule’s expedited removal procedures.  Id. ¶ 148.  Similarly, a large \nportion of the individuals Las Americas typically serves in regular removal proceedings are now \nsubject to the Rule.  Id. ¶ 156.  If these individuals are summarily removed, Tahirih and Las \nAmericas will lose the opportunity to represent them in their removal proceedings and may lose \nfunding for their asylum-related work.  Id. ¶¶ 151, 164.  \nFor asylum seekers subject to the Rule who do reach regular removal proceedings, the \norganizations will be forced to revamp representation strategies in a resource-intensive way.  The \norganizations will have to demonstrate that their clients face a likelihood of persecution or \ntorture in every operative ACA country before the merits of their asylum claims can even be \nheard.  Id. ¶¶ 151, 163; see id. ¶¶ 9-13.  The additional costs associated with developing these \ncases (like procuring expert evidence) limits the overall number of clients the organizations can \nserve, further harming them.  Id. ¶ 151.  Tahirih also suffers harm from the lost opportunity to \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 56 of 58\ncomment on the Rule.  Id. ¶ 152.  The loss of that opportunity, combined with the frustration of \nPlaintiffs’ missions, diversion of resources, and lack of remedy, constitutes irreparable harm.  E. \nBay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 349 F. Supp. 3d 838, 865 (N.D. Cal. 2018).  \nB.   The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Favor Preserving the Status Quo. \n  \nThe remaining factors also favor injunctive relief.  While the Supreme Court has \nrecognized a public interest in the prompt removal of “an alien lawfully deemed removable,” \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009) (emphasis added), “[t]he Government ‘cannot suffer \nharm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice,’” R.I.L.-R. v. Johnson, 80 F. \nSupp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015).  Rather, allowing removals to go forward under the Rule, \nGuidance, and Designations would “permit[] and prolong[] a continuing violation of United \nStates law.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 436 (quotation marks omitted). \nIn contrast, if these policies remain in effect, hundreds—and, soon, thousands—more \nasylum seekers will be unable to pursue protection, and will instead be removed to Guatemala or \nanother country where they face persecution and other serious harm.  See Libbie Rehab. Ctr., Inc. \nv. Shalala, 26 F. Supp. 2d 128, 132 (D.D.C. 1998) (considering harm to third parties under \npublic interest prong).  “[T]here is a public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully \nremoved . . . to countries where they are likely to face substantial harm.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 436  \nFinally, “[t]he public interest is served when . . . agencies comply with their obligations \nunder the APA.”  N. Mariana Islands v. United States, 686 F. Supp. 2d 7, 21 (D.D.C. 2009).   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment should be granted.  \n   \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 40-1   Filed 03/02/20   Page 57 of 58\nDated: February 28, 2020             Respectfully submitted, \n \n   /s/ Katrina Eiland \nKeren Zwick (D.D.C.

To \ncombat this overwhelming and ongoing crush on the immigration system, the United States has \nengaged in ongoing diplomatic discussions with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, \nHonduras, and other countries on how to best share the burdens posed by this mass migration while \npreserving eligible individuals’ access to protection. On July 26, 2019, after sustained negotiations, \nthe United States signed an asylum-cooperative agreement (ACA) with Guatemala facilitating the \ntransfer of certain arriving aliens seeking asylum to Guatemala for processing of their protection \nclaims. Transfer of aliens to a third country is authorized by statute if the government determines \nthat Guatemala can provide “a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or \nequivalent temporary protection.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A). The Departments of Justice and \nHomeland Security made those determinations and issued an interim final rule implementing \nACAs, see Implementing Bilateral and Multilateral Asylum Cooperative Agreements Under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, 84 Fed. Reg. 63,994 (Nov. 19, 2019), and agency guidance \nimplementing the Rule, see USCIS278-300. \nTogether, the agreement, the Rule, and the guidance address the urgent, ongoing crisis at \nthe border and in the nation’s immigration courts caused by the “significant increase” in the past \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 12 of 77\n \ndecade in the “number of aliens encountered at or near its borders, particularly the southern land \nborder with Mexico.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,995. Many of these aliens raise asylum claims that are \nultimately found not to be have merit, contributing to a backlog of nearly one million cases in \nimmigration courts, including nearly half a million pending asylum claims, delaying consideration \nof genuine claims for asylum. Id. at 63,995-96. Processing these aliens and their claims has also \nconsumed a tremendous amount of resources of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Id. \nThe Rule seeks to relieve some of this burden by implementing a statutorily authorized mechanism \nfor “shar[ing] the distribution of hundreds of thousands of asylum claims” and “provid[ing] asylum \nseekers with access to only one” country’s systems for hearing asylum and protection claims, while \nalso ensuring that aliens are not sent to countries where they are likely to face persecution or \ntorture. 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,994-95, 64,009. The Rule thus allows aliens to pursue their claims for \nasylum or protection from removal and aids ongoing negotiations with regional partners on \ndeterring and sharing the burdens of mass migration to the United States. Id. at 64,005-06. \nDespite the Executive Branch’s clear authority and sound policy aims, Plaintiffs ask this \nCourt to issue a nationwide permanent injunction halting the government’s implementation of its \nagreement with Guatemala and other future such agreements. This Court should deny Plaintiffs’ \nextraordinary request. \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable. To begin, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction \nover their claims. The statute Plaintiffs invoke, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), Compl. ¶ 18; Mot. 13-14, \nauthorizes “judicial review” only of “determinations under section 1225(b)” (the expedited-\nremoval statute) “and its implementation,” including “regulations” and “written polic[ies]” “to \nimplement [§ 1225(b)].” But the challenged Rule and guidance implement provisions of the \nasylum statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), authorizing the Attorney General to determine who may \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 13 of 77\n \napply for asylum in the United States, and do not implement § 1225(b). Plaintiffs also may not \nchallenge  in  this  Court  the  application  of  the  Rule  by  immigration  judges  in  full  removal \nproceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, because such claims may be raised in only the courts of \nappeals.  See  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(a)(5),  (b)(9). And  Plaintiffs’  challenges  to  the  Departments’ \ndeterminations implementing 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A) are in any event foreclosed because \nCongress  was  clear:  “No  court  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  review  any  determination”  under \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A), id. § 1158(a)(3), or any discretionary decision undergirding such a determination, \nsee id. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). \nPlaintiffs also lack standing. The organizational Plaintiffs lack standing because they are \nadvocacy groups who claim injury based on the need to adapt to a new policy and speculation \nabout its effect on their funding. That view of injury defies Article III—it would confer standing \nwhenever the law changes. Plaintiffs’ predictions about their funding streams are also far too \nspeculative to support standing. Their asserted injuries also fall outside the zone of interests of the \nimmigration laws—which provide a cause of action, if at all, only for individual affected aliens. \nPlaintiff organizations have no cognizable role to play in the immigration review scheme, and \ncannot circumvent it by rushing to federal court before aliens directly affected by the Rule do so. \nThe individual Plaintiffs also lack standing because each was categorically ineligible for asylum \nfor reasons unrelated to the Rule and guidance, and therefore has no legally protected interest or \ninjury sufficient to support Article III standing. They also lack standing to seek prospective relief \nbecause they fail to demonstrate that they are likely to be subject to the Rule again in the future. \nPlaintiffs’ claims also fail on the merits. First, Plaintiffs contend that the Rule and guidance \nviolate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), because they are \ninconsistent  with  the  credible-fear  procedures  in  the  expedited-removal  statute,  8  U.S.C. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 14 of 77\n \n§ 1225(b)(1). Compl. ¶¶ 169-74; Mot. 16-17. The credible-fear procedures provide an avenue for \nan alien subject to expedited removal to nonetheless apply for asylum in certain circumstances. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Rule and guidance are contrary to law because they do not provide the \nsame procedures. But there is no statutory requirement that aliens subject to a bar to applying for \nasylum under § 1158(a)(2)(A) must have access to the same procedures that are available to aliens \nwho can potentially pursue asylum claims.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend that the Rule and guidance violate the APA because they are \ninconsistent with the statute governing removal to a third country based on an ACA, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A). Compl. ¶¶ 156-62; Mot. 17-20. Section 1158(a)(2)(A) categorically bars an alien \nfrom seeking asylum in this country if the Departments determine that the alien may be removed \nunder a bilateral agreement to a country where his “life or freedom would not be threatened on \naccount of” a protected ground and where he would have “access to a full and fair procedure for \ndetermining  a  claim  to  asylum  or  equivalent  temporary  protection.”  Section  1158  squarely \nauthorizes the Departments to issue the Rule here, and the Rule is consistent with each of these \nprovisions. The Rule ensures that any alien who raises a fear of removal to a third country can do \nso as part of an individual screening interview. In addition, before implementing the ACA with \nGuatemala, the Departments made determinations, following careful review of information from \ngovernmental and non-governmental sources, that Guatemala provides access to full-and-fair \nprocedures for asylum and other protection claims. Contrary to Plaintiffs’ contention, there is no \nrequirement that the Departments make the latter determination anew in each individual case. \nSee Lopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 243-44 (2001). \nThird, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule violates the APA because it is inconsistent with \n8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), which governs claims for withholding of removal raised in full removal \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 15 of 77\n \nproceedings because the Rule does not apply the same procedures as § 1231(b)(3). Compl. ¶¶ 163-\n68; Mot. 21. But Plaintiffs offer no support for the contention that the procedures that apply when \nan alien seeks protection from removal to his home country under § 1231(b)(3) must be applied \nwhen an alien is being removed to a third country under § 1158(a)(2)(A). The Rule is consistent \nwith the requirements of § 1158(a)(2)(A) and, in any  event, a separate provision, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(h), provides that § 1231 creates no legally enforceable rights. \nFourth, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA \nbecause it departs from “prior policy” and fails to consider important aspects of the problem, and \nthat the determinations that Guatemala has full-and-fair procedures are unlawful. Compl. ¶¶ 175-\n80; Mot. 21-36. But the Rule and guidance implement a new bilateral agreement with Guatemala \nand do not alter or depart from any existing policy. Moreover, the Departments explained their \nreasons for adopting each aspect of the Rule that Plaintiffs challenge; the Departments explained \nthe basis for the full-and-fair determinations, the Rule, and the guidance; and each is supported by \na  robust  administrative  record.  See DOJIFR001-1075;  DHSIFR001-875;  DOJFF001-144; \nDHSFF001-1283;  USCIS001-402.  Plaintiffs’  policy  disagreements  with  the  Executive’s \nconsidered policy judgments are no basis to second-guess the conclusions of the agency heads.  \nFifth, Plaintiffs maintain that the Departments unlawfully bypassed the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment procedures under 5 U.S.C. § 553. Compl. ¶¶ 181-83; Mot. 36-40. But those procedures \nare not required where, as here, agencies are implementing a measure linked intimately to foreign \naffairs—ongoing negotiations between the United States and other countries to address the current \nmass-migration crisis. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(1); 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,005. Awaiting notice and \ncomment would have “[h]inder[ed]” the Executive’s “ability to implement a new policy in \nresponse to a current foreign affairs crisis”—precisely the “undesirable international consequence \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 16 of 77\n \nthat warrants invocation of the foreign affairs exception.” East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, \n909 F.3d 1219, 1252 (9th Cir. 2018); see 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,005-06. Nor is a notice-and-comment \nperiod required where it would harm important national interests and “the agency for good cause \nfinds” that it would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(B), (d)(3). Where it would “jeopardize the lives and welfare of aliens who could surge to \nthe border to enter the United States before the rule limiting asylum applications took effect,” \nmaking the crisis on the southern border worse, 84 Fed. Reg. 64, 006-07, good cause is satisfied. \nSixth, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule violates the Suspension Clause because it does not \nprovide for individual judicial review of an alien’s removal order to Guatemala. Compl. ¶¶ 184-\n86; Mot. 28-29. But it is the relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2), not the Rule, which forecloses \njudicial review, and that statute has been operative since 1998. Plaintiffs are well outside the 60-\nday jurisdictional time limit in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B) for challenges to the statute, which the \nD.C. Circuit upheld in all respects nearly twenty years ago. See American Immigration Lawyers \nAss’n v. Reno (AILA), 199 F.3d 1352, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Regardless, no Plaintiff is subject to \ndetention or purports to raise a habeas claim, so Plaintiffs cannot invoke the Suspension Clause to \ndemand more procedures concerning their removal than Congress provided.  \nFinally, if this Court grants any relief to Plaintiffs, that relief must be sharply limited. \nHalting the implementation of the United States’ agreement with Guatemala would have serious \nnegative foreign-relations implications, and the statute governing this Court’s jurisdiction over \nchallenges to expedited removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), authorizes only the entry of declaratory, \nnot injunctive, relief. See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, No. 19-2676, 2020 WL 985376, at *24 (D.D.C. \nMar. 1, 2020) (Moss, J.).  \nThe Court should grant summary judgment to the government and dismiss this case. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 17 of 77\n \nLEGAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nLegal Background. Congress has empowered the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to decide who may be granted asylum in the United States. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, \n1225(b)(1). Although certain aliens generally may “apply for asylum” under § 1158(a)(1), asylum \nrelief is always discretionary, 1 and importantly, the statute sets out a range of exceptions, creating \nvarious categories of aliens who are ineligible to apply. Id. § 1158(a)(2). Section 1158(a), titled \n“Authority to apply for asylum,” provides that: “Any alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States,” “irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for \nasylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, [8 U.S.C. §] 1225(b),” which governs \nexpedited removal of aliens. Id. § 1158(a)(1).  \nSection 1158(a)(2), titled “Exceptions,” articulates three bars to applying for asylum, \nincluding the “safe third country” bar. Id. § 1158(a)(2)(A). Under that bar, an alien may not apply \nfor asylum if the Attorney General2 determines: (1) “that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a \nbilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of the alien’s nationality \nor, in the case of an alien having no nationality, the country of the alien’s last habitual residence) \nin which the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, \nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” and (2) that “the alien \nwould have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent \n                                                 \n1 A grant of asylum is entirely discretionary. Asylum “may [be] grant[ed] to an alien who has \napplied,” id. § 1158(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added), if the alien is not subject to a bar to applying for \nasylum, is not subject to an eligibility bar, and satisfies certain requirements, id. § 1158(a)(2), \n(b)(1)(B), (b)(2). \n2 Following the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §§ 402, 441, 116 Stat. 2135 \n(Nov. 25, 2002), the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security now share authority \nover immigration functions and references to “Attorney General” in the INA are understood to \nalso encompass DHS, depending on the circumstances. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 18 of 77\n \ntemporary protection.” Id. § 1158(a)(2)(A). If the Attorney General makes these determinations \nand does not “find[] that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United \nStates,” id., then the alien is barred from applying for asylum in this country. The determinations \nunder § 1158(a)(2) are not subject to review. See id. § 1158(a)(3) (“No court shall have jurisdiction \nto review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2)”). \nThe  INA  and  regulations  also  provide  for  two  forms  of  protection  from  removal: \nwithholding of removal, which generally precludes removal of an alien who is subject to a removal \norder if he demonstrates that his “life or freedom would be threatened” based on a protected ground \nin the country of removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); and protection under the Convention Against \nTorture (CAT), if the alien faces a clear probability of torture in the designated country of removal, \n8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). Both forms of protection are country-specific and only relate to the \nparticular country to which the United States is trying to remove an alien. See Mejia v. Sessions, \n866 F.3d 573, 579 (4th Cir. 2017). Withholding and CAT do not prevent the United States from \nremoving an alien to a third country and do not provide an alien with any right to live in the United \nStates, any status, or any avenue to obtain status. See 8 U.S.C. § 1159 (conditions for adjustment \nof status); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 429 n.6 (1987). \nAsylum-Cooperative Agreements. On July 26, 2019, the United States signed a bilateral \nagreement covered by § 1158(a)(2)(A), “Agreement on Cooperation Regarding the Examination \nof Protection Claims, with the government of Guatemala.” DOJFF99-105. The agreement provides \nthat Guatemala will consider the protection claims of covered individuals who are transferred from \nthe United States to Guatemala. DOJFF103. The ACA does not apply to citizens or nationals of \nGuatemala,  unaccompanied  minors,  or  persons  with  U.S.  visas  or  no  visa  restrictions,  but \notherwise covers individuals of any nationality seeking protection under international agreements \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 19 of 77\n \ngoverning refugees, including the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 \nProtocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the Convention Against Torture. DOJFF101-103; \nsee also DHSFF698; 84 Fed. Reg. 64,095.  \nAs part of the ACA, Guatemala agreed that, “[t]o ensure that protection applications \ntransferred to Guatemala by the United States have access to a system to determine protection, \nGuatemala will not return or expel applications for protection in Guatemala, unless the application \nis  abandoned  by  the  applicant  or  is  formally  rejected  through  an  administrative  decision.” \nDOJFF103. Both governments agreed to put “procedures in place to ensure that the transfer from \nthe United States to Guatemala of the persons covered by [the ACA] are compatible with their \nrespective obligations, domestic and international laws, and migration policies.” DOJFF104. The \nUnited States also agreed “to cooperate to strengthen the institutional capacities of Guatemala,” \nand that the governments of the two countries would reevaluate the agreement at regular intervals \nto identify and correct any deficiencies with the agreement or its implementation. Id.  \nFull-and-Fair Determinations. On October 16, 2019, the Acting Secretary of DHS issued a \nmemorandum detailing his determination that Guatemala’s refugee protection laws satisfy the \n“access to a full and fair procedure” requirements of § 1158(a)(2)(A). DHSFF1282. The Acting \nSecretary reached this decision “after a careful review of the available information found in the \nGuatemalan Migration Code, their implementing regulations, an active dialogue between our two \nstates, information provided by the Department of State, information provided by the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and information from other sources.” Id. \nThe Acting Secretary noted that, although not necessarily required to determine that a country \nprovides access to full-and-fair procedures, Guatemala “appears to satisfy” all UNHCR guidelines \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 20 of 77\n \nfor the minimal guarantees that UNHCR advises State Parties to implement in their refugee-status \ndeterminations. DHSFF1282. \nIn a memorandum dated November 7, 2019, the Attorney General also determined that \nGuatemala’s  refugee  protection  laws  satisfy  the  “Access  to  a  Full  and  Fair  Procedure” \nrequirements  of  § 1158(a)(2)(A).  DOJFF6-7.  He  reached  this  conclusion  “[a]fter  careful \nconsideration,” “based upon the Guatemalan Migration Code, its implementing regulations, and \ninformation provided by the Departments of State and Homeland Security following consultations \nbetween the United States and Guatemala.” DOJFF6.  \nThe Attorney General determined that Guatemala provides “access to a full and fair \nprocedure” because “it has in place a sufficient protection system with accompanying procedures \nand laws,” and an “applicant for protection in Guatemala has a meaningful opportunity to make a \nprotection claim, receive a hearing and adjudication regarding that claim, and safely remain in \nGuatemala until his or her protection claim is resolved.” DOJFF6. Guatemala also has a process \n“that comports with basic notions of procedural fairness,” as both its legal provisions and the \nrepresentations made by Guatemalan officials to the United States State Department and DHS \nindicate  that  “Guatemala  has  a  competent  immigration  authority  with  clear  procedures  for \naddressing initial asylum applications, including referral of claims to an adjudicative body.” Id. \nThis includes giving applicants “oral guidance” during the initial stages of the proceedings “on \nhow to present a claim” and “on rights protections, and privileges,” notice of decisions, “the right \nto appeal an adverse decision,” and the right to “remain in Guatemala during any appellate \nprocess.” Id. Guatemala “has also adopted laws barring refoulement of refugees that are consistent \nwith the non-refoulement obligations” of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol. Id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 21 of 77\n \nJoint Rule Implementing ACAs. On November 19, 2019, the Attorney General and Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security issued a joint interim final rule (the “Rule”) that applies to all \nACAs with countries other than Canada (which is already covered by an earlier rule specifically \nimplementing the U.S.-Canada ACA). See 84 Fed. Reg. 63,994. The Rule provides for “a threshold \nscreening” process to determine “which country will consider the alien’s claim,” and “provide \nasylum seekers with access to only one of the ACA signatory countries’ protection systems,” “in \nan effort to share the distribution of hundreds of thousands of asylum claims.” Id.  \nConsistent with § 1158(a)(2)(A), the Rule is designed to alleviate the burden on the \novertaxed U.S. asylum system from “adjudicating asylum claims” resulting from “[h]undreds of \nthousands of migrants [who] have reached the United States in recent years and have claimed a \nfear of persecution or torture.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,994. Many of these migrants ultimately do not \n“establish legal qualification for such relief” or even “apply[ ] for protection after being released \ninto the United States, which has contributed to a backlog of 987,198 cases before the Executive \nOffice for Immigration Review (including 474,327 asylum cases), each taking an average of 816 \ndays to complete.” Id. at 63,995. In the last decade, “the United States has experienced a significant \nincrease in the number of aliens encountered at or near its borders with Mexico,” and “[t]his \nincrease has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the number and percentage of aliens \nrequesting asylum or claiming a fear of persecution or torture when apprehended or encountered \nby DHS.” Id. During this time period, “the percentage of aliens referred for credible fear interviews \nwithin ER proceedings jumped from approximately 5 percent to above 40 percent.” Id. This has \n“consume[d] a tremendous amount of resources within the Departments of Justice and Homeland \nSecurity.” Id. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 22 of 77\n \n The Rule provides that when an immigration officer in an expedited-removal proceeding \ndetermines “that an alien ... appears to be subject to the terms of an [ACA],” “prior to any \ndetermination concerning whether the alien has a credible fear of persecution or torture, the asylum \nofficer shall conduct a threshold screening interview to determine whether the alien is ineligible \nto apply for asylum in the United States and is subject to removal to” a country with which the \nUnited States has signed an ACA. 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,008. “The asylum officer shall advise the \nalien of the applicable agreement’s exceptions and question the alien as to applicability of any of \nthese exceptions to the alien’s case.” Id. at 64,009. The Rule provides that aliens may not be \nremoved to an ACA country if they establish, consistent with § 1158(a)(2)(A) and the CAT \nregulations, that it is more likely than not that they will be persecuted or tortured in the receiving \ncountry, and the alien must “be provided written notice that if he or she fears removal to the \nprospective receiving country because of the likelihood of persecution on account of a protected \nground or torture in that country and wants the officer to determine whether it is more likely than \nnot that the alien would be persecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in that country, \nthe alien should affirmatively state to the officer such a fear of removal.” Id. If the asylum officer, \nwith concurrence from a supervisory asylum officer, determines that the alien does not fall into an \nexception to the ACA and has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he would be \npersecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in the ACA country, then “the alien is \nineligible to apply for asylum in the United States,” “shall be advised that he [ ] will be removed \nto the receiving country,” and “shall be informed that, in the receiving country, [he] will have an \nopportunity  to  pursue  the  [  ]  claim  for  asylum  or  equivalent  temporary  protection.”  Id. \nAlternatively, for aliens “whom DHS has chosen to place in removal proceedings under [INA \n§ 240],”—i.e. full, non-expedited removal proceedings in immigration court—the Rule gives \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 23 of 77\n \nimmigration judges the authority to make these determinations, including determining “whether \nan alien is ineligible to apply for asylum and should be removed to a third country pursuant to” an \nACA under § 1158(a)(2)(A). 84 Fed. Reg. 64,010. \nThe Departments issued this Rule as an interim final rule that is effective immediately \nunder the APA’s exception to the notice-and-comment requirements for rules involving a “foreign \naffairs function” and the “good cause” exception that applies where these requirements are \n“impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Id. at 64,004-08. \nUSCIS Guidance. On November 19, 2019, USCIS issued written guidance to asylum \nofficers  implementing  the  Rule.  USCIS278-300; see  also  id  33-49,  348-380.  The  guidance \nprovides that a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer or agent will make an initial \ndetermination as to whether an alien is amenable to an ACA and will give the individual a “tear \nsheet” providing information about the threshold screening under the Rule. USCIS283, USCIS001 \n(tear sheet). The tear sheet explains, among other things, that the individual will be referred to an \nasylum officer for an interview and an assessment of whether they fall under any exception to the \nACA. USCIS001, 284; see also id. at 287-90 (setting out the exceptions). It also notifies the alien \nthat, if he does not fit an exception to the ACA, that he may be removed to Guatemala where he \nmay apply for asylum or other protection. USCIS001, 284.  \nThe tear sheet also notifies the alien that he may express a fear of removal to Guatemala, \nand that, if he does, he will be afforded “appropriate process.” USCIS001. It states: “If you have \nsuch a fear, please inform the immigration officer who provided you this form or any other \nimmigration officer, or please ask to speak to a supervisor,” and that “[o]ver the next day, you may \nconsult with a person or persons of your choosing prior to the interview by phone.” USCIS001. At \nthe interview, the asylum officer “must confirm that the individual received the Tear Sheet and \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 24 of 77\n \nunderstood its contents,” and “provide an interpreter as needed.” USCIS314, 352. If an individual \naffirmatively expresses a fear of removal to Guatemala, the asylum officer will determine whether \nhe is more likely than not to be persecuted or tortured in Guatemala. USCIS285. If the asylum \nofficer “determines the individual is unable to participate effectively in the interview because of \nillness, fatigue, or other impediments the officer may reschedule the interview. USCIS314, 352. \nThe officer must create a summary of the material facts stated by the alien at the interview, review \nthe summary with the alien, and give him an opportunity to correct any errors. Id. Following the \ninterview, the asylum officer’s determination must be reviewed by a supervisor, and the alien can \nbe removed under an ACA only if the supervisor concurs with the asylum officer’s findings. \nUSCIS291.  \nThis Lawsuit. On January 15, 2020, two organizations that provide legal services to asylum \nseekers and six individual Plaintiffs filed this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Compl. \n¶¶ 20-32, Prayer for Relief. Plaintiffs allege that the Rule and guidance deny covered aliens “the \nright to apply for asylum in the United States,” subvert the “legal framework for accepting \nrefugees,” id. ¶¶ 5, 17, and “severely limit[ ] their ability to access protection from persecution” \nby “prevent[ing them] from applying for asylum” in the United States, id. ¶ 147. Each individual \nPlaintiff has already been issued an expedited-removal order and been removed to Guatemala \nunder the Rule and ACA. Id. ¶ 20. \n The organizational Plaintiffs Las Americas and Tahirih Justice Center allege that the Rule \nand  guidance  “frustrate”  their  “mission  of  providing  legal  services”  to  asylum  seekers  by \npreventing aliens from “making it through the credible fear process,” and removing them before \nthese organizations have a chance to represent them, potentially affecting particular funding \nsources, id. ¶¶ 148-49, 152, 154, and prevent aliens from reaching “full removal proceedings,” or \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 25 of 77\n \nrequire investment of more resources when they do,” id. ¶¶ 148, 153. The organizations also allege \nharm from the lack of “opportunity to comment on the Rule.” Id. ¶¶ 154-55.  \nPlaintiffs bring six APA claims and one constitutional claim. First, they claim that the rule \nconflicts with the statute governing ACAs, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A), and so is contrary to law. \nCompl. ¶¶ 156-62; see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Second, Plaintiffs claim that the rule is inconsistent \nwith 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and its implementing regulations, which govern claims for withholding \nof removal raised in full removal proceedings, and so is contrary to law. Compl. ¶¶ 163-68; \nsee 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Third, Plaintiffs allege that the rule is inconsistent with 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1),  the  provision  authorizing  expedited-removal  procedures,  and  its  implementing \nregulations, and so is contrary to law. Compl. ¶¶ 169-74; see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Fourth, \nPlaintiffs assert that the rule unlawfully departs from “prior policy,” and is therefore “arbitrary and \ncapricious.” Compl. ¶¶ 175-76; see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Fifth, they allege that the government’s \nfinding that Guatemala provides access to “full and fair procedures” for asylum or related claims \nis unreasonable, and therefore arbitrary and capricious. Compl. ¶¶ 177-80; see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b), \n(c), (d). Sixth, Plaintiffs claim the rule violates the APA because it was issued without notice and \nan opportunity to comment and was published less than 30 days before its effective date. Compl. \n¶¶ 181-83;  see  5  U.S.C.  §  553(b),  (c),  (d).  Seventh,  they  allege  that  the  rule  violates  the \nConstitution’s Suspension Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2, because the relevant statute bars \n“judicial review” of individual orders of “expedited removal.” Compl. ¶¶ 184-86.  \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that the Rule and guidance are unlawful, vacatur of the Rule \nand guidance, a universal permanent injunction preventing implementation of the Rule and \nguidance (effectively enjoining implementation of any future ACA), and an order vacating the \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 26 of 77\n \nremoval orders of each individual named Plaintiff and paroling these six Plaintiffs into the United \nStates to allow them to apply for asylum. Id., Prayer for Relief.  \nPlaintiffs filed their summary-judgment motion on February 28, 2020. \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and grant summary \njudgment in favor of the government. This Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction; Plaintiffs lack \nstanding and the organizational Plaintiffs are not within the INA’s zone of interests; all of \nPlaintiffs’ claims lack merit; and—even if their claims had merit—their requested injunctive relief \nis foreclosed by the relevant statutory provisions and, in any event, far too broad. \nI.  The claims are non-justiciable. \nA.  The Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs contend that this “Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nand under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).” Compl. ¶ 18; see also Mot. 13-14. This is incorrect.  \nAs explained below, various provisions of the INA bar jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. \nSection 1252(e)(3), the only possible basis for jurisdiction here, is strictly limited to particular \ntypes of challenges to regulations and policies that implement the expedited-removal statute, which \nthe Rule and guidance do not do. Plaintiffs argue that “[t]he policies challenged here purport to \nimplement expedited removal,” Mot. 14, but there is no basis for this assertion and Plaintiffs cite \nnothing to support it. To the contrary, the Rule and guidance implement the Attorney General’s \nauthority under § 1158(a)(2)(A). Because Plaintiffs lack jurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3), and other \nprovisions of § 1252 bar any other challenges to expedited removal “[n]otwithstanding” any other \nprovision of law,” § 1252(a)(2)(A), (B), this Court also lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 27 of 77\n \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. See Patchak v. Zinke, 138 S. Ct. 897, 905 (2018) (phrase “notwithstanding \nany other provision of law” in jurisdictional provision encompasses § 1331). \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). Section 1252(e)(3) does not provide jurisdiction to review any of \nPlaintiffs’ challenges to the Rule, the guidance, or the full-and-fair determinations. Section \n1252(e)(3),  titled  “Challenges  to  the  validity  of  the  system,”  provides  for  review  only  of \nregulations and written policies that establish the structure and procedures for the expedited-\nremoval system. Moreover, while § 1252(e)(3) authorizes “[j]udicial review of determinations \nunder section 1225(b)” and “its implementation,” Congress authorized review only of certain types \nof actions under § 1252(e)(3). Congress directed that review of any determination under § 1225(b) \nand its implementation of § 1225(b) “shall be limited to determinations of” whether “[§ 1225(b)], \nor any regulation issued to implement such section, is constitutional,” and whether “a regulation, \nor a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the \nauthority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is not consistent with applicable \nprovisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.” Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). This \nsection permits review of the validity of § 1225(b)(1) itself and regulations and policies that flesh \nout its structure and procedure. See AILA, 199 F.3d at 1364 (affirming district court’s rejection of \nchallenges to initial adoption of procedural framework for the expedited-removal process).  \nThe Rule and guidance do not “implement” § 1225(b) or the expedited-removal process; \nthey implement provisions of § 1158(a), the asylum statute. That latter statute generally provides \n“[a]uthority to apply for asylum” for certain aliens, who “may apply for asylum” in various ways \n“in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b).” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1). But \nthe following subsection provides “Exceptions” and authorizes the Attorney General to determine \ncertain categories of aliens for whom the authorization to seek asylum in § 1158(a)(1) does not \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 28 of 77\n \napply,  including  aliens  determined  to  fall  under  the  “[s]afe  third  country”  exception  in \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A). It is this exception that the Rule and guidance implement, and neither says \nanything about the implementation or operations of the expedited-removal statute, § 1225(b). The \nexpedited-removal statute, § 1225(b)(1)(A), provides that arriving aliens and certain other aliens \nare subject to expedited removal if they are determined to be inadmissible under § 1182(a)(6)(C) \nor § 1182(a)(7). 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A). These aliens are ordered “removed from the United \nStates without further hearing or review unless” the alien can “apply for asylum under section 1158 \nof this title” and expresses an intent to do so. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). The Rule and guidance \njust define the universe of aliens who may “apply for asylum under section 1158,” and, as relevant \nhere, the threshold screening contemplated by the Rule and guidance do nothing more than identify \nwhich aliens fall within that universe.  \nThe Rule and guidance do not change how the expedited-removal statute operates. Under \nthe expedited-removal statute, an alien who may apply for asylum and expresses an intent to do so \ngoes through the process provided for asylum claims raised in expedited-removal proceedings, \nwhich begins under § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) with an immigration officer referring the alien to an \nasylum officer for the credible-fear interview provided for by § 1225(b)(1)(B). After evaluating \nwhether the alien “has a credible fear of persecution,” the asylum officer determines whether the \nalien  should  be  held  for  “further  consideration  of  the  application  for  asylum.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Alternatively, aliens who are barred from applying \nfor asylum or who do not express a fear of persecution or intent to apply for asylum as permitted \nby § 1158, are removed without further hearing or review under § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), and do not \nreach the start of the expedited-removal asylum process in § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). This was true \nbefore the Rule, and remains true today. The Rule and guidance, which address only threshold \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 29 of 77\n \ndeterminations  of  whether  an  alien  falls  under  the  safe-third-country  exception  codified  in \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A), are thus not an “implementation” of § 1225(b). Neither the Rule nor the guidance \ngives any effect to § 1225(b) or changes how it operates, and neither fulfills any specific obligation \nof the expedited-removal provisions in § 1225(b)(1). See Webster’s Third International Dictionary \n(1987) (defining “implement” as “to give practical effect to and ensure of actual fulfillment by \nconcrete measures”). \nPlaintiffs’ challenges are thus not “[c]hallenges to the validity of the [expedited-removal] \nsystem” or to a regulation or policy that implements § 1225(b), and so § 1252(e)(3) provides no \njurisdiction for their claims. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3); see also H.R. Rep. 104-828 (Sept. 24, 1996) \n(conference report), at 220 (“Section [1252](e)(3) provides for limited judicial review of the \nvalidity of procedures under section [1225](b)(1).” (emphasis added)). Nor were the Rule and \nguidance “issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement [§ 1225(b)].” Id. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). They were issued under § 1158 and the Attorney General’s general authority \nunder § 1103(g)(2) to “establish such regulations,” “issue such instructions,” and “perform such \nother acts” as he determines are necessary for carrying out the provisions of the INA. See also id. \n§ 1103(a)(3) (providing similar authority to the Secretary of DHS); 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,997 (citing \nthese provisions as the “DOJ and DHS authority to promulgate this Rule”). If Congress had sought \nto permit review under § 1252(e)(3) of any decision, rule, or guidance implementing other INA \nprovisions that are incidental to credible-fear proceedings, it would have listed as subject to review \ndecisions concerning all substantive provisions of the INA, rather than just decisions, rules, and \nguidance issued “to implement” § 1225(b) itself. It did not do so. See id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(i) & (ii).  \nThe organizational Plaintiffs’ attempts to invoke jurisdiction under § 1252(e)(3) fail for all \nof the above reasons and others, as well. Only an individual who is subject to expedited-removal \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 30 of 77\n \nprocedures at the time a suit is initiated may invoke § 1252(e)(3). Again, § 1252(e)(3) authorizes \nreview of the “implementation” of certain expedited-removal procedures only if Plaintiffs are in \nfact subject to “determinations under section 1225(b) of this title.” This is further demonstrated by \nthe fact that § 1252(e)(3) appears in a section titled “[j]udicial review of orders under section \n1225(b)(1).” (Emphasis added). Section 1252(e)(3) thus grants jurisdiction only if there is a \nreviewable “determination[]” or “order[]” “under section 1225(b).” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). As \norganizations, these Plaintiffs have not, and could not, be subject to any determination under \n§ 1225(b), and they lack standing to raise the claims of others who are subject to such orders. \nSee AILA, 199 F.3d at 1360 (“Congress meant to allow litigation challenging the new [expedited-\nremoval] system by, and only by, aliens against whom the new procedures had been applied.” \n(emphasis added)). \n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3). Plaintiffs’ claims are also foreclosed by 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3). The \nDepartment heads promulgated the Rule under § 1158(a)(2)(A). That provision authorizes the \nDepartments to “determine[ ]” of “find[]” three things at issue here: (1) whether “the alien may be \nremoved, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country ... in which the alien’s life \nor freedom would not be threatened” on a protected ground; (2) whether “the alien would have \naccess to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary \nprotection” in that country; and, (3) whether “it is in the public interest for the alien to receive \nasylum in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A). Congress provided that “[n]o court shall \nhave jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General [or the Secretary] under \n[§ 1158(a)(2)(A)].”  Id.  § 1158(a)(3)  (emphasis  added).  The  phrase  “any  determination”  in \n§ 1158(a)(3) refers to each thing the government “determines” under § 1158(a)(2)(A), and bars \nreview  of  Plaintiffs’  challenges  to  these  determinations,  including  the  determination  that \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 31 of 77\n \nGuatemala has “a full and fair procedure for determining” asylum and other protection claims, or \nthat an alien removed to Guatemala will not face persecution there. Mot. 29-31 \nIn § 1158(a)(3), Congress barred review of any determination under § 1158(a)(2)(A), \nincluding any challenge to the process of making these determinations. See Jimenez-Mora v. \nAshcroft, 86 F. App’x 527, 530 (3d Cir. 2004) (§ 1158(a)(3) bars review of “challenges to the \nprocess of deciding” or reaching the ultimate determination). Congress’s use of “determines” \ncoupled with the judicial-review bar at § 1158(a)(3) shows that Congress meant to shield from \nreview not just a final “determination,” but the “method for reaching that final decision.” Bourdon \nv.  DHS,  940  F.3d  537,  542  (11th  Cir.  2019).  Congress’s  decision  in  § 1158(a)(3)  to  limit \n“jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General [or the Secretary] under” \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A) would have no effect if parties could challenge the ultimate determination by \nchallenging the Departments’ decisions on how to best reach that determination. See Jimenez-\nMora, 86 F. App’x at 530 (rejecting argument that claim “merely involves a collateral attack on \nthe procedures used in making a determination,” because otherwise “it is hard to imagine a case \nthat would not fall outside the jurisdictional bar of § 1158(a)(3)”). The judicial-review bar in \n§ 1158(a)(3) thus precludes any challenge to the procedures or process by which the agencies \nchoose to implement their unreviewable authority under § 1158(a)(2)(A). See, e.g., Bourdon, 940 \nF.3d at 542 (collecting cases); Gebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980, 987 (9th Cir. 2018); Bremer v. \nJohnson, 834 F.3d 925, 930 (8th Cir. 2016); Lee v. USCIS, 592 F.3d 612, 620 (4th Cir. 2010); Am. \nSoc’y of Cataract & Refractive Surgery v. Thompson, 279 F.3d 447, 452 (7th Cir. 2002); cf. \nStruniak v. Lynch, 159 F.Supp.3d 643, 654 (E.D. Va. 2016) (holding that provision precluding \n“jurisdiction to review [] the ultimate decision” also bars review of “the steps that are a necessary \nand ancillary part of reaching the ultimate decision”). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 32 of 77\n \nThis limit on jurisdiction extends to each of Plaintiffs’ claims that challenge the way in \nwhich the Rule and guidance make the determinations contemplated by § 1158(a)(2)(A). Compl. \n¶¶ 156-80 (Claims I-V). Plaintiffs claim that the Rule and guidance provide an inadequate process \nfor determining that an alien’s life or freedom will not be threatened in the destination country, \nthat he will have “access to a full and fair procedure,” and that it is not in the public interest for \nhim to seek asylum in the United States, Compl. ¶¶ 156-60, 63-67, 69-72; Mot. 15-21 (Claims I-\nIII); that the manner in which these determinations are made under the Rule and guidance \n“depart[s] from prior agency policies” for making these determinations and failed to consider \nimportant  aspects  of  the  problem,  Compl.  ¶  175;  Mot.  21-27  (Claim  IV);  and,  that  the \ndetermination process is “ill-suited to achieving” the aims of that statute, Compl. ¶ 178-80 (Claim \nV); Mot. 35-36. Each of these claims purports to challenge both the result and the process—\nincluding the standard applied and the burden of proof—by which the Departments “determine” \nunder § 1158(a)(2)(A) whether “alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened” on a protected \nground in a third country or whether that country has a “full and fair procedure for determining a \nclaim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.”  \nSection 1158(a)(2)(A) thus grants the agencies unreviewable authority to determine that an \nalien is subject to its provisions and to determine that the alien is categorically barred from \napplying for asylum “unless the Attorney General finds that it is in the public interest for the alien \nto receive asylum in the United States.” Section 1158(a)(2)(A) does not refer narrowly to “an \napplication,” or contain any other provisions implying that broader procedural decisions about how \nto adjudicate whether an alien falls under the safe-third-country provision in § 1158(a)(2)(A) are \noutside  the  scope  of  the  agency’s  discretion  or  the  scope  of  the  bar  to  judicial  review  in \n§ 1158(a)(3). Section 1158(a)(3) thus forecloses jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ first five claims. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 33 of 77\n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) also limits jurisdiction to review the \nagencies’  discretionary  determinations  under  § 1158(a)(2)(A),  and  their  chosen  means  of \nimplementing it through the Rule and the guidance. In § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress stated that \n“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), . . . no court shall have \njurisdiction to review” “any ... decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion \nof the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief \nunder section 1158(a) of this title.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Such decisions must be “specified \nunder [8 U.S.C. §§ 1151–1378] to be in the discretion” of the Secretary. Kucana v. Holder, 558 \nU.S. 233, 239 (2010). But the fact that a specific provision does not use the word “discretion” does \nnot mean § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not apply. See Zhu v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 292, 295 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (citing § 1158(a) as an example of how “a decision may be ‘specified … to be in the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General’ even if the grant of authority to make that decision does not \nuse the word ‘discretion’”). Rather, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies if the judgment to be rendered is, \nby statute, “entirely within [the] judgment or conscience” of the Secretary. Spencer Enters., Inc. v. \nUnited States, 345 F.3d 683, 690 (2003). The statute simply must “vest[] the government with \nauthority to make a discretionary decision.” Poursina v. USCIS, 936 F.3d 868, 871 (9th Cir. 2019). \nSection 1158(a)(2)(A) does just that. The statute gives the Attorney General the authority \nto “determine[ ] that the alien may be removed pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement,” \nthat “the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened” on account of a protected ground, and \nthat “the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or \nequivalent temporary protection.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A). This grant of authority does not \nprovide any statutory standard to apply—it calls for the exercise of “expertise and judgment \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 34 of 77\n \nunfettered by any statutory standard whatsoever.” Zhu, 411 F.3d at 295. Section 1158(a)(3) \ncategorically bars review of the exercise of that expertise and judgment, and the decision to apply \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A) to a specific alien, through the Rule or otherwise, is thus “‘entirely discretionary’” \nand covered by § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See Poursina, 936 F.3d at 872. \nIn addition, Congress’s use of the prefatory “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law” \nin  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  “clearly  signals  the  drafter’s  intention  that  the  provisions  of  the \n‘notwithstanding’ section override conflicting provisions of any other section.” Cisneros v. Alpine \nRidge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18, (1993). The unambiguous text provides a clear statement that such \ndiscretionary decisions not be subject to judicial review, and “supersede[s] all other laws.” Liberty \nMaritime Corp. v. United States, 928 F.2d 413, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (“clearer statement of law” \nthan a “‘notwithstanding clause’” “is difficult to imagine”). Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) squarely \nremoves from federal courts any jurisdiction—including federal-question jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C.  § 1331—to  review  discretionary  determinations  such  as  those  contemplated  by \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A), and bars Plaintiffs’ claims I through V challenging these determinations. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Plaintiffs also purport to challenge the application of the Rule to \naliens in regular removal proceedings before immigration judges. Compl. ¶¶ 76-78, 148, 153, 160. \nBut even if Plaintiffs were individuals who were in such proceedings—which they are not, so they \nlack standing to raise these claims—the INA strips district courts of jurisdiction to review any \n“questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory \nprovisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United \nStates.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9). Such review “shall be available only through judicial review of a \nfinal order under this section” and no district court “shall have jurisdiction ... to review such an \norder or such questions of law or fact.” J.E.F.M. v. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2016). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 35 of 77\n \nSection 1252(b)(9) limits review of all claims challenging procedures applied in full removal \nproceedings to an appeal brought by an individual alien in the court of appeals after his removal \nproceedings  are  over.  Id.  at  1032.  This  provision  thus  bars  claims  raised  by  organizations \nchallenging the rules that apply to third-party aliens in removal proceedings, see P.L. v. U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, No. 1:19-CV-01336, 2019 WL 2568648, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nJune 21, 2019), including “policies-and-practices challenges,” J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032, arising \nfrom any “action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(9), whether or not the challenge is to an actual final order of removal or whether there \neven is a final order at all. See J.E.F.M., 837 F.3d at 1032. Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs \nraise any claims challenging the application of the Rule to aliens in full removal proceedings, those \nclaims are barred by § 1252(b)(9). \nCongress similarly made clear that no party other than the United States could litigate \nchallenges to removal in the district courts by withdrawing jurisdiction for such causes of action \nthat had previously existed. Until Congress amended the INA to include the claim-channeling \nprovisions of § 1252, a separate provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1329, provided an affirmative basis for \njurisdiction in federal district courts for suits filed by any alien or organization challenging \nimplementation of the immigration laws. See, e.g., Bains v. Schiltgen, No. C 97-2573 SI, 1998 WL \n204977, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 1998) (describing statute’s prior version). But Congress amended \n§ 1329 in 1996, “making clear that district court jurisdiction founded on the immigration statute is \nconfined to actions brought by the government.” Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1162 \n(D.C. Cir. 1999). This provision makes clear that organizational plaintiffs like those here have no \ncause of action under the INA to raise challenges related to removal proceedings.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 36 of 77\n \nB.  Plaintiffs lack Article III standing and are not within the zone of interests. \nPlaintiffs have not suffered any cognizable injury sufficient to establish Article III standing. \nTo satisfy the “‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of standing” under Article III, a party must \ndemonstrate that it has “(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992)). “Foremost among these requirements is injury in fact—a plaintiff’s \npleading and proof that he has suffered the ‘invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete \nand particularized.’” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1929 (2018) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n560). Plaintiffs must separately establish standing and jurisdiction for each claim they raise and \neach form of relief they seek. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 335 (2006).  \nOrganizational Standing. Organizations cannot establish standing by alleging injuries of \nthird parties. Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1689 (2017). Where, as here, an \norganization sues on its own behalf, it must establish standing in the same manner as an individual. \nSee Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975). A party “lacks standing to contest the policies of \nthe prosecuting authority when [it] is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.” Linda \nR.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973); see also Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Gracey, 809 F.2d \n794, 804-07 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (applying principle to immigration context); AILA, 199 F.3d at 1364 \n(rejecting organizational standing “to raise claims, whether statutory or constitutional, on behalf \nof aliens,” noting “judicial presumption against suits seeking relief for a large and diffuse group \nof individuals, none of whom are party to the lawsuit”). \nThe  organizational  Plaintiffs  seek  to  establish  standing  under  Havens  Realty  Corp. \nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363 (1982), which held that organizations can establish standing in certain \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 37 of 77\n \nlimited circumstances based on interference with their missions. Compl. ¶¶ 148-55; Mot. 14. But, \nnotably, Havens arose under a private right of action under the Fair Housing Act, and Congress’s \naim to allow private enforcement of statutory prohibitions against discriminatory housing practices \ndrove the Court’s standing analysis in that case. 455 U.S. at 373-74. This is a far different context \nfrom the INA, where Congress has made plain its interest in limiting all review to claims from \nindividual aliens who are directly affected. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), (b)(9), (e). The INA confers \nno “legally cognizable interests,” Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1549, on advocacy organizations, and such \norganizations have “no judicially cognizable interest” related to “enforcement of the immigration \nlaws,” Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883, 897 (1984). An organization similarly cannot show \nan invasion of a legally protected interest based solely on the fact that a change in law may affect \nfuture clients and, in turn, Plaintiffs’ decisions about how to allocate resources. See Arpaio \nv. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (rejecting standing from alleged injuries from \n“[p]rojected increases ... in the county’s policing burden and jail population”). \nEven if Havens applied, it would not be satisfied here. The D.C. Circuit has interpreted \nHavens to impose a two-part test for determining “whether an organization’s injury is concrete \nand demonstrable or merely a setback to its abstract social interests.” PETA v. United States Dep’t \nof Agric., 797 F.3d 1087, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2015). First the Court asks “whether the defendant’s \nallegedly unlawful activities injured the plaintiff’s interest in promoting its mission.” Am. Soc. for \nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Entm’t, Inc., 659 F.3d 13, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2011). “If the \nanswer is yes, [it] then ask[s] whether the plaintiff used its resources to counteract that injury.” Id. \nHere, the organizational Plaintiffs do not satisfy these requirements. \nTo satisfy the first element, the government’s conduct must “directly conflict with the \norganization’s mission.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1430 (D.C. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 38 of 77\n \nCir. 1996). Standing exists only when “the action challenged ... [is] at loggerheads with the stated \nmission of the plaintiff.” Id. at 1429; see also PETA, 797 F.3d at 1095; cf. PETA, 797 F.3d at 1100-\n01 (Millett, J., dubitante) (criticizing expansive readings of Havens and noting that the case \ninvolved “direct, concrete, and immediate injury” to the organization’s services based on a \n“specific legal right”). Plaintiffs state that their missions involve “providing legal services to” \nasylum seekers and individuals fleeing violence, Compl. ¶¶ 148, 152, but even under the Rule, \nlarge numbers of aliens will continue to be placed in full removal proceedings or go through the \ncredible-fear process, and nothing in the Rule prevents the organizations from continuing to \nrepresent large numbers of asylum-seeking clients. \nFor similar reasons, Plaintiffs also fail to show that they have diverted resources in a \nmanner that confers standing. Plaintiffs do not allege that the Rule will decrease their overall client \nbase or result in a shortage of asylum seekers in need of legal services. They have put forth no \nevidence is support of their allegations that the Rule threatens their funding, Compl. ¶¶ 149, 154, \neven from “per-case funding” sources, Mot. 15. Both organizations also allege that they will have \nto expend resources “to represent clients in regular removal proceedings” to help clients who are \nineligible for asylum apply for other forms of protection. Mot. 14-15. But D.C. Circuit “precedent \nmakes clear that an organization’s use of resources for litigation, investigation in anticipation of \nlitigation, or advocacy is not sufficient to give rise to an Article III injury.” Food & Water Watch, \nInc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 919 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also Nat’l Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. United \nStates, 68 F.3d 1428, 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“The mere fact that an organization redirects some \nof its resources to litigation and legal counseling in response to actions or inactions of another \nparty is insufficient to impart standing upon the organization.”); cf. Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, \n568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013) (no standing where plaintiffs’ costly measures to avoid government \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 39 of 77\n \nsurveillance they believed reasonably likely were “self-inflicted”). Even in the fair-housing \ncontext, an organization alleging standing under Havens must establish that it would have suffered \nsome other injury if it had not diverted resources to counteracting the problem, because otherwise \nthe diversion of resources is a purely self-inflicted injury that cannot support standing. See Fair \nEmpl. Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Marketing, 28 F.3d 1268, 1276-77 (D.C. Cir. \n1994).  \nFinally, both organizations allege harm based on the lack of “opportunity to comment on \nthe Rule before it [went] into effect.” Compl. ¶ 155; see also Mot. 15. But “deprivation of a \nprocedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation—a procedural \nright in vacuo—is insufficient to create Article III standing.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 \nU.S. 488, 496 (2009); cf. Am. Ass’n for Homecare v. Leavitt, No. 08-cv-0992, 2008 WL 2580217, \nat *5 (D.D.C. June 30, 2008) (“procedural violation alone without showing another actual injury” \ninsufficient). In any event, this injury would only supply Article III standing for one claim. \nZone of Interests. The organizational Plaintiffs’ claims are also outside the zone of interests \nof the statutes that they invoke. The APA does not “allow suit by every person suffering injury in \nfact.” Clarke v. Secs. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 395 (1987). It provides a cause of action only to \none “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 702. To be “aggrieved,” “the interest sought to be protected” must “be arguably within \nthe zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute ... in question.” Clarke, 479 U.S. at \n396 (modifications omitted). “[O]n any given claim the injury that supplies constitutional standing \nmust be the same as the injury within the requisite ‘zone of interests.’” Mountain States Legal \nFound. v. Glickman, 92 F.3d 1228, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The organizational Plaintiffs do not \nargue that they are in the zone of interests, and invoke no such interest here. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 40 of 77\n \nNothing in the INA or its asylum provisions even arguably suggests that it protects the \ninterests of nonprofit organizations “providing legal services to detained asylum seekers.” Compl. \n¶ 148; id. ¶ 152. The asylum provisions neither regulate the organizational Plaintiffs’ conduct nor \ncreate any benefits for which these organizations themselves might be eligible. And courts have \nroutinely  concluded  that  immigration  statutes  are  directed  at  aliens,  not  the  organizations \nadvocating for them. When confronted with a similar challenge brought by “organizations that \nprovide legal help to immigrants,” Justice O’Connor concluded that the Immigration Reform and \nControl Act “was clearly meant to protect the interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests \nof [such] organizations,” and the fact that a “regulation may affect the way an organization \nallocates its resources ... does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests \nthe statute meant to protect.” INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of L.A. Cty., 510 U.S. 1301, \n1305 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers). The D.C. Circuit and other courts have thus held that \nimmigrant advocacy organizations are outside the immigration statutes’ zone of interests. See, e.g., \nFed’n for Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. (FAIR) v. Reno, 93 F.3d 897, 900-04 (D.C. Cir. 1996).3 \nThat reasoning fully applies here. Plaintiffs are not applying for asylum; they seek to help others \ndo so. Nothing in “the relevant provisions [can] be fairly read to implicate [Plaintiffs’] interest in \nthe efficient use of resources.” Nw. Immigrant Rights Project v. USCIS, 325 F.R.D. 671, 688 (W.D. \nWash. 2016). Because Plaintiffs are simply bystanders to the statutory scheme, the (alleged) effects \non their resources are outside the statutory zone of interests.4 \n                                                 \n3 While the Ninth Circuit recently held otherwise in East Bay, 909 F.3d at 1243-44, it did not \nconsider FAIR, 93 F.3d at 903, which held that persons were outside the zone of interests of the \nINA provisions that they challenged even though they were within the zone of interests of another \nstatutory provision. Regardless, East Bay conflicts with controlling D.C. Circuit authority. \n4 The INA itself confirms that such organizations are not within the zone of interests. An alien’s \nchallenge to an asylum determination must occur in individual removal proceedings, and others \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 41 of 77\n \nThe procedural nature of some of the organizational Plaintiffs’ claims makes no difference. \nA plaintiff asserting a violation of the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements must still show a \nconcrete Article III injury that comes within the zone of interests protected by the underlying \nsubstantive statute upon which their claims are based—here, the INA. See Mendoza v. Perez, 754 \nF.3d 1002, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs have not done so. \nStanding of the Individual Plaintiffs. The individual Plaintiffs similarly lack standing for \nany of their claims challenging the Rule, the guidance, or the full-and-fair determinations.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs lack standing to request any prospective injunctive relief related to the \nRule, the guidance, or the full-and-fair determinations. A plaintiff seeking prospective relief must \nshow more than Article III standing to challenge past injuries; he must demonstrate a “real and \nimmediate threat that the injury will be repeated.” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 107 \n(1983). Plaintiffs have proffered no allegations that they are likely to be subject to the Rule at some \npoint in the future, and even if they had, such allegations would be speculative. Plaintiffs cannot \nseek prospective relief absent a showing either of “continuing, present adverse effects” or “a \nsufficient likelihood that [they] will again be wronged in a similar way.” O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488, 495-96 (1974); Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111. Plaintiffs thus lack standing to seek prospective \ninjunctive relief on their APA claims challenging the Rule and guidance (Claims I-VI). \nSecond, none of the individual Plaintiffs has standing to raise challenges to limitations on \napplying for asylum in the United States because none of them was eligible for asylum even if the \nRule did not exist. Each individual Plaintiff transited through a third country in the second half of \n                                                 \nmay not bring suit on their behalf. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a); see Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. \n340, 351 (1984). And as to any change to expedited removal, should Plaintiffs’ claims be construed \nas challenging such changes, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) creates the exclusive review scheme for such \nchallenges and precludes organizational challenges. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 42 of 77\n \n2019 on their way to the United States, and none of them sought asylum or other protection in \nthose countries before arriving to the United States. See ECF No. 1, Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 19-25; Ex. 2 at \n¶¶ 5, 18, 20; Ex. 3 at ¶¶ 26-28, 30; Ex. 4 at ¶¶ 16-18. All the individual Plaintiffs were thus barred \nfrom receiving asylum in the United States under an Interim Final Rule titled “Asylum Eligibility \nand Procedural Modifications.” 84 Fed. Reg. 33,829. Under that rule, which was issued in July \n2019, “an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border after \nfailing to apply for protection in a third country outside the alien’s country of citizenship, \nnationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which the alien transited en route to the United \nStates is ineligible for asylum.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 33,830. Accordingly, even if the ACA Rule had \nnot prevented Plaintiffs from applying for asylum, none of them would have been eligible to \nreceive asylum here anyway. See Barr v. East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 140 S. Ct. 3 (2019). \nPlaintiffs thus cannot claim any injury caused by the ACA, the Rule, or the guidance based on the \ntheory they were prevented from obtaining asylum in the United States and so they lack standing.  \nIt does not matter that aliens who are ineligible for asylum based on the third-country transit \nrule might, if in removal proceedings before an immigration judge, still seek withholding of \nremoval or CAT protection. 84 Fed. Reg. at 33,837-38. These protections apply only with respect \nto a particular country to which an immigration judge orders an alien removed, generally the alien’s \nhome country. Plaintiffs were removed to a third country, rather than their home countries or other \ncountries to which DHS otherwise would have sought to remove them in full removal proceedings. \nSee 8  U.S.C.  § 1231(b)(1)(A).  Plaintiffs  cannot  claim  any  injury  based  on  not  having  an \nopportunity to apply for protection from removal to a country to which the government did not \nultimately send them. See, e.g., Mejia, 866 F.3d at 579. In other words, even if a Plaintiff had been \nin full removal proceedings and an immigration judge ordered him removed to, for example, El \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 43 of 77\n \nSalvador, a grant of withholding to El Salvador would limit only his removal to that country and \nnot limit his removal to Guatemala or any other country. Such a grant would have no effect \nwhatsoever if the government is not seeking to remove him to El Salvador, and would provide no \nbenefit to the alien otherwise because a grant of protection does not provide an alien with any right \nto live in or any avenue to obtain any status in the United States, see Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. \nat 429 n.6, so a lost opportunity to apply for these protections had no effect, and caused no injury \nthat can confer standing.5  \nII.  The government is entitled to summary judgment on all claims. \nA.  The Rule and guidance do not violate statutes governing removal to a third \ncountry, expedited removal, or for withholding of removal (Claims I - III). \n \nThe  Rule,  the  guidance,  and  the  government’s  full-and-fair  determinations  are  fully \nconsistent with other provisions of the INA. Section 1158(a)(2)(A) bars an alien from applying for \nasylum in this country if two threshold conditions are met: “the Attorney General determines that” \n“the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other \nthan the country of the alien’s nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, the \ncountry of the alien’s last habitual residence) in which the alien’s life or freedom would not be \nthreatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion,” and determines that “the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure \nfor determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A). \nThe only exception to such a determination for covered aliens is if the “the Attorney General finds \nthat it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United States.” Id. \n                                                 \n5 Moreover, in certain circumstances, even an alien who was granted asylum may nonetheless be \nremoved to a third country  pursuant to a bilateral agreement. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(2)(C). \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 44 of 77\n \nThe Rule satisfies each of the requirements of § 1158(a)(2)(A). First, on July 26, 2019, the \nUnited States and Guatemala signed a bilateral agreement governing removal from the United \nStates to Guatemala. DOJFF99-105. Consistent with § 1158(a)(2)(A), the ACA exempts any alien \nfor whom Guatemala is “the country of the alien’s nationality or, in the case of an alien having no \nnationality, the country of the alien’s last habitual residence.” DOJFF99-105. Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge the validity of this ACA. Second, through the Rule, the Attorney General and the Acting \nSecretary of Homeland Security have established a procedure to ensure that an “alien’s life or \nfreedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion,” if removed to Guatemala. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A); \nsee 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009. The Rule establishes a process for assessing and determining in each \nindividual case whether an alien has a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground and \nprovides for an interview and a procedure that requires concurrence of a supervisory official. \nSee 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009. Third, the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary both determined \nthat Guatemala provides “access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or \nequivalent temporary protection.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A); see DHSFF1282; DOJFF6-7. They \nreached this categorical determination after careful review of the Guatemalan Migration Code and \nits implementing regulations, discussion between officials from both countries, and information \nprovided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and information from \nthe State Department and other sources. DOJFF6; DHSFF1282. The statute requires nothing more. \nAILA v. Reno, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 55-56 (D.D.C. 1998), aff’d, 199 F.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000) \n(cannot “impose upon the Attorney General any obligation to afford more procedures than the \ngoverning statute explicitly requires or that she has chosen to afford in her discretion.”). \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 45 of 77\n \n  Plaintiffs also challenge USCIS’s guidance addressing the Rule, but this guidance merely \nimplements the Rule and the U.S.-Guatemala ACA, and Plaintiffs do not make any particular \narguments related to the guidance that are separate from the Rule for their first three claims. \nSee generally Mot. 15-21. Consistent with statute and the Rule, the guidance sets out how to \ndetermine whether an alien is covered by an ACA and whether the alien’s life or freedom would \nbe threatened on account of a protected ground in the relevant third country. USCIS349-72. This \nguidance simply tracks the language of the Rule, which itself is consistent with § 1158(a)(2)(A). \nNothing more is required. In any event, the guidance is not subject to APA review. See Broadgate \nInc. v. USCIS, 730 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (D.D.C. 2010) (“interpretive rules and general policy \nstatements” are not reviewable under the APA). \nPlaintiffs’ primary argument is that the Rule and guidance are inconsistent with INA \nprovisions barring aliens from applying for asylum if they may be removed to a third country, \nsee 8  U.S.C.  § 1158(a)(2)(A),  the  credible-fear  provisions  in  the  expedited-removal  statute, \nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), and the withholding and CAT statutes, see 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b), and are \nthus contrary to law under the APA. Mot. 15-21. Each claim fails.  \n    8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). Plaintiffs contend that the Rule violates statutory provisions governing \ncredible-fear  interviews  under  § 1225(b)(1)(B)  for  asylum  seekers  in  expedited-removal \nproceedings and argue that there is a “requirement that asylum seekers in expedited removal can \nbe removed only through the credible fear process.” Mot. 16. This is incorrect. It a is well-\nestablished principle rooted in prosecutorial discretion that DHS has discretion to choose whether \nto place an alien in “expedited removal or other forms of removal.” Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727 \nF.3d 873, 878 (9th Cir. 2013). There is no statutory requirement that an alien who is categorically \nineligible to even apply for asylum must nevertheless go through expedited-removal procedures \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 46 of 77\n \nthat provide an alien applying for asylum with a credible-fear interview. Section 1225(b)(1) \nrequires only that an alien be referred for a credible-fear interview if he indicates an “intention to \napply  for  asylum  under  section  1158  of  this  title  or  a  fear  of  persecution.”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). But 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), titled “Exceptions,” excludes certain aliens from \nthe opportunity to apply for asylum, including those aliens subject to § 1158(a)(2)(A)’s safe-third-\ncountry provision, and creates a categorical bar to asylum applications for these aliens. \n    An  alien  who  is  categorically  barred  from  applying  for  asylum  because  of \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A)—as an alien subject to the ACA is—cannot indicate a cognizable “intention to \napply for asylum,” and so is not entitled to referral to a credible-fear interview. Indeed, as already \nexplained, § 1158(a)(2) authorizes the Departments to set up a separate process preceding the \ncredible-fear process or regular removal proceedings for “determin[ing] that the alien may be \nremoved” to a particular country with which there is an ACA and “in which the alien’s life or \nfreedom would not be threatened,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)(A). Once that determination is made, the \nalien is categorically barred from applying for asylum, and so, contrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, \nsee Mot.  16,  the  Rule  is  consistent  with  § 1225(b)(1)  because  an  alien  who  is  subject  to \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A)  cannot  indicate  a  possible  “intention  to  apply  for  asylum  under  [§ 1158],” \n8 U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i),  and  is  barred  from  certain  portions  of  the  expedited-removal \nprocedures that apply to asylum applicants under § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), including credible-fear \ninterviews under § 1225(b)(1)(B). See also 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii) (heading) (governing \n“[c]laims for asylum”). \n    The screening process provided for by the Rule is thus consistent with § 1225(b) and the \npreceding section, § 1225(a), which provides that “all aliens ... who are applicants for admission \n... shall be inspected by immigration officers.” 8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(3). Aliens who cannot establish \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 47 of 77\n \n“clearly and beyond a doubt” that they are “entitled to be admitted” are generally placed, as a \nmatter of discretion, in expedited removal or removal proceedings under § 1229a. For an alien in \nprocedures under § 1225, if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum, they are referred \nto an asylum officer for a “credible fear” interview. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii). But again, an \nalien subject to § 1158(a)(2)(A) cannot cognizably assert “an intention to apply for asylum under \nsection 1158,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), and so is not entitled to the process for determining \nwhether he has a credible fear. The statute defines an alien as having a “credible fear” if “the alien \ncould establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.” Id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v). An \nalien subject to an ACA cannot establish such eligibility and, consistent with § 1158(a)(2)(A) and \n§ 1225(a), the Rule thus reasonably provides for a “threshold screening to determine whether an \nalien is barred from applying for asylum” “[d]irectly upon an initial inadmissibility or deportability \ndetermination.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,998.  \n    Indeed, the rule implementing the ACA with Canada similarly provides for a threshold \nscreening process that does not involve the alien completing the credible-fear process. See 69 Fed. \nReg. at 69,480 (setting up a “threshold screening process” for “prescreening of asylum and related \nclaims” to “determine ... whether aliens should be returned to Canada for consideration of their \nprotection claims”). As noted in that rule, “a careful reading of the Act makes clear that credible \nfear interviews are not required for aliens subject to [an ACA]” under “8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(1).” Id. \nImportantly, the provision governing “Asylum interviews” as part of the credible-fear process in \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii) states that, when an alien successfully completes the credible-fear interview \nprocess, “the alien shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.” \n(emphasis added). “Clearly, then, the credible fear interview process constitutes the initiation of \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 48 of 77\n \nthe asylum application process described in [§ 1158(a)(1)]” and is part of that application process. \n69 Fed. Reg. at 69,481.  \n    There  is  accordingly  no  conflict  between  the  Rule  and  § 1225(b)(1),  because \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A) allows the Departments to determine that certain aliens may not access the \nasylum-application process in the first place, and therefore for aliens subject to § 1158(a)(2)(A) \nno credible-fear interview process is required. \n    8  U.S.C.  § 1158(a)(2)(A).  Plaintiffs  next  make  several  arguments  that  the  Rule  and \nguidance violate the safe-third-country provision in § 1158(a)(2)(A), Mot. 17-20, but each of their \narguments lacks merit.  \nFirst, they argue that “the Rule and Guidance contravene the statute by failing to ensure \nthat all individuals will be free from persecution upon removal and, instead, assessing that danger \nonly when ‘the alien affirmatively states a fear of removal to [the third] country.’” Id. at 18. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Rule and guidance “compel[  ] removals that the statute expressly forbids.” \nId. Plaintiffs are incorrect. Under the Rule and guidance, an asylum officer must “advise the alien \nof the [ACA’s] exceptions and question the alien as to applicability of any of these exceptions,” \nand provide the alien with “written notice that if he or she fears removal to the prospective \nreceiving country because of a likelihood of persecution on account of a protected ground or torture \nin that country,” that “the alien should affirmatively state to the officer such a fear of removal.” 84 \nFed. Reg. at 64,009; USCIS354. Prior to the interview with an asylum officer, the alien is provided \nwith a written “tear sheet” that informs him that he “is potentially amenable to removal to \nGuatemala for consideration of [his] asylum or other protection claim(s),” that he “will be referred \nfor an interview with a U.S. asylum officer, so a determination can be made whether [he] meet[s] \nany exceptions to the [ACA],” and that, “[o]ver the next day, [he] may consult with a person or \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 49 of 77\n \npersons of [his] choosing prior to the interview by phone.” USCIS001. The tear sheet lays out the \nACA’s exceptions and further explains that if he does not “meet an exception to the” ACA, he \n“may be removed to Guatemala” where he can apply for “asylum or equivalent temporary \nprotection.” Id.  \nThe tear sheet also informs the alien that he “may express a fear of being removed to \nGuatemala or a fear of persecution or torture in Guatemala,” and that if he “express[es] a fear of \nremoval to Guatemala, [he] will be afforded the appropriate process.” USCIS001. The tear sheet \ntells the alien: “If you have such a fear, please inform the immigration officer who provided you \nthis form or any other immigration officer, or please ask to speak to a supervisor.” Id. In addition, \nthe asylum officer “must confirm that the individual received the Tear Sheet and understood its \ncontents,” and “provide an interpreter as needed.” USCIS314, 352. Moreover, if the asylum officer \n“determines the individual is unable to participate effectively in the interview because of illness, \nfatigue, or other impediments” then the officer “may reschedule the interview.” USCIS314, 352. \nThe Rule and guidance thus provide that any alien “potentially be subject to an ACA will \nbe advised that he or she may be removed to” Guatemala, 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,000, and encouraged \nto “please inform the immigration officer who provided” the form or “any other immigration \nofficer,” or to “please ask to speak to a supervisor,” if they have any fear of being sent to \nGuatemala, USCIS001. Any alien with a fear of removal to Guatemala has an opportunity and \nevery incentive to raise it,6 and if they do, the officer interviewing the alien to determine whether \nthe ACA applies will also “interview the alien to determine whether it is more likely than not that \nthe alien would be persecuted on account of a protected ground or tortured in the third country.” \n                                                 \n6 Various INA provisions governing protection claims similarly require aliens to affirmatively \nexpress a fear of removal to trigger screening. See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. §§ 238.1, 241.8(e).  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 50 of 77\n \n84 Fed. Reg. at 64,000. The officer “must create a summary of material facts as stated by the \nindividual,” “must review the summary with the alien and give him or her an opportunity to correct \nerrors,” USCIS352, 355, and if the officer finds that an alien has not met this standard, a \nsupervisory asylum officer must review and concur with the determination before a decision is \nmade to remove the alien, 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,009. The Rule and guidance thus do not conflict with \nthe § 1158(a)(2)(A)’s requirement to determine that an “alien’s life or freedom would not be \nthreatened” in Guatemala on account of a protected ground. \nSecond, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule and guidance are contrary to § 1158(a)(2)(A), by \n“erroneously placing the burden of proof on the asylum seeker.” Mot. 18-19. But where, as here, \nthe statute does not set a precise standard, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A); 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,999, \ngovernment choices implementing the statute, including on the appropriate standard to apply, are \nentitled to deference. See AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38 at 53 (“an agency is entitled to the highest \ndegree of deference where Congress has delegated to the agency the authority ‘to promulgate \nstandards or classifications.’” (quoting American Fed'n of Labor v. Donovan, 757 F.2d 330, 341 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985)). Plaintiffs’ sole response is that the government should bear the burden because \nthe government bears the burden of proof as a matter of regulation in proceedings to terminate \nasylum once it has been granted. Mot. 19. Plaintiffs note that the language in § 1158(c)(2), which \ngoverns termination of asylum, is similar to the language in § 1158(a)(2)(A), and so, in their view, \nplacing the burden on the alien under § 1158(a)(2)(A) impermissibly gives the same statutory text \ndifferent meanings. Mot. 19. This is incorrect for multiple reasons. \nThe regulation Plaintiffs cite, 8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f) applies exclusively in a very different \ncontext: removal proceedings in immigration court under § 1229a that are reopened to reassess an \nasylum claim that an immigration judge previously granted. Plaintiffs cite the regulation rather \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 51 of 77\n \nthan the statute because the statute, § 1158(c)(2), says nothing about who bears the burden of proof \nto terminate asylum, and the fact that the agency choice to implement a different statute in a \ndifferent context another way says nothing about what the statute itself requires. Also, while the \nstatutory provision on termination of asylum says nothing about who should bear the burden of \nproof, the provision on obtaining asylum does. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). It says that “[t]he \nburden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee,” by showing among \nother things that he fears persecution on account of his “race, religion, nationality, membership in \na particular social group, or political opinion.” Id. Thus, when the statute sets out a burden it places \nit on the applicant, and there is nothing inconsistent about similarly placing the burden on an alien \nwho falls under an ACA under the Rule.  \nEven if the statute did set a burden for termination of asylum and placed that burden on the \ngovernment, there would be nothing inconsistent about placing the burden on an applicant to obtain \nrelief or protection and placing the burden on the government when it tries to terminate the relief \nor protection—which presupposes that the alien has already been granted a benefit. There is no \nbar to giving different statutory text with different purposes different meanings based on its context \nin the overall statutory scheme. The language Plaintiffs cite from Clark that judges cannot “give \nthe same statutory texts different meanings in different cases,” rejects giving the text of the “same \n[statutory] provision” different meanings when applied to different individuals. Clark v. Martinez, \n543 U.S. 371, 380, 386 (2005). It says nothing about giving different statutory provisions or sub-\nprovisions with similar language different interpretations where they serve different purposes. \nWeaver v. U.S. Info. Agency, 87 F.3d 1429, 1437 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (noting that “[i]dentical words \nmay have different meanings” depending on “the subject-matter to which the words refer” or \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 52 of 77\n \n“based on a difference in context” even when addressing “two subsections of the same [ ] \nprovision”). \nMoreover, for withholding claims, “[t]he burden of proof is on the applicant” to “establish \nthat his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account \nof race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.16(b), (c)(2). Section 1158(a)(2)(A) “do[es] not specify the precise procedural \nmechanism by which the Attorney General and Secretary must determine that an alien’s life or \nfreedom will not be threatened on account of a protected ground in the third country,” 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 63,999, but § 1158(a)(2)(A) uses the same language as the withholding statute. Compare 8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(A) (limiting removal to country “if the Attorney General determines that ... \nthe alien’s life or freedom would [ ] be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, \nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion”) with id. § 1231(b)(3) (limiting \nremoval to country “if the Attorney General decides that the alien’s life or freedom would be \nthreatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a \nparticular social group, or political opinion”); see also 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,999 (noting that standard \nin the Rule “mirrors the standard for protection contained in the INA’s withholding-of-removal \nprovision”).  \n  Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule and guidance “fail to provide any opportunity for an \nindividual to contest whether she would have access to full and fair asylum procedures in the \nreceiving country.” Mot. 19-20. But there is no requirement in the statute that each alien have an \nindividualized opportunity to challenge the determination that Guatemala is “a country ... where \nthe alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining” asylum claims. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1158(a)(2)(A). As to their argument that individualized determinations are required absent \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 53 of 77\n \nrulemaking, Mot. 19, nothing in the statute requires the agency either to make the full-and-fair \ndetermination  through  rulemaking  or  to  re-assess  whether  Guatemala  provides  full-and-fair \nprocedures  in  every  individual  threshold  determination.  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  Heckler  v. \nCampbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983)—see Mot. 19—is misplaced, as that case dealt with disability \ndeterminations under a provision of the Social Security Act that explicitly required a disability \ndetermination related to the “individual” based on whether “his physical or mental impairment” \nlimits his ability to work “considering his age, education, and work experience.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 423(a)(2)(A). Section 1158(a)(2)(A) lists no individualized factors that must be considered in \nmaking the full-and-fair determination, and, in any event, Heckler stands for the proposition that \nan agency may resolve some general factual issues by regulation even where a statute requires \ndeterminations related to a particular individual and not, as Plaintiffs assert, that any determination \nrequired by a statute must be made on a case-by-case basis. See Heckler, 461 U.S. at 467.  \n  Section 1158(a)(2)(A) requires only a determination that Guatemala has a full-and-fair \nprocedure for determining asylum and protection claims, and settled principles of administrative \nlaw dictate that the agencies may make this determination categorically. See Lopez v. Davis, 531 \nU.S. 230, 243-44 (2001). Plaintiffs have no basis to demand procedures beyond what is required \nby the statute. See AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38 at 56. Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that an individualized \ndetermination is necessary because “some individuals may be unsafe” due to “their particular \ncircumstances, such as their sexual orientation,” Mot. 20, but that concern relates to whether an \nalien’s life or freedom would be threatened in Guatemala, a concern for which the Rule does \nprovide individualized consideration. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,000. \n  Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that “the Rule violates the plain text of the safe third country \nprovision  by  barring  IJs  in  regular  removal  proceedings  from  applying  the  public  interest \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 54 of 77\n \nexception, and instead ‘reserv[ing]’ that discretion solely to DHS attorneys.” Mot. 20. As advocacy \norganizations and individuals who were not placed in removal proceedings before an immigration \njudge, Plaintiffs cannot raise this claim for the reasons noted above (Plaintiffs lack standing to \nraise such a claim and there is no jurisdiction to raise such a claim in district court anyway).7 In \nany  event,  they  err  in  arguing  that  immigration  judges  must  apply  this  exception  because \nimmigration judges exercise other authority delegated by the Attorney General. The Rule was \nissued jointly by DOJ and DHS, who jointly share authority over immigration, and the agencies \ndetermined that DHS should exercise this authority. Even if, as Plaintiffs argue, § 1158(a)(2)(A) \nspecifically grants authority to make these “public interest” determinations to the Attorney \nGeneral, the INA grants the Attorney General broad authority to “delegate such authority” in \nwhatever way he “determines to be necessary for carrying out this section” or any other provision \nof the INA. 8 U.S.C. § 1103(g)(2); see also id. § 1103(a)(3) (providing similar authority to the \nSecretary). And, again, § 1158(a)(3) places such determinations beyond review. Finally, the \ndecision that DHS should make the public-interest determinations predates this Rule, and was \nadopted by regulation at the time of the U.S.-Canada ACA. 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(e)(6)(iii)(F). \n  8  U.S.C.  § 1231(b)(3).  Plaintiffs  next  argue  that  the  “rule  and  guidance  violate  the \nwithholding  and  CAT  statutes,”  which,  they  argue,  codify  the  government’s  general  non-\nrefoulement obligations and are not limited to where “an alien has had a full removal hearing.” \nMot. 21. But by their plan terms, the statutory and regulatory provisions governing withholding \nand CAT protections do relate to an alien in full removal proceedings whom an immigration judge \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs further lack standing to raise this claim because none of them were in removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge and so no Plaintiff had any opportunity to have this \nexception considered in removal proceedings by DHS or by an immigration judge, and so no \nPlaintiff can claim any injury from this aspect of the Rule. \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 55 of 77\n \nhas found removable and who will, absent protection, be returned to his home country. See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16. These provisions have no direct application here, and \nPlaintiffs provide no basis for their argument that the same exact procedures must be applied when \naliens will be removed to a third country. In any event, to the extent Plaintiffs challenge the \nstandard of proof and argue that the government must take the same approach as under the \nwithholding statute, as noted above, the Rule does apply the burden of proof in the same way as \nthe withholding statute. Plaintiffs’ only other argument on this point is that the procedures are \ninsufficient  if  they  require  aliens  to  “volunteer  that  they  fear”  removal  to  a  third  country \n“unprompted.” Mot. 21 (quoting Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, No. 19-15716, 2020 WL 964402, at \n*15 (9th Cir. Feb. 28, 2020)). But as explained, the tear sheet provided to any alien who is \npotentially covered by an ACA prompts the alien to raise any fear he might have of being removed \nto the third country. USCIS001.  \nRegardless,  Plaintiffs  cannot  rely  on  § 1231  as  a  basis  for  any  APA  challenge  to \nimplementation of § 1158(a)(2)(A) because § 1231 provides that “Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any \nparty against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(h).  \nB.  The Rule and guidance are not arbitrary and capricious (Claim IV). \n \nPlaintiffs next argue that the Rule and guidance are arbitrary and capricious because they \nfail to “acknowledge or explain” departures from previous procedures and fail “to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem.” Mot. 21-27. There is no merit to these arguments. \nTo begin, arbitrary-and-capricious review is “limited,” EarthLink, Inc. v. FCC, 462 F.3d \n1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and courts may not substitute their “judgment for that of the agency.” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). “An \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 56 of 77\n \nagency’s predictive judgments about areas that are within the agency’s field of discretion and \nexpertise are entitled to particularly deferential review” and “need not rest on pure factual \ndeterminations.” EarthLink, Inc., 462 F.3d at 12 (quotations omitted). The agency need only \narticulate “a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Motor Vehicle, \n463 U.S. at 43. In cases like this one, involving an express grant of authority to prescribe rules and \nstandards, the agency’s “judgment [is owed] more than mere deference or weight,” and courts give \nthe agency interpretation “controlling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly \ncontrary to the statute.” Lindeen v. SEC, 825 F.3d 646, 656 (D.C. Cir. 2016); see City of Los \nAngeles v. Barr, 929 F.3d 1163, 1177 (9th Cir. July 12, 2019) (in such circumstances “agency’s \npromulgations are entitled to more than mere deference or weight; rather, they are entitled to \nlegislative effect”).  \n  The Rule here was promulgated based on a range of undisputed findings related to the crisis \non the southern border, including that “[h]undreds of thousands of migrants have reached the \nUnited States in recent years and have claimed a fear of persecution or torture,” many of whom \nultimately do not “establish legal qualification for such relief” or even “apply[ ] for protection after \nbeing released into the United States.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 63,994-95; see, e.g. DOJIFR38-40, 54-78, \n479-80, 613-15, 627, 636-740, 746-838, 890-925, 1018, 1054-1075; DHSIFR01-4, 809-30, 837-\n51. “This increase has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the number and percentage of \naliens requesting asylum or claiming a fear of persecution or torture when apprehended or \nencountered by DHS,” and “the percentage of aliens referred for credible fear interviews within \nER proceedings jumped from approximately 5 percent to above 40 percent.” 84 Fed. Reg. at \n63,994-95. This has “contributed to a backlog of ... 474,327 asylum cases,” placing tremendous \nburdens on the government agencies tasked with processing these aliens and “adjudicating asylum \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 57 of 77\n \nclaims.” Id. The Rule implements ACAs that the Executive Branch has negotiated to help share \nthis burden with other nations and was developed to support ongoing negotiations with these \ncountries and others. Id. at 63,995. The Departments adequately identified and explained the basis \nand reasons for this new Rule. Cf. F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 \n(2009) (“it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute [and] that there are good \nreasons for it”). \n  In support of their argument that the Rule and guidance are arbitrary and capricious, \nPlaintiffs contend only that the “agencies failed to acknowledge or explain the elimination of six \nkey safeguards intended to ensure compliance with non-refoulement obligations.” Mot. 22. But \neach of their six arguments reduces to the same false premise: that the policies are arbitrary and \ncapricious if they do not parrot credible-fear interviews or procedures available in full removal \nproceedings under § 1229a, even if these procedures are not mentioned in § 1158(a)(2)(A). \n  First, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule departs from regulations that provide asylum officers \nconducting credible-fear interviews should elicit relevant information from aliens during the \ninterview. Mot. 22 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)). This is incorrect. The government has not \nchanged any aspect of credible-fear interviews through this Rule. It is a new policy implementing \nnew ACAs and, in any case, the most analogous prior rule governing the U.S.-Canada ACA \nsimilarly did not adopt all credible-fear procedures. 69 Fed. Reg. at 69,481; DOJIFR98-108; \nDHSIFR657-68. As explained, there is no requirement that credible-fear procedures apply to \nthreshold  determinations  under  § 1158(a)(2)(A).  Moreover,  Plaintiffs’  argument  improperly \nconflates the procedures that apply in a credible-fear interview for eliciting information with the \nprocess that applies prior to any such interview or screening if the alien does raise a fear. The rule \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 58 of 77\n \nexplains why the agencies chose the approach they adopted, and that is all that is even arguably \nrequired under the APA. \n  Second, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule fails to apply a “true” screening test because it does \nnot apply a “significant possibility” test. Mot. 22-23. But there is no requirement to apply a \n“significant possibility” standard or any other aspect of the credible-fear standard to an initial-\nscreening interview under § 1158(a)(2)(A). Again there is no change from prior position—as there \nwas no prior position—and this Rule provides more screening than was made available under the \nrule implementing the U.S-Canada ACA. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, that earlier rule “contains no \nindividualized non-refoulement assessment” whatsoever. Mot. 26, n.8. Moreover, unlike with \nwithholding claims, “the third country to which an alien would be removed under an ACA is a \ncountry to which an alien does not necessarily have preexisting ties or any preexisting reason to \nfear persecution or torture,” and the country will “have pre-committed, per [a] binding [ACA] \nagreement[ ] with the United States” to “provide the alien procedures for requesting safe haven.” \n84 Fed. Reg. at 64,001-02. Plaintiffs argue that a lesser standard should apply, but the agency \nadequately explained the choice it made, and no binding source of law compels a higher standard.  \n  Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule departs from regulations that say that an immigration \njudge will decide withholding and CAT claims. Mot. 24 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(a), (c)(4)). But \nas with Plaintiffs’ other arguments, here again, there is no prior rule applicable to the ACA process \nunder § 1158(a)(2)(A) from which the Rule is a departure. The regulations that Plaintiffs cite apply \nexclusively in immigration court where, of course, the immigration judge is the one to decide \nclaims. These regulations say nothing about the process required under § 1158(a)(2)(A) for aliens \nbarred from applying for asylum, whether under § 1225(b) or under § 1229a, where an alien can \nhave their asylum and protection claims decided in immigration court. Plaintiffs provide no \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 59 of 77\n \nargument for why such rules should apply in the very different ACA context, and the agency \nexplained the rationale for its approach, which is all that is required. \n  Fourth,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  guidance  improperly  “[e]liminat[es]”  the  general \npresumption  that  past  persecution  creates  a  presumption  of  future  persecution.  Mot.  24; \nsee also Matter of N-M-A-, 22 I. & N. Dec 312 (BIA 1998). But the Rule does not “eliminate” \nanything, because the presumption never applied in this context in the first place. Moreover, the \nagency had good reason to take a different approach here because the Rule applies only to removal \nto a third country where the alien will generally not have particular ties, not to his home country, \nand where he will be removed under a bilateral agreement in which Guatemala agrees to ensure \nthat he has access to procedures for ensuring he can seek safe haven there. Further, although not \napplying an across-the-board presumption, the guidance still reasonably treats past persecution as \n“strong evidence of likelihood of future persecution on the basis of the same claim.” USCIS366. \n  Fifth, Plaintiffs argue that the Rule does not provide the same access to counsel and \nopportunity  for  consultation  that  is  provided  in  credible-fear  interviews.  Mot.  24-25.  This \nargument is similarly based on the false premise that the screening under § 1158(a)(2)(A) must \nfollow the separate credible-fear process under § 1225(b). In any case, an alien subject to the Rule \nhas an opportunity for consultation in advance of the interview, see USCIS001, similar to the \nCanada ACA rule. 69 Fed. Reg. at 69,481-82. Plaintiffs argue that the Rule is a departure from the \nregulations implementing the Canada ACA, which “permit consultation with counsel” during the \ninterview, Mot. 25, but the agencies adequately explained that consultation in the Canada rule was \nbased on that ACA’s complex exceptions, and the exceptions in the Guatemala ACA are “fewer \nand less complex,” creating less need for consultation. 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,003; see DOJIFR98-\n108; DHSIFR657-68. Plaintiffs argue that the Guatemala “Rule’s fear screening” is “complex,” \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 60 of 77\n \nACA, Mot. 25, but that argument misses the mark, as the fear screening simply requires the alien \nto describe his own personal experiences. Moreover, Plaintiffs cannot rely on the procedures under \nthe Canada rule to argue a “departure” from prior practice because, as they acknowledge, the \nCanada rule did not provide for any fear screening. Mot. 25 & n.8. \n  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Rule departs from prior procedures in other summary \nremoval contexts that permit review by an immigration judge, Mot. 25, but this argument is again \nbased on different statutory provisions that have never been applied in the ACA context and so \nthere is no departure from prior practice. Moreover, the Rule implements § 1158 and the particular \ngoals of that section—goals that are not necessarily implicated by other removal procedures—to \ncreate streamlined procedures that reduce the burden on our immigration system and encourage \nour foreign partners to bear a greater share of the burden of resolving regional migration issues. \n84 Fed. Reg. 63,994-95; see, e.g. DOJIFR79-133, 627, 985, 1019, 1042, 1074; DHSIFR201-15, \n645-68, 677-81, 837-75. Plaintiffs also argue that the agencies failed to consider an important \naspect of the problem by failing to “address the obvious risks of refoulement in a process stripped \nof the safeguards used in other summary removal contexts.” Mot. 26-27. But the Rule not only \nconsidered these risks, 84 Fed. Reg. 63,999, it also created specific procedures to allow aliens to \nraise a fear-of-persecution or torture claim with respect to the third country. In this way, it is \nconsistent with the requirements of § 1158, and provides greater refoulement protections than the \nrule implementing the U.S.-Canada ACA. As this Court held in AILA, which the D.C. Circuit \naffirmed in full on this point: “Plaintiffs cannot impose upon the Attorney General any obligation \nto afford more procedures than the governing statute explicitly requires or that she has chosen to \nafford in her discretion.” AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 55-56, aff’d, 199 F.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 61 of 77\n \nC.  The full-and-fair determinations are lawful (Claim V). \n \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the Departments’ determinations under § 1158 that Guatemala has \na “full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection” \nare unlawful because they “violate the safe third country provision and run afoul of the APA’s \ndemand for reasoned decisionmaking.” Mot. 29. Plaintiffs cannot succeed on this claim. To begin, \n§ 1158(a)(3) bars review of “any determination” under § 1158(a)(2)(A), including the “full and \nfair procedure” determination. As explained above, this bar on judicial review extends to the \nprocess by which the agencies make determinations and evinces congressional intent to insulate \nthe decision-making process from review. In such circumstances, the rule of non-inquiry applies \nand courts are limited to evaluating whether the agencies made the determination identified in the \nstatute. If, as here, they did, then “the court’s inquiry shall have reached its end”—courts may not \ninquire into the substance of the Executive’s foreign-affairs determinations. Trinidad y Garcia v. \nThomas, 683 F.3d 952, 956-57 (9th Cir. 2012) (en banc). Though often applied in the extradition \ncontext, the Supreme Court has made clear that the rule of non-inquiry is not limited to that context. \nMunaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 700-01 (2008) (dismissing habeas petition alleging “transfer to \nIraqi custody is likely to result in torture” because “it is for the political branches, not the judiciary, \nto assess practices in foreign countries”); cf. Narenji v. Civiletti, 617 F.2d 745, 748 (D.C. Cir. \n1979) (noting limited role of judiciary in relation to immigration matters tied to foreign relations). \n  In addition, § 1158(a)(2)(A) requires only that the Departments determine that aliens would \n“have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary \nprotection” in Guatemala. The agencies did precisely this when they determined that Guatemala \n“has in place a sufficient protection system with accompanying procedures and laws,” and an \n“applicant for protection in Guatemala has a meaningful opportunity to make a protection claim, \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 62 of 77\n \nreceive a hearing and adjudication regarding that claim, and safely remain in Guatemala until his \nor her protection claim is resolved.” DOJFF6. In addition, they found that Guatemala has a process \n“that comports with basic notions of procedural fairness,” as both Guatemalan legal provisions \nand representations made by Guatemalan officials to the United States Departments of State and \nHomeland Security indicate that “Guatemala has a competent immigration authority with clear \nprocedures  for  addressing  initial  asylum  applications,  including  referral  of  claims  to  an \nadjudicative body.” Id. This includes giving applicants “oral guidance” during the initial stages of \nthe  proceedings  “on  how  to  present  a  claim,”  and  “information  on  rights  protections,  and \nprivileges”; providing notice of decisions and “the right to appeal an adverse decision” and to \n“remain in Guatemala during any appellate process”; and “laws barring refoulement of refugees \nthat are consistent with the non-refoulement obligations” of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 \nProtocol. DOJFF6-7. The Attorney General thus made the determination required by the statute, \nwhich requires nothing more. See AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38 at 56. \n  Plaintiffs argue that the phrase “safe third country” is a term of art in refugee law for which \n“UNHCR ‘provides significant guidance.’” Mot. 30 n.22 (quoting Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at \n439 n.22). But as the Supreme Court explained, U.N. guidance does not have “the force of law or \nin any way bind[ ]” agencies. Id. What matters is the language Congress enacted in the relevant \nstatute, id. at 432, and nothing in § 1158(a)(2)(A) requires the “full and fair” determination \nconform to UNHCR guidance. In any case, as noted in the full-and-fair determinations, the \nDepartments considered UNHCR guidance on determining refugee status and concluded that \nGuatemala “appears to satisfy” that guidance. DHSFF1282. The Acting Secretary therefore found \nthat  his  determination  was  consistent  with  “another  official’s  view”  of  “safe  third  country \nconsiderations.” Id.; see also id. at 144, 677, 680, 790-823, 881, 915; DOJFF143. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 63 of 77\n \nPlaintiffs argue that the “statute requires the agencies to consider the actual operation of \nGuatemala’s  asylum  system,”  and  that  the  agency  determinations  improperly  address  “only \nGuatemala’s formal law and nowhere consider its asylum system’s actual operations.” Mot. 31-\n32. But there is no such requirement in the statute, and in any event, Plaintiffs are incorrect. The \ndesignations were based in part on Guatemala’s formal legal provisions. See DOJFF1-8, 25-86; \nDHSFF21-89, 114-43. But they were also based on “careful consideration” of Guatemala’s \n“implementing regulations, and information provided by the Departments of State and Homeland \nSecurity following consultations between the United States and Guatemala.” DOJFF6; see also id. \n1-5, 7-24, 87-142; DHSFF90-101, 698. The process included “an active dialogue between our two \nstates”—DHSFF1282;  see DHSFF1076-1244,  1259-61  (documenting  extensive  inter-\ngovernmental communications)—and considerations of “information provided by the Department \nof State, information provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), \nand information from other sources,” DHSFF1282; see also e.g., DHSFF102-13, 144-697, 790-\n859, 881-84, 915-22. \nPlaintiffs  next  contend  that  Guatemala’s  historical  capacity  to  process  refugees  is \ninsufficient and that the agencies failed to consider this. Mot. 32. But here again, there is no \nspecific requirement in the statute to consider capacity, and in any case, the agencies did consider \ncapacity. Over a five-month period, senior DHS officials, including the Acting Secretary, “visited \nGuatemala multiple times and hosted bilateral discussions with Guatemalan officials to examine \nthat country’s capacity for processing asylum and other refugee protection claims,” and DHS and \nthe State Department “verif[ied] the nature and capacity of Guatemala’s procedures.” DOJFF2; \nsee also DOJFF20-24, DHS1255-53 (“Guatemalan Immigration Law and Current Capacity”). As \npart of the ACA, Guatemala also specifically agreed “[t]o ensure that protection applications \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 64 of 77\n \ntransferred to Guatemala by the United States have access to a system to determine protection.” \nDOJFF103-04. And the United States agreed to invest in Guatemala’s capacity to process asylum \nclaims by “cooperat[ing] to strengthen the institutional capacities of Guatemala,” DOJFF104, and \nat the time of the full-and-fair determinations, DHS already had a “robust footprint of personnel” \nin Guatemala to assist with and “assure successful implementation of” the ACA through “planning, \nsupport, technical expertise, and logistical assistance,” DOJFF02.  \nPlaintiffs next argue that the “agencies also entirely failed to consider whether Guatemala \nis safe in reality, as required by statute.” Mot. 33; id. 34-5. But § 1158(a)(2)(A) does not state that \nthe Departments must make a safety determination, and Plaintiffs cite nothing in the statute in \nsupport of their assertion. The statute does require a determination that the ACA country is a \ncountry “in which the alien’s life or freedom would not be threatened.” 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)(2)(A). \nBut that determination is not part of the full-and-fair determination, and the Departments addressed \nthis requirement through the Rule, which creates an individualized process for assessing whether \na particular asylum seeker will face persecution in Guatemala.  \nPlaintiffs’ remaining arguments that the designations are arbitrary and capricious, Mot. 35-\n36, restate their earlier arguments and fail for the same reasons. These arguments all reduce to a \ndisagreement with the agencies’ unreviewable determinations. But a disagreement with how the \nagency viewed the record does not make the determinations arbitrary and capricious where, as \nhere, the agency addressed everything required by the statute, evaluated all relevant evidence, and \nexplained why and how it reached the determinations. This Court may not “second-guess[ ] the” \nAttorney General’s and Secretary’s “weighing of risks and benefits.” Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2571 (2019). The agencies’ determinations, like the Rule, are supported by \nreasonable justifications rooted in the government’s “expertise and experience,” Earthlink, Inc., \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 65 of 77\n \n462 F.3d at 12, and even if these determinations were subject to review, they would easily meet \nthe deferential standard of review under the APA, Lindeen, 825 F.3d at 656. \nD.  The Rule was lawfully issued without notice and comment (Claims VI). \n \nPlaintiffs contend that the Rule was unlawfully issued without notice and an opportunity \nfor  comment.  Mot.  36-40.  But  the  APA  provides  exceptions  to  the  notice-and-comment \nrequirements when either the rule “involve[s] ... [a] foreign affairs function of the United States,” \nid. § 553(a)(1), or “the agency for good cause finds ... that notice and public procedure thereon are \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B), (d)(3). The \nRule here fits within both exceptions and is consistent with similar interim rules affecting the \nborder. \nForeign Affairs. The foreign-affairs exception covers agency actions “linked intimately \nwith the Government’s overall political agenda concerning relations with another country.” Am. \nAss’n of Exporters & Importers-Textile & Apparel Grp. v. United States, 751 F.2d 1239, 1249 \n(Fed. Cir. 1985). “A rule of law that would inhibit the flexibility of the political branches [in \nmatters of foreign affairs] should be adopted with only the greatest caution.” Yassini v. Crosland, \n618 F.2d 1356, 1361 (9th Cir. 1980). \nThe Departments properly invoked this exception. The Rule involves “U.S. relations with \nMexico and the Northern Triangle countries,” and is critical to negotiations with these countries \non how to “address the enormous flow of aliens through these countries to the southern border,” \nwhere they “strain resources and contribute to a national security and humanitarian crisis.” 84 Fed. \nReg. at 64,005. See DOJIFR79-95, 109-133, 627, 839-48, 890-93, 985, 1074-75; DHSIFR681, \n737, 809-30, 837-75. The Rule thus directly implicates U.S. foreign-policy and national-security \ninterests. The Departments found that the Rule “will facilitate ongoing diplomatic negotiations \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 66 of 77\n \nwith foreign countries regarding migration issues, including measures to control the flow of aliens \ninto the United States,” and “will remove obstacles to successfully negotiating ACAs with other \ncountries.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,005. United States officials “remain in negotiations with other \nnations to enter into additional ACAs,” and “[d]elaying the implementation of the rule due to \nnotice-and-comment rulemaking could impact the ability of the United States to negotiate.” Id. \nDelays in implementing the Rule “create[ ] uncertainty about the regulatory framework that the \nUnited States will have in place to carry out such agreements,” and “[p]otential signatories to such \nagreements may be more hesitant to negotiate” or “rely on a commitment by the United States to \nmeet the terms of negotiated agreements if the regulatory framework to carry out such agreements \nis uncertain and not yet in place.” Id.  \nThe  Rule  is  thus  “linked  intimately  with  the  Government’s  overall  political  agenda \nconcerning relations with another country”—here, the multiple other countries with which the \nUnited States is engaged in ongoing negotiations to address the crisis on the southern border. \nSee Am. Ass’n of Exporters, 751 F.2d at 1249; see Raoof v. Sullivan, 315 F. Supp. 3d 34, 43-44 \n(2018). The Rule is thus a “[d]ecision[ ] involving the relationships between the United States and \nits alien visitors” that “implicate[s] our relations with foreign powers” and “implement[s] the \nPresident’s  foreign  policy.”  Yassini,  618  F.2d  at  1361.  Courts  may  not  second-guess  the \nExecutive’s assessment of potential foreign-policy consequences or inhibit the flexibility of the \npolitical branches to take actions they deem necessary in matters of foreign affairs. Id.; Chicago \n& S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman SS Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948) (“[T]he very nature of \nexecutive decisions as to foreign policy is political, not judicial ... They are decisions of a kind for \nwhich the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility.”). \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 67 of 77\n \nPlaintiffs argue that the foreign-affairs exception can be invoked only after a showing by \nthe  agencies  that  notice-and-comment  procedures  would  provoke  undesirable  international \nconsequences. Mot. 37. The statute requires no such showing. The exception applies when a rule \n“involve[s]” a “foreign affairs function of the United States”—without regard to harm. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(a)(1); see Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 437 (2d Cir. 2008) (there is “no requirement” \nthat agency state a finding of undesirable international consequences, particularly “when the \nconsequences are seemingly as evident” as they are here). Indeed, “[h]indering” the Executive’s \n“ability to implement a new policy in response to a current foreign affairs crisis is the type of \ndefinitely undesirable international consequence that warrants invocation of the foreign affairs \nexception.” East Bay, 909 F.3d at 1252. Even if such a showing were required, the Rule notes that \nnotice-and-comment  procedures  would  “provoke  definitively  undesirable  international \nconsequences,”  because  a  “delayed  effective  date  for  this  rule  could  have  far-reaching \nconsequences for the strength of the negotiating position of the United States in relation to potential \nsignatories of future ACAs.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,006. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Rule does not put into effect any ACA, emphasizing that “[t]he \nRule was issued months ago, and yet the Honduras and El Salvador ACAs have not been ‘put[ ] \ninto effect.’” Mot. 37. But ongoing planning on the implementation of agreements with foreign \nnations that have already been signed does not undermine the application of the foreign-affairs \nexception,  where,  as  noted  above,  delays  in  finalizing  the  Rule  could  undermine  ongoing \nnegotiations with additional countries and undermine our bargaining position by establishing that \nthe United States was not serious about implementing the agreements. Plaintiffs also argue that \nthe exception should not apply because the Rule does not put into effect a particular ACA, but \nrather creates “procedures to govern all future ACA removals.” Mot. 37-38. But Plaintiffs cite no \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 68 of 77\n \nsupport for the argument that the foreign-affairs exception cannot apply simply because a rule \nimplements multiple agreements, present and future, with foreign countries. Finally, Plaintiffs note \nthat the rule implementing the ACA with Canada went through the notice-and-comment process, \nbut the agencies’ discretionary choice to follow these procedures one time does not bind them to \ntake the same approach every time. Moreover, as Plaintiffs acknowledge, the earlier rule took \nseveral years to finalize, including approximately eight months between the proposed and final \nrules. Mot. 38. The agencies are not required to presume that the process would be any more swift \nnow than it was in 2004, and Plaintiffs offer no reason to believe it would be. Mot. 38. \nGood  Cause.  The  good-cause  exception  applies  when  “the  very  announcement  of  a \nproposed rule itself can be expected to precipitate activity by affected parties that would harm the \npublic welfare.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 728 F.2d 1477, 1492 (TECA 1983). In \nevaluating the good-cause exception, courts “defer to an agency’s factual findings and expert \njudgments therefrom, unless such findings and judgments are arbitrary and capricious.” Sorenson \nCommc’ns Inc. v. F.C.C., 755 F.3d 702, 706 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Significant public-safety harms \nprovide good cause to make rule changes without pre-promulgation notice and comment. Hawaii \nHelicopter Operators Ass’n v. FAA, 51 F.3d 212, 214 (9th Cir. 1995); see Jifry v. F.A.A., 370 F.3d \n1174, 1179-80 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (relying on Hawaii Helicopter).  \nConsistent with these principles, the Departments recognized that providing notice of \nchanges in asylum procedures could cause migrants to rush to the southern border, as “[w]ould-be \nasylum applicants have a strong incentive to intensify their efforts to rapidly reach the U.S. border \nwhen the United States announces a regulatory change that will impact asylum applicants.” 84 \nFed. Reg. at 64,006; see East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1115 (N.D. \nCal. 2018), aff’d 950 F.3d 1242. “Recent events have shown that knowledge of this kind of \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 69 of 77\n \nimpending change is highly likely to cause a dramatic increase in the numbers of aliens who enter \nor attempt to enter the United States to file asylum applications before the effective date of the \nchange,” and would even “create a perceived urgency for aliens to enter the United States illegally \nor apply for admission without proper documentation before the ACAs take effect.” 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 64,006. As “courts have recognized, smugglers encourage migrants to enter the United States \nbased on changes in U.S. immigration policy.” Id. \nPlaintiffs argue that the Rule offers only speculative assertions and that the government’s \nclaims lack record support. Mot. 39. But the Rule sets out a long list of prior examples of past \npolicy changes that caused surges to the southern border, and these findings are supported by ample \nevidence in the records. See 84 Fed. Reg. at 64,007 (collecting examples); DOJIFR154, 436, 547, \n593, 597, 613, 616, 628, 738; DHSIFR692, 737-49, 755-801, 809. Plaintiffs alternatively argue \nthat the application of the good-cause exception to similar policy changes in the past is irrelevant \nbecause good cause must be determined on a case-by-case basis, Mot. 40, but the government \nobviously cannot provide evidence of the harms that would have occurred if the government had \ngiven advance notice that it planned to implement a new rule related to asylum applications. \nInstead, the agencies identified evidence that similar changes in the law in the past had caused an \nincreased surge at the border and reasonably determined that this Rule would have a similar impact, \nworsening the crisis at the southern border and the potential risk of harm. Courts are ill-equipped \nto second-guess the Executive Branch’s predictive judgments in this context. See Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 34-35 (2010) (“The Government, when seeking to prevent \nimminent harms in the context of international affairs and national security, is not required to \nconclusively link all the pieces in the puzzle before we grant weight to its empirical conclusion.”).  \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 70 of 77\n \nE.  The Rule may not be challenged on Suspension Clause grounds and in any event \nis consistent with the Clause (Claim VII). \n \n    Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  Rule  violates  the  Suspension  Clause  because  that  clause \n“guarantees judicial review of the legality of removal orders” yet the Rule “does not permit judicial \nreview” of “removal orders to ACA countries.” Mot. 28-29. There is no merit to this argument.  \n    First, it is not the Rule, but the relevant statute, § 1252(e)—which has been operative since \n1998—that limits judicial review of expedited-removal orders. Section 1252 prohibits judicial \nreview of individual orders of expedited removal other than on three limited grounds, none of \nwhich is applicable here. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A), (e)(2). And § 1252(e)(3) is the sole \nprovision  authorizing  suits  challenging  expedited-removal  procedures.  Challenges  to  the \nexpedited-removal process and review procedures, including challenges to whether the procedures \nprovided are constitutional, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(i), “must be filed no later than 60 days \nafter the date the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure ... is first \nimplemented.” Id. § 1252(e)(3)(B). Plaintiffs are well outside the 60-day jurisdictional limit for \nchallenging the statute, which, in any event, the D.C. Circuit upheld in all respects 20 years ago. \nSee AILA, 199 F.3d at 1364. \n    Second, there is no freestanding cause of action premised on the Suspension Clause that \nPlaintiffs may invoke outside the context of a challenge to ongoing detention. See Munaf, 553 U.S. \nat 693; INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 301 (2001). The Clause is implicated only in the habeas \ncontext, and so the individual Plaintiffs, who are not detained and do not raise detention challenges, \nand the organizational Plaintiffs, who certainly are not detained, cannot raise Suspension Clause \nclaims. Moreover, an alien seeking initial admission to the United States “has no constitutional \nrights regarding his application,” Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982), so “[w]hatever the \nprocedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned,” \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 71 of 77\n \nUnited States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 544 (1950). Plaintiffs are entitled only \nto the procedures that Congress and the agencies provide, including judicial review procedures, \nAILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 56, and applicants for admission cannot invoke the Suspension Clause to \ndemand additional procedures beyond the judicial-review procedures Congress Mandates. Castro \nv. DHS, 835 F.3d 422, 448–49 (3d Cir. 2016). Here, Plaintiffs do not identify any statute mandating \njudicial review of the challenged aspects of their removal orders.     \nIII.  Any relief that the Court grants must be sharply limited. \n \nEven if Plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on any of their claims, the Court \nshould not issue nationwide injunctive relief, and must limit any relief to the parties before the \nCourt. At most, relief should be limited to vacatur of the Rule with prospective effect, and should \nnot include injunctive or retrospective relief. \nFirst, Article III forecloses the injunctive relief Plaintiffs seek. Under Article III, “[a] \nplaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury.” Gill v. Whitford, \n138 S. Ct. 1916, 1931 (2018) (citation omitted). Allowing a party to challenge regulations “apart \nfrom any concrete application that threatens imminent harm to [their] interests” would “fly in the \nface of Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement.” Summers, 555 U.S. at 494. That rule is especially \nimportant here, where plaintiffs do “not represent a class, so they [can] not seek to enjoin [an \nagency regulation] on the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.” Monsanto Co. v. \nGeertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 163 (2010). \nSecond, injunctions that go beyond a plaintiff’s own injuries exceed the power of a court \nsitting in equity, which must limit injunctions to “be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 \nU.S. 753, 765 (1994). It is well established that the scope of a court’s statutory authority to enter \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 72 of 77\n \ninjunctive relief is circumscribed by the type of relief that was “traditionally accorded by courts of \nequity.” Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19 \n(1999). But the tradition of equity inherited from English law was premised on “providing \nequitable relief only to parties” because the fundamental role of a court was to “adjudicate the \nrights of ‘individual[s].’” Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2427-28 (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(quoting The Federalist No. 78, at 466 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961)). As a \nresult, “a plaintiff could not sue to vindicate the private rights of someone else.” Id. at 2428.  \nThird, the APA does not authorize universal injunctive relief. Cf. Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2425 \n(Thomas, J. concurring) (“No statute expressly grants district courts the power to issue universal \ninjunctions.”). The APA provides only that a court may “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Nothing in § 706(2)’s text specifies whether the Rule, if found invalid, \nshould be set aside on its face or as applied to the individual Plaintiffs. In the absence of a clear \nstatement in the APA that it displaces traditional rules of equity, the court should adopt the \nnarrower reading of the “set aside” language. See Virginia Soc’y for Human Life v. FEC, 263 F.3d \n379, 393 (4th Cir. 2001) (“Nothing in the language of the APA, however, requires us to exercise \nsuch far-reaching power.”). The absence of nationwide injunctions prior to Congress’ enactment \nof the APA in 1946 (and for over fifteen years thereafter) further suggests that the APA was not \noriginally understood to authorize such broad relief. See Samuel L. Bray, Multiple Chancellors: \nReforming the National Injunction, 131 HARV. L. REV. 417, 438 & n.121 (2017); see also H.R. \nRep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 42 (1946) (referring to possibility of suits for declaratory \nrelief to “determine the validity or application of a rule or order”). \nFourth, even assuming the APA could be read to provide for universal relief, § 702 \nprovides that “[n]othing herein (1) affects other limitations on judicial review ... or (2) confers \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 73 of 77\n \nauthority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids \nthe relief which is sought.” Congress can curtail the jurisdiction and equitable authority of lower \nfederal courts, see Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 211 (2007), and has done so here by enacting \nthe following INA provisions that prohibit universal injunctive relief. Section 1252(e)(1)(A) \nprovides that “no court may [ ] enter declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief in any action \npertaining to an order to exclude an alien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1) ... except as \nspecifically authorized in a subsequent paragraph of this subsection.” The sole remedy authorized \nunder § 1252(e)(3) is a “determination[]” on the merits of challenges to § 1225(b) and aspects of \nits implementation. The word “determination” does not ordinarily connote injunctive relief, as \nopposed  to  declaratory  relief.8 Section  1252(e)(1)(B)  also  prohibits  “certify[ing]  a  class,” \nindicating that Congress did not “intend[] to permit actions” seeking relief “on behalf of a still \nwider group of aliens,” with “no class representative” and where “plaintiffs are unconstrained by \nthe requirements of [Rule] 23.” AILA, 199 F.3d at 1364. Universal injunctive relief produces the \nsame result Congress foreclosed, benefitting aliens “none of whom are parties to the lawsuit.” Id.  \nAccordingly, even if the Court sets aside the Rule and guidance, the Court should deny \ninjunctive relief. See L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli, No. 19-2676, 2020 WL 985376, at *24 (D.D.C. Mar. \n1, 2020) (Moss, J.) (observing that § 1252(e)(3) “contemplates that courts may issue declaratory \njudgments relating to the ‘implementation of’ the expedited removal provisions,” and rejecting \nrequest for injunctive relief). “An injunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should \nnot be granted” where “a less drastic remedy” can redress the Plaintiffs’ injury. Monsanto Co., 561 \nU.S. at 165. The Supreme Court has cautioned that a district court vacating an agency action under \n                                                 \n8 Had Congress intended otherwise it could have used language to that effect. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2342 (empowering court “to enjoin ... the validity of” agency orders). \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 74 of 77\n \nthe APA should not issue an injunction unless doing so would “have [a] meaningful practical effect \nindependent of [the policy’s] vacatur,” id. at 165, a showing that Plaintiffs cannot make where \nthey do “not represent a class,” id. at 163. Cf. O.A. v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 153-54 (D.D.C. \n2019) (concluding, even in a class-action case not involving some of the jurisdictional provisions \nat issue in this case, that vacatur was sufficient). \nEven if injunctive relief were appropriate, Plaintiffs have not shown that the nationwide \nset-aside relief they seek is warranted. Plaintiffs raise arguments related to the factors for a \npreliminary injunction, including irreparable harm and the balance of the equities, but these factors \nare not relevant here. When a request for injunctive relief is raised in a motion for summary \njudgment, it “moots the Court’s consideration of the preliminary injunctive factors because the \nCourt will enter judgment on the merits.” Children’s Hosp. Ass’n of Texas v. Azar, 300 F. Supp. \n3d 190, 202 (D.D.C. 2018); see also Cronin v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 919 F.2d 439, 445 (7th Cir. \n1990) (“considerations of irreparable harm are out the window” when combined with “a full \nhearing” plaintiff’s claims).  \nIn any event, Plaintiffs’ allegations of harm are insufficient here, where the Executive \nBranch has identified a crisis and an urgent need for our regional partners to cooperate to address \nit, and has taken targeted action to address the “national security and humanitarian crisis,” 84 Fed. \nReg. at 64,005 & n.12, while ensuring that seeking asylum in the United States remains available \nto aliens who have no other option, Tchitchui v. Holder, 657 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir. 2011) (“core \nregulatory purpose of asylum ... is not to provide [aliens] with a broader choice of safe homelands, \nbut rather, to protect refugees with nowhere else to turn”). None of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries \noutweigh the harm that would be caused by “injunctive relief [that] deeply intrudes into the core \nconcerns of the executive branch,” Adams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 954 (D.C. Cir. 1978), and \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 75 of 77\n \nundermines the “efficient administration of the immigration laws at the border,” Innovation Law \nLab v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 510 (9th Cir. 2019). It is always in the public interest to protect \nthe borders and enforce its immigration laws. See Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34 (1982). \nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ allegations of harm in their home countries, Mot. 40-41, are \nirrelevant because they were not removed to their home countries. And their allegations related to \nparties not before this Court—e.g., “other asylum seekers,” Mot. 41-42—are similarly inapposite. \nSee East Bay, 909 F.3d at 1240. The individual Plaintiffs’ allegations about the Guatemalan asylum \nsystem cannot overcome the unreviewable determinations by the Attorney General and DHS that \nGuatemala has full-and-fair procedures for hearing protection claims that both governments have \nagreed to further invest in and strengthen. DOJFF104. Their allegations about the capacity of that \nsystem and the likelihood of aliens being sent from Guatemala to an additional country, Mot. 41-\n43, are similarly undermined by the Departments’ findings and future commitments. As to the \norganizational Plaintiffs, even assuming they could challenge the Rule, the diversion-of-resources \ninjuries they allege, Mot. 43-45, are not the type of injury “that can warrant [nationwide] relief.” \nCAIR v. Trump, No. 1:19-CV-02117-TJK, 2019 WL 3436501, at *2 (D.D.C. July 24, 2019). As to \nthe loss of an opportunity to comment, Mot. 44-45, this is also insufficient because Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of injury “cannot stand on procedural violation alone.” Am. Ass’n for Homecare v. \nLeavitt, 2008 WL 2580217, *5 (D.D.C. June 30, 2008).  \nFor these reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs request for a permanent injunction. At \nmost, Plaintiffs may be entitled to prospective declaratory relief on any claims for which they have \ndemonstrated an entitlement to summary judgment. See L.M.-M., 2020 WL 985376, at *24. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant summary judgment to Defendants on all claims.  \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00116-EGS   Document 83   Filed 03/25/20   Page 76 of 77\n \n  Dated: March 25, 2020    Respectfully submitted, \n \nJOSEPH H.
