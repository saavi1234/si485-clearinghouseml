    "summary": "<p>This case is closely related to Farmer v. Brennan, in which the plaintiff sued prison officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the Eighth Amendment. Litigation in the lower court was identical across Brennan and Haas. Following litigation in Farmer v. Brennan, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment for the defendants in an unpublished order submitted on March 10, 1991. The district court conducted a trial which produced a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\r\n<p>In this appeal, the plaintiff raised only the question whether the district court should have granted her motion to request a lawyer to represent her at her trial. In its opinion published on April 2, 1993, the Seventh Circuit rejected the plaintiff&rsquo;s argument. 990 F.2d 319. The plaintiff asked the court to appoint a lawyer before Jackson v. County of Maclean was decided, so the court did not apply the threshold requirement established in that case. Rather, the Seventh Circuit panel reviewed the district court&rsquo;s decision for reasonableness and found that it was not unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First, the court noted that the plaintiff had litigated for three years before requesting counsel and had already pursued a successful appeal&mdash;that is, Farmer v. Brennan. Likewise, the court agreed with the district court&rsquo;s perception that the trial was likely to be a straightforward swearing contest, with few of the &ldquo;legal issues [and] pitfalls&rdquo; that might frustrate the ordinary pro se litigant. Finally, the court reviewed the trial transcript and thought that it disclosed &ldquo;a shrewd cross-examination by [the plaintiff] of one of the defendants.&rdquo; For these reasons, the court did not think that this case was one of those extreme cases &ldquo;in which it should have been plain beyond reasonable doubt before the trial began that the difficulty of the issues relative to the capabilities of the litigant would make it impossible for him to obtain any sort of justice without the aid of a lawyer and he could not procure a lawyer on his own.&rdquo; Thus, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court&rsquo;s decision not to appoint counsel at trial for the plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case in an order published on November 8, 1993.</p>",

Farmer does not appeal the district \ncourt’s denial of this claim. \n \n3  The caption and the district court orders refer to Mr. Haas as Dr. Haas. However, in their answer to the complaint, \n  the defendants deny that Haas is a doctor. In Haas’ declaration attached to the defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment, he describes his duties as including “the responsibility for supervision over all aspects of the medical \ndepartment and the delivery of health services at FCI, Oxford.” \n \n4  During this intervening time period, Farmer filed an administrative complaint challenging the decision not to give \n  her estrogen treatment. On February 12, 1988, Farmer also filed a civil suit in the Western District of Wisconsin, Dee \nFarmer v. Edwin Meese, Michael Quinlan, E.J. Brennan, and Mr. Hass [sic], No. 88 C 110. She alleged, in part, that the \ndefendants were deliberately indifferent by failing to prescribe the estrogen. The court found this claim to be \nprecluded by the order in Farmer v. Carlson, No. 87-0215, from the United States District Court for the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, which decided the same issue by denying relief to Farmer. That case challenged only the \ndenial of estrogen, not the denial of all types of treatment. \n \n5  The district court relied on the declarations attached to the defendants’ motion for summary judgment for its \n  conclusions. On close reading, these affidavits do not support the district court’s findings. \nDr. Reed’s affidavit stated that he read the report from the physicians in Lewisburg and agreed that “the proper \ntreatment for individuals like inmate Farmer remains in the providence [sic] of psychotherapy, not in hormonal or \nsurgical manipulation.” Reed’s declaration concludes that Farmer should not be given hormones. Nothing in \nReed’s declaration indicates when he reviewed the Lewisburg report. Nor does this affidavit suggest that he, or \nother  personnel,  took  any  action  or  formulated  an  alternative  treatment  plan  based  on  the  Lewisburg \nrecommendation. \nThe declaration of Dennis Schimmel states that inmates are informed “during the admission and orientation \nprocess that counseling and other psychological services are available to them through the Psychology Services \nDepartment.” That such services were available does not support the conclusion that Farmer failed to request \nthem. This affidavit contains no information about the procedures, if any, an inmate must follow to receive such \nservices. \nMr. Haas states in his affidavit that to the best of his recollection, Farmer never made a written request to him for \ntreatment. However, that statement was made “without the benefit of thoroughly reviewing inmate Farmer’s \nMedical File which is where such a written request would be filed.” Contrary to Haas’ recollection, the district \ncourt record contains several requests addressed to Haas for treatment. No responses to these requests are \nfound in the record. \nIn short, we can find nothing in the record which demonstrates that Oxford personnel prepared a plan of \ntreatment which was made available to Farmer. Nor is there any explanation in the record why Farmer’s requests \nfor treatment were denied. The defendants did not offer any evidence to counter the documentary evidence \nsupplied by Farmer with her brief in opposition to summary judgment. \n  5 \n \n\n \n \n \n  6 \n ",
