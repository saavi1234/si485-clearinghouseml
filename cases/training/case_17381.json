    "summary": "<p>A trans woman housed in a mens' prison in Texas filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas on June 8, 2015 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff represented herself in the trial court, and she was represented on appeal by Stephen Braga, a law professor at the University of Virginia. The case was assigned to Judge Robert Pitman. </p><p>The plaintiff alleged that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's blanket ban on gender affirmation surgery violated the Eighth Amendment because it amounted to deliberate indifference to her medical needs. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that, while incarcerated, her primary care physician was not adequately trained on transgender care and failed to provide her with treatment consistent with the WPATH standards of care. He refused to provide her with an individualized assessment or treatment plan, which denied her access to various forms of treatment that may have been medically necessary. The plaintiff had on several occasions used the prison's formal grievance system to protest this lack of care as well as the blanket policy to no avail. </p><p>The defendants named in this case were the TDCJ Director, the primary care physician who refused to provide the plaintiff with treatment for her gender dysphoria, and and unknown University of Texas Medical Branch official. The Director moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim. On June 8, 2015, the district court granted this motion, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint in its entirety. </p><p>The plaintiff filed an appeal in the Fifth Circuit pro se on September 16, 2016. On October 10, 2017, Professor Stephen Bega began representing her. Judges Smith, Ho and Barksdale heard the case and released an opinion on March 29, 2019 (920 F.3d 212). The majority opinion, written by Judge Ho, held that there had been no Eighth Amendment violation, characterizing the WPATH standards as simply one side of a contested debate rather than the widely accepted standard in the medical field. Judge Ho held that because the doctor and prison administration had merely chosen a side, they were not demonstrating the malicious intent necessary to make out a claim of deliberate indifference.</p><p>Judge Barksdale's dissent, on the other hand, took issue with both the summary judgment procedure used by the lower court and the majority's assessment of the merits. Specifically, he disagreed with the majority's characterization of WPATH, noting that it had become a widely accepted norm that had been acknowledged as such in both the Fourth and Seventh Circuits. Judge Barksdale also questioned whether authorities cited by the majority supported its use of he/him/his pronouns to refer to the plaintiff.</p><p>The plaintiff filed a petition for certiorari (an appeal) in the Supreme Court of the United States on July 1, 2019. The Supreme Court announced on December 9, 2019 that they had declined to hear the case (140 S. Ct. 653). The case is now closed. </p><p>While this case was still ongoing, the plaintiff filed another lawsuit alleging retaliation in response to pursuing these claims. For more information, see <i>Gibson v. Jean-Baptiste</i>, No. 6:17-cv-00042 (W.D. Tex.)</p>",

CAYCE    TEL. 504-310-7700 \nCLERK    600 S. MAESTRI PLACE \n \nNEW ORLEANS, LA 70130 \n   \nNovember 03, 2016 \n \n \n \nMr. Richard Huntpalmer \nOffice of the Attorney General \nfor the State of Texas \nP.O. Box 12548 \nCapitol Station \nAustin, TX 78711-2548 \n \n \n  No. 16-51148  Scott Gibson v. Brad Livingston, et al \n        USDC No. 6:15-CV-190 \n         \n \n \nDear Mr. Huntpalmer, \n \nWe filed the appellant's brief on 10/28/16.  Appellee's brief is \ndue within 30 days of that date, see FED R. APP. P. 31(a)(1).  5TH \nCIR. R. 31 and the Internal Operating Procedures following rules \n27  and  31  state  that  except  in  the  most  extraordinary \ncircumstances, the maximum extension for filing briefs is 30 days \nin criminal cases and 40 days in civil cases. \n \nNew Guidance Regarding Citations in Pleadings. \n \nThe court has approved an amendment to 5TH CIR. R. 28.2.2 granting \nthe Clerk the authority to create a standard format for citation \nto the electronic record on appeal.  You must use the new citation \nformat when citing to the electronic record on appeal. \n \nA.  In single record cases, use the short citation form, \"ROA\" \nfollowed by a period, followed by the page number.  For \nexample, \"ROA.123.\" \n \nB.  For multiple record cases, cite \"ROA\" followed by a period, \nfollowed by the Fifth Circuit appellate case number of the \nrecord referenced, followed by a period, followed by the \npage of the record.  For example, \"ROA.13-12345.123.\"   \n \nImportant notice regarding citations to the record on appeal to \ncomply with the recent amendment to 5TH CIR. R. 28.2.2. \n \nParties are directed to use the new ROA citation format in 5TH CIR. \nR. 28.2.2 only for electronic records on appeal with pagination \nthat includes the case number followed by a page number, in the \nformat \"YY-NNNNN.###\".  In single record cases, the party will use \nthe  shorthand  \"ROA.###\"  to  identify  the  page  of  the  record \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513746027     Page: 2     Date Filed: 10/28/2016\nreferenced.    For  multi-record  cases,  the  parties  will  have  to \nidentify which record is cited by using the entire format (for \nexample, ROA.YY-NNNNN.###). \n \nParties may not use the new citation formats for USCA5 paginated \nrecords.  For those records, parties must cite to the record using \nthe USCA5 volume and or page number. \n \nIn  cases  with  both  pagination  formats,  parties  must  use  the \ncitation format corresponding to the type of record cited. \n \nExplanation:  In 2013, the court adopted the Electronic Record on \nAppeal (EROA) as the official record on appeal for all cases in \nwhich the district court created the record on appeal on or after \n4 August 2013.  Records on appeal created on or after that date \nare paginated using the format YY-NNNNN.###.  The records on appeal \nin  some  cases  contain  both  new  and  old  pagination  formats, \nrequiring us to adopt the procedures above until fully transitioned \nto the EROA. \n \nThe recent amendment to 5TH CIR. R. 28.2.2 was adopted to permit a \ncourt  developed  computer  program  to  automatically  insert \nhyperlinks into briefs and other documents citing new EROA records \nusing the new pagination format.  This program provides judges a \nready link to pages in the EROA cited by parties. \n \nAttention Attorneys: Direct access to the electronic record on \nappeal  (EROA)  for  pending  appeals  will  be  enabled  by  the  U  S \nDistrict Court on a per case basis.  Counsel can expect to receive \nnotice once access to the EROA is available.  Counsel must be \napproved for electronic filing and must be listed in the case as \nattorney of record before access will be authorized.  Instructions \nfor accessing and downloading the EROA can be found on our website \nat  www.ca5.uscourts.gov/attorneys/attorney-forms/eroa_downloads.  \nAdditionally, a link to the instructions will be included in the \nnotice you receive from the district court. \n \nSealed documents, except for the presentence investigation report \nin criminal appeals, will not be included in the EROA.  Access to \nsealed documents will continue to be provided by the district court \nonly upon the filing and granting of a motion to view same in this \ncourt. \n \nPro se litigants may request the record from the district court to \nprepare your brief.  If you wish to receive exhibits, you must \nspecifically request them. \n \nOnce you obtain the record, you should check it within 14 days of \nreceipt  for  any  missing  or  incomplete  items.    If  you  need  to \nrequest a supplemental record or order transcripts, do so promptly.  \nThe court will not grant extensions of time to file your brief \nbecause you did not timely check the record.  \n \nImportant notice: 5TH CIR. R. 30.1.7(c) provides that the electronic \nPDF  version  of  the  record  excerpts  should  contain  pages \nrepresenting the \"tabs\" identified in the index of the document.  \nHowever, we remind attorneys that the actual paper copies of record \nexcerpts filed with the court must contain actual physical tabs \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513746027     Page: 3     Date Filed: 10/28/2016\nthat extend beyond the edge of the document, to facilitate easy \nidentification and review of tabbed documents.  \n \n \n \n                             Sincerely, \n \n                             LYLE W.

They may be properly and concisely \naddressed when consolidated into the following dispositive issues for review:  \n1.  Whether Gibson has established a genuine issue of material fact as to \n  whether policy G-51.11 is unconstitutional on its face or as applied to \n  Gibson. \n \n2.  Whether Defendants were required to affirmatively negate Gibson’s claims \nto be entitled to summary judgment.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  Plaintiff-Appellant  Scott  Lynn  Gibson  (“Gibson”)  is  a  male-to-female \npreoperative transsexual1 who seeks an evaluation for sex-reassignment surgery (“SRS”) \nand, if warranted, the surgery itself, on the grounds that inmates diagnosed with severe \nGender Dysphoria (“GD,” previously known as Gender Identity Disorder), are entitled \nto such treatment under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual \npunishment. \nI.  Gibson’s Background \n  Gibson  has  identified  as  a  female  for  20  years,  but  did  not  begin  receiving \ntreatment for his gender disorder until 2014. ROA.388-89. When Gibson entered TDCJ \n1995, he verbally requested treatment for his undiagnosed gender disorder, but was \ndenied.  ROA.388-89.  The  policy  in  place  at  that  time  prohibited  treatment  for \n                                                           \n1 Though Gibson self-identifies as female, Gibson is biologically male and is confined in a male prison \nunit. For clarity and consistency, this brief will refer to Gibson as male. \n \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 8     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\ntransgender inmates without a gender disorder diagnosed before incarceration. ROA.388-\n89. The current policy, effective since October 2013, does not have this treatment barrier \nfor inmates like Gibson. ROA.266-70.  \n  Once Gibson learned of the new policy and expressed a desire to castrate himself, \nGibson was evaluated by University of Texas Medical Branch doctors at the Skyview \npsychiatric facility and diagnosed with GD in May 2014. ROA.398-99. Gibson has since \nreceived ongoing mental health care, and began receiving hormone therapy in September \n2014. ROA.398-99.    \nII.  Correctional Managed Health Care Policy G-51.11 (“G-51.11”) \n  Policy G-51.11 provides guidelines for the management of inmates with intersex \nconditions and GD. ROA.266-70. The policy provides three levels of procedures to \nmanage inmates with a known intersex condition, those pre-diagnosis, and those who \nreceive a diagnosis while incarcerated. ROA.267-69. The policy provides that inmates \nwith GD “will receive thorough medical and mental health evaluations,” ROA.268, \nmental  health  counseling,  ROA.269,  and,  hormone  therapy  if  warranted  under  the \n[c]urrent, accepted standards of care and the offender’s physical and mental health.” \nROA.269. Gibson’s care and treatment was managed under the guidelines of this policy. \nROA.18, 414. \nIII.  Gibson’s Claim \n  Gibson does not contend that he has not received treatment within the current \npolicy’s  guidelines.  Rather,  Gibson  contends  that  mental  health  care  and  hormone \n2 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 9     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\ntherapy are insufficient to treat his severe GD, and that the policy’s failure to provide \nSRS as a treatment option renders it constitutionally inadequate. In support, Gibson cites \nthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) standards of \ncare for the treatment of transgender individuals, which includes SRS as a last resort \ntreatment option. Gibson argues that Livingston showed deliberate indifference to his \nsevere GD by creating and enforcing a treatment policy, which should—but does not—\ninclude WPATH’s SRS recommendation.  \nCOURSE OF PROCEEDINGS AND DISPOSITION IN THE COURT BELOW \n  Gibson filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Livingston, in his official capacity, \nalleging  the  violation  of  his  Eighth  Amendment  rights.  Gibson  seeks  prospective \ninjunctive relief in the form of an evaluation for SRS, and if necessary, SRS. Gibson \nasserts Livingston was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by creating \nand  enforcing  a  policy  that  provides  constitutionally  inadequate  guidelines  for  the \ntreatment of inmates with GD. Bryan Collier has since taken over from Livingston as \nExecutive Director of TDCJ.   \n  On summary judgment, the district court found Gibson failed to demonstrate a \nviolation of his Eight Amendment rights. ROA.416-17. In assessing Gibson’s claim, the \ndistrict court first considered the current state of relevant Fifth Circuit law, finding no \ncontrolling precedent suggesting that inmates are constitutionally entitled to SRS as a \ntreatment for GD. ROA.416-17. The court next declined to adopt the WPATH standards \nof care under which Gibson sought to hold Livingston accountable, because Gibson \n3 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 10     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nfailed  to  provide  sufficient  summary  judgment  evidence  that  those  standards  were \nconstitutionally required. ROA.416. Finally, the court found that even assuming the \nappropriate standard of care mandated SRS as a treatment option for GD, the record \nevidence  did  not  support  Gibson’s  conclusory  assertion  that  Livingston’s  conduct \namounted to deliberate indifference. ROA.416. On appeal, Gibson challenges the district \ncourt’s conclusions and asserts that the court erred in  granting summary judgment \nbecause Defendants did not affirmatively negate his claims. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n  Gibson cannot establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether policy G-\n51.11  is  unconstitutional.  Gibson  failed  to  produce  competent  summary  judgment \nevidence  demonstrating  that  SRS  is  constitutionally  required  or  that  the  medical \ntreatment he has received under G-51.11 is constitutionally inadequate. Gibson also failed \nto show Livingston’s conduct as a policy-maker amounted to deliberate indifference.  \n  Summary judgment was appropriate due to Gibson’s failure to establish a genuine \nissue of material fact concerning the essential elements of his Eighth Amendment claims. \nLivingston, as the moving party, was not required to affirmatively negate Gibson’s claims \nto be entitled to summary judgment.  \n  The District Court properly dismissed Dr. Greene from the suit sua sponte. That \ndiscretion was within the court’s power under the Federal in forma pauperis statute, and \nGibson failed to allege facts stating a claim on which relief could be granted. This Court \nshould affirm the judgment below in its entirety.  \n4 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 11     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  This Court “review[s] a district court’s decision granting summary judgment de \nnovo, applying the same standards as the trial court.” Milton v. TDCJ, 707 F.3d 570, 572 \n(5th Cir. 2013). “Summary judgment must be granted against a party who fails to make a \nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, \nand on which it will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Pioneer Expl., L.L.C. v. Steadfast Ins. \nCo., 767 F.3d 503, 511 (5th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation mark omitted). To make that \nrequired showing, “the nonmovant must go beyond the pleadings and designate specific \nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. (internal quotation mark omitted). \n“Conclusional  allegations  and  denials,  speculation,  improbable  inferences, \nunsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for \nspecific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). \nARGUMENT \nI.    Gibson Cannot Establish A Genuine Issue Of Material Fact As To Whether \nG-51.11 Is Unconstitutional. \nThe Eighth Amendment is meant to prohibit “unnecessary and wanton infliction \nof pain,” which is “repugnant to the conscience of mankind.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. \n97, 105-06 (1976). The Eighth Amendment’s focus on punishment means that not every \nshortage or failure of medical care violates the Constitution. The Eighth Amendment is \nimplicated only where there is (1) objective proof of a serious medical need, and (2) \ndeliberate indifference to that serious medical need. See id. at 104. Gibson failed to put \nforth evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact as to either of these prongs. \n5 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 12     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nA. Gibson Failed To Produce Evidence Suggesting That The Care Provided \nFor In G-51.11 Is So Inadequate As To Shock The Conscience.  \n \nTo satisfy the first prong of his Eighth Amendment claim, Gibson must show that \nhe has a serious medical need for which he received inadequate care. See Gamble, 429 U.S. \nat 106. This Court has previously declined to hold that GD is a serious medical need. See \nPraylor v. Texas Dep’t of Criminal Justice, 430 F.3d 1208, 1209 (5th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \nThe Court need not reach that issue here because, even assuming that GD is a serious \nmedical need, Gibson has failed to show that the mental health counseling and hormone \ntreatment provided for in G-51.11 is so inadequate as to shock the conscience. In fact, \nas this Court recognized in Praylor, multiple courts have held that not even hormone \ntreatment is required to adequately address GD. See id. at 1209 (citing  cases).  \nTo  be  actionable  under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  medical  care  must  be  so \ninadequate as to shock the conscience. See, e.g., Gamble, 429 U.S. at 106 (actions must be \n“repugnant to the conscience of mankind”); Kosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 83 (1st Cir. \n2014) (en banc) (“[T]he Constitution proscribes care that is so inadequate as to shock the \nconscience.”) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied sub nom., Kosilek v. O’Brien, \n135 S. Ct. 2059 (2015); Miller v. Calhoun Cnty., 408 F.3d 803, 819 (6th Cir. 2005) (“Grossly \ninadequate medical care is medical care that is so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or \nexcessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”) \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  To  support  his  assertion  that  mental  health \ncounseling  and  hormone  therapy  are  inadequate,  Gibson  relied  on  the  WPATH \nguidelines.  ROA.416;  Appellant’s  Br.  12,  17-20.  But  while  those  guidelines  do \n6 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 13     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nrecommend SRS as a form of treatment, they provide no help in determining whether \ndiverging from those guidelines shocks the conscience.  \nAs the district court explained, Gibson put forth “no witness testimony or evidence \nfrom professionals in the field demonstrating that the WPATH-suggested treatment \noption of SRS is so universally accepted, that to provide some but not all of the WPATH-\nrecommended treatment amounts to” a constitutional violation. ROA.416; see also Kosilek, \n774 F.3d at 86-91 (en banc First Circuit reversing district court’s conclusion that WPATH \nguidelines  represented  constitutionally  required  standard  of  care).2  Gibson  failed  to \nprovide any evidence that would give context to the WPATH guidelines—indeed, he did \nnot even provide a full copy of the guidelines. See ROA.416.  \nEvidence that supports the use of a certain treatment is not evidence that such \ntreatment is required. Because Gibson failed to produce the latter evidence, he “fail[ed] \nto make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to” his \n“case,” and the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants. Steadfast \nIns. Co., 767 F.3d at 511 (internal quotation mark omitted).  \nB.  Gibson Failed To Produce Evidence Suggesting That G-51.11     \nAmounts To Deliberate Indifference. \nEven if Gibson did produce evidence suggesting that SRS is medically necessary \nto adequately treat GD, his claim would still fail because he failed to produce any evidence \nsuggesting that anyone “knew or should have known this fact, but nonetheless failed to \n                                                           \n2 Gibson cites the district court’s opinion in Kosilek but overlooks its subsequent reversal. See \nAppellant’s Br. 12. \n7 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 14     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nrespond in an appropriate manner.” Kosilek, 774 F.3d at 91; accord Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. \n294, 298 (1991) (explaining that “the subjective component” of an Eighth Amendment \nclaim asks whether “officials act[ed] with a sufficiently culpable state of mind”). Gibson \nproduced no evidence concerning the process that went into developing G-51.11 or the \nmedical advice received and relied on by prison officials. Without such evidence, it \nimpossible to determine whether “officials act[ed] with a sufficiently culpable state of \nmind.” Wilson, 501 U.S. at 298. \nGibson likewise produced “no evidence addressing the security issues associated \nwith adopting in full the WPATH standards in an institutional setting.” ROA.416. This \nCourt does “not sit to substitute [its] own judgment for that of prison administrators.” \nKosilek, 774 F.3d at 92; accord Hay v. Waldron, 834 F.2d 481, 486 (5th Cir. 1987) (“[A] \ncourt  should  accord  broad  deference  to  prison  administrators  regarding  the \nreasonableness of the scope, the manner, the place and the justification for a particular \npolicy.”). As the First Circuit noted in Kosilek, “[r]ecognizing that reasonable concerns \nwould arise regarding a post-operative, male-to-female transsexual being housed with \nmale prisoners takes no great stretch of the imagination.” 774 F.3d at 93 (citing Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 848-49 (1994)).  \nYet Gibson produced no evidence bearing on this issue. As a result, Gibson has \nagain “fail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element \nessential to” his “case,” and the district court properly granted summary judgment to \nDefendants. Steadfast Ins. Co., 767 F.3d at 511 (internal quotation mark omitted).  \n8 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 15     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nGibson’s Eighth Amendment claim against Livingston as a policymaker fails for \nthe  additional  reason  that  Gibson  failed  to  produce  any  evidence  suggesting  that \nLivingston was personally aware of facts indicating a substantial risk of serious harm or \nthat Livingston was actually aware of that risk. A plaintiff bringing a civil rights claim \nunder  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  must  establish  a  causal  connection  between  the  alleged \nconstitutional  deprivation  and  the  defendant  whom  they  would  hold  responsible; \n“[p]ersonal involvement is an essential element of a civil rights cause of action.” Thompson \nv. Steele, 709 F.2d 381, 382 (5th Cir. 1983); see Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 371-77 (1976) \n(affirmative link needed between injury and conduct of defendant). For a claim of \ndeliberate indifference, a public official must have been personally aware of the facts \nindicating a substantial risk of serious harm, and the official must have actually recognized \nthe existence of such a risk. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838.   \n  Because Gibson sues Livingston as a policymaker, as the district court correctly \nreasoned, Gibson must show that Livingston was aware both that the WPATH standards \nof care were appropriate for inmates diagnosed with GD, and that a substantial risk of \nserious harm would be posed to those inmates absent a policy that provides SRS. Further, \nGibson must show Livingston deliberately created and enforced a policy to deny such \ntreatment despite the known or obvious constitutional violations that would follow. \nGibson, however, produced no evidence of Livingston’s knowledge of any relevant fact \nor risk. As such, summary judgment was appropriate for this reason as well. \n \n9 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 16     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nII.   Rule  56  Does Not  Require  The  Summary  Judgment  Movant  To  Produce \nAffirmative Evidence To Negate A Non-Movant’s Claim. \n \nCiting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), Gibson asserts that the district court \nerred in granting summary judgment to Livingston because Livingston did not produce \nevidence to affirmatively negate Gibson’s claims. See Appellant’s Br. 27-28. Gibson is \nmistaken.  \nSubsection (e) of Rule 56 says nothing about what is needed to negate a non-\nmovant’s claim. Subsection (c), meanwhile, provides that “[a] party asserting that a fact \ncannot be . . . genuinely disputed must support the assertion by . . . showing that the \nmaterials [in the record] do not establish the . . . presence of a genuine dispute, or that an \nadverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.” Thus, contrary to \nGibson’s premise, a summary judgment “movant need not negate the elements of the \nnonmovant’s case.” Steadfast Ins. Co., 767 F.3d at 511 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nBecause Gibson, as the nonmovant, failed to “set forth specific facts showing the \nexistence  of  a  ‘genuine’  issue  concerning  every  essential  component  of  its  case” \n(Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir. 2005)), summary judgment was \nappropriate.3 \nIII. Amicus Curiae Advisory  regarding  the  District  Court’s  proper  dismissal  of \nGibson’s claims against Dr. Greene. \n   \n  Concurrent with its grant of summary judgment in Livingston’s favor, the district \n                                                           \n3 The case relied on by Gibson—Okoye v. University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, 245 F.3d 507 \n(5th Cir. 2001)—correctly states that the non-movant must support her claim with competent \nsummary judgment evidence. See id. at 515. Gibson failed to do that here and thus summary judgment \nwas appropriate. \n10 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 17     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\ncourt  also  dismissed  Gibson’s  claim  against  Dr.  Greene4  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  § \n1915(e)(2), which subjects in forma pauperis complaints to sua sponte dismissal for failure to \nstate a claim on which relief may be granted. See § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The lower court found \nGibson’s allegations against Dr. Greene amounted to a treatment disagreement, not a \nconstitutional violation. ROA.419. This Court should affirm that judgment.  \n  Gibson  asserts  Dr.  Greene,  a  TDCJ  medical  doctor,  violated  his  Eighth \nAmendment  rights  by  refusing  to  provide  Gibson  the  same  treatment—the  items \nnecessary to have “real life experience” as a female—recommended by Dr. McKinney, \nhis UTMB doctor. ROA.284-295; App.Br. 15-16. Gibson concedes that Dr. McKinney \ndid not specify what “real life experience” items included, but asserts it should include \nSRS under the WPATH standards. App.Br. 15-17; accord ROA.417-19. Gibson further \nargues that Dr. Greene is not a GD specialist and therefore did not base his treatment \ndenial on accepted standards of care for inmates with GD but instead relied on the \nguidelines provided by G-51.11. \n  The lower court correctly reasoned that Gibson’s allegations against Dr. Greene \n“fail  to  amount  to  a  constitutional  violation.”  ROA.421.  The  competent  summary \njudgment evidence shows Dr. Greene provided Gibson treatment in line with G-51.11, \na constitutionally adequate policy for managing inmates with GD.  ROA.421; see also \ndiscussion supra at 5-9. Though Gibson plainly disagrees with the extent of the care he \n                                                           \n4 Dr. Greene has not made an appearance in this case and is not represented by the Office of the \nAttorney General for Texas.  \n11 \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00513815284     Page: 18     Date Filed: 12/28/2016\nhas received, Gibson has not and cannot demonstrate Dr. Greene “refused to treat him, \nignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar \nconduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.” \nDomino v. Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, 239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001). Therefore this \nCourt should affirm the District Court’s sua sponte dismissal of Gibson’s claim against Dr. \nGreene. \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should affirm the judgment of the District Court in its entirety. \n \n  Respectfully submitted. \n   \nKEN PAXTON  LACEY E.

Smith, Jr., U.S. District Judge  \n________ \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF OF APPELLANT  \nSCOTT LYNN GIBSON \n________ \n \n  This appeal raises two questions of first impression in this Circuit: is Gender \nDysphoria (“GD”) a serious medical condition, and is Sex Reassignment Surgery \n(“SRS”) a potentially necessary treatment for some who suffer from GD?  If the \nanswer to both of these questions is yes, then Texas state inmates who suffer from \nGD  should  have  SRS  available  as  a  potential  treatment  for  their  condition.  \nOtherwise,  by  proscribing  this  potential  treatment  for  this  serious  medical \nii \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \ncondition, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (“TDCJ”) violates the Eighth \nAmendment’s  ban  on  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishments  by  being  “deliberately \nindifferent” to these inmates’ serious medical needs.  Yet that is exactly what is \nhappening here, to the great and unconstitutional suffering of inmate Scott Lynn \nGibson (“Gibson”) and others like her.         \nSTATEMENT REGARDING ORAL ARGUMENT  \n \nGibson respectfully requests oral argument of this appeal because the issues \nof first impression it raises involve fundamental and evolving rights of the required \ncare and treatment for transgender inmates under the United States Constitution, \nthe analysis of which might be substantially aided by the assistance of counsel at \noral  argument  who  are  familiar  with  the  medical  standards  set  by  The  World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health (“WPATH”), etc.  In addition, as \nappellees’ counsel has informed the Court,1 at least one other case in this Circuit \n(Haverkamp v. Penn, No. 2:17-CV-18 (S.D.Tex. Corpus Christi Division)) has \nbeen    stayed pending the resolution of this appeal, which also counsels in favor of \nthe issues on appeal being fully aired as well.   \n \n                                                 \n1  See Notice Of Form For Appearance for John C.

As  a  result,  this  case  presents  an \nuncluttered record on which this Court can directly address the important legal \nquestions at issue herein. \nGibson’s Transgender Condition  \nGibson  is  a  pre-operational  male-to-female  transgender  inmate  currently \nincarcerated at the A. Hughes Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in \nGatesville, Texas.  ROA.397.  She has openly lived as a female for over twenty \nyears, since the age of fifteen. ROA.388-89.  Gibson is a “female trapped in a \nmale’s body.”  ROA.397.  \n  When  Gibson  entered  TDCJ  in  1995,  she  immediately  requested  to  be \ntreated,  but  her  request  was  denied  because  TDCJ  had  a  policy  at  the  time \nprohibiting  treatment  for  transgender  inmates  who  were  not  diagnosed  before \nincarceration.  ROA.398-99.  As a result, throughout her incarceration, Gibson has \nsuffered from “severe depression and the thoughts of suicide [have become] more \nprevalent and realistic.”  ROA.398-99. \n  Gibson’s condition has led her to abuse her testicles by tying a string around \nthem until they are swollen and dark purple, causing her severe pain.  ROA.407. \n2 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 13     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nShe does this to “stop the testosterones [sic] from entering into [her] body” and “to \ndestroy [her] testicles” because “the pain of having them is overwhelming and \n[she] cannot cope.”  ROA.392.  She also abuses her penis by “pulling it, bending \nit” and she “pulled it one day so hard [she] heard a pop, and severe pain shot into \n[her] stumach [sic] and [she] threw up.”  ROA.392.  She asserts she has “been \nhaving serious thoughts of removing [her] testicles because they make [her] sick, \nmake  [her]  feel  deformed,  and  [she]  cannot  live  in  peace”  because  she  is  in \n“[constant] mental and physical anguish!”  ROA.392.  As she experiences it, her \n“sex organs . . . don’t belong to [her] and [she is] tired of being forced to live with \nthem!”  ROA.393.   \nShe has also attempted suicide three times while incarcerated.  ROA.407. \nShe cut a vein in her arm, causing substantial blood loss, tried to hang herself with \nher light cord, and overdosed on medication.  Id. She has also cut herself “over 100 \ntimes.”  ROA.407.  While Gibson “doesn’t claim she attempted suicide solely due \nto her gender related condition, . . . it did play a significant part in her suicide \nattempts because the constant stress she deals with is at times overwhelming.”  \nROA.398-99. She “feel[s] Deformed, Nasty and it makes [her] Hate [her] body to \nthe point [she] want[s] to Die.”  ROA.406.  \n \n \n3 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 14     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nGibson’s Diagnosis With Gender Dysphoria \n  In 2014, TDCJ rescinded the “non-treatment” policy described above and  \nGibson  then  renewed  her  request  for  treatment.    ROA.266-70.    TDCJ  refused \nGibson’s  request  again,  however,  because  “medical  was  still  enforcing  the  old \npolicy.”    ROA.398-99.  “After  expressing  her  desire  to  casterate  [sic]  herself,” \nGibson was sent to Sky View Unit, a psychiatric facility.  ROA.398-99.  At Sky \nView,  psychiatrist  Robin  L.  Rigsby  diagnosed  Gibson  with  Gender  Dysphoria.  \nROA.386.  \nGibson Continues To Suffer From Her Condition \nGibson  regularly  informed  prison  officials  of  her  distress  and  repeatedly \nrequested her penis and testicles be removed because “having them make[s] [her] \nsick.”  ROA.302-04.  She has to “wear socks over [her] hand to use the restroom \nand to take a shower.”  ROA.407.  Gibson has told “every nurse, doctor” that she \nwill cut her penis and testicles off if she does not get treatment.  ROA.407.  She \nhas “written Medical over 30 times about this and they [told her] she will never get \na Sex change or be treated.”  ROA.407.  Gibson has repeatedly informed doctors of \nthe extreme mental and physical anguish she suffers on a regular basis.  ROA.302-\n04.  \n \n \n4 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 15     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nLimited Treatment Is Prescribed For Gibson \nIn  early  2015,  Gibson’s  primary  care  doctor  at  the  University  of  Texas \nMedical Branch (Dr. McKinney) prescribed certain treatments for Gibson’s GD.  \nROA. 238.  Specifically, the doctor prescribed hormone therapy with estrogen-\npremarin, spirolactone, and finestreride, as well as the “real-life” experience, such \nas access to a bra.  ROA.390. However, Dr. Greene at the prison refused to allow \nGibson the opportunity for the real-life experience portion of her treatment, stating \n“I have never authorized a ‘Man’ a pass to live as a female and I will never do it!”  \nROA.390 (emphasis added). \nGibson Is Denied Evaluation For SRS Treatment \nAs a result of her GD and as a consequence of her continued suffering, \nGibson has repeatedly requested that she be considered for SRS.  ROA.305.  In \nresponse  to  those  requests,  Gibson  has  been  told  that  “TDCJ/UTMB  does  not \nprovide inmates sex changes for any reason.”  ROA.394 (emphasis added).  \nIn addition, because of the TDCJ’s blanket prohibition on SRS, Gibson has \nnot even “been evaluated to see if SRS would adequately treat [her] condition, nor \nhas any doctor made a sound medical judgment [about that potential treatment \noption] based on [her] medical needs.”  ROA.394.  When she wrote a letter to the \nDirector of TDCJ (Brad Livingston) explaining her condition, her depression, and \n5 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 16     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nher thoughts of suicide and self-mutilation, she received a letter in return advising \nher to put in a sick call.  ROA.394 (emphasis added). \nGibson believes that “if [she doesn’t] get a Sex change [she] will end up \ncommitting suicide because the older [she becomes] the strong[er] [her] pain gets, \nas well as the need to abuse [her] body parts.” ROA.407.   \nGibson Files A Lawsuit Over Her Lack Of Treatment \n \n  Feeling left with no alternative by the repeated denials of her requests for \ntreatment, on June 9, 2015, Gibson filed a pro se complaint in the Western District \nof  Texas,  Waco  Division,  against  TDCJ  Director  Brad  Livingston  (“the \nDirector”),2 an unknown University of Texas Medical Branch (“UTMB”) Policy \nMaker, and the Municipality of Gatesville, Texas, alleging violations of her rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. §1983.  ROA.376.  The heart of Gibson’s claim was the TDCJ’s \n“enforce[ment] of a systematic ban on sex reassignment surgery, which creates a \npolicy of deliberate indifference to her gender dysphoria because they refuse to \nallow her to be evaluated to determine if sex reassignment surgery would be a \nviable  medical  treatment  option  based  on  her  medical  needs.    Consequently, \nPlaintiff  has  to  suffer  severe  mental  anguish  that  causes  her  to  have  realistic \nthoughts of committing suicide and of self-castration.”  ROA.380.  As relief on this \n                                                 \n2  Bryan Collier subsequently took over the role of TDCJ’s Executive Director from Livingston, \nas reflected in the current case caption on appeal.  \n6 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 17     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nclaim,  Gibson  sought  a  “declaration  that  this  ban  is  unconstitutional”  and  a \n“permanent injunction” against its ongoing enforcement.  ROA.380.  \n  On October 7, 2015, the Director answered Gibson’s complaint.  His answer \ndenied all of Gibson’s allegations and asserted that Gibson “has failed to state a \nclaim for which relief can be granted under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.”  ROA.136.  The \nDirector  also  asserted  various  affirmative  defenses  and  immunities  against \nGibson’s claims.  ROA.137-38.   \n  On  October  20,  2015,  the  Municipality  of  Gatesville,  Texas  moved  to \ndismiss the claims against it, arguing that it had no role in setting TDCJ policy \nconcerning inmate medical treatment.  ROA.157.  The district court granted this \nmotion on November 17, 2015.  ROA.402.  \n  On December 21, 2015, Gibson sought leave to amend her complaint to \ninclude Dr. Greene as a defendant.  ROA.402.  Greene was the physician who \nrefused to allow Gibson to be treated for her GD as prescribed by her UTMB \nprimary care doctor.  ROA.235-247.  As Gibson put it: “Dr. Greene is not a Gender \nDysphoria  specialist  and  has  never  actually  treated  this  medical  condition.  \nTherefore  he  is  not  qualified  to  deny  Plaintiff  this  treatment  nor  is  he  legally \nqualified to treat Gender Dysphoria.”  ROA.240.  The District Court sua sponte \ndismissed Gibson’s claims against Greene as a matter of law because “Plaintiff \n7 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 18     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \ncannot state a claim for deliberate indifference based on Dr. Greene’s refusal to \nprovide Plaintiff with SRS in accordance with TDCJ policy.”  ROA 418-21.    \n  On February 19, 2016, the Director filed a motion for summary judgment \narguing there was no issue of material fact in dispute as he was (1) entitled to \nqualified or Eleventh Amendment immunity and (2) not deliberately indifferent to \nGibson’s serious medical needs.  ROA.398.  The Director’s grounds for summary \njudgment on the merits of Gibson’s Eighth Amendment claim were presented in \nthree  brief  pages  of  text.    ROA.259-61.    The  crux  of  this  argument  was  its \nrecharacterization of Gibson’s claims as follows: \nPlaintiff complains that sex reassignment surgery is a cure to \nhis  gender  dysphoria  and  that  Defendant  is  medically \nindifferent to his serious medical needs because she hasn’t been \nprovided sex reassignment surgery.  Plaintiff does not get to \nchoose  her  medical  treatment.    Plaintiff’s  medical  records \nindicate  that  she  is  and  has  received  extensive  treatment \nregarding  gender  dysphoria.    Plaintiff  is  receiving  hormone \ntreatment therapy in accordance with the Correctional Managed \nHealth Care Policy Manual, as well as mental health services.  \nPlaintiff’s disagreement with the course of treatment pursued \nby prison medical staff does not constitute a viable claim for \ndeliberate  indifference  to  serious  medical  needs  under  the \nEighth Amendment. \n \nROA.260.        \nOn March 11, 2016, Gibson filed a pro se response in opposition to the \nDirector’s motion for summary judgment arguing there was a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact as to whether (1) Gibson had a serious medical condition in GD, (2) \n8 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 19     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nTDCJ’s policy for treating GD did not follow that of prudent medical professionals \n(as illustrated by WPATH) because those policies effectively eliminated SRS as a \ntreatment option, and (3) the Director  was deliberately indifferent to Gibson’s \nmedical needs by enforcing TDCJ’s policy against Gibson.  ROA.299-320.3  The \ngravamen  of  Gibson’s  opposition  was  to  focus  on  the  right  to  have  her \n“individualized medical needs” determined rather than be subject to the TDCJ’s \n“blanket policy that denies Transgender inmates SRS and allows TDJC’s Doctors \nto ignore their condition by not fully assessing their individualized medical needs \nto determine if SRS would adequately treat her condition.”  ROA.305.  Gibson \nfurther explained: \nThe Defendants claim that Plaintiff cannot choose the care she \nwants.  Plaintiff is not demanding SRS.  If the Court goes by \nher Complaint, it’s clear that she is not requesting SRS, rather \nshe is requesting to be evaluated by a GID specialist so the \ndoctor can fully assess her condition and determine whether or \nnot  based  on  her  individualized  medical  needs  SRS  would \nadequately treat her condition.  If her Doctor cannot assess her \nmedical needs, her condition will not be treated nor will there \nbe a sound medical judgment made. \nROA.305. \nOn August 31, 2016, the district judge granted the Director’s motion for \nsummary judgment.  ROA.419.  The district court held that no reasonable trier of \nfact could determine that Livingston’s conduct in TDCJ’s failure to offer SRS to \n                                                 \n3    Gibson  also  opposed  the  Director’s  arguments  for  Qualified  and  Eleventh  Amendment \nimmunity.  The District Court subsequently ruled in favor of Gibson on these arguments because \nshe was not seeking any monetary relief on his claims, only injunctive relief. ROA.412-13.  \n9 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 20     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nGibson  amounted  to  deliberate  indifference.    ROA.416-17.    In  doing  so,  the \nDistrict Court was influenced by the fact that there was no controlling precedent in \nthis  Circuit  suggesting  that  inmates  are  constitutionally  entitled  to  SRS  as  a \ntreatment  for  GD.    ROA.416-17.    And  it  was  uninfluenced  by  the  WPATH \nStandards of Care which Gibson cited as support for his contention that SRS was a \npotentially medically necessary treatment for her GD that should be evaluated.  \nROA.416.   \nThis appeal followed.4  \nInitial Briefing Before This Court \n  On initial briefing in this Court before undersigned counsel was appointed to \nfile this supplemental brief, the parties submitted the following elucidation of the \nissues.   \n  Gibson  argued,  inter  alia,  that  “Gender  Dysphoria  is  a  serious  medical \ncondition  that  triggers  the  protection  of  the  Eighth  Amendment”  and  that \n“Plaintiff’s factual allegations that the Defendants denied her Sex Reassignment \nSurgery (SRS) based on a blanket policy that denies her and other Transgender \ninmates  SRS  and  other  treatment  and  care  that  the  Standard  of  care  for \nTransgender  Health Care recommends raised a material issue under the Eighth \n                                                 \n4  This Court subsequently entered an order appointing undersigned counsel to represent Gibson \nthrough the filing of this Supplemental Brief on appeal.  See Letter From Deputy Clerk Shawn \nHenderson to Stephen L. Braga dated October 10, 2017. \n10 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 21     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nAmendment.”  Gibson Initial Brief (“Gibson IB”) at 1-2.  In support of these \nclaims, Gibson cited “The World Professional Association For Transgender Health \n(‘WPATH’), a professional Association dedicated to establishing the Standards for \ntreating Gender Dysphoria,” and noted that “[t]hese Standards are accepted by the \nmedical community and Federal courts.”  Gibson IB at 12.5  According to Gibson, \nthe  WPATH  “treatment  protocols  include  socially  transitioning  (dressing, \ngrooming,  and  presenting  oneself  to  others  in  accordance  with  one’s  gender \nidentity),  hormone  therapy,  and  surgeries.    The  particular  course  of  medical \ntreatment varies on the individualized needs of the person.”  Gibson IB at 14.6  By \ncontrast, “TDCJ has designed a health care policy designed to fit all Transgender \ninmates without actually basing the care on their individualized medical needs, and \n[under] Policy G.51.11 Plaintiff and other transgender inmates treatment is frozen \nat the first phase of the treatment.”  Gibson IB at 18. \n  In  his  initial  brief,  the  Director  argued  that  “Gibson  failed  to  produce \nevidence suggesting that the care provided for in G-51.11 is so inadequate as to \nshock  the  conscience.”    Brief  Of  Defendant-Appellee  Bryan  Collier  (“Director \nIB”) at 6.  According to the Director, “[t]o support his assertion that mental health \n                                                 \n5  Gibson also noted that “The National Commission on Correctional Healthcare” cited “the \nWPATH standards of care” in connection with “the medical management of prisoners with \ngender dysphoria.”  Gibson IB at 13.  \n6  With respect to each patient’s “individualized needs,” Gibson also pointed to WPATH’s \nrecognition “that while many individuals need both hormone therapy and surgery to alleviate \ntheir gender dysphoria, others need only one of these treatment options and some need neither.”  \nGibson IB at 18.     \n11 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 22     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \ncounseling and hormone therapy are inadequate, Gibson relied on the WPATH \nguidelines.  But while those guidelines do recommend SRS as a form of treatment, \nthey  provide  no  help  in  determining  whether  diverging  from  those  guidelines \nshocks the conscience.”  Director IB at 7.  The Director also argued that “Gibson \nfailed  to  produce  evidence  suggesting  that  G-51.11amounts  to  deliberate \nindifference.”  Director IB at 7.  As the Director saw it, “[e]ven if Gibson did \nproduce evidence suggesting that SRS is medically necessary to adequately treat \nGD, his claim would still fail because he failed to produce any evidence suggesting \nthat  anyone  ‘knew  or  should  have  known  this  fact,  but  nonetheless  failed  to \nrespond in an appropriate manner.’”  Director IB at 7-8.           \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nIn granting summary judgment, the district court erred by not accepting and \ndeferring to the established consensus of reputable U.S. medical organizations as \nrequired by Supreme Court Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. There is virtually \nunanimous  medical  consensus  around  the  World  Professional  Association  for \nTransgender Health’s (“WPATH”) Standards of Care prescribing the level of care \nrequired  for  the  adequate  care  of  transgender  patients  suffering  from  gender \ndysphoria.  (Indeed, even the TDCJ itself has adopted “parts” of those WPATH \nstandards.)  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Courts have almost uniformly deferred \nto those standards as well.       \n12 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 23     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nYet TDCJ’s policy explicitly deviates from the Standards by not allowing \nconsideration of SRS as a potentially medically necessary treatment for GD, which  \nprevents  evaluation  of  -  and  potential  accommodation  for  -  each  individual’s \nunique medical circumstances. WPATH’s Standards of Care do not provide such  \nflexibility  for  the  provider  of  care  to  deviate  from  the  Standard  when  treating \ngender dysphoria.  By deciding on its own to remove this one aspect of the GD \nstandard of care, the TDCJ has effectively gutted the potential care plan required \nfor those at the most extreme end of the treatment spectrum.     \nPolicy G51.11 constitutes a blanket ban on SRS as a potential treatment for \ngender dysphoria. It prevents TDCJ from making individualized determinations of \ninmates’ medical needs. TDCJ’s repeated refusals to consider SRS as a treatment \nfor inmates like Gibson who continue to experience symptoms of gender dysphoria \nafter other treatments have been prescribed constitutes deliberate indifference to \nserious medical needs.  TDCJ prison officials are well aware of Gibson’s history of \nself-harm and repeated attempts at self-castration and suicide. The refusal to allow \nconsideration  of  such  a  recognized  additional  treatment  options  disregards  an \nexcessive risk that Gibson will harm herself in the future. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  “This Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo, \napplying the same standard as the district court” Kariuki v. Tarango, 709 F.3d 495, \n13 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 24     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \n501 (5th Cir. 2013).  In reviewing such a judgment, the facts “must be viewed ‘in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party’ and ‘all reasonable inferences’ \nmust be drawn in favor of that party.” Griffin v. Hess Corp., No. 17-30165, 2017 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 22011, at *4 (5th Cir. Nov. 3, 2017) (internal citation and quote \nmarks omitted).  And summary judgment is proper only if \"there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \nARGUMENT \n \n  The  Eighth  Amendment  prohibits  the  infliction  of  “cruel  and  unusual \npunishments.” U.S. CONST., amend. VIII.  The Supreme Court has specifically \nidentified the deliberate indifference to a serious medical need as a violation of the \nEighth  Amendment  because  such  actions  can  “produce  physical  ‘torture  or  a \nlingering death.’”  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103-104 (1976).  “It is . . .  \nobduracy  and  wantonness”  that  defines  such  an  Eighth  Amendment  violation, \nwhether  it  “occurs  in  connection  with  establishing  conditions  of  confinement, \nsupplying medical needs, or returning order to a tumultuous cellblock.” Whitley v. \nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986).   \nTo state a claim under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate indifference to \na serious medical need, the plaintiff must satisfy two prongs. First, the plaintiff \nmust show the prison officials were “aware of facts from which an inference of \n14 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 25     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nexcessive  risk  to  the  prisoner’s  health  or  safety  could  be  drawn.”  Herman  v. \nHoliday,  238  F.3d  660,  664  (5th  Cir.  2001).7    Second,  the  plaintiff  must \ndemonstrate that the prison officials acted with “deliberate indifference” to such \n“potential harm,” as evidenced by denials of requests for treatment, disregard for \nongoing symptoms and the like.  Holiday, 238 F.3d at 664.  \nI.    GENDER DYSPHORIA IS A SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION \n  In  Praylor  v.  TDCJ,  430  F.3d  1208,  1209  (5th  Cir.  2005),  this  Court           \n“[a]ssum[ed], without deciding, that transexualism does present a serious medical \nneed.”  In the District Court, the Director went one step further and asserted that \n“based upon the existence of policy G-51.11, TDCJ appears to recognize gender \ndisorder as a serious medical need.”  Defendant’s Motion For Summary Judgment \nat  7.8    The  Director’s  concession  in  this  regard  is  well-taken  in  light  of  the \ncontinually evolving standards surrounding GD. \n  Thus,  other  courts  have  consistently  recognized  gender  dysphoria  as  a \nserious medical condition. See Kosilek v. Spencer, 774 F.3d 63, 86 (1st Cir. 2014) \n(“That GID is a serious medical need, and one which mandates treatment, is not in \ndispute in this case.”); De’lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d 520, 525 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(“De’lonta has alleged an objectively serious medical need for protection against \n                                                 \n7  See also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 838 (1996). \n8  As the District Court put it in reliance on these moving papers, the Director “does not argue \nthat GID/GD is not a serious medical condition for Fifth Amendment purposes.”  Order of \nAugust 31, 2016 (“Dist. Ct. Order”) at 15.  \n15 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 26     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \ncontinued self-mutilation.”); Allard v. Gomez, 9 Fed. App’x 793, 794 (9th Cir. \n2001)  (mem.)  (“It  is  now  undisputed  that  the  appellant  suffered  from  [gender \nidentity disorder], that appellant repeatedly sought hormone treatment for it . . . and \nthat the disorder constituted a serious medical need.”); Murray v. United States \nBureau of Prisons, No. 95-5204, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 1716, *11 (6th Cir. Jan. \n28, 1997) (per curiam) (“[T]ranssexualism is a recognized medical disorder, and \ntranssexuals  often  have  a  serious  medical  need  for  some  sort  of  treatment”); \nMeriwether  v.  Faulkner,  821  F.2d  408,  413  (7th  Cir.  1987)  (“Courts  have \nrepeatedly  held  that  treatment  of  a  psychiatric  or  psychological  condition  may \npresent a “serious medical need” under the Estelle formulation . . . [t]here is no \nreason to treat transsexualism differently than any other psychiatric disorder. Thus \n. . . plaintiff’s complaint does state a “serious medical need.””). \n  Based on this unanimity of opinion, this Court should not hesitate to make it \nclear in this Circuit from this point forward that GD is a serious medical condition \nfor purposes of the Eighth Amendment.  It is time to resolve this question of first \nimpression left open in the twelve years since Praylor.9    Plainly, that question \nmust be resolved in Gibson’s favor. \n   It is important in this analysis, however, not only to recognize that GD is a \nserious medical condition, but also to recognize just how serious it is.  See Helling \n                                                 \n9  Thus, the court below should be the last to have to consider the fact that “[t]he Fifth Circuit \nhas yet to recognize unequivocally that transsexualism presents a serious medical need.”   \n16 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 27     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nv. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993)(evaluating the significance of the risk of \nfuture harm).  As the facts of record concerning Gibson’s situation amply reveal, \ninadequate  treatment  for  inmates  suffering  from  gender  dysphoria  presents  a \nsignificant  risk  of  future  self-harm  and  psychological  suffering.    Without \nappropriate treatment, those inmates - like Gibson - can continue to struggle with \nthoughts of self-mutilation and suicide as a result of their condition.10   Death can, \nthus, be the unfortunate result of mistreated GD.  Nothing is more “serious” than \nthat.  \nII.    SEX  REASSIGNMENT  SURGERY  IS  A  POTENTIALLY \nMEDICALLY  NECESSARY  TREATMENT  FOR  GENDER \nDYSPHORIA \n \n  Once GD is properly recognized as a serious medical condition, the Eighth \nAmendment analysis then turns to the potential treatments for that condition.  The \nDistrict Court stumbled in this regard on this Court’s holding in Praylor II that \n“the  refusal  to  provide  hormone  therapy”  did  not  constitute  “deliberate \nindifference” to Praylor’s medical needs.  Dist. Ct. Order at 18.  As the district \njudge explained, “[w]ith this precedent, the Court cannot make the leap to hold that \na policy that does not provide surgery to treat GID/GC necessarily constitutes \ndeliberate indifference.”   Id. at 18-19.          \n                                                 \n10  As Exhibit 3 submitted in support of Gibson’s opposition to the motion for summary \njudgment against him below indicates: “An October 2010 study done by the National Center for \nTransgender Equality found that 41% of transgender people in the U.S. have attempted suicide, \ncompared to a rate of 1.6% for the general population.”  \n17 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 28     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \n  Like all decisions, of course, the Praylor precedent is limited to its own \nfacts,  which  are  dramatically  different  than  the  facts  before  this  Court.    For \nexample,  in  Praylor’s  situation,  hormone  therapy  was  available  as  a  treatment \noption in the prison and Praylor was evaluated for such therapy on two occasions.  \nSee 430 F.3d at 1209.  In this case, Gibson’s complaint is predicated on the fact - \nundisputed by the Director - that SRS is not available as a treatment option in the \nprison.  Similarly, in Praylor’s case, there is no indication that Praylor had been \ndiagnosed with GD.  See id.  In this case, by contrast, Gibson has been labeled with \nthat serious diagnosis.  Finally, in Praylor’s case, the prison’s evaluation of him \nconcluded that there was no “medical necessity for the hormone.”  Id.  In Gibson’s \ncase,  her  principal  complaint  is  that  prison  policy  G-51.11  robs  her  of  the \nopportunity to have any such individualized determination of the potential medical \nnecessity of SRS made for her GD.    \n  But perhaps the most important distinction between Praylor and this case is \nthe fact that the Praylor decision does not contain any discussion whatsoever of the \nauthoritative medical consensus concerning the WPATH Standards of Care for \nTransgender Health, which have evolved significantly since Praylor.  Yet in this \n18 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 29     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nCourt, those standards are front and center for review, as part of another question \nof first impression for this Court to review.11  \nA.   WPATH’s Standards of Care are Universally Accepted by \nthe  Medical  Community  as  the  Appropriate  Standards  of \nCare  for  Transgender  Individuals,  Including  Incarcerated \nIndividuals. \n \nThe  World  Professional  Association  for  Transgender  Health  (“WPATH”)12 \ndevelops  and  publishes  the  Standards  of  Care  for  the  Health  of  Transsexual, \nTransgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People (Standards of Care), which are \nrecognized  in  the  medical  community  as  the  authoritative  standards  for  the \nprovision of transgender health care.  Gibson submitted the WPATH Standards of \nCare to the District Court Exhibit 4 to his opposition to the Director’s summary \njudgment motion.  As relevant to this case, Standard of Care XI for “Surgery” and \ntitled  “Sex  Reassignment  Surgery  Is  Effective  and  Medically  Necessary,” \nprovides: \nSurgery - particularly genital surgery - is often the last and the \nmost  considered  step  in  the  treatment  process  for  gender \ndysphoria.    While  many  transsexual,  transgender  and  gender \nnon-conforming  individuals  find  comfort  with  their  gender \nidentity, role and expression without surgery, for many others \nsurgery is essential and medically necessary to alleviate their \n                                                 \n11\n Cf. Dist. Ct. Order at 17 (recognizing Gibson’s case as presenting “an issue of first impression \nin this Circuit” because “there is no Fifth Circuit precedent holding that denying an inmate SRS \nto treat GID/GD amounts to an Eighth Amendment violation”).    \n12  WPATH is an international professional association with membership consisting of more \nthan 600 physicians, psychologists, social scientists, and legal professionals dedicated to the \ntreatment of gender identity disorders.  \n19 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 30     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \ngender  dysphoria.    For  the  latter  group,  relief  from  gender \ndysphoria cannot be achieved without surgery. \n \nExhibit  4  at  9-10.13    This  is  in  direct  contrast  with  the  Texas  Department  of \nCriminal Justice’s (“TDCJ”) policy on the “Treatment of Offenders with Intersex \nConditions,”  which  remains  silent  as  to  the  availability  of  SRS  and  instead \npractically  limits  the  available  care  to  hormonal  therapy,  which  is  insufficient. \nROA.69.10-ROA.69.11. \nThe district court below did not fully consider TDCJ’s inadequacy under the \nWPATH Standards of Care because Gibson provided “no witness testimony or \nevidence from professionals in the field demonstrating that the WPATH-suggested \ntreatment option of SRS is so universally accepted, that to provide some but not all \nof  the  WPATH-recommended  treatment  amounts  to  deliberate  indifference.”14 \nROA.69.19.  \n                                                 \n13 However, as this option is “often the last and the most considered step in treatment” per \nWPATH’s  Standards  of  Care,  SRS  would  be  medically  permissible  only  after  the  patient \nreceives two referrals from medical professionals.  In such a referral, medical professionals must \nverify  that  the  patient  has  a  “persistent,  well  documented  gender  dysphoria”  and  state  the \n“clinical rationale for support in the patient’s request for surgery.” WPATH, STANDARDS OF \nCARE  FOR  THE  HEALTH  OF  TRANSSEXUAL,  TRANSGENDER,  AND  GENDER  NONCONFORMING \nPEOPLE 27-8, 59 (2011) (“Standards of Care”).  The rationale requirement is usually met by \nstating the inadequacy of less intrusive treatment options such as lifestyle treatment (such as \nwearing gender conforming clothes) and hormone therapy. \n14 The district court also appeared to charge the appellant with the burden of negating all of the \ninstitutional  safety  and  other  concerns  associated  with  implementation  of  the  treatment \nalternative. Id. Affirmative proof of such factual concerns should more properly fall on the \ninstitution  in  the  first  instance.    See  Fields  v.  Smith,  653  F.3D  550,  557  (7th  Cir.  2011) \n(Defendant sought proof of their institutional concerns through their expert witness, of which, \nwas rejected due to substantial risk of transgender violence even without treatment); see also, \n20 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 31     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nAlthough Gibson, a pro se plaintiff below, did not directly present evidence of \nthe  WPATH  Standard  of  Care’s  “universal[]  acceptance,”  such  universal \nacceptance  by  the  medical  community  can  readily  be  factually  inferred  and/or \njudicially noticed under FED. R. EVID. 201, especially at the summary judgment \nphase.15 It is undisputed, in fact, that all reputable U.S. medical organizations have \nrecognized WPATH as the proper standard of care. No professional organization \nof mental health care, including the APA, has prescribed its own standards of care \nfor transgender individuals suffering from gender dysphoria; all instead all defer to \nWPATH,  AM.  PSYCHIATRIC  ASS’N,  REPORT  OF  THE  APA  TASK  FORCE  ON  THE \nTREATMENT OF GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER 6 (2011).  WPATH, thus, stands alone \nin this regard, as even the TDCJ has implicitly recognized by deciding to follow \n“some . . . of the WPATH-recommended treatment.”  Dist. Ct. Order at 19.  \nIn addition, the American Medical Association articulated unequivocally that \nWPATH “is the leading international, inter-disciplinary professional organization \ndevoted to the under-standing and treatment of gender identity disorders, and has \nestablished  internationally  accepted  Standards  of  Care  for  providing  medical \n                                                                                                                                                             \nLong v. Nix, 877 F. Supp. 1358, 1361 (S.D. Iowa 1995) (Defendant had acting warden testify in \neffort to prove the institutional concerns). \n15 Specifically, FED. R. EVID. 201(b)(2) states that “[t]he court may judicially notice a fact that is \nnot subject to reasonable dispute because it can be accurately and readily determined from \nsources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Furthermore, “The court may take \njudicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.” FED. R. EVID. 201(d). See also Lovelace v. \nSoftware Spectrum, 78 F.3d 1015, 1018-19, n.1 (5th Cir. 1996) (A court may under FED. R.

(Dec.  21,  2016), \nhttp://www.wpath.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=1352&pk_a\nssociation_webpage=3947. \nFinally, and most importantly, the National Commission on Corrective Health \nCare  (“NCCHC”)  cites  the  WPATH  Standards  of  Care  as  “[t]he…accepted \nstandards developed by professionals with expertise in transgender health,” that \nprison doctors must follow in treating prisoners suffering from gender dysphoria. \n22 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 33     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nNCCHC, Transgender, Transsexual, and Gender Nonconforming Health Care in \nCorrectional Settings (Apr. 2015), https://www.ncchc.org/ \ntransgender-transsexual-and-gender-nonconforming-health-care.  \nThus, not only was TDCJ’s policy for transgender prisoners below the medical \ncommunity’s  consensus  to  follow  the  WPATH’s  standards  for  the  transgender \ncommunity  in  general—given  the  NCCHC’s  adherence  to  WPATH  standards, \nTDCJ’s policy also fell short of the standards directed by the national medical \ncommission to ensure the proper standard of care for prisoners.  \nThis overwhelming consensus from the medical community has led naturally to \nthe WPATH Standards of Care similarly being recognized by various U.S. courts, \nincluding the Fourth Circuit, as the preeminent authority for the care required for \ncorrectional inmates.  De'Lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d 520, 522-23 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(describing WPATH as “the generally accepted protocols” for treatment of gender \ndysphoria); Norsworthy v. Beard, 74 F. Supp. 3d 1100, 1104 (N.D. Cal. 2015) \n(describing WPATH as the “leading medical research and standards of care” and \ngranting  prisoner  suffering  from  gender  dysphoria  a  preliminary  injunction  for \nSRS based on the expert medical consensus from WPATH); Soneeya v. Spencer, \n851 F. Supp. 2d 228, 231 (D. Mass. 2012) (recognizing “the ‘Standards of Care’ \npromulgated by the [WPATH]” as “the course of treatment for Gender Identity \nDisorder generally followed in the community”); Fields v. Smith, 712 F. Supp. at \n23 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 34     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \n838 n.2 (E.D. Wis. 2010) (acknowledging WPATH’s Standard of Care as “the \nworldwide acceptable protocol for treating GID”), aff’d 653 F.3d 550 (7th Cir. \n2011). \nB.    By Not Deferring to the Clearly Established Medical Expert \nConsensus  of  WPATH’s  Standards  of  Care,  the  District \nCourt Departed from Clear U.S. Supreme Court Precedent \nand Eighth Amendment Jurisprudence. \n   \nThe district court erred in refusing to defer to the general consensus of the \nmedical community that the WPATH standards of care govern the treatment of \ngender dysphoria prisoners. This refusal violates U.S. Supreme Court precedent \nand  Eighth  Amendment  jurisprudence,  especially  for  purposes  of  ruling  on  a \nmotion  for  summary  judgment  when  all  reasonable  factual  inferences  must  be \nfound in favor of the non-moving party.   \nIn considering Eighth Amendment cases involving complex medical science, \nthe Supreme Court has repeatedly deferred to the existing general consensus in the \nmedical  community.  In  Akins  v.  Virginia  for  instance,  the  Supreme  Court \ndetermined  that  the  state  justification  of  retribution  and  deterrence  for  the \nexecution of mentally retarded prisoners violated the Eighth Amendment. 536 U.S. \n304, 319-20 (2002).  The Court arrived at this conclusion after deferring to the \ngeneral consensus of medical experts from the American Association on Mental \nRetardation and the American Psychiatric Association as to the clinical definition \nof mental retardation. Id., at 318.   \n24 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 35     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nAgain, when considering a matter of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence in Roper \nv. Simmons, the Supreme Court deferred to the consensus of the expert medical \ncommunity. 543 U.S. 551, 569 (2005). In finding an Eighth Amendment violation \nfor  juvenile  capital  punishment,  the  Supreme  Court  relied  on  a  consensus  of \n“scientific and sociological studies” in holding that juveniles cannot reliably be \nconsidered to hold the same moral reprehensibility as adult worst offenders. Id.  \nThe District Court should have followed the same approach here. \nIII.    TDCJ’S DENIAL OF SRS AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT \nFOR  INMATES  SUFFERING  FROM  GD  VIOLATES \nGIBSON’S EIGHTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO MEDICAL \nCARE  \n \nEven if this court does not find error in the lower court’s refusal to defer to \nthe medical community’s acceptance of the WPATH standards of care, this court \nshould still reverse the District Court’s decision on Eighth Amendment grounds. In \nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff, the facts of this case demonstrate, at the \nvery least, a deliberate indifference to Gibson’s serious medical condition and risk \nof serious harm in the future.  \nThe  repeated  denial  of  Gibson’s  requests  for  consideration  for  SRS \nconstitutes  deliberate  indifference  to  her  serious  medical  needs  in  light  of  her \ncontinuing symptoms. She has presented factual allegations which, when taken as \ntrue, as required in this appeal, demonstrate that her medical condition is serious \nand that the defendants are aware of the serious risk resulting from her symptoms. \n25 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 36     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nThe defendants have nonetheless continued to deny her requests for consideration \nfor  SRS  based  on  Policy  G  51.11’s  blanket  ban  rather  than  an  individualized \nmedical assessment.  Gibson’s allegations state a valid claim under the Eighth \nAmendment’s  protections  against  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  should  be \nresolved at trial.  \n It is a truism that under the Eighth Amendment, inmates are not entitled to \nideal care or care of their choosing. Varnado v. Lynaugh, 920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th \nCir. 1991). Rather, the plaintiff must show that the prison officials were “aware of \nfacts from which an inference of excessive risk to the prisoner’s health or safety \ncould be drawn” and that the prison officials “actually drew an inference that such \npotential for harm existed.” Herman v. Holiday, 238 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir. 2001). \nUnder this standard, the plaintiff must show officials “refused to treat him, ignored \nhis complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar \nconduct  that  would  clearly  evince  a  wanton  disregard  for  any  serious  medical \nneeds.” Id. (citing Johnson v. Treen, 759 F.2d 1236, 1238 (5th Cir. 1985)).  \n  Other  circuits  have  found  that  the  denial  of  consideration  for  SRS  can \nconstitute an Eighth Amendment violation, particularly where the denial is based \non a policy creating a blanket ban on surgery without consideration of the inmate’s \nspecific circumstances. See Rosati v. Igbinoso, 791 F.3d 1037, 1039-40 (9th Cir. \n2015) (finding a viable Eighth Amendment claim where California prison denied \n26 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 37     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nher sex reassignment surgery based on a blanket ban or the recommendation of a \nphysician’s  assistant  without  experience  in  transgender  medicine);  De’lonta  v. \nJohnson, 708 F.3d 520, 525 (4th Cir. 2013) (finding plaintiff’s complaint sufficient \nto  state  a  claim  where  she  suffered  from  constant  mental  anguish  and \noverwhelming urges to castrate herself); Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d 550, 555 (7th \nCir. 2011) (finding a state policy prohibiting the use of state funds for hormone \ntherapy and sex reassignment surgery was unconstitutional because it prohibited \neffective treatment for a serious medical condition).  \n  In  De’lonta  v.  Johnson,  the  Fourth  Circuit  reversed  the  lower  court’s \ndismissal  where  the  plaintiff  suffered  from  constant  mental  anguish  and \noverwhelming urges to castrate herself despite having received hormone therapy, \nmental health consultations, and real-life experiences. De’lonta, 708 F.3d at 525. \nDe’lonta had been repeatedly hospitalized following self-castration attempts and \nhad repeatedly requested SRS under the WPATH Standards of Care for gender \ndysphoria. De’lonta, 708 F.3d at 522. The court held that, while the prison had \nprovided some treatment for De’lonta’s gender dysphoria, “it does not follow that \nthey have provided the constitutionally mandated level of treatment” and that the \nplaintiff did not need to show “a total deprivation of care” for the court to find “a \nconstitutional violation.” Id. The court recognized that while hormone therapy and \n27 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 38     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nreal-life experiences can treat some cases of gender dysphoria, others require SRS \nwhen the symptoms persist. Id. at 523.  \nThe state’s argument that SRS was merely a preferred treatment failed to \nacknowledge  the  ongoing  symptoms  of  De’lonta’s  underlying  condition.  Id. \nAlthough  the  requisite  level  of  treatment  cannot  be  determined  solely  by  the \ninmate’s choice, it must address the serious medical need causing the inmate’s \nsuffering.  Id.  The  Fourth  Circuit  made  a  helpful  comparison  to  painkillers \nprescribed for persistent pain, explaining that the prison could not deny an inmate \nconsideration for surgery just because she had received one form of treatment if it \nhad not alleviated her symptoms. Id. at 526.  \nSimilarly,  in  Rosati  v.  Igbinoso,  the  Ninth  Circuit  found  the  plaintiff’s \ncomplaint was sufficient to state a claim where she alleged the prison had denied \nher request for SRS in a California prison based either on a blanket ban or on the \nrecommendation  of  a  physician’s  assistant  without  any  experience  treating \ntransgender patients. 791 F.3d at 1039-40. While the state argued there was no \nblanket ban, it also admitted that, “no California prisoner has ever received SRS,” \nsuggesting no request for the procedure would be approved. Id. at 1040. The court \nheld that “even absent such a blanket ban, Rosati plausibly alleges her symptoms \n(including  repeated  efforts  at  self-castration)  are  so  severe  that  prison  officials \nrecklessly disregarded an excessive risk to her health by denying SRS solely on the \n28 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 39     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nrecommendation  of  a  physician’s  assistant  with  no  experience  in  transgender \nmedicine.” Id. at 1040.  \nIn  Fields  v.  Smith,  the  Seventh  Circuit  affirmed  the  lower  court’s \ndetermination  that  a  Wisconsin  statute  prohibiting  the  prescription  of  hormone \ntherapy and SRS was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the plaintiffs \nbecause it violated the Eighth Amendment. 653 F.3d 550. The Seventh Circuit \naffirmed the district court’s holding that “plaintiffs suffered from a serious medical \nneed, namely GID, and that defendants acted with deliberate indifference in that \ndefendants  knew  of  the  serious  medical  need  but  refused  to  provide  hormone \ntherapy because of [the statute].” Id. at 555. The court cited testimony from doctors \nstating  they  could  think  of  “no  other  state  law  or  policy,  besides  [the  Act  in \nquestion],  that  prohibits  prison  doctors  from  providing  inmates  with  medically \nnecessary treatment” as evidence that hormone therapy and SRS are necessary \nmedical treatments for inmates suffering from gender identity disorder. Id. at 554.  \nSimilar to the Fourth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit stated that “[s]urely, had \nthe Wisconsin legislature passed a law that DOC inmates with cancer must be \ntreated  only  with  therapy  and  pain  killers,  this  court  would  have  no  trouble \nconcluding that the law was unconstitutional.” Id. at 556. The court viewed both \ncancer and transsexualism as serious medical conditions requiring treatment and \nstated that the refusal to provide effective treatment “serves no valid penological \n29 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 40     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \npurpose  and  amounts  to  torture.”  Id.  at  556.    While  the  statute  in  question \nprohibited both hormone therapy and SRS, the court refused to separate the two \ntreatments because the statute removed any consideration of either treatment for \ninmates suffering from gender identity disorder regardless of medical need. Id. at \n559.  \nNot surprisingly in light of the ample authority delineated above, District \nCourts throughout the country have similarly found blanket bans on consideration \nfor SRS as a treatment for gender dysphoria to be unconstitutional under the Eighth \nAmendment. See Denegal v. Farrell, No. 1:15-cv-01251, U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83373 \n(E.D.  Cal.  May  31,  2017)  (refusing  to  order  summary  judgment  where  a \ntransgender woman alleged vaginoplasty was medically necessary to treat her GID \nand was only available for cis women); Shadle v. Frakes, No. 8:16CV546, 2017 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 53731 (D. Neb. Apr. 7, 2017) (stating the alleged denial of \nhormone therapy and SRS was sufficient to overcome summary judgment); Tate v. \nWexford Health Source, Inc., No. 3:16-cv-00092 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20391, at *7, \n*10 (S.D. Ill. Feb. 18, 2016) (holding summary judgment is inappropriate where \nthe prison’s policy prevents evaluation for SRS and fails to train personnel to treat \ntransgender inmates); Barrett v. Coplan, 292 F. Supp. 281 (D.N.H. 2003) (finding \nthe plaintiff’s complaint was sufficient where a policy prohibited hormone therapy \nand SRS despite repeated self-castration and suicide attempts). \n30 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 41     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nThe federal government has now come in line solidly behind these Courts as \nwell.  Just two weeks ago, United States District Court Judge Marvin Garbis issued \na preliminary injunction against implementation of the Department of Defense’s \nnew policies with respect to transgender members of the military, which included a \ndirective aimed at future funding for Sex Reassignment Surgery.  See Stone v. \nTrump, Civil Action No. MJG-17-2459 (D. Md. Nov. 21, 2017).  In the course of \naddressing the claims before him, Judge Garbis noted that the federal “[d]efendants  \ndo not dispute that the military has a statutory obligation to provide medically-\nnecessary treatment, nor that surgical procedures are sometimes necessary to treat \ntransgender  individuals  who  have  been  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria.”  \nMemorandum And Order Re: Motions at 51. \nAnd just a week before Judge Garbis‘ decision, the Pentagon approved SRS \nfor an active-duty transgender member of the military.  See “Pentagon Approves \nGender-Reassignment Surgery for Service Member,” The New York Times (Nov. \n14, 2017).  As Dana W. White, the chief Pentagon spokeswoman, explained: “the \nindividual  who  underwent  the  surgery  had  already  started  a  sex-reassignment \ncourse of treatment and that the individual’s doctor said the surgery was medically \nnecessary.”  Id.             \nMotions for summary judgment should be denied where the decision to deny \naccess  to  SRS  or  other  treatment  was  made  with  knowledge  of  the  plaintiff’s \n31 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 42     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nongoing attempts to harm herself. See Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d 1104, \n1117-18 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (denying summary judgment where the plaintiff alleged \nprison was “fully aware she faced a serious medical need for SRS and failed to \naddress her ongoing anguish.”); Gulley-Fernandez v. Wisc. Dept. of Corr., No. 15-\ncv-995,  2015  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  161623  (E.D.  Wis.  Dec.  1,  2015)  (denying \nsummary judgment where inmate was prohibited from receiving hormone therapy, \nreal life experiences, and SRS); Konitzer v. Frank, 711 F. Supp. 874, 908 (E.D. \nWis. 2010) (“[A] reasonable jury could find that the defendants were deliberately \nindifferent to Konitzer’s serious medical need where they failed to provide him \nwith the second step of treatment  . . . in the face of his repeated mutilations and \nsuicide attempts. Clearly, what the defendants were doing to treat Konitzer was not \nworking”).  That should plainly be the result here as well.  On this record, a \nreasonable  factfinder  certainly  could  find  that  TDCJ’s  policy  rewriting  the \nWPATH standards of care to eliminate the potentially medically necessary SRS \ntreatment  for  those  suffering  the  most  from  GD  does  indeed  “shock  the \nconscience.”  \n  Policy G 51.11 constitutes a blanket ban on SRS because it does not provide \nfor evaluation for SRS when other treatment options do not address the patient’s \nongoing  symptoms.  Just  as  the  Fourth  and  Seventh  Circuits  asserted,  denying \nfurther  treatment  options  is  akin  to  providing  ineffective  treatment  options  for \n32 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 43     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nother serious conditions, like cancer or physical ailments requiring surgery. See \nDe’Lonta, 708 F.3d at 526; Fields, 653 F.3d at 556. Where other treatments fail to \naddress the underlying issue and the inmate continues to suffer with symptoms of \ngender  dysphoria,  a  failure  to  consider  other  treatment  options  constitutes \ndeliberate indifference to the inmate’s serious medical condition.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Sometimes cases are more difficult than they seem at first blush.  Other \ntimes they are easier.  Under proper analysis, Gibson’s case falls into the latter \ncategory.  “Surely, had the . . . legislature passed a law that DOC inmates with \ncancer must be treated only with therapy and pain killers, this court would have no \ntrouble concluding that the law was unconstitutional.”  Fields v. Smith, 653 F.3d \n550, 556 (7th Cir. 2011).  The substance of Gibson’s situation is no different.  \nTDJC Policy G 51.11 effectively provides that its transgender inmates must be \ntreated only with part of the recognized standard of care for patients suffering from \nGender Dysphoria.  Under the Eighth Amendment, however, prison officials are \nnot allowed to substitute their judgment for the medical profession on the scope of \nsuch treatment. \n  This is not a case of a prison authority deciding only to offer one of a variety \nof  equally  effective  alternative  medical  cares.    Quite  to  the  contrary.    As  the \nWPATH Standards of Care and the many courts (and others) who have relied upon \n33 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 44     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \nthose  standards  make  clear,  the  consensus medical care for GD is a gradually \nincreasing  spectrum  of  care  ending  with  SRS  as  the  most  severe  potential \nmedically necessary treatment for those patients for whom the prior nonsurgical \ntreatments  have  proved  unsuccessful.    Thus,  TDCJ’s  policy  removes  from  the \ntreatment equation the final alternative treatment potential for those GD patients \nwho are suffering the most.  SRS is the last treatment standing for these patients. \n  As  demonstrated  above,  GD  is  a  serious  medical  condition.    A  deadly \nserious one.  This is not a routine prison medical case of poison ivy.  It is rather a \ncase of poison itself.  And Policy G-51.11 does not reflect a prison policy of \noffering calomine lotion instead of cortisone cream for such routine medical care.  \nRather, it reflects a policy of withholding the only potential antidote for the poison \nof  GD  in  those  individuals  whose  suffering  continues  unabated  by  lesser \ntreatments. \n  If a prisoner in Texas gets bitten by a poisonous rattlesnake, could the prison \nrefuse to consider providing that prisoner with the anti-venom that might save the \nprisoner’s life.  Of course not.  That would be precisely the type of “torture” that \nthe Eighth Amendment prohibits.  That is also precisely the type of potentially \nmedically necessary care that is being withheld from consideration here.  And as \nthe facts of Gibson’s suffering detailed in the record amply reveal, she is just as \nsurely going through “torture” as well.   \n34 \n \n\n      Case: 16-51148      Document: 00514261733     Page: 45     Date Filed: 12/05/2017\n \n \n  The Eighth Amendment demands better from prison officials, for Gibson \nand  for  all  those  who  might  follow  in  her  footsteps.    Our  society’s  evolving \nstandards  of  decency  must  require  this  Court  to  reverse  the  decision  below.  \nGibson respectfully prays that it do so promptly.                    \n          Respectfully Submitted,  \n \n  /s/ Stephen L.

W-15-CA-190 \n§ \nv. \n§ \n§ \nBRAD LIVINGSTON, et al., \nDefendants. \nORDER \nBefore  the  Court  are  the  following  Motions:  1)  Defendant  Livingston's  Motion  for \nSummary Judgment (Doc. 50); 2) Plaintiffs Motion Requesting the Court Consider the Court's \nHolding in Praylor v.  TDCJ (Doc. 60); 3) Plaintiffs Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order \nand Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 62); 4) Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Dr. Greene to Respond to \nPlaintiff's § 1983 Complaint (Doc. 66); and 5) Plaintiff's Motion to Allow Plaintiff to Use TDCJ \nSpokesman Jason Clark's Statement as Proof to Support her Lawsuit (Doc. 67). \nPlaintiff Vanessa Lynn Gibson 1 (\"Plaintiff') is an inmate in the custody of the Texas \nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division (\"TDCJ\"). She is presently \nconfined at the Alfred Hughes Unit in Gatesville, Texas. Plaintiff is proceeding prose and in \nforma pauperis in this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nI.  Factual Background As Alleged By Plaintiff \nAccording to her original Complaint filed on June 8, 2015, Plaintiff is 37-year-old male-\nto-female preoperative transsexual. (Doc. 1, Memo. at 2). She has lived as a female since the age \n1 The Court will refer to Plaintiff in this Order as her preferred gender of female, using feminine pronouns. Such use, \nhowever, is not to be taken as a factual or legal finding. \n1 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 2 of 23\nof 15. ld.  She was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria (GDi by TDCJ doctors at the Skyview \npsychiatric facility. ld Plaintiff believes she is a female trapped in a male's body, which causes \nher to have realistic thoughts of committing suicide and of self-castration. /d Plaintiff alleges she \nhas, in fact, attempted suicide on three occasions and has made attempts to destroy her testicles. \nJd  When Plaintiff first entered TDCJ in 1995, she verbally requested treatment for her gender \ndisorder but TDCJ denied her request. Id .  at 3. Her depression and suicidal thoughts became \nmore prevalent over the years, and in 2014, Plaintiff learned that TDCJ amended its policy, \nwhich had previously prohibited transgender inmates who  were  not diagnosed  with Gender \nIdentity Disorder (GID) prior to incarceration from receiving treatment. Jd After expressing the \ndesire to castrate herself, Plaintiff was sent to the TDCJ' s Skyview psychiatric facility where a \npsychiatrist diagnosed Plaintiff with GD and recommended hormone therapy. !d. \nDr. Kevin McKinney subsequently placed Plaintiff on estrogen and spironolactone. Id \nPlaintiff explained to Dr. McKinney that she could not live in a male's body because it caused \n2 Plaintiff has been diagnosed with \"Gender Identity Disorder\" and \"Gender Dysphoria.\" The TDCJ G-51.11 Policy, \nthe policy at issue in this case, does not appear to distinguish between the two diagnoses for the purposes of \ntreatment. For the sake of ease and clarity, the Court will refer to Plaintiff's disorder as \"GID/GD,\" except in \ninstances where the Plaintiff or a medical provider indicates an individual diagnosis of GID or GD. \nThe TDCJ policy uses the defmitions set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth \nEdition. (Def.'s Mot., Ex. Cat 1). \nGender Identity Disorder (GID) -A strong and persistent cross-gender identification, which is the desire to be, or the \ninsistence that one is of the other sex. This cross-gender identification must not merely be a desire for any perceived \ncultural advantages of being the other sex. There must also be evidence of persistent discomfort about one's \nassigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex (Criteria B). The diagnosis is not made if \nthe individual has a concurrent physical intersex condition (e.g., androgen insensitivity syndrome or congenital \nadrenal hyperplasia) (Criteria C). To make the diagnosis, there must be evidence of clinically significant distress or \nimpairment in social occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criteria D). [Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR), p. 576]. \nGender Dysphoria (GD)-refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one's experienced or \nexpressed gender and one's assigned gender. This term replaces GID and has the following criteria: Marked \nincongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender for a specified time and associated \nclinically significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis can be made with a concurrent disorder of sex \ndevelopment. [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) p. 451-453]. \n2 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 3 of 23\nher to hate herself and gave her thoughts of committing suicide. !d. Dr. McKinney told Plaintiff \nhe could only treat her with female  hormones because TDCJ policy bans sex reassignment \nsurgery (\"SRS\"). Id Plaintiff also requested Dr. McKinney issue her a pass that would allow her \nto \"live as a female.\" !d.  at 4. Plaintiff has also made requests to TDCJ to have her genitals \nremoved,  but the  Defendants have  ignored her or told  her  no.  ld  Finally,  Plaintiff asked \nDefendants if, in light of the \"ban\" on SRS, she could have a pass to live and dress as a female \nand keep her hair at least seven inches long, but her request was denied. Id \nPlaintiff alleges the TDCJ' s \"blanket ban\" on SRS is unconstitutional both facially and \nas-applied because it deprives inmates with GID/GD of their right to medical care under the \nEighth Amendment. Id.  at 5.  Plaintiff argues the Eighth Amendment requires Defendants to \nprovide adequate medical care of quality acceptable when measured by prudent professional \nstandards of the community, tailored to  an inmate's specific medical needs. Id.  at 6,  citing \nBarrett v. Coplan,3 292 F. Supp. 2d 281 (D.N.H. 2003). According to Plaintiff, the TDCJ policy \nis at odds with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health's (WPATH) standard \nfor the treatment of transgender individuals, which states that SRS is necessary to treat \"some \npeople adequately.\" !d. at 6. \nPlaintiff alleges the TDCJ' s policy is unconstitutional on its face because it prohibits \ntransgender  inmates  with  severe  GID/GD  from  being  referred  to  a  specialist to  determine \nwhether SRS is necessary to adequately treat their disorder on an individual basis, and further, it \nindiscriminately and arbitrarily denies transgender inmates SRS, even when medically necessary. \nld. at 5. As applied to Plaintiff, the current policy only offers treatment that \"reduce[s] the pain \n[her disorder]  causes,\"  but it denies  her  SRS,  which would  also  treat her  serious  medical \n3 Plaintiff cites to \"Burrett v. Lop/en\" however the case-style associated with 292 F. Supp 2d 281 is \"Barrett v. \nCoplan.\" \n3 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 4 of 23\ncondition.  Id .  at 5.  In Plaintifr s case,  the policy  allows  Defendants to \"ignore her serious \nmedical needs\" and results in a substantial risk of serious harm because Plaintiffs illness causes \nher to have realistic thoughts of suicide and self-castration. Id Plaintiff alleges Defendants are \naware of this risk because she has put Defendants on notice that she has thoughts of suicide and \nself-castration and that the TDCJ' s policy is unconstitutional. Id at 7. \nPlaintiff seeks (1) a declaration that the ban is unconstitutional (2) a permanent injunction \nordering Defendants to rescind the ban on SRS and add SRS to the TDCJ' s health care policy, \n(3) judicial notice of the WPATH's statements that SRS is medically necessary treatment, and \n(4) costs and attorneys' fees. (Doc. 1 at 4). \nIn her original Complaint, Plaintiff names three Defendants: TDCJ Executive Director \nBrad Livingston, an unknown policymaker at the University of Texas Medical Branch {UTMB) \n\"who created and enforc[es] the ban,\" and the municipality of Gatesville, Texas. (Doc. 1 at 3). \nOn November 17, 2015, the Court granted Defendant Gatesville's Motion to Dismiss, and the \nmunicipality of Gatesville was terminated from this lawsuit. (Doc. 41 ). \nOn December 21, 2015, Plaintiff sought leave to amend her Complaint. (Doc. 48). In her \nAmended Complaint, which the Court construes as a supplemental complaint, Plaintiff asserts \nclaims against \"Dr. Greene\" for denying her the treatment her doctor at UTMB prescribed her to \ntreat her GID/GD. (Doc. 55). Plaintiff alleges that on July 28, 2015, Dr. McKinney from UTMB \nprescribed  estrogen-premarin,  spiro lactone  [sic],  and  finastreride  [sic]  to  treat  Plaintiffs \nGID/GD. (ld at 1). Plaintiff asserts Dr. McKinney also prescribed \"the real-life experience\" and \nordered that Plaintiff be provided the items necessary to freely live as a female. !d.  Plaintiff \nadmits Dr. McKinney's order did not specify what items Plaintiff should be allowed to have. Jd. \nHowever, Plaintiff alleges that the WPATH standard of care recommends the \"triadic therapy,\" \n4 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 5 of 23\nwhich  includes  hormone  therapy,  \"real-life  experiences,\"  and  sex  reassignment  surgery  for \ntreating GID/GD. /d. at 2. \nPlaintiff alleges Dr. Greene, a medical doctor who is not a GD specialist, refused Dr. \nMcKinney's orders, citing the TDCJ policy, which does not provide transgender inmates the \nreal-life experience, nor does the TDCJ allow transgender inmates to live as females or express \ntheir gender.  Id  Plaintiff alleges  Dr.  Greene  is  violating her Eighth Amendment rights by \ndenying the treatment prescribed by Dr. McKinney. /d. at 1. Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Dr. \nGreene's acts violate Plaintiff's constitutional rights and an injunction granting Plaintiff the \ntreatment prescribed by Dr. McKinney. /d.  at 4. The Court ordered service on Dr. Greene on \nMarch 1, 2016. (Doc. 54). A return receipt shows Dr. Greene was served by certified mail return \nreceipt on March 21, 2016. (Doc. 65). However, as of the date of entry of this Order, Dr. Greene \nhas not filed an Answer or otherwise responded to Plaintiff's Supplemental Complaint. \nII.  Livingston's Motion for Summary Judgment \nDefendant  Livingston  filed  a  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  along  with Plaintiff's \ngrievance records, Plaintiff's medical records from January 2014-August 17, 2015, and TDCJ \nPolicy No. G-51.11. (See Docs. 50 & 52). Livingston argues he is entitled to qualified immunity \nfor claims against him in his individual capacity, and Plaintiff's claims against him in his official \ncapacity are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. (Doc. 50). Plaintiff filed a Response (Doc. 58), \nalong with an affidavit, her psychiatric records from Skyview (Ex. A2), literature on the subject \nof health  care  and  transgender  individuals,  including  excerpts  from  a  report  detailing  the \nWP A TH Standard of Care (Exs. 3 & 4 ), a copy of the TDCJ' s policy on surgical castration for \nsex  offenders  (Ex.  5),  copies  of correspondence  sent  to  Plaintiff from  TDCJ  Correctional \nManaged Health Care (Ex. 6), and relevant TDCJ grievance records (Exs. 7 -9). \n5 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 6 of 23\nIII.  Relevant Summary Judgment Evidence \nA.  Medical and Grievance Records \nMedical records show medical staff first saw Plaintiff regarding her GID/GD on February \n20, 2014 after she submitted a sick call request asking for treatment for GID. (Def.'s Mot., Doc. \n52, Ex. B at 10 ). She reported emotional and physical distress because she feels she is a girl and \nthe  officers  and  inmates  teased  her.  ld  She  reported  a  long  history  of mental  health  and \nbehavioral issues, including one overdose attempt in 2005 or 2006 and a hanging attempt that \nwas never reported. Id She claimed she was threatened \"with cases\" because she likes to wear \nmakeup and style her hair. !d. She reported she is often depressed because of frequent requests of \na sexual nature from other inmates. Id She claimed she has been living as a girl for over 20 \nyears. Id She denied any thoughts of harming herself or others. Id \nIn March and April of 2014, Plaintiff submitted sick calls stating she is a transsexual and \na woman in a man's body, but when mental health services responded, she told mental health \nservices her sick call was meant to go to medical. /d. In May of 2014, mental health services saw \nher again after she requested counseling for GID. Id On May 14, 2014, Plaintiff was diagnosed \nwith GID. /d.  at 10.

TDCJ Policy \nLivingston submitted as summary judgment evidence Correctional Managed Health Care \nPolicy G-51.11, the TDCJ' s policy on the \"Treatment of Offenders with Intersex Conditions, \nGender Disorder or Gender Dysphoria.\" It provides in relevant part: \nII. An offender with documented or claimed Gender Identity Disorder (GID) or Gender \nDysphoria (GD) will receive thorough medical and mental health evaluations. \nA.  The offender will be continued on the same hormone regimen, if any, upon arrival \nto TDCJ. \nB.  A  concerted  effort  will  be  made  to  expeditiously  obtain  the  offender's  prior \nmedical and psychological records. \n10 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 11 of 23\nC.  Medical  evaluation  will  include  a  thorough  history  and  complete  physical \nexamination. \nD.  Mental  Health  evaluation  will  be  conducted  by  a  qualified  mental  health \nprofessional (QMHP). If conducted by a non-psychiatrist, the evaluation and any \nsupporting  information  must  be  reviewed  by  a  psychiatrist.  Only  a  licensed \npsychiatrist may make the diagnosis of GID or GD within TDCJ. \nIII. When a diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria is made -\nA.  Mental health counseling will be offered. \nB.  Current, accepted standards of care and the offender's physical and mental health \nwill determine if advancement of therapy is indicated. \n1.  If hormone therapy is indicated, the offender will be referred to a medical \nprovider competent to prescribe hormone therapy. \n2.  Hormone therapy will be requested through the non-formulary process. \n3.  Documentation of patient education and written consent are required prior to \nsubmission of the non-formulary request (see Attachments A-1 and A-2). \n4.  If hormone therapy is prescribed, the offender will also be followed in chronic \ncare clinic with regular assessments for potential complications of hormone \ntherapy (e.g. hypertension, liver disease, heart disease, breast cancer, etc.). \n(Def. 's Mot., Doc. 52, Ex. C). \nC.  WPA  TH Standard of Care \nPlaintiff's Response includes portions of the 2012 \"Standards of Care for the Health of \nTranssexual, Transgender and Gender-Noncomforming People\" published by the WPATH. (Pl.'s \nResp., Doc. 58, Ex. 4). The excerpts provide in relevant part: \nGender Nonconformity is Not the Same as Gender Dysphoria \nWhat helps one person alleviate gender dysphoria might be very different from what \nhelps another person. This process may or may not involve a change in gender expression \nor body modifications. Medical treatment options include, for example, feminization or \nmasculinization of the body through hormone therapy and/or surgery, which are effective \nin alleviating gender dysphoria and are medically necessary for many people. Gender \nidentities and expressions are diverse, and hormones and surgery are just two of many \noptions available to assist people with achieving comfort with self and identity. Report \nPg. 5. \nSex Reassignment Surgery is Effective and Medically Necessary \nSurgery--particularly genital surgery-is often the last and the most considered step in \nthe treatment process for gender dysphoria. While many transsexual, transgender, and \ngender-nonconforming  individuals  find  comfort  with their gender  identity,  role,  and \nexpression without surgery, for many others surgery is essential and medically necessary \nto alleviate their gender dysphoria (Hage & Karim. 2000). Report Pg. 54. \n11 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 12 of 23\n(Pl.'s Resp., Doc. 58, Ex.  4).  The report also suggests access to \"these medically necessary \ntreatments should not be denied on the basis of institutionalization or housing arrangements.\" /d. \n4 \nat Report Pg. 67.\nIV.  Summary Judgment Standard \nThis Court may grant summary judgment on a claim if the record shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute of any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  56(c ). A party who moves for summary judgment has the burden of \nidentifying the parts of the pleadings and discovery on file that, together with any affidavits, \nshow the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n324 (1986). If the movant carries this burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmovant to show \nthat the Court should not grant summary judgment. /d.  at 324-325. The nonmovant must set \nforth specific facts that show a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 256 (1986). The nonmovant cannot rely on conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, \nand unsupported speculation. Krim v.  BancTexas Group,  Inc., 989 F.2d 1435,  1449 (5th Cir. \n1993). The Court must review the facts and draw all inferences most favorable to the nonmovant. \nReidv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 784 F.2d 577,578 (5th Cir. 1986). \nv.  u.s.c. \n42  § 1983 \nTitle 42 U.S.C. § 1983 creates a cause of action against any person who, under \ncolor of law, causes another to be deprived of a federally protected constitutional right. Section \n1983 provides, in pertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or \nusage, of any state ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the \n4 Plaintiff also submitted a brief report from Lambda Legal aggregating the position statements of various health \norganizations with respect to transgender care. See Ex. 4. \n12 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 13 of 23\nUnited States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation \nof any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws \nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity or other \nproper proceeding for redress ... \n42  U.S.C.  §  1983.  Section 1983  was promulgated to prevent \" ...[ a government official's] \n[m]isuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the [official] \nis clothed with the authority of state law.\" Johnston v.  Lucas, 786 F.2d 1254, 1257 (5th Cir. \n1986);  Whitley v.  Albers, 475  U.S.  312 (1986); Davidson  v.  Cannon,  474 U.S.  344 (1986), \nDaniels v.  Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986). Section 1983 does not create substantive rights; rather, \nit merely provides a remedy for deprivations of rights established elsewhere. City of Oklahoma \nCity v.  Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 816 (1985). To bring an action within the purview of Section 1983, \na claimant must first identify a protected life, liberty, or property interest, and then prove that \ngovernment action resulted in a deprivation of that interest. Baker v.  McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, \n140  (1979);  Mahone  v.  Addicks  Utility  Dist.,  836  F.2d  921  (5th  Cir.  1988);  Villanueva  v. \nMcinnis, 723 F.2d 414,418 (5th Cir. 1984). \nOnly two allegations are required in order to state a cause of action under § 1983. \"First, \nthe Plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right. Second, he must \nallege that the person who has deprived him of that right acted under color of state or territorial \nlaw.\" Gomez v.  Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640 (1980); Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d 808, 812 (5th \nCir. 1988). Allegations of a prisoner's complaint, '\"however inartfully pleaded,' are held 'to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\"' Hughes v.  Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 9 \n(1980); Haines v.  Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972). It is also clear that civil rights complaints \nmust be pleaded with specific facts, not merely conclusory allegations.  Thompson v.  City of \nStarkville, Mississippi, 901 F.2d 456, 469 n. 13 (5th Cir. 1990); Elliot v. Perez, 751 F.2d 1472, \n1479 (5th Cir. 1985). \n13 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 14 of 23\nVI.  Deliberate Indifference Claim \nThe Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause allows an inmate to obtain relief after being \ndenied medical care if he proves that there was a \"deliberate indifference to [his] serious medical \nneeds.\" Banuelos v.  McFarland, 41  F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.  1995) (quoting Estelle v.  Gamble, \n429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976)). Deliberate indifference requires a showing that the Defendant (1) was \n\"aware of facts from which an inference of excessive risk to the prisoner's health or safety could \nbe drawn,\" and (2) that he \"actually drew an inference that such potential for harm existed.\" \nHerman v.  Holiday, 238 F.3d 660, 664 (5th Cir. 2001). In Domino v.  Texas Dep't of Criminal \nJustice, the Fifth Circuit discussed the high standard involved in showing deliberate indifference \nas follows: \nDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet. It is indisputable that \nan incorrect diagnosis by medical personnel does not suffice to state a claim for \ndeliberate indifference. Rather, the plaintiff must show that the officials \"refused to \ntreat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in \nany similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious \nmedical needs.\" !d. Furthermore the decision whether to provide additional treatment \n\"is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment.\" And, the \"failure to alleviate \na significant risk that [the official] should have perceived, but did not\" is insufficient \nto show deliberate indifference. \n239  F.3d  752,  756  (5th  Cir.  2001)  (citations  omitted).  A disagreement  with the  treatment \nprovided by a doctor does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. See  Varnado  v. \nLynaugh, 920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir. 1991). \nVII.  Livingston's Motion for Summary Judgment \nLivingston alleges he  is  entitled to qualified immunity to  the extent Plaintiff asserts \nclaims against him in his individual capacity.  Government officials sued in their individual \ncapacities for money damages are entitled to qualified immunity from liability insofar as their \n14 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 15 of 23\nconduct does not violate a clearly-established constitutional right of which a reasonable person \nwould  have  been  aware.  See  Mangaroo  v.  Nelson,  864  F.2d  1202,  1206  (5th  Cir.  1989) \n(emphasis  supplied).  The  Plaintiff in this case,  however,  seeks  injunctive relief,  not money \ndamages. Thus, Livingston's qualified immunity defense is not relevant. The relief sought by \nPlaintiff can only be provided by the individual defendant in his official capacity. Accordingly, \nwhat remains is Plaintiff's claim against Livingston in his official capacity as Executive Director. \nTo that end, Defendant asserts Plaintiffs claim against him in his official capacity is \nbarred  by  the  Eleventh  Amendment.  However,  as  mentioned  previously,  Plaintiff  seeks \nprospective injunctive relief, not money damages and \"the Eleventh Amendment does not bar \nclaims for prospective relief against state officials acting in their official capacity.\" See Edelman \nv. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 664 (1974); Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908); Nelson v.  Univ. of \nTex. at Dallas, 535 F.3d 318, 321-22 (5th Cir. 2008). Thus, Plaintiffs claim is not barred by the \nEleventh Amendment.  Plaintiff cannot prevail against Livingston, however, because Plaintiff \ncannot demonstrate a violation of her Eighth Amendment rights. \nLivingston does not argue that GID/GD is not a serious medical condition for Eighth \nAmendment purposes. See Def. 's Mot. at 7 (\"based upon the existence of policy G-51.11, TDCJ \nappears to  recognize gender disorder as a serious medical need\"). The Fifth Circuit has not \naddressed the issue of whether an inmate is entitled to SRS as a treatment for GID/GD. The \nmagistrate judge in this division previously addressed the issue of whether a TDCJ inmate is \nentitled to hormone therapy as a treatment for GID/GD in Pray/or v. TDCJ, Civil No. W- 04-CA-\n058. In Pray/or, the Magistrate concluded that hormone therapy was not constitutionally required \nfor the Plaintiff, based in part upon testimony developed at a Spears hearing that the Plaintiff had \nnot initiated the process for an operative sex change and did not qualify under the then-existing \n15 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 16 of 23\npolicy for treatment. Further, the magistrate found that Plaintiff[']s disagreement with the non \nhormonal  treatment  pursued  by  prison  medical  staff did  not  constitute  a  viable  claim  for \ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs under the Eighth Amendment. \nThe plaintiff in Pray/or appealed the magistrate's decision to the Fifth Circuit who issued \na decision  at  423  F.3d  524  (5th  Cir.  2005)  (\"Pray/or  f') which  was  later withdrawn  and \nsubstituted for the decision in Pray/or v.  TDCJ, 430 F.3d 1208 (5th Cir. 2005) (\"Pray/or If'). \nInitially, the Fifth Circuit decided to follow those circuits that determined transsexualism to be a \nserious medical need raising Eighth Amendment considerations, but held that such inmates do \nnot have a constitutional right to hormone therapy. Pray/or, 423 F.3d at 525-26. In affirming the \nmagistrate's  decision,  the  Fifth  Circuit  concluded  that  \"the  prison  facility  must  afford  the \ntranssexual inmate some form of treatment based upon the specific circumstances of each case.\" \nId at 526. Shortly after their initial decision, the Fifth Circuit withdrew its decision in Pray/or I \nand held \"[a]ssuming, without deciding, that transsexualism does present a serious medical need, \nwe  hold that,  on this record, the refusal  to  provide hormone therapy did not constitute the \nrequisite deliberate indifference.\" Pray/or, 430 F.3d at 1209. \nThe magistrate addressed the issue again in Young v. Adams, 693 F. Supp. 2d 635 (W.D. \nTex. 2010). In that case, the magistrate determined the Plaintifrs claims were barred by the \nstatute of limitations, however the magistrate went on to hold that in any event the Plaintiff failed \nto show evidence of a violation of his federal civil rights because he was not entitled to receive \nhormone therapy under the facts as alleged and developed at the Spears hearing. /d. at 639. The \nMagistrate again recognized that, under Pray/or II, there currently is no controlling precedent in \nthe Fifth Circuit as to whether refusing hormone therapy to a person diagnosed with gender \ndysphoria violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. \n16 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 17 of 23\nHowever, the Magistrate recognized the Fifth Circuit's implication that under certain facts the \nrefusal to provide hormone therapy will not constitute deliberate indifference. Jd. \nThe version of G-51.11  in force  at the  time  Young  was  decided  provided hormone \ntherapy in circumstances in which the inmate is close to release and committed to proceeding \nwith a sex change operation immediately upon discharge. Id.  at 641. The magistrate determined \nYoung did not meet the requirements to receive hormone treatment. Id The Magistrate found \nthat the policy was \"reasonable and supports legitimate penological interests such as maintaining \norder and discipline within the prison unit.\" !d. The magistrate concluded that the existence of \npolicy G-51.11, coupled with adherence to the same in the case of the Plaintiff, is also evidence \nin and of itself that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs serious medical \nneeds under the Eighth Amendment. Id \nThis case presents  a different issue and  an  issue  of frrst  impression in this  Circuit. \nPlaintiff here concedes she has received hormone therapy and instead argues the TDCJ policy is \nunconstitutional because it does not provide for inmates diagnosed with GID/GD to be evaluated \nby a specialist to determine if SRS is necessary, nor does it provide for SRS if deemed necessary. \nPlaintiff recognizes there is no Fifth Circuit precedent holding that denying an inmate SRS to \ntreat GID/GD amounts to an Eighth Amendment violation, however Plaintiff argues there is a \nconsensus of persuasive authority from other circuits demonstrating it is unconstitutional to deny \nPlaintiff medical care based on a blanket policy, especially when a Plaintiffs medical condition \nhas not be fully assessed. (Doc. 58 at 13, citing, e.g., Fields v.  Smith, 653 F.3d 550 (7th Cir. \n2011) (affirming district court's invalidation on Eighth Amendment grounds of a Wisconsin state \nstatute  prohibiting  the  Wisconsin  Department  of  Corrections  (\"DOC\")  from  providing \ntransgender  inmates  with  hormonal  therapy  and  sexual  reassignment  surgery);  Kosilek  v. \n17 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 18 of 23\nSpencer,  740  F.3d  733  (1st  Cir.  2014)  (affirming  district  court's  injunction  requiring  the \nMassachusetts Department of Corrections to provide SRS to inmate suffering from severe gender \ndysphoria), rev'd en bane, 774 F.3d 63 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding care provided to inmate by the \nMassachusetts Department of Corrections does not violate the Eighth Amendment); De 'Lonta v. \nJohnson, 708 F.3d 520 (4th Cir. 2013) (reversing and remanding district court's dismissal of \nEighth Amendment Claim based on denial of consideration for sex reassignment surgery)). \nIt is worth noting that the TDCJ's policy does  not include an outright ban on SRS. \nHowever,  at  present,  the  policy  does  not  go  beyond  providing  mental  health  services  and \nhormone therapy for inmates with GID/GD. Based on the current state of the law in this Circuit \nregarding the medical treatment of prisoners with GID/GD and the record in this case, this Court \ndeclines to hold that the TDCJ' s policy is unconstitutional either on its face or as applied to \nPlaintiff. After Pray/or II, there is still no controlling precedent in the Fifth Circuit as to whether \nrefusing hormone therapy to a person diagnosed with GID/GD violates the Eighth Amendment \nprohibition against cruel  and unusual punishment, although the  Fifth Circuit does appear to \nimply  that  under  certain  facts  the  refusal  to  provide  hormone  therapy  will  not  constitute \ndeliberate indifference. The Fifth Circuit has yet to recognize unequivocally that transsexualism \npresents a serious medical need. The Fifth Circuit substituted its initial decision in Pray/or I \nwhere it stated that \"[a]lthough this circuit has not addressed the issue of providing hormone \ntreatment  to  transsexual  inmates,  we  will  follow  those  circuits  that  have  determined \ntranssexualism to be a serious medical need raising Eighth Amendment considerations\" with its \ndecision in Pray/or II,  where it stated \"assuming, without deciding, that transsexualism does \npresent a serious medical need, we hold that, on this record, the refusal to provide hormone \ntherapy did not constitute the requisite deliberate indifference.\" See Pray/or I, 423 F.3d at 526; \n18 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 19 of 23\nPray/or II, 430 F.3d at 1209. With this precedent, the Court cannot make the leap to hold that a \npolicy  that  does  not  provide  surgery  to  treat  GID/GD  necessarily  constitutes  deliberate \nindifference. 5 \nFurther,  Plaintiff's  argument  rests  in part on the  premise  that the  TDCJ's policy is \nunconstitutional  because  it  does  not  comply  with  the  treatment  standard  set  forth  by  the \nWPATH. The Court does not dismiss Plaintiffs argument that the WPATH's standard of care \nhas gained wide acceptance. However, Plaintiff provides as summary judgment evidence only \nportions of the WP ATH report, and no witness testimony or evidence from professionals in the \nfield  demonstrating  that  the  WP AT  H -suggested  treatment  option  of SRS  is  so  universally \naccepted, that to provide some but not all of the WP ATH -recommended treatment amounts to \ndeliberate  indifference.  More  importantly,  the  record  contains  no  evidence  addressing  the \nsecurity issues associated with adopting in full the WP ATH standards in an institutional setting. \nAs such, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden in demonstrating sufficient evidence exists from which \na reasonable trier of fact could conclude the TDCJ's failure to offer SRS amounts to deliberate \nindifference. \nAssuming arguendo the standard of care for GID/GD does mandate SRS as a treatment \noption for inmates, Plaintiff fails to show Livingston's official conduct amounts to deliberate \nindifference. In order to show deliberate indifference, a public official must have been personally \naware of facts indicating a substantial risk of serious harm, and the official must ~ave actually \nrecognized the existence of such a risk. Farmer v.  Brennan, 511  U.S.  825, 838 (1994). Thus \nPlaintiff must  demonstrate  Livingston,  as  TDCJ  policymaker,  was  and  is  aware  that  the \ns Plaintiff also names as a Defendant an unknown policymaker at UTMB \"who created and enforc[es] the ban.\" \nPlaintiff's claim against this policymaker in his or her official capacity is a claim against the state. For the reasons \ndiscussed, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate the TDCJ's policy is unconstitutional under Fifth Circuit law. Plaintiff \ncannot, therefore, prevail against this Defendant. Additionally, as of the date of entry of this Order, Plaintiff has \nfailed to name, serve, or request service upon this Defendant. Accordingly, dismissal of this Defendant is proper. \n19 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 20 of 23\nappropriate standard of care for inmates with GID/GD requires an assessment for SRS, and, if \nwarranted, SRS, and further, that the treatment set forth in the TDCJ's policy does not provide a \nsuitable alternative. Plaintiff must further demonstrate Livingston had and has knowledge of the \nsubstantial  risk  of serious  harm  posed  to  GID/GD  inmates  by  not  providing  for  surgical \ntreatment, and deliberately set forth and persists in enforcing a policy to deny such treatment, \ndespite the known or obvious consequence that constitutional violations will result. Plaintiff does \nnot demonstrate  sufficient evidence  from  which a reasonable  factfinder  could conclude that \nLivingston was aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of \nserious harm existed and that Livingston actually drew that inference. \nFinally, after reviewing Plaintiffs submissions, she does not present a policy or scenario \nthat fails  to provide constitutionally adequate treatment.  In contrast, the summary judgment \nevidence demonstrates the TDCJ policy provides mental health counseling and hormone therapy \nwhen appropriate to inmates with GID/GD.  Plaintiff, per TDCJ policy, has received extensive \nand ongoing mental health care as well as hormone therapy to treat her GID/GD since 2014. Of \ncourse, Plaintiff would prefer a policy that provides SRS. However, a Plaintiffs disagreement \nwith the diagnostic decisions of medical professionals does not provide the basis for a civil rights \nlawsuit. Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to establish there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether the policy is unconstitutional on its face or as applied to Plaintiff. \nVIII.  Plaintiff's Claim Against Dr. Greene \nIn her Supplemental Complaint, Plaintiff states Dr. McKinney from UTMB prescribed \nher Estrogen-permarin,  spirolactone  [sic],  and  finastreride  [sic]  to  treat  her  GID/GD.  (Pl.'s \nSuppl.  Compl., Doc.  55  at 1).  She alleges that on July 28,  2015, Dr.  McKinney prescribed \nPlaintiff \"the real-life experience\" and ordered that Plaintiff be provided the items necessary to \n20 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 21 of 23\nfreely live as a female. ld Plaintiff admits Dr. McKinney's order did not specify what items \nPlaintiff should be allowed to have. Id However, Plaintiff alleges that the WPATH standard of \ncare recommends the \"triadic therapy,\" which includes hormone therapy, \"real-life experiences,\" \nand sex reassignment surgery for treating GID/GD. /d. at 2. Plaintiff alleges she explained to Dr. \nGreene that the \"real-life experience\" is a serious part of her treatment, but Dr. Greene, a TDCJ \nmedical doctor who is not a GD specialist, refused Dr. McKinney's orders, citing the TDCJ \npolicy. Id Plaintiff alleges she explained to Dr. Greene that he was violating clearly established \nlaw and professional standards of care, but Dr. Greene said he would not comply until TDCJ' s \npolicy clearly provides such treatment. Id at 2-3. Plaintiff alleges Dr. Greene is violating her \nEighth Amendment rights  by denying the  treatment prescribed by  Dr.  McKinney.  Id  at  1. \nPlaintiff seeks a declaration that Dr. Greene's acts violate Plaintiff's constitutional rights and an \ninjunction granting Plaintiff the treatment prescribed by Dr. McKinney. Id at 4. \nBecause  Plaintiff is  proceeding  in forma pauperis  in  this  action,  her  Supplemental \nComplaint is subject to sua sponte dismissal under 28  U.S.C.  § 1915(e)(2), which mandates \ndismissal \"at any time\" if the court determines that the action \"fails to state a claim on which \nrelief may be granted\" or \"is frivolous or malicious.\" See also Neitzke v.  Williams, 490 U.S. 319, \n328 (1989) (A complaint filed in forma pauperis that lacks an arguable basis in law should be \ndismissed under 28 U.S.C. § 1915). \nPlaintiffs allegations against Dr. Greene fail to amount to a constitutional violation. As \nan initial matter, Plaintiff admits Dr. McKinney did not specify what items Plaintiff should be \npermitted  to  have  to  enjoy  the  \"real  life  experience.\"  It  is  Plaintiff's  conclusion  that  Dr. \nMcKinney  intended  to  prescribe  SRS.  However,  even  assuming  Dr.  McKinney intended to \nprescribe Plaintiff SRS, Plaintiff cannot state a claim for deliberate indifference based on Dr. \n21 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 22 of 23\nGreene's refusal to provide Plaintiff with SRS in accordance with TDCJ policy. The Court holds \nin this Order that the TDCJ' s policy does not violate the Eighth Amendment. Moreover, Plaintiff \nnever alleges Dr. Greene \"refused to treat [her], ignored [her] complaints, intentionally treated \n[her] incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard \nfor any serious medical needs.\" Domino, 239 F.3d at 756. Plaintiff states in her Complaint that \nshe is receiving mental health services and hormone therapy. Plaintiffs disagreement with Dr. \nGreene's treatment does not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation. Thus, Plaintiff fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted, and her claim against Dr. Greene is dismissed as \na matter of law. \nIX.  Conclusion \nIt  is  ORDERED  that  Defendant  Livingston's  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  is \nGRANTED as to all claims. It is further \nORDERED that Plaintiffs claim against Dr. Greene is DISMISSED for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted and Plaintiffs Motion to Compel Dr. Greene to respond \nto Plaintiffs 1983 Complaint is DENIED (Doc. 66). The dismissal of this case for failure to state \na claim will  count as  a  \"strike\" for  the purpose  of 28  U.S.C.  § 1915(g). See  Adepegba v. \nHammons, 103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Plaintiff is admonished that if she accumulates \nthree \"strikes\" pursuant to § 1915(g), she may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action \nor appeal filed while she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent \ndanger of serious physical injury. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). It is further \nORDERED that any and all motions not previously ruled upon by the Court are hereby \nDENIED. It is further \n22 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-RP   Document 69   Filed 08/31/16   Page 23 of 23\nORDERED that the Clerk of the Court is directed to e-mail copies of this Order and the \nJudgment to the TDCJ-Office of the General Counsel and the ProSe Clerk for the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. \n'f71[~ \nSIGNED this ..21_ day of August, 2016. \nWALTER S.

Diss. Op. at 237. \n \n4  Gibson also sued “Dr. D. Greene” at the prison hospital, along with the Municipality of Gatesville.

The \n21 \n \n\n \n \nGibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212 (2019)   \n \n \n  contention is meritless. We all agree that summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine dispute as to any \nmaterial fact—and that the underlying substantive law (here, the Eighth Amendment) dictates which facts are \nmaterial.  As  we  explain  below,  Eighth  Amendment  precedent  establishes  that  medical  disagreement  is  not \nactionable. Given the demonstrable medical disagreement over sex reassignment surgery, we conclude—consistent \nwith established precedent—that there are no material facts in dispute here. In sum, the dissent’s disagreement \nconcerns substantive Eighth Amendment law, not the standards that govern summary judgment. \nThe dissent’s related complaint—that we have somehow misplaced the burden of production on Gibson, rather \nthan on TDCJ where it belongs—fails for similar reasons. To recognize the futility of Gibson’s claim does not place \nthe burden of production on him. It simply follows from the established rule that summary judgment is proper in the \nabsence of a dispute over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. \n \n6  Schmidt and Osborne are not the only experts at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who question the necessity \n  and effectiveness of sex reassignment surgery. See, e.g., Paul McHugh, Transgender Surgery Isn’t the Solution, WALL \nST.  J.  (May  13,  2016), \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-mchugh-transgender-surgery-isnt-the-solution-1402615120; see also Amy Ellis \nNutt, Long Shadow Cast by Psychiatrist on Transgender Issues Finally Recedes at Johns Hopkins, WASH.

In August 2016, for \n  example, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued \na “Decision Memo for Gender Dysphoria and Gender Reassignment Surgery.” The memo surveyed the available \nmedical literature and found that there was insufficient expert medical evidence to support sex reassignment \nsurgery with respect to Medicare and Medicaid patients. See generally CMS, Decision Memo for Gender Dysphoria \nand  Gender  Reassignment  Surgery  (Aug.  30,  2016), \nhttps://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/nca-decision-memo.aspx?NCAId=282. \n \n8  We are not aware of any circuit that has disagreed with Kosilek. The Fourth and Ninth Circuits allowed Eighth \n  Amendment claims for sex reassignment surgery to survive motions to dismiss, without addressing the merits. See \nRosati v. Igbinoso, 791 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir. 2015) (per curiam); De’lonta v. Johnson, 708 F.3d 520, 526 (4th Cir. \n2013). \nMoreover, various circuits, including our own, have rejected Eighth Amendment claims for hormone therapy—never \nmind sex reassignment surgery—to treat gender dysphoria, at least in individual cases. See Praylor, 430 F.3d at 1209 \n(“[W]e hold that, on this record, the refusal to provide hormone therapy did not constitute the requisite deliberate \nindifference.”); Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987) (“[Prisoners do] not have a right to any \nparticular type of treatment, such as estrogen therapy.”); Supre v. Ricketts, 792 F.2d 958, 963 (10th Cir. 1986) (“It \nwas never established, however, that failing to treat plaintiff with estrogen would constitute deliberate indifference \nto a serious medical need. While the medical community may disagree among themselves as to the best form of \ntreatment for plaintiff’s condition, the [prison] made an informed judgment as to the appropriate form of treatment \nand did not deliberately ignore plaintiff’s medical needs.”). \n \n9  Cf. City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 297, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000) (plurality op.) (“Erie could \n  reasonably rely on the evidentiary foundation set forth in [City of Renton v.

IF YOU VIOLATE THIS RULE, THE COURT MAY STRIKE YOUR \nCOMPLAINT. \nThe Defendants  are  violating Plaintiff's constitutional  rights \nunder the  8th amendment by  denying her medical care that would \ntreat  the actual  cause of her serioud medical condition to  en- \nforce a  sytamatic ban on sex reassignment surgery;  which creates \na  policy of deliberate  indifference to  her gender dysphoria be- \ncause they refuse to allow  her to be evaluated  to determine if \n8ex reassignment surgery would be  a  viable medical  treatment \noption based on her medical needs. Consequently,  Plaintiff has \nto  suffer severe mental  anguish that  causes her to have realistic \nthoughts of commiting  suicide end of self-casteration which \nforces her to live  in conditions that places  her].ife at  substanial \nVI.

Plaintiff asserts that TDCJ-ID  ban  on  sex  reassignment surgery \nis  unconstitutional,  both facicelly and  as  applied because  it india- \ncriminally and arbitrarily denies transgender inmates who has  severe \nGender Dysphoria medical  treatment  that would treat  the  actual cause \nof their illness for  no justification whatsoever, end thus it's not \nbased on  A  Doctor's evalutiun.  In  Fact,  This policy refuses  to even \nallow  Plaintiff to  be evaluted to  see  if  sex  reassignment surgery \nwould adequately  treat her. \nPlaintiff asserts that as applied  to her TDCJ-Id ban on  sex \nreassignment surgery is  uncondtitutional because it  allows the  De- \nfendants to ignor her serious medical needs for  nonmedical reasons \nwhich places her life  at  substantial risk  of harm because her ill \nness causes her to have realistic thoughts of committing  suicide and \nof self-casteretion, \nPlaintiff futher asserts that no  set of circumstances exists \nunder which the ban  can be valid because TDCJ-ID has  created a  sit- \nuation where they don't  even have to evalute a  traneqender inmate \nfor this  type of treatment regardless how  severe  their  illness is \ncr.e*Ic  creates a  policy of deliberate indifferences  to  an inmates \nserious medical needs,  and totally rejects the  stanard of care that \npurant professionals  foèlow to treat Gender Dysphoria. \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 6 of 33\nC.

Plaintiff 1* a Pre-Op Transsexual.  She has legully been \nt \ndiagnosed with Gender Dyspharte  by TDC3ID Doctors  Sky View \nUnit and is currently receiving remale Hormones end AntiAndrogena. \n(9).  Plain*f goes by;  VEflUA. \n(10).  Platntff ha, lived as a Female since she was about 15 \nyears old. She is now 37 years old and sincerely believes that \nshe is a Female trapped in a sale's body and it causes her to \nhave realistic thoughts of coesitting euictda and a? selfcastsrstion. \n(ii).  Plaintf he. atteapted to commit suicide three tisse since \nshe hes been incarcerated and has abused her genitals by tying \na string around the testicles until they turned a bloody purple \ncolor end were so swollen end hurt so bed she could barely walk. \nPg. 2 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 22 of 33\n(12).  Plaintiff did this in belief thet if she destroyed her \ntesticles it would stop thee from producing testosterones. \n(13).  Plaintiff doesn't dais she etteapted suicide solely \ndue to her gender related condition, however, it did play * sinificant \npart in her suicide atteapte because the constant stress she \ndeals with is at times is overwhelming. \n(14).  Plaintiff first entered TDC3-ID in 1995. At this time \nshe was verebly requested to be treated and she was told RO, \nand she just lived as a resale. \n(15).  In the ensuing years she aterted suffering severe depression \nand the thoughts of suicide becaus, sore prevalent end realistic. \n(16).  In 2014,  Plaintiff learned that TDC3ID reacted  fs \npolicy that prohibited trenagender inmates who ware not diagnosed \nin soceity with Gender Identity Disorder, from rectaving treatment. \n(17).  Plaintiff requested to be treated. Initially medical \nwas still enforcing the old policy. However, after expressing \nher desire to caet.rate herself, she was sent to TDC3-ID Mental \nHospital end was diagnosed with sender Dysphoria, end was recommended \nto be pieced on resale Hormones. \nCia).  Dr. Kevin Mckenney placed her on Estrogen end Spironolsctone. \n(19).  At this  time PlaintIff explained to Dr. McKsnney that \nshe could not live in a wales body because it made htr hate herself, \nfeel deformed, nasty and caused her to have thoughts of soasiting \nsuicide. \n(20).  Dr. MCK.nney told Plstfltiff that all he could do was place \nher an Female Narmanes bessus. TDC3.ZD bee a Ban an Sax Reassignment \nSurjsry. \nPg. 3 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 23 of 33\n(21).  Plaintiff also requested Dr. Mcennsy to provide her \nwith a pass that would allow her to live as a  Female. \n(22),  Plaintiff has constetly requested to have her genitals \nremoved and the Defendants have ignored hart or told her NO. \n(23).  Plaintiff has also requested since TDC-XD has * Ban \non Sex Reassignment Surjery, could she have a pass to live as \na female, to dress as a female end to keep her hair at Least \n7 inches long at all times,  end she yes told NO. \n(2k).  Plaintiff have put the Defendants on notice,  That she \n$as thoughts øf suicide, self- casteration, and that their Ran \non six reala ignment eurjery violates the 8th Amendment of The \nUnited States Canetitation. She was told that the Director doe. \nnot respond to inmates request or complaints. \n(25).  The Dsfandents also aware of Federal Law - case law that \nshows that a  systematic Ban on Sex change Ia Unconstitutional. \nBecause in her complaints she cited the law and explained how \nTDC3-ID's Ban is Identical to the one that Federal court  found \nUnlawful. \nUU.  V \nCAUSE  --AC-TI-D I \n- \n(26).  The Defendants are Vlàlating Plaintiff's Constitutional \nRights under The 6th Amen&$ent by denying her Medical Car. that \nwould treat the actual cauae of her serious Medical condition \nto enforce a systematic ban on Sax Resecigneent Surjery; which \ncreates a policy of deliberite indifference to her gender dyephorie \nbecause they refuse to allow her to be evaluated to determine \nif  Sex Reassignment Surjery would be ó viable medical treatment \noption based on her medical needs. \nConeeqvently, Plaintiff has to suffer severe mental anguish \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 24 of 33\nthat osuise her to have realistic thoughts at suicide end of \nseif-casterstion. \nIn addition she La forced to live in conditione that pieces \nherhtf. at substantial  risk of harm. \nTDCID \n(27),  Plaintiff asserts that  ban en Sax  Rasesigneent \nSurjsry is Unconatttutienst, both  ficically end as applied because \nit tndieoziaLnslly and arbitranily denies trenigender  inmates \nwho has severe Gender Dyaphorte Medical Treatment that would \ntreat the actual cause of their illness,  Thus it prohibits them \nfrom even seeing  a Doctor to be evaluated to see whether or not \nthey need Sex  Reassignment Surjsry to sdsquety treat their illness. \n(20).  Plaintiff asserts that as applied to her TDC31D ban \nan Sex Reassignment Surjsry is Unconstitutional becaus. it allows \nthe Defendants to ignar her serious medical needs for namnedical \nreasons which places her life at substantial risk of serious \nharm because her illness causes her to have realistic thoughts \nof cosmiting suicide end of self cesteration. \n(29).  Plaintiff futher asserts that no set of circumstance \nexists under which the ban can be valid because TDC3XD has created \na  situation where they don't even hive to evaluate a Tranagender \ninmate for this  type of treatment regardless how severe their \nGender  Dyepharia is.  h*ch creates a  policy of deliberate  indifference \nto en inmates eertious medical need. \n(30).  The 0th Amendment prohibits prison official,  to tgnar \nen inmates serious medical needs. \n(31).  This Ban does just that* It en macta can not be evalusted, \nPlaintiff's condition will be ignored end she will  only receive \nacre thatesrely  provides treatment to reduce the pain it cause, \nPg  S \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 25 of 33\n(32).  This ban is not predicated on any type at medical  usttfLcatian \nrather is based axelusivaly on a blanket policy that indiscriminately \nbans Sax Reassignment $urjsry would treat Plaintiff adequately, \n(33).  The defendants have a legal obligation to provide plaintiff \nwith adequate medical oars of quality acceptable  when measured \nby prudent professional standards of the community, tailored \nto her specific. meda.l needs,  BURRETT V.  L0PEN, 292 F.  Supp. \n2d 281  C.D.N.H. 2003). \n(34).  Pursuant The World Professional Association for Tranagender \nHealth,  Sax reassignment Surjsry is Medically Necessary to treat \nacme people adequately.  Sac LX 1. \n(35).  Sex  Reassignment Surjsry is not cosmetic or slectiva, \nSee LX  (2). \n(36).  The Defendants cannot fulfils  this laDe  obligution because: \n(1).  Ny doctor is prohibttad from \nfollowing the  standard of care \nfor Trenagendar Health, \n(2).  He cannot evaluate me or refer \nme to a specialist to determine \nif Sex Reassignment Surjery would \ntreat tha actual cause of my illness \nadequately. \n(37).  Plaintiff asserts that if hsr Doctor can not evaluate \nher or follow the standard of care, ha cannot make sound medical \njudgment. \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 26 of 33\n(3$),  The failure to consider an individual inmate's condition \nin making treatment decisions is precisely ihe kind of conduct \nthat constitutes *  substantial departure from accepted professional \njudgment, end clearly shows that the Defendants are denying to treat \nPlaintiff to enforce a  blenket bed on Sax Reassignment $urjery for \nnsnaedical reasons. \n(39).  Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants are aware of the \nsubstantial harm of serious risk that Plaintiff faces because \nPlaintiff was admitted to TDC3ID'e Msntel Hospital for expressing \nher dsetrss to commit suictds and to useterats herself. \n(ho),  Absent legitimate countervailing  consideration,  adequate \nmedics] cars rsquiras addressing the actual sauss of the serious \nmedical condition,  rather then merely pravtdtng trastsent to \nreduce the pain it causes.  SLJRRET U. COPUN, 12 P. Supp 2d.  251 \nC.D.N.H. 2003). \n(1).  the Defendants stated reason far ds*ytng Plaintiff Sex \nReassignment $uzjsry Lal She don't qualify. See Exhibit (i), \n(2).  Ms. V.  Pollard  Tha Hughse'a Unit Medical complaint \ncoardinstor cads this claim.  However,  she is not a Doctor nor \nwas pløintttf evaluated by a Doctor therefore her judgment is \nnot based an sound Medical 3udgmant. \n(3).

SMITH,  656 F.  3d  (7th air. 2011) \nThe court ruled that \"  Asetatute prohibiting hormone therapy \nand Sex Reassignment Surjery far any prisoner violates the 0th \nAmendment because same inmates could be msdtcslly necessary to \ntreat acme inmates adsquately. \n(46).  Plaintiff farther asserts thet the municipality of Satesvifle, \nTexas teresponsibla for denying Plaintiff Medical Care because \nThe State of Texas caileatly La enforcing a State wide ban on \ninmetas receiving Sex  Reassignment Sur3.ry foX  any reason, \n(47).

GIBSON  TDCJ-ID #699888  I'm the  Plaintiff \nin  the  foreqoing Civil  Complaint and  submit  this  Affidavit \nI \nabout the following: \n(1)  I  have been  legally  Diagnosed with  Gender Dysphoria by \nTDCJ-ID  Doctors. \n(j) \n(2).  I'm  currently on  Female Hormones  and  Pnti-Androgens. \n(3)  Dr.  Kevin  McKenney places me  on  the  medication. \n(4).  I  have lived as  a  Female from  about  the age  of 14  or 15 \nyears  old  and I  sincerely believe that  I'm a  Female trapped in \na  Males body. \n(5).  This makes  me  suffer severe Depression  that makes me  have \nthoughts of committing  suicide and of  self-casteration because \nI  feel Deformed,  Nasty  and  it makes me  Hate my body  to  the  point \nI  want to  Die. \n(6).  The  depression is  so  severe  at times  I  have  to  abuse my \ngenitals to  cope. \n/ce  o4 \nin1/  /4 \no'  ja  ' \na/ok:  ice,\"v \nmy'  Te/oS/eIb,1  /e-veI  cIc'7  thX.- i) \nhe- \nth.i/2 \no \n1k  c \no \n.5 jt- \n141'q5  1-/I/S \nPg.  1 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 31 of 33\n(7).  Since  I've been in  prison,  I  have  tried  to  commit  suicide \ntimes.  can't  claim  it was  all due  to  my  Gender Dysphoria \n3  I \nbut  it  stresses me  out and  little thinqs will  oush me  to  the \npoint  I  want to  Die. \n(8).  For  years,  I  use to  tie  a  string around my  testicles until \nthey turned a  bloody purple color and hurt  so  b3d  that I  could \nbarely walk.  I  did  this  in  belief that  if  I  destrayed my  testicles \nit  would  prevent  them from producing testosterone. \n(9).  I  truly  believe that  if  I  don't get  a  Sex  change  I  will \nend  up  committing suicide  because the  older  I  became  the  strong \nmy pain  gets,  as  well as  the  need to  abuse my  body gets. \n(10).  I  have  written Medical over 30  times  about  this and  they \ntell  me  I  will  never get  a  Sex change or  he  treated. \n(11).  The  Defendants know  about the risk  I  face yet they  ignored \nmy  request  because  they claim  that they don't respond  to  inmates \ncomplaints.  See  Ex  (5) \n(12).  I'm  afraid to  tell  TDCJ-ID doctors how  close  I  come  to  committing \nsuicide or  casterting myse].f  -  Each day  because all  they  will \ndo  is  put me  in  a  cold room  naked and  I  will have to  suffer because \nit  is  so  cold  in  their,  if  I  had  anythinq  to  kill  myself with,  I \nwould! \n(1 3) .  It  is  hard to  talk  to medical  buut how  I  feel because they \ndo  not  -  They refuse  to  hear  anything about Sex  change;  Etc. \nPg.  2 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 32 of 33\n(hi.).  plus  alot of  the  Doctors  are  against  inmates receiving \nthis type of treatment. \nswear under  penalty of perjury that  the  foregoing statements \nI \nare  true. \n511 2/2015 \nPg.  3 \n\nCase 6:15-cv-00190-WSS   Document 1   Filed 06/08/15   Page 33 of 33\n  /   \n/2 /:i //\n/\n \n/\n/  \nY 7\n. /\n' /\ng\n/\ng\n   \nI   2\n1\nj\n \n)\n/\n;\n \n/\n/\n \n  7\n:\n2 1\n(\nJ   1c\nL Y '\n \n1 2\n \n7 f /\n/\n1\n7\n \n  -\n7( \n \n7\n'\n7\n/  T \n2 j\n7 Y\n(\n \n7  \n(\n \n1 .\n/\n  /\nI",
