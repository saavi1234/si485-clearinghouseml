She named as defendants the Warden and Administrative Captain of the prison she was housed in as well as two of the doctors at the facility. The case was assigned to Judge Lynn Adelman. The plaintiff initially only sought damages, but moved for injunctive relief as well during the litigation. The complaint was styled as a class action and listed the names of three other plaintiffs on it, but throughout the litigation the court treated them as co-plaintiffs rather than as a class. The issue of class certification was never formally ruled on. </p><p>She alleged that in denying to diagnose her with Gender Identity Disorder, prison doctors and administration denied her access to medically necessary gender-affirming treatment in violation of the Eighth Amendment (note: Gender Identity Disorder is no longer used to describe transgender people, the term has been replaced in the DSM with Gender Dysphoria). Her complaint outlined her extensive mental health history, including recurrent self harm and suicide attempts. She attributed her pervasive depression in part to gender dysphoria. She argued that she has repeatedly made her gender identity know to medical staff, and by refusing to diagnose and treat her GID, they acted with deliberate indifference to her serious medical need. She also alleged that they had violated the Prison Rape Elimination Act by housing her near inmates who they knew to be a threat to her safety. Finally, she brought state-law claims for medical malpractice and negligence against her psychologist based on allegations that the doctor ignored her requests for treatment or transfer. </p><p>Over the course of the litigation, the plaintiff also filed a motion for diagnostic evaluation, a motion to appoint counsel, and a motion for a John Doe criminal investigation. Both parties also filed motions for summary judgment.</p><p>On May 25, 2018, Judge Adelman granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the case. 2018 WL 2389732. Her decision and order also denied the plaintiff's motion for injunctive relief and all other motions. In June of 2018, the plaintiff filed motions to amend and vacate judgment, which were subsequently denied on Nov 1, 2018. </p><p>As of  May 31, 2020, there is no update. </p>",

TRACY JOHNSON, \nDAVID GARDNER, \nWARDEN GARY BOUGHTON, \nCHRISTA K. MORRISON, \nDR. SHIRLEY DAWSON, and \nDR. DAWN LANDERS, \n    Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________ \nORDER \nPlaintiff is a Wisconsin state prisoner representing herself.  On May 25, 2018, I \ngranted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, denied several of plaintiff’s motions, \nand dismissed this case.  Judgment was entered on the same day.  Plaintiff has filed a \nmotion to amend judgment (ECF No. 186) and a motion to alter or amend judgment (ECF \nNo. 189). \nIn her motion to amend judgment, plaintiff states that she never received her copy \nof the video deposition from her September 22, 2017 deposition; that she did not respond \nto defendants’ proposed findings of fact because she never received a copy of them; and \nthat she “never received any filings from the defendants for oppositions or motion for \nrelief/summary judgment[.]”  (ECF No. 186 at 2.)  Plaintiff requests that I send her copies \nof these items and then allow her enough time to read and respond to them, and to file \nher own proposed findings of fact and summary judgment motion. \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 11/01/18   Page 1 of 5   Document 190\n\nDefendants contend that plaintiff’s claims are incredible. (ECF No. 187.)  According \nto defendants, plaintiff received a copy of her deposition transcript with their summary \njudgment filings.  Defendants point out that plaintiff’s January 12, 2018 reply to her motion \nfor injunctive relief references Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact.  (See ECF No. \n181.)  According to defendants, plaintiff was well-aware of the applicable rules and court-\nimposed deadlines in this case.   \nPlaintiff filed a reply in which she states that, upon review her records and files, \nshe  did  receive  a  copy  of  her  deposition  transcript  and  she  does  have  a  copy  of \ndefendants’ proposed findings of fact.  (ECF No. 188.)  Plaintiff now states that she would \nlike the court to allow her another chance to respond to defendants’ proposed findings of \nfact, that she did not receive portions of defendants’ summary judgment motion, and that \nshe did not know about her response deadline.  Plaintiff states that she was completely \nunaware of any applicable rules and the court-imposed deadlines to respond to summary \njudgment. \nIn her motion to alter and/or amend judgment, plaintiff contends that defendants \ndid not produce any factual evidence to show that her allegations of having symptoms of \ngender identity disorder are false.  (ECF No. 189.)  According to plaintiff, she does in fact \nhave some signs and symptoms of gender identity disorder.  Plaintiff also states that \ndefendants  have  not  produced  any  factual  evidence  to  show  that  her  claims  of \nharassment, physical assaults, and discrimination are false.  Next, plaintiff states that the \npackage that her deposition transcript came in was not opened in her presence and \nseveral documents/pages are missing “including a copy of the defense cross-motions for \nsummary judgment findings.”  (Id. at 1.)  Plaintiff requests that the court provide her with \n2 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 11/01/18   Page 2 of 5   Document 190\n\na copy of “defendants’ motion for summary judgment findings” and allow her thirty days \nto respond to their summary judgment motion.  Plaintiff reiterates that she was completely \nunaware of any applicable rules and the court-imposed deadlines.   \n“Rule 59(e) allows a court to alter or amend a judgment only if the petitioner can \ndemonstrate a manifest error of law or present newly discovered evidence.”  Obriecht v. \nRaemisch, 517 F.3d 489, 494 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Sigsworth v. City of Aurora, 487 F.3d \n506,  511-12  (7th  Cir.  2007)).    “A  ‘manifest  error’  is  not  demonstrated  by  the \ndisappointment of the losing party.  It is the ‘wholesale disregard, misapplication, or failure \nto recognize controlling precedent.’”  Oto v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 224 F.3d 601, 606 \n(7th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).  Under Rule 60(b), a court may grant a party relief from \nan order for several reasons, including mistake, excusable neglect, newly discovered \nevidence, and fraud.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)).  “Rule 60(b) relief is an extraordinary \nremedy and is granted only in exceptional circumstances.”  Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Flanders \nElec. Motor Serv., Inc., 131 F.3d 625, 628 (7th Cir. 1997). \nPlaintiff has not satisfied the standards Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).  To the extent \nthat plaintiff contends that defendants did not provide factual evidence to support the \nmotion for summary judgment, she is mistaken.  Plaintiff’s June 11, 2018, motion to alter \nor amend judgment simply expresses her disagreement with the court’s decision and \nreiterates her disagreement with medical professionals’ determinations to not diagnose \nher with gender identity disorder and with prison officials’ decision to keep her at the \nWisconsin  Secure  Program  Facility.    Plaintiff’s  disagreement  with  my  decision  that \ndefendants met their burden at summary judgment is not a sufficient basis for me to grant \nplaintiff’s motion. \n3 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 11/01/18   Page 3 of 5   Document 190\n\nPlaintiff  also  states  that  she  may  not  have  received  all  the  documents  that \ndefendants filed in support of their motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff initially stated \nthat she did not receive a copy of her video deposition transcript or the defendants’ \nproposed findings of fact, but later stated that she had in fact received those filings.  Now \nshe states that the deposition transcript was not opened in her presence, that some \nunspecified pages were missing, and that she did not receive a copy of the defense cross-\nmotion for summary judgment findings.  Plaintiff also states that she was unaware of the \ndeadline for responding to defendants’ motion for summary judgment.   \nPlaintiff’s assertions appear to be an attempt to prolong this case and her filings in \nthis case do not support her assertions.  Defendants filed their motion for summary \njudgment on November 28, 2017.  On December 6, 2017, I issued an order stating that \nplaintiff’s response to defendants’ motion was due by December 28, 2017.  (ECF No. \n170.)  On December 15, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment in which she \nargued for an order dismissing defendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismissal \nof defendants Gardner and Morrison based on alleged perjury in their summary judgment \nfilings.  Plaintiff responded to defendants’ motion for summary judgment and the record \ncontradicts her contention that she did not know of her deadline to respond.  Moreover, \nplaintiff  had  ample  opportunity  to  notify  the  court  that  she  did  not  receive  all  the \ndefendants’ summary judgment materials and she did not do so.   \nFor the reasons stated, IT IS ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion to vacate judgment \n(ECF No. 186) is DENIED. \n \n4 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 11/01/18   Page 4 of 5   Document 190\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion to alter/amend judgment (ECF \nNo. 189) is DENIED. \n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 1st day of November, 2018. \n               \n             \n              s/Lynn Adelman__________  \nLYNN ADELMAN \n              United States District Judge  \n \n \n5 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 11/01/18   Page 5 of 5   Document 190",

TRACY JOHNSON, \nDAVID GARDNER, \nWARDEN GARY BOUGHTON, \nCHRISTA K. MORRISON, \nDR. SHIRLEY DAWSON, and \nDR. DAWN LANDERS, \n    Defendants. \n______________________________________________________________________ \nDECISION AND ORDER \nThe pro se plaintiff, Dominique DeWayne Gulley-Fernandez, is incarcerated at \nthe Wisconsin Secure Program Facility.  Plaintiff alleges that defendants violated her1 \nrights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and state law \nbecause they have not properly treated her gender identity disorder and continue to \nhouse her at an institution that is harmful to her condition.  The parties have filed cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.  In addition, plaintiff has filed a motion for diagnostic \nevaluation, a motion to appoint counsel, a motion for injunctive relief, and a motion for a \nJohn Doe criminal investigation.  Because the undisputed facts establish that plaintiff \ndoes not have gender identity disorder and that defendants did not act with deliberate \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff is a biological male and has never been diagnosed as transgender.  However, \nout  of  respect  for  plaintiff’s  stated  preference  for  the  feminine  pronoun,  I  will  use \nfeminine pronouns in this decision. \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 1 of 21   Document 184\n\nindifference to her condition, I will grant defendants’ motion for summary judgment, \ndeny plaintiff’s summary judgment motion, and dismiss this case. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn March 21, 2016, the court consolidated this case with Gulley-Fernandez v. \nJohnson, Case Number 15-cv-995-RTR (E.D. Wis.). (ECF No. 56.) Plaintiff filed her \ncomprehensive amended complaint on March 31, 2016. (ECF No. 62.) She alleged that \ndefendants have failed to treat her gender identity disorder and mental health issues, \nand that defendants have continued to house her near inmates who sexually harass \nand abuse her. I subsequently screened plaintiff’s comprehensive amended complaint \nand allowed her proceed on these claims under the Eighth Amendment. (ECF No. 71.) \nOn May 4, 2017, I consolidated Case No. 17-cv-1347-LA with this case.  (ECF \nNo. 154.)  In that case, which was transferred from the Western District of Wisconsin, \nplaintiff alleged that defendants Tracy Johnson, David Gardner, T. Sebranek, and Dr. \nBurton Cox, Jr., were failing to properly treat plaintiff’s gender dysphoria in violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment and state law. \nI subsequently granted plaintiff’s request to dismiss defendants Dr. Torria Van \nBuren, Dr. Gary Ankarlo, Dr. Kevin Kallas, Dr. Victoria (Tori) Sebranek, Dr. Burton Cox, \nTimothy Haines, and Troy Hermans.  (ECF No. 170.)  That leaves only the following \nindividuals  as  defendants:  Shirley  Dawson,  Dawn  Landers,  Tracy  Johnson,  Christa \nMorrison, David Gardner, and Gary Boughton. \nMOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard \n2 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 2 of 21   Document 184\n\n  “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986); Ames v. Home \nDepot U.S.A., Inc., 629 F.3d 665, 668 (7th Cir. 2011).  “Material facts” are those under \nthe  applicable  substantive  law  that  “might  affect  the  outcome  of  the  suit.”    See \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  A dispute over “material fact” is “genuine” if “the evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Id. \n  A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the \nassertion by:  \n(A)  citing  to  particular  parts  of  materials  in  the  record,  including \ndepositions,  documents,  electronically  stored  information,  affidavits  or \ndeclarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion \nonly),  admissions,  interrogatory  answers,  or  other  materials;  or  (B) \nshowing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence \nof a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible \nevidence to support the fact.   \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).  “An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion \nmust  be  made  on  personal  knowledge,  set  out  facts  that  would  be  admissible  in \nevidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters \nstated.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). \nB.  Factual Background2 \n                                                           \n2 This section is taken from the Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Fact.  (ECF No. 168.)  \nPlaintiff did not respond to defendants’ proposed facts and she did not file her own \nproposed facts.  Thus, defendants’ proposed findings of fact are undisputed.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(e); Civil L.R. 56(b)(4) (E.D. Wis.).  \n3 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 3 of 21   Document 184\n\n  Plaintiff is an inmate in the custody of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. \nShe  was  transferred  from  Dodge  Correctional  Institution  to  the  Wisconsin  Secure \nProgram Facility (WSPF) on March 10, 2011, where she is currently housed.  Defendant \nDawson was a psychiatrist at Dodge Correctional Institution while plaintiff was housed \nthere  in  2010-2011.    Defendant  Landers  was  a  licensed  psychologist  at  Dodge \nCorrectional Institution.  Defendant Johnson is the psychologist supervisor at WSPF.  \nDefendant Morrison is an offender classification specialist with the Bureau of Offender \nClassification  and  Movement.    Defendant  Gardner  is  an  administrative  captain  at \nWSPF.  Defendant Boughton is the warden at WSPF.  Morrison and Gardner serve as \nmembers of the Program Review Committee at WSPF.  \nPlaintiff has been allowed to proceed on her claims that defendants failed to \nadequately treat her gender identity disorder and mental health issues at WSPF.  She is \nproceeding on Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims against all defendants.  \nShe also proceeds on state-law claims for medical malpractice and negligence against \nJohnson  based  on  allegations  that  Johnson  ignored  her  requests  for  treatment  or \ntransfer.  (See Case No. 17-cv-347-LA, ECF No. 18 at 8.)  Plaintiff’s claims can be \nproperly divided into two groups: (1) claims against health and psychological care staff \nmembers (Dawson, Landers and Johnson) that resulted in her placement at WSPF and \n(2)  claims  against  other  staff  (Morrison,  Gardner,  and  Boughton)  who  allegedly \nunconstitutionally retain her at WSPF.  \n1.  Plaintiff’s History within the Wisconsin Department of Corrections \n  Plaintiff  claims  that  she,  as  a  transgender  inmate,  is  inappropriately  and \nunconstitutionally housed at WSPF.  She believes that the defendants have violated her \n4 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 4 of 21   Document 184\n\nconstitutional rights by failing to house her around inmates who are more tolerant of her \ncondition.  Plaintiff claims that, at WSPF, she is housed around inmates that call her \nnames.  She believes that WSPF does not have appropriate psychological or health \ncare staff to treat inmates with gender identity disorders.  Plaintiff admits that she has \nnever been diagnosed with a gender identity disorder, that a gender identity disorder \ndiagnosis is a matter of medical judgment, and that none of the named defendants have \never said anything negative to her regarding her stated gender identity.   \nIn  October  2015,  plaintiff  underwent  a  gender  identity  consultation  with  the \ndepartment’s  independent  consultant,  Cynthia  Osborne.    Osborne  did  not  diagnose \nplaintiff with a gender identity disorder.   \nMost recently, and in the context of this lawsuit, plaintiff was evaluated by Dr. \nChester  Schmidt,  a  Johns  Hopkins  psychiatrist  who  specializes  in  the  diagnosis, \ntreatment and care of patients with gender identity disorders.  Dr. Schmidt met with \nplaintiff on July 13, 2017.  Plaintiff claims that she was honest during her conversation \nwith Dr. Schmidt, and that the two discussed plaintiff’s family, history, alleged symptoms \nof gender identity disorder, and physical symptoms that she believes are related to her \ndisorder.    Plaintiff  shared  with  Dr.  Schmidt  that  she  would  like  to  undergo \npsychotherapy, hormonal treatment, and eventually have a sex change operation. \nDr.  Schmidt’s  October  2,  2017,  report  noted  that  plaintiff  “has  a  many  year \ninterest in living in a cross-gender role.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1007 at 1.)  He noted that \nplaintiff, although street-wise about everyday activities, makes poor decisions when it \ncomes to her relationship with authority and societal and prison rules.  Dr. Schmidt \ndiagnosed plaintiff with mild intellectual disability and antisocial personality disorder.  \n5 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 5 of 21   Document 184\n\nBased upon the lack of independent medical records that confirm plaintiff’s assertions \nregarding her history of taking cross-sex hormones and upon her unreliable historical \nreports and attempts at deception, Dr. Schmidt concluded that plaintiff is not eligible for \nmanagement with cross-gender hormones.  He found that plaintiff did not meet three of \nthe four criteria that psychiatrists analyze before prescribing hormone therapy.3  Dr. \nSchmidt  noted  that  plaintiff  has  failed  to  demonstrate  the  ability  to  conform  her \nbehaviors to social norms even in the highly-structured prison environment and that \nplaintiff has taken no responsibility for her repeated disruptive behaviors.   \nPlaintiff’s ongoing psychological concerns prevented Dr. Schmidt from making a \ndiagnosis of gender dysphoria.  Dr. Schmidt opened that f plaintiff is diagnosed with \ngender dysphoria in the future, a clinical decision regarding whether plaintiff is eligible \nfor cross-gender hormones should be made at that time.  According to Dr. Schmidt, \nonce plaintiff’s disciplinary and medical records “document stabilization of function,” \nplaintiff should be evaluated once again. Until then, she should continue to be provided \ncounseling therapy.  \n2.  Plaintiff’s Alleged Gender Identity Disorder \nPlaintiff describes her sexual orientation as “bisexual slash transgender,” but \nadmits that her sexual orientation has evolved over time.  Plaintiff was not treated for \ngender identity issues prior to her incarceration in 2010, though she took hormones that \nshe purchased off the street and used intermittently for some time in her early teens.    \n                                                           \n3  The  criteria  for  hormone  therapy  are  as  follows:  (1)  persistent,  well-documented \ngender dysphoria (criterion not met); (2) capacity to make a fully informed decision and \nto  consent  to  treatment  (criterion  not  met);  (3)  age  of  majority  in  a  given  country \n(criterion met); and (4) if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they \nmust be reasonably well controlled (criterion not met).  (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1007 at 3-4.) \n6 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 6 of 21   Document 184\n\nPlaintiff first had feelings that she wanted to transition from male to female when \nshe was eight years old.  She cross-dressed a handful of times as a child, and dressed \nas a woman daily in high school.  Plaintiff has taken steps to feminize herself within \nprison, including using socks and clothing to fill out her chest.    \nAt her deposition, plaintiff explained that she would like to live “fully” as a woman \nfor “a day, two days, a week, a month, a year. Go from there, do the hormonal therapy \ntreatment,  the  psychotherapy,  and  then  the  whole  –  undergoing  the  whole  SRS.” \n(Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 123:23-124:2.)  Plaintiff has a mandatory release \ndate in 2021 (with no possibility of parole before then) and agrees that it will be easier \nfor her to pursue these options once she is released.  Until then, she does not believe \nthat WSPF is appropriate for her.   \nPlaintiff claims that she has been subjected to batteries by other inmates at \nWSPF. In June 2016, she was punched during recreation, but she did not need medical \nattention. In April 2017, plaintiff was punched after she “messed with” another inmate in \nthe library “to piss him off.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 30:18-35:5.)  \nPlaintiff  has  about  fifteen  inmate  friends  at WSPF.    She  has  participated  in \nWSPF’s mentoring program for troubled inmates. According to plaintiff, the mentoring \nprogram is for “[i]nmates that have – that had difficulties growing up, that have difficulty \ncoping with the environment of the prison system, inmates who happen to be they [sic] \nfirst adult incarceration, who happen to be getting into a lot of trouble, getting conduct \nreports here and there for frivolous things, being loud on the range, being disruptive – \nexcuse me – you know, things of that nature.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 59:1-\n12.) Plaintiff states that she came up with the mentoring program idea, and defendant \n7 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 7 of 21   Document 184\n\nGardner was responsive.  Plaintiff participated in the mentoring program “for a while” \nbefore she got to doing “my own thing again”, “going back downhill, not – not listening to \nthe mentors, not taking they [sic] advice, got into some trouble that I take responsibility \nfor, stole things here, stole things there, got a conduct report for it, ended up going to \nSeg[.]” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 60:14-25.) \nPlaintiff  admits  that  she  has  been  attention  seeking  for  as  long  as  she  can \nremember and specifically does things to get a negative reaction from those around her. \nShe has an extensive conduct history that she does not dispute.  Plaintiff has moved \ncells within WSPF on average every other week and admits that she is disruptive on \nevery unit where she is housed.  She has had to be moved to other units a total of 59 \ntimes and has been moved to different ranges or cells within the same unit a total of 60 \ntimes since she has been at WSPF because of rule violations, disruptive conduct, and \ndisrespectful remarks towards other inmates. She has also been moved due to other \ninmates’ disruptive behavior towards plaintiff, after plaintiff has provoked them.  Just \ndays prior to her September 22, 2017 deposition, plaintiff received a conduct report for \nbeing loud and disruptive on her housing unit. According to plaintiff, she just “snapped.”  \nPlaintiff  has  received  conduct  reports for sexual  conduct  and  making  disrespectful, \nsexual comments.  Plaintiff agrees that it is reasonable for prison staff to expect her to \ncontrol her behavior before they move her to another prison.  \nPlaintiff has told “almost the entire institution” that she is transgender. (Rakvic-\nFarr  Ex.  1006,  Gulley  Dep.  14:11-15.)    Some  inmates  are  tolerant  of  her  sexual \npreferences, and plaintiff has requested to be housed by twenty-three other inmates \n8 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 8 of 21   Document 184\n\nwho she considers tolerant. She gave a list of inmates to Gardner and requested to be \nhoused by them, though she understands that she does not get to select her housing.   \nHousing decisions at WSPF are made after considering a number of factors, \nincluding (1) assessment and evaluation of an inmate’s needs or program assignments \nsuch as vocational, educational, and assigned work duties; (2) the inmate’s status, such \nas  general  population,  disciplinary  separation,  or  administrative  confinement;  (3) \nsecurity considerations, if applicable, including prior reports from other institutions or \nrestrictions already in place regarding the inmate’s suitability for certain types of housing \nassignments; and (4) bed space availability. While inmates would prefer to be housed \nnear their friends, that is not always possible and is not a consideration used by security \nstaff when placing inmates within the institution.  \nWhen plaintiff arrived at WSPF in March 2011, she was placed in the Restrictive \nHousing Unit in disciplinary separation status because she had recently been given 120 \ndays of disciplinary separation for rule violations while at Dodge Correctional Institution.  \nSince plaintiff has been at WSPF, she received 71 major conduct reports and 51 minor \nconduct reports for rule violations.   \nPlaintiff believes that there are certain things that may help her fare better in \nprison. For example, she believes that if she had a TV in her cell she would not have \nproblems  with  the  other  inmates  and  would  do  a  better  job  of  keeping  to  herself.  \nAlthough plaintiff was initially given a “loaner” TV at WSPF, she lost it after she received \na conduct report.  She admits that it was her own fault that she lost the TV, and admits \nthat she continues to have problems in prison: “It’s – it’s hard. I have extreme poor \ndistress tolerance. So any time I get distressed – I don’t tolerate BS. So any time I see – \n9 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 9 of 21   Document 184\n\nsee – see BS happening to me, I snap out. I threaten to harm myself, which I have done \nin the past. Placed on clinical observation, get – banging my head, trying to bite my \nwrists open, cutting myself, getting strapped down, et cetera.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, \nGulley Dep. 66:25-68:25.) \nPlaintiff claims that the psychological care provided at WSPF is constitutionally \ndeficient. She claims that she would have “put up a fight” against her transfer to WSPF \nif she knew that it was the “supermax” prison.  Plaintiff admits that she has no idea how \nWSPF compares to other maximum security prisons in Wisconsin, but believes that \nmore  movement  is  allowed  at  other  prisons.    Plaintiff  believes  that  WSPF  is  a \n“supermax…for  inmates  who  have  a  severe  traumatic  volatile  background,  volatile \nhistory, inmates who have a problem with other inmates who can’t get along with other \ninmates, batteries, all that type of stuff.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 171:17-23.)  \nPlaintiff does not believe that she belongs at WSPF.  But she admits to the behavior \nthat led to many of her conduct reports at WSPF, some of which were due to disruptive \nbehavior.  \nAccording to the defendants, WSPF is not a “supermax” prison. Rather, WSPF is \nthe  same  as  other  maximum  security  prisons  in  Wisconsin  such  as  Columbia \nCorrectional Institution and Waupun Correctional Institution.  Inmates are not sent to \nWSPF as punishment.  WSPF is a smaller prison and the smaller inmate population \nallows for most inmates to be housed in single cells and allows for a smaller inmate-to-\nstaff ratio.  The sole basis for plaintiff’s belief that she is not receiving appropriate \npsychological care is that Waupun Correctional Institution has more staff members in its \n10 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 10 of 21   Document 184\n\nPsychological  Services  Unit.    But WSPF’s  inmate  population  of  468  is significantly \nsmaller than Waupun’s 1,251 inmates.   \nPlaintiff admits that she continues to work through significant mental health care \nissues and that her current mental health concerns are not under control.  \n3.  Dr. Dawson \nPlaintiff was under Dr. Dawson’s care from 2010 through 2011, when she was \ninitially housed at Dodge.  Plaintiff claims that Dawson removed certain diagnoses that \nallowed her to be transferred to WSPF rather than another maximum security prison.  \nShe also claims that Dawson “lied” and said that plaintiff wanted to go to WSPF.  \nDr. Dawson treated plaintiff five times from December 2, 2010 through February \n28, 2011.  She treated plaintiff for sleep issues, anxiety, and depression.  Dr. Dawson \ndiagnosed plaintiff with bipolar affective disorder due to her positive response to mood \nstabilizing  medication  that  she  had  prescribed.    Plaintiff  told  Dr.  Dawson  that  she \nwanted to go to WSPF because she would have her own cell and could receive certain \nprogramming.    Dr.  Dawson  agreed  to  reconsider the  bipolar diagnosis (which  may \nprevent  a  transfer  to  WSPF)  if  plaintiff’s  mood  and  behavior  were  stable  without \nmedication.  A few weeks later, plaintiff’s mood was stable and Dr. Dawson removed \nthe bipolar diagnosis.   \nDr. Dawson had no input regarding plaintiff’s transfer to WSPF.  Nor was Dr. \nDawson consulted with respect to the “Mental Health Screen” that was completed by a \npsychologist prior to plaintiff’s transfer to WSPF. Dr. Dawson’s limited role was to review \nthe  “Mental  Health  Screen”  completed  by  the  psychologist  and  Health  Services \nManager, and to summarize plaintiff’s current reported symptoms and severity.  \n11 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 11 of 21   Document 184\n\n4.  Dawn Landers \nPlaintiff’s claim against Landers is that she evaluated plaintiff at Dodge “for this \nwhole placement of WSPF” and promised her programs at WSPF including “loaner” \nTVs. (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 181:8-182:4.)  Plaintiff admits that she was \ninitially given a loaner TV at WSPF, and admits that Landers did not “lie” to her. Nor \ndoes plaintiff allege that Landers had a reason to believe that placement at WSPF \nwould cause plaintiff harm.  Plaintiff is dissatisfied with her placement at WSPF because \nWSPF has more limited movement that other, larger, institutions and “everywhere you \ngo, you gotta have a [corrections officer] with you.” This is the entirety of plaintiff’s claim \nagainst Landers. (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 182:20-23, 184:16-22.) \n5.  Dr. Tracy Johnson \nPlaintiff claims that when she would write Dr. Johnson about “bigger” issues, \nsuch as starting certain programs at the prison that plaintiff thought would be beneficial, \nDr. Johnson did not write back to her. This is the extent of plaintiff’s claim against \nJohnson, who was not her primary care provider at any time during her incarceration.  \nEven though Dr. Johnson was not plaintiff’s primary care provider, she would see her at \nleast twice a week and when plaintiff engaged her, Dr. Johnson’s interactions with her \nwere “appropriate.” (Rakvic-Farr Ex. 1006, Gulley Dep. 177:10-178:5.) \n6.  Morrison, Gardner, and Boughton \nPlaintiff’s claims against the remaining three defendants stem from their positions \non the prison’s program review committee (PRC) and their alleged control over “inmate \nhousing.”  At least yearly, inmates are given a program review which re-assesses their \ncustody  classification  and  treatment  and  programming  needs,  reviews  institutional \n12 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 12 of 21   Document 184\n\nadjustment, and determines whether inmates should continue their current placement or \nbe transferred to a different institution.  Classification decisions are made after the PRC \nreviews criminal offense history; attitude regarding the criminal offense(s); length of \nsentence and overall time served; institutional adjustment and behavior; and medical, \nclinical, and programming needs.  A recommendation to move an inmate to another \nprison or to change the security classification (from maximum to medium, for example), \nmust be unanimous, and the decision is also reviewed by the director of the Bureau of \nClassification of Movement.  \nTransfers to WSPF are unique to the extent that if an inmate is recommended for \nWSPF, a Mental Health Screen must be completed, and an inmate must be accepted \nby psychological staff for placement at WSPF.  The PRC does not have access to \nmedical and psychological records and instead relies on the Mental Health Screen \ncompleted by the medical and psychological staff.  None of the named defendants \nmade the recommendation that plaintiff be placed at WSPF.  \nPlaintiff claims that Morrison made repeated representations to her that if she \nremained “conduct report free” for a certain period of time, then she could be transferred \nout of WSPF.  Plaintiff claims that she was, in fact, conduct report free for certain \nperiods of time, though she was repeatedly denied a transfer by Morrison and other \nmembers of the committee. Plaintiff claims that Morrison continues to deny transfers \nwithout reason.  She admits that at least one of Morrison’s denials was based on \nplaintiff’s poor conduct, including forgery.  Morrison’s report indicated that she did not \nfeel comfortable transferring plaintiff as a result of this conduct, and plaintiff agrees that \nthis was a reasonable decision.  \n13 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 13 of 21   Document 184\n\nPlaintiff alleges that Morrison and Gardner know that she is “short tempered” and \n“easily set off,” yet plaintff does not understand why the two defendants have not signed \noff on a transfer.  Gardner was a member of the PRC for plaintiff’s program review \nhearings in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  \nIn 2011, plaintiff had nineteen conduct reports and was denied a transfer.  She \nwas advised to “refrain from any further major tickets” in order to move from WSPF. \nPlaintiff requested to be placed at other institutions and stated she “just wants out of \nhere.” (Morrison Ex. 1003 at 8.)  In 2012, plaintiff was focused on a transfer to Waupun.  \nIn 2014, she had four minor conduct reports and eight “majors” since her last PRC \nreview.  Although plaintiff requested to transfer to another maximum security institution, \nher request was denied so plaintiff could complete her segregation time due to her \nconduct reports.  \nPlaintiff’s  most  recent  PRC  hearing  was  on  October  26,  2017.  During  the \nhearing, the PRC Committee noted that plaintiff had received seven major conduct \nreports and six minor conduct reports within the last year, including, but not limited to, \nconduct  reports  for  threats,  disobeying  orders,  disrespect,  disruptive  conduct,  and \nsexual conduct.  The PRC decided to retain plaintiff at WSPF.  \nDue to plaintiff’s conduct history and disruptive behavior towards other inmates, \nprofessional security staff feels WSPF is the safest institution for her.  If plaintiff were \nmoved to another maximum-security institution, she would have to be housed in a \ndouble cell with another inmate and would be part of a larger inmate population. These \nscenarios present a safety and security risk to plaintiff as well as other inmates and \nstaff.  Plaintiff is not being retained at WSPF for punitive reasons, but is being retained \n14 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 14 of 21   Document 184\n\ndue to her problematic pattern of disobeying orders and disruptive conduct.  WSPF \nplacement provides plaintiff with a single cell and higher level of monitoring which can \nprovide  a  higher  level  of  security,  allowing  staff  to  intervene  when  situations  arise \nbetween plaintiff and other inmates due to her inappropriate sexual comments and \nbehavior.  \n With  respect  to  plaintiff’s  claims  against  Warden  Boughton,  she  admits  that \nwhen she wrote to Boughton about complaints, Boughton responded.  Plaintiff agrees \nthat it is reasonable for Boughton, as the warden, to rely on psychological staff who are \nworking with her on a regular basis.   \nPlaintiff  continues  to be  housed  at WSPF  due  to  her inability  to  control  her \nbehavior and inability to maintain her composure, which may make her eligible for \ntransfer to another prison.  Plaintiff agrees that her inmate and staff relations still need \nwork,  and  she  needs  to  continue  to  work  with  Psychological  Services  to  control \npsychological issues.  Plaintiff admits that she has continually manipulated the process \nto get what she wants.  She claims she does not believe that “WSPF is appropriate \nhousing  for  myself”  based  on  her  understanding  that  there  is  more  appropriate \nprogramming at other prisons and her belief that there are more transgender inmates at \nother prisons.  \nC.  Analysis \n  “The Eighth Amendment safeguards the prisoner against a lack of medical care \nthat  ‘may  result  in  pain  and  suffering  which  no  one  suggests  would  serve  any \npenological purpose.’” Arnett v. Webster, 658 F.3d 742, 750 (7th Cir. 2011) (quoting \nRodriguez v. Plymouth Ambulance Serv., 577 F.3d 816, 828 (7th Cir. 2009)); see also \n15 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 15 of 21   Document 184\n\nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976).  “Prison officials violate the Constitution if \nthey are deliberately indifferent to prisoners’ serious medical needs.” Arnett, 658 F.3d at \n750 (citing Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104). “[A] claim based on deficient medical care must \ndemonstrate  two  elements:  1)  an  objectively  serious  medical  condition;  and  2)  an \nofficial’s  deliberate  indifference  to  that  condition.”  Arnett,  658  F.3d  at  750  (citation \nomitted). “[D]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of a prisoner constitutes the \nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain forbidden by the Constitution.” Rodriguez, 577 \nF.3d at 828 (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104). \n  It  is  undisputed  that  plaintiff  has  not  been  diagnosed  with  gender  identity \ndisorder.  Moreover, as explained below, the undisputed facts do not support a finding \nthat defendants were deliberately indifferent to plaintiff’s medical needs.  \nTo demonstrate deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the defendant \n“acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind,” something akin to recklessness. Roe v. \nElyea, 631 F.3d 843, 857 (7th Cir. 2011).  A prison official acts with a sufficiently \nculpable state of mind when he or she knows of a substantial risk of harm to an inmate \nand either acts or fails to act in disregard of that risk. Id. A prison official cannot be \nfound liable under the Eighth Amendment unless the official “‘knows of and disregards \nan excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts \nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, \nand he must also draw the inference.’” Gutierrez v. Peters, 111 F.3d 1364, 1369 (7th \nCir.  1997)  (quoting  Farmer  v.  Brennan,  511  U.S.  825,  837  (1994)).  “Deliberate \nindifference ‘is more than negligence and approaches intentional wrongdoing.’”  Arnett, \n658 F.3d at 759 (quoting Collignon v. Milwaukee Cnty., 163 F.3d 982, 988 (7th Cir. \n16 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 16 of 21   Document 184\n\n1998)). Deliberate indifference does not, however, include medical malpractice; “the \nEighth Amendment does not codify common law torts.”  Duckworth v. Ahmad, 532 F.3d \n675, 679 (7th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). \nAt  most,  plaintiff’s  claim  against  Dawson  and  Landers  amounts  to  a \ndisagreement over plaintiff’s transfer to WSPF.  Dawson claims that plaintiff wanted to \ngo to WSPF.  In any event, Dawson had no input on the decision to transfer plaintiff \nthere.  Landers allegedly evaluated plaintiff for her placement at WSPF and promised \nher  programs  there  including  a  loaner  TV.    However,  plaintiff  does  not  claim  that \nLanders thought that housing plaintiff at WSPF would cause harm, and plaintiff admits \nthat while she initially had a loaner TV at WSPF, it was taken from her because of her \nconduct.   \nPlaintiff claims that, once she was housed at WSPF, Johnson did not write her \nback about bigger issues such as starting certain programs that plaintiff thought would \nbe beneficial.  It is undisputed that Johnson was not plaintiff’s primary care provider at \nWSPF.    Nonetheless,  plaintiff  acknowledges  that  Johnson,  who  is  a  psychologist \nsupervisor at WSPF, would see her at least twice a week and when plaintiff engaged \nher, Johnson’s interactions were “appropriate.”  These facts do not support a finding \nthat Johnson acted with deliberate indifference toward plaintiff. \nTurning  to  plaintiff’s  claims  against  Morrison,  Gardner,  and  Boughton,  she \nalleges that their refusal to transfer her from WSPF violated her constitutional rights. \nPlaintiff wants to transfer to another maximum-security institution because she thinks \nthat it would be easier to live as a transgender person in a different institution.  Plaintiff \n17 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 17 of 21   Document 184\n\nalleges that she has been subjected to harassment, battery, and sexual assault at \nWSPF. \nThe  Eighth  Amendment's  prohibition  on  “cruel  and  unusual  punishment” \nestablishes the minimum standard for the treatment of prisoners by prison officials. To \ndemonstrate that prison conditions violated the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner must \nprovide facts that satisfy a test involving both an objective and subjective component.  \nLunsford v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1574, 1579 (7th Cir. 1994). The objective analysis focuses \non whether prison conditions “exceeded contemporary bounds of decency of a mature, \ncivilized society.” Id. The subjective component requires evidence that prison officials \nacted wantonly and with deliberate indifference to a risk of serious harm to the prisoner.  \nId.  Prisoners do not have a constitutional right to be housed in a particular prison.  See \nDeTomaso v. McGinnis, 970 F.2d 211, 212 (7th Cir. 1992); see also Meachum v. Fano, \n427 U.S. 215, 224 (1976) (Constitution does not guarantee placement in a particular \nprison).  \nIt  is  undisputed  that  plaintiff  has  been  kept  at  WSPF  because  professional \nsecurity staff think it is the safest institution for her due to her conduct history and \ndisruptive behavior towards other inmates.  The parties differ on their interpretations of \nplaintiff’s behavior.  Plaintiff states that other inmates are disrespectful towards her first, \nand then she reacts in kind.  However, plaintiff admits that she has been attention \nseeking for as long as she can remember and that she does things to get a negative \nreaction from those around her.  It is undusted that plaintiff has an extensive conduct \nhistory, that she has moved cells within WSPF on average every other week, and that \nshe is disruptive on every unit where she is housed. \n18 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 18 of 21   Document 184\n\nPlaintiff is not being retained at WSPF for punitive reasons, but is being retained \ndue to her problematic pattern of disobeying orders and disruptive conduct.  WSPF \nplacement provides plaintiff with a single cell and a higher level of monitoring which can \nprovide  a  higher  level  of  security  allowing  staff  to  intervene  when  situations  arise \nbetween plaintiff and other inmates due to her inappropriate sexual comments and \nbehavior.    Plaintiff  does  not  allege  that  any  defendant  was  responsible  for  the \nharassment or assaults at WSPF. \nThe record does not support a finding that Morrison, Gardner, and Boughton \nacted with deliberate indifference in not transferring plaintiff from WSPF.  Thus, I will \ngrant defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment \nclaims against them. \nFinally,  in  the  absence  of  any  surviving  federal  claims,  I  will  relinquish \nsupplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff’s state law claim against Johnson.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367(c); Carlsbad Technology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., 556 U.S. 635, 639 (2009). \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS \nA.  Motion for Diagnostic Evaluation \nOn December 15, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for a diagnostic evaluation by an \noutside, independent, trained and qualified licensed psychologist and psychiatrist at the \nWisconsin Resource Center.  Plaintiff states that she has post-traumatic stress disorder \nbased on experiences she went through as a child.  She requests that defendants refer \nher  to  be  re-evaluated  for  PTSD,  bipolar  disorder,  OCD,  ADHD,  and  possibly \npsychopathy/psychotic disorder.  Plaintiff states that this is the only way to “defer/deny” \nher allegations against defendants.  However, while the court is sympathetic to plaintiff’s \n19 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 19 of 21   Document 184\n\nchildhood experiences, these allegations are not relevant to plaintiff’s lawsuit.  I will \ndeny her motion.   \nB.  Motion to Appoint Counsel \nOn December 15, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion to appoint counsel.  Plaintiff has \nfiled other requests for counsel in the past, which I have denied.  See, e.g., ECF No. \n108.  Because I am dismissing this case, her most recent request for counsel will also \nbe denied.   \nC.  Motion for Injunctive Relief \nOn January 4, 2018, plaintiff filed a motion for injunctive relief.  She states that \nshe is not safe at WSPF and that her safety, mental, and emotional health needs are \nnot being adequately met there.  According to plaintiff, defendants Gardner continues to \nhouse her near inmates who call her names like “snitch” and “punk ass bitch.”  Plaintiff \nstates that she starts arguing with these inmates and then they smack her in the mouth \nwhile the officers are not watching.  Plaintiff also states that defendants Gardner and \nBoughton have let Dr. Stacey Hoem, Officer Caliva, and other individuals write her \nretaliatory conduct reports.  Plaintiff asks the court to grant her motion and issue an \norder for transfer to another institution where she will be able to get proper mental \ntreatment.   \nPlaintiff has not met the standard for injunctive relief.  As explained above, the \nplaintiff has not shown that the defendants are violating her constitutional rights by \nhousing her at WSPF.  Therefore, I will deny plaintiff’s motion. \nD.  Motion for John Doe Criminal Investigation \n20 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 20 of 21   Document 184\n\n  Plaintiff has filed a motion for a John Doe criminal investigation.  She states that \nshe brings the motion under Wis. Stat. § 968.26 based on the defendants’ alleged \nviolation  of  certain  Wisconsin  criminal  statutes.    However,  I  have  no  authority  to \ncommence a John Doe investigation under Wisconsin law.  Therefore, this motion will \nbe denied. \nORDER \nFor  the  reasons  stated,  IT  IS  ORDERED  that  defendants’  motion  summary \njudgment (ECF No. 161) is GRANTED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion for diagnostic evaluation (ECF \nNo. 172) is DENIED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion to appoint counsel (ECF No. \n173) is DENIED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (ECF \nNo. 175) is DENIED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief (ECF No. \n179) is DENIED. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  plaintiff’s  motion  for  John  Doe  criminal \ninvestigation (ECF No. 182) is DENIED. \nFINALLY, IT IS ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall enter final judgment. \n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 25th day of May, 2018. \n               \n             \n              s/Lynn Adelman__________  \nLYNN ADELMAN \n              United States District Judge  \n21 \n \n \nCase 2:15-cv-00795-LA   Filed 05/25/18   Page 21 of 21   Document 184",
