    "summary": "<p>On December 27, 2017, five detainees in California's Otay Mesa Detention Center (\"the Facility\"), a for-profit civil immigration detention facility, filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The plaintiffs sued CoreCivic, a multibillion-dollar corporation that owns and operates civil detention facilities across the United States, under the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act and California state law, including California's Minimum Wage and Unjust Enrichment laws. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and Al Otro Lado, sought class-action certification, declaratory and injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant used the \"free and nearly-free\" labor of civil immigrant detainees to operate the facility and provide the essential services it was contractually required to provide. The plaintiffs claimed that this was forced labor and that the defendant maintained a corporate policy to withhold essential care and services to \"ensure a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the Facility.\" The plaintiffs contended that this policy resulted in detainees performing labor, often for no more than $1.50 an hour, to buy basic necessities that were not provided by defendant, including food, water, and warm clothing. The plaintiffs alleged that if detainees did not participate in this labor scheme defendant would threaten to place them in solitary confinement and or report their actions to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The plaintiffs asserted that this practice of forced labor resulted in an economic windfall for defendant, as its costs of operating detention facilities were greatly reduced.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought to certify four classes:</p>\r\n<p>(1) The Work Program Class: All civil immigration detainees who performed work for defendant at the Facility in the Work Program within the past ten years.</p>\r\n<p>(2) The Unlawful Inducement Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Otay Mesa Facility within the past ten years who performed work for no compensation outside of their pods.</p>\r\n<p>(3) The Injured Worker Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Facility within the past ten years who were injured while performing work through defendant's Work Program and denied access to California&rsquo;s Worker&rsquo;s Compensation benefits.</p>\r\n<p>(4) The Unpaid Cleaner Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Facility who performed labor within their pods within the past ten years under threat of solitary confinement, and/or in exchange for basic necessities.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Anthony Battaglia and Magistrate Judge Nita L. Stormes.</p>\r\n<p>On January 2, 2018, the plaintiffs provided notice of a related case. The plaintiffs related this case with <a href=\"../../../../case/17271\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc.</em></a>, \"because both actions involve common legal bases, similar legal claims, and an identical defendant.\"</p>\r\n<p>On January 5, 2018, this case was transferred to Judge Janis L. Sammartino to have the related cases assigned to the same judge. The related cases were not consolidated; pleadings were to be filed separately in each case.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought to consolidate this action with the <em>Owino</em> case on January 22, 2018, claiming that \"such consolidation will assist in the litigation, and appointment of lead counsel as proposed is in the best interests of the parties and will expedite the litigation.\" In addition to consolidation, the plaintiffs sought to assert themselves as interim lead class counsel in the event of a consolidated action.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2018, the plaintiffs in the <em>Owino</em> case filed a motion for intervention, for the purpose of opposing the <em>Gonzalez</em> plaintiffs' motion to consolidate. The <em>Owino</em> plaintiffs argued that because the <em>Gonzalez</em> plaintiffs have different legal theories and objectives, consolidation of the cases would impair the <em>Owino</em> plaintiffs' ability to protect their interests. Furthermore, the <em>Owino</em> plaintiffs asserted that the <em>Gonzalez</em> plaintiffs would not adequately protect their interests in a consolidated action. Lastly, the <em>Owino</em> plaintiffs argued that the Gonzalez case should be dismissed because the case is duplicative. The court granted the motion to intervene on March 23, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2018, Judge Sammartino issued an order denying consolidation and staying this case. Judge Sammartino concluded that the <em>Gonzalez</em> case is duplicative of <em>Owino</em>, as both cases arise from the same \"transaction nucleus of fact;\" both cases bring similar causes of actions and request similar relief and are based on similar factual allegations. However, Judge Sammartino declined to dismiss the <em>Gonzalez</em> case, despite the fact that these are \"two nearly identical putative class actions\", given the early stage of the <em>Owino</em> case.&nbsp; After class was certified in&nbsp;<em>Owino</em>, Judge Sammartino held a status conference in this case, at which the plaintiffs confirmed their understanding that they were members of the&nbsp;<em>Owino</em> class and agreed to wait for the resolution of&nbsp;<em>Owino</em> before proceeding in this case. In light of that, on September 28, 2023, the district court continued the stay in this case pending resolution of&nbsp;<em>Owino</em>.&nbsp; As of December 2024, this case remains stayed.&nbsp;</p>",

This action arises from systematic and unlawful wage theft, unjust enrichment, and \n14 \nforced labor at Californiaโs Otay Mesa Detention Center (the โOtay Mesa Facilityโ or the โFacilityโ).  \n15 \n2.  The Otay Mesa Facility is a civil immigration detention facility owned and operated \n16 \nfor profit by Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. (โCoreCivicโ).  \n17 \n18  3.  CoreCivic  is  a  multibillion-dollar  corporation  that  owns  and  operates  detention \n19  facilities across the United States. CoreCivic has made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from \n20 \nits contract to run the Otay Mesa Facility.  \n21 \n4.  Although it is contractually required to provide for all essential detention services at \n22 \nthe Facility, CoreCivic uses the free and nearly-free labor of detainees to perform these services to \n23 \nmaximize profits. \n24 \n5.  CoreCivic pays detainees $1 or $1.50 per day โ or nothing at all โ to maintain and \n25 \noperate the Facility.      \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  2   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.3   Page 3 of 25\n \n1  6.  This labor is not voluntary in any meaningful sense. CoreCivic maintains a corporate \n2 \npolicy and uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility of withholding necessary protection, care, and \n3 \nservices from its detainees to ensure a ready supply of available labor needed to operate the Facility.  \n4 \n7.  As a result, detainees are forced to submit to CoreCivicโs unlawful detainee labor \n5 \nscheme to buy the basic necessities โ including food, water, warm clothing, medicine, and hygiene \n6 \nproducts โ that CoreCivic unlawfully refuses to provide for them.   \n7 \n8.  CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Otay Mesa Facility \n8 \n9  of threatening detainees who refuse to work with solitary confinement, cutting off communication \n10  and visitation with family, reporting their actions to the United States Immigration and Customs \n11 \nEnforcement  (โICEโ),  or  referring  them  for  criminal  prosecution.  Together  with  CoreCivicโs \n12 \nsystemic under-provision for detainee needs, these abusive practices and threats of abuse ensure that \n13 \ndetainees will continue working for subminimum wages, or for nothing at all.  \n14 \n9.  CoreCivicโs  scheme  significantly  reduces  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n15 \nexponentially  increases  its  already  vast  profits,  by  unlawfully  forcing  and  coercing  detainees  to \n16 \nperform labor at subminimum wages or for free.  These policies and practices violate California \n17 \n18  minimum wage law, the California Unfair Competition Law, and federal and state Trafficking Victims \n19  Protection Acts, which prohibit forced labor.  \n20 \n10.   Plaintiffs Carlos Gonzalez, Juan Jose Merino-Rodas, Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola, \n21 \nGladys Carrera-Duarte, and Jennye Pagoada-Lopez, individually and on behalf of all others similarly \n22 \nsituated, brings this class action lawsuit to stop the economic exploitation of detainees at the Otay \n23 \nMesa  Facility,  to  recover  unpaid  wages,  and  to  remedy  the  unjust  enrichment  resulting  from \n24 \nCoreCivicโs unlawful failure to pay its detainee workforce legal wages.           \n25 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n26 \n27  11.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 because this \n28  action arises under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589 et seq. \n  3   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.4   Page 4 of 25\n \n1  12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \n2 \nof 2005, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332(d), because at least one class member is of diverse citizenship from one \n3 \ndefendant; there are more than 100 class members; the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds \n4 \n$5,000,000; and minimal diversity exists. \n5 \n13.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because the events or \n6 \nomissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \n7 \n14.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over CoreCivic because the corporation regularly \n8 \n9  conducts business in California, and has sufficient minimum contacts with California.    \n10  15.  Plaintiffs  request  that  this  Court  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  pursuant  to \n11 \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 over their state law claims arising under the California Minimum Wage Act, the \n12 \nCalifornia Unfair Competition Law, and California common law.  \n13 \nPARTIES \n14 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n15 \n16.  Plaintiff Carlos Gonzalez is an adult resident of Bakersfield, California. He is a citizen \n16 \n17  of El Salvador and is seeking asylum in the United States. From May 2017 through November 2017, \n18  he was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. During those months, Mr. Gonzalez was employed by \n19 \nCoreCivic as a kitchen worker, janitor, and administrative clerk. He was paid only $1 or $1.50 per day \n20 \nfor his labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours he worked.   \n21 \n17.  Plaintiff Juan Jose Merino-Rodas is an adult resident of Bakersfield, California. He is \n22 \na citizen of El Salvador and is seeking asylum in the United States. From May 2017 through \n23 \nNovember 2017, he was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. During those months, Mr. Merino Rodas \n24 \nwas employed by CoreCivic as a kitchen worker and janitor. He was paid only $1 or $1.50 per day for \n25 \n26  his labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours he worked.   \n27 \n28 \n  4   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.5   Page 5 of 25\n \n1  18.  Plaintiff Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n2 \nShe is a citizen of Mexico and is seeking asylum in the United States. She has been detained at the \n3 \nFacility  since  on  or  around  June  17,  2017.  Ms.  Gutierrez-Canchola  is  currently  employed  by \n4 \nCoreCivic as a janitor. She is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of \n5 \nhow many hours she works.   \n6 \n19.  Plaintiff Gladys Carrera-Duarte is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. She is \n7 \na citizen of Guatemala and is seeking asylum in the United States. She has been detained at the \n8 \n9  Facility since on or around June 30, 2017. Ms. Carrera-Duarte is currently employed by CoreCivic as \n10  a janitor. She is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many \n11 \nhours she works.   \n12 \n20.  Plaintiff Jennye Pagoada-Lopez is a current detainee at the Otay Mesa Facility. She is \n13 \na citizen of Honduras and is seeking asylum in the United States. Ms. Pagoada-Lopez has been \n14 \ndetained at the Facility since on or around July 23, 2017. She is employed by CoreCivic as a janitor. \n15 \nShe is paid only $1.50 per day for her labor โ or nothing at all โ regardless of how many hours she \n16 \nworked.     \n17 \n18  B.  Defendant \n19  21.  Defendant CoreCivic, formerly the Corrections Corporation of America, is a for-\n20 \nprofit  corporation  providing  correctional  and  detention  services.  CoreCivic  is  a  Maryland \n21 \ncorporation, with its principal office located at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee, \n22 \n37215. \n23 \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n24 \nA.  Immigration detention is civilโnot criminal.  \n25 \n22.  Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  individuals  are  detained  in  geographically \n26 \n27  isolated  immigration  detention  facilities  while  awaiting  immigration  or  citizenship  status \n28 \n  5   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.6   Page 6 of 25\n \n1  determinations.  These  detainees  include  U.S.  citizens,  lawful  permanent  residents  (green  card \n2 \nholders) with longstanding family and community ties, survivors of torture, asylum seekers, victims \n3 \nof human trafficking, children, and pregnant women.  \n4 \n23.  Some  detainees  were  brought  to  the  United  States  as  children.  And  thousands \n5 \nultimately have their United States citizenship or legal residency affirmed by an immigration court or \n6 \nfederal judge. \n7 \n24.  Immigration  violations  are  civil  violations,  and  immigration  detention  is  civil  in \n8 \n9  nature.1 Many detainees have no criminal history at all.   \n10  25.  Notwithstanding  immigration  detentionโs  civil  nature  and  purpose,  detainees  are \n11 \nsubjected to prison-like conditions at the Otay Mesa Facility. According to Dora Schriro, former \n12 \nhead of ICEโs Office of Detention Policy and Planning, most detainees are held โ systematically and \n13 \nunnecessarily  โ  under  circumstances  inappropriate  for  immigration  detentionโs  noncriminal \n14 \npurposes.2    Detainees  are  frequently  subjected  to  punitive  and  long-term  solitary  confinement, \n15 \ninadequate  medical  care,  sexual  and  physical  assault,  lack  of  access  to  counsel,  and  other \n16 \nharsh conditions of confinement, all without a conviction. \n17 \n18  26.  Many detainees accede to deportation simply to obtain release from these intolerable \n19  conditions, even when they have valid claims to remain in the United States, including claims for \n20 \nasylum or other discretionary relief.      \n21 \nB.  The privatization of immigration detention and CoreCivicโs economic windfall. \n22 \n27.  Immigration detention expanded roughly eightfold over the past two decades, from a \n23 \ncapacity of 5,532 detention beds in 19943 to a current capacity of over 41,000.4  \n24 \n25 \n                                                 \n1 See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 728โ30 (1893) (observing that deportation proceedings have โall the \n26 \nelements of a civil caseโ and are โin no proper sense a trial or sentence for a crime or offenseโ). \n2 Dora Schriro, U.S. Depโt of Homeland Sec., โImmigration Detention Overview and Recommendations,โ at 10, 15 \n27 \n(2009). \n3 Sharita Gruberg, โHow For-Profit Companies are Driving Immigration Detention Policies, Center for American \n28 \nProgressโ (Dec. 18, 2015), available at \n  6   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.7   Page 7 of 25\n \n1  28.  During the same period, CoreCivic and other private prison corporations have spent \n2 \ntens of millions of dollars on lobbying efforts.5   \n3 \n29.  As  immigration  detention  has  expanded,  private  prison  corporations,  particularly \n4 \nCoreCivic, have gained an increasing share of the contracts for new detention beds.6  \n5 \n30.  Contracts with ICE accounted for 28% of CoreCivicโs total revenues in 2016 ($511.8 \n6 \nmillion), up from up from 24% in 2015.7 CoreCivic officials expect these lucrative ICE contracts to \n7 \naccount for a significant percentage of the corporationโs ongoing revenues.8   \n8 \n9  31.  CoreCivicโs 2016 revenues were approximately $1.85 billion, and its stock is publicly \n10  traded on the New York Stock Exchange.9    \n11 \n32.  CoreCivicโs economic windfall, and the profitability of its immigration detention \n12 \nenterprise, arise from its policy of systemically withholding necessary case from detainees to ensure a \n13 \nreadily available, captive labor force that cleans, maintains, and operates its facilities for sub-minimal \n14 \nwages under threat of solitary confinement and abuse of legal process. Without this nearly free \n15 \ndetainee labor, CoreCivicโs windfall from immigrant detention would be substantially decreased. \n16 \nC.  CoreCivic withholds necessary care from detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility.  \n17 \n18  33.  Since 2005, CoreCivic has contracted with ICE to operate the Otay Mesa Facility, \n19  which is a 1,482-bed immigration detention facility in San Diego, California.    \n20 \n34.  The Otay Mesa Facility is notorious for its poor treatment of detainees.   \n21 \n                                                                                                                                                            \n22  https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/reports/2015/12/18/127769/how-for-profit-companies-are-\ndriving-immigration-detention-policies/.  \n23  4 Jenny Jarvie, โThis industry stands to benefit from Trumpโs crackdown on the border,โ Los Angeles Times (Feb. 14, \n2017) available at http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-immigrant-detention-20170214-story.html. \n24  5 Michael Cohen, โHow for-profit prisons have become the biggest lobby no one is talking about,โ Washington Post \n(Apr. 28, 2015), available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/28/how-for-profit-prisons-\n25  have-become-the-biggest-lobby-no-one-is-talking-about/?utm_term=.25de04ae71f9  \n6 Bethany Carson & Eleana Diaz, โPayoff: How Congress Ensures Private Prison Profit with an Immigrant Detention \nQuota, Grassroots Leadership,โ (Apr. 2015) at 4, Chart 1-AA, available at \n26 \nhttps://grassrootsleadership.org/sites/default/files/reports/quota_report_final_digital.pdf  \n7 CoreCivic.

CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice of withholding sufficient \n2 \nprotection, food, water, medicine, clothing, and hygiene products from the detainees at the Otay \n3 \nMesa Facility. As a result, detainees are forced to either purchase these daily necessities from the \n4 \nFacilityโs commissary, or go without.  \n5 \n36.  By maintaining these harsh conditions and purposely withholding basic necessities \n6 \nfrom detainees, CoreCivic ensures an available labor pool of detainees will work for only $1 or $1.50 \n7 \nper day, thus allowing it to continue operating the Otay Mesa Facility at an enormous profit.  \n8 \n9  D.  CoreCivic uses detainees to clean, maintain, and operate the Otay Mesa Facility. \n10  37.  Through its so-called Voluntary Work Program (the โWork Programโ), CoreCivic \n11 \nhires detainees to perform work that directly contributes to institutional operations, at a rate of $1 or \n12 \n$1.50 per day. \n13 \n38.  Despite its name, the Work Program is not โvoluntaryโ in any meaningful sense. \n14 \nInstead, as noted above, CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Otay \n15 \nMesa Facility of withholding necessary care and protection from detainees. As a result, detainees are \n16 \nforced to submit to CoreCivicโs detainee labor scheme in order to buy necessities โ including food, \n17 \n18  water, medicine, clothing, and hygiene products โ that CoreCivic refuses to provide for them.   \n19  39.  Further, CoreCivic maintains a corporate policy and uniform practice at the Facility \n20 \nof threatening to place those who refuse to work into solitary confinement. These conditions, \n21 \npolicies, and practices ensure that detainees continue working for subminimum wages.       \n22 \n40.  In the Work Program, detainees are required to work according to an assigned work \n23 \nschedule and to participate in work-related training. At all times, CoreCivic controls detaineesโ wages, \n24 \nhours, and working conditions.   \n25 \n41.  CoreCivic provides all necessary personal protection equipment and work uniforms.    \n26 \n27  42.  CoreCivic records the hours detainees work and periodically credits wages to their \n28  accounts.         \n  8   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.9   Page 9 of 25\n \n1  43.  The  detainee  workers  are  โemployees,โ  and  CoreCivic  is  an  โemployerโ  under \n2 \nCaliforniaโs minimum wage laws. \n3 \n44.  CoreCivic informs all detainees entering the Otay Mesa Facility that the following \n4 \nwork assignments may be available through the Work Program:  \n5 \na.  Intake \n6 \nb.  Kitchen Worker \n7 \nc.  Recreation \n8 \n9  d.  Library \n10  e.  Barber \n11 \nf.  Laundry \n12 \ng.  Living area clean-up/janitorial \n13 \nh.  Evening workers (facility janitorial) \n14 \ni.  Maintenance \n15 \n45.  In the course of their labor and employment by CoreCivic, detainees employed in the \n16 \nWork Program performed a wide range of work, including but not limited to: \n17 \n18  a.  Scrubbing bathrooms, showers, toilets, and windows; \n19  b.  Cleaning and maintaining CoreCivicโs on-site medical facility;  \n20 \nc.  Cleaning patient rooms and medical staff offices; \n21 \nd.  Sweeping, mopping, stripping, and waxing floors throughout the facility; \n22 \ne.  Washing detainee laundry; \n23 \nf.  Preparing, cooking, and serving detainee meals; \n24 \ng.  Washing dishes; \n25 \nh.  Cleaning the kitchen and cafeteria before and after detainee meals; \n26 \n27  i.  Performing clerical work for CoreCivic;  \n28  j.  Running and managing the law library; \n  9   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.10   Page 10 of 25\n \n1  k.  Providing barber services to detainees; \n2 \nl.  Cleaning intake areas and solitary confinement units; and \n3 \nm. Cleaning and maintaining recreational areas. \n4 \n46.  The Work Program allows CoreCivic to avoid recruiting from the traditional labor \n5 \nmarket,  complying  with  the  terms  of  its  union  contracts,  and  paying  all  costs  associated  with \n6 \npotential, current, and former employment relationships, thereby reducing operational costs and \n7 \nincreasing its own profits. \n8 \n9  47.  CoreCivic  does  not  pay  and  has  not  paid  detainees  the  state  minimum  wage  โ \n10  currently, $10.50 per hour โ for the hours they worked at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n11 \n48.  CoreCivicโs contract with ICE requires CoreCivic to comply with all federal, state, \n12 \nand local laws.  \n13 \n49.  No clause in CoreCivicโs contract with ICE or any rule or standard incorporated by \n14 \nreference into the contract requires CoreCivic to maximize its profits by paying detainees sub-\n15 \nminimum wages.  \n16 \n50.  CoreCivicโs pay policies violate Californiaโs minimum wage laws. \n17 \n18  PLAINTIFFSโ EMPLOYMENT AT THE OTAY MESA FACILITY \n19  A.  Plaintiff Carlos Gonzalez \n20 \n51.  Mr. Gonzalez is citizen of El Salvador and an asylum seeker in the United States.  He \n21 \nlives with his family in Bakersfield, California.       \n22 \n52.  Mr. Gonzalez was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility from approximately May 7, 2017 \n23 \nto approximately November 30, 2017. He was detained along with his stepson, Plaintiff Juan Jose \n24 \nMerino-Rodas.    \n25 \n53.  Mr. Gonzalez has performed work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility and was \n26 \n27  not paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed. \n28 \n  10   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.11   Page 11 of 25\n \n1  54.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Gonzalez prepared, cooked, and served meals, washed \n2 \ndishes, and cleaned the kitchen area. He worked six-hour shifts, starting at 3:00 am, up to seven days \n3 \nper week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic.    \n4 \n55.  When he was hired to work in the kitchen, Mr. Gonzalez was forced to sign a waiver \n5 \nof his workersโ compensation rights.    \n6 \n56.  As a janitor, Mr. Gonzalez cleaned and maintained the intake area of the Facility. He \n7 \nworked three-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and equipment \n8 \n9  provided by CoreCivic.    \n10  57.  Mr. Gonzalez also worked for three weeks cleaning and maintaining the office of the \n11 \nFacility manager. He worked three-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies \n12 \nand equipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n13 \n58.  Mr. Gonzalez worked in the Facility managerโs office because he was promised \n14 \npayment of $1 per day, plus soda and candy bars, in exchange for his labor. However, he never \n15 \nreceived any payment, soda, or candy bars โ or anything else โ for his work.     \n16 \n59.  In return for this labor in the kitchen, intake area, and the managerโs office, Mr. \n17 \n18  Gonzalez was paid $1 to $1.50 per day โ or nothing at all โ regardless of the number of hours he \n19  worked. CoreCivic credited these wages to Mr. Gonzalezโs commissary account periodically.  \n20 \n60.  Mr. Gonzalez spent his wages on food and vitamins from the Otay Mesa Facility \n21 \ncommissary, among other necessities. \n22 \n61.  Officers at the Otay Mesa Facility threatened to put Mr. Gonzalez in disciplinary \n23 \nsegregation, i.e., solitary confinement, revoke his family visitation and commissary access rights, and \n24 \nwithhold mail delivery if he stopped working or encouraged other detainees to stop working.   \n25 \n62.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Gonzalez would not have worked for less than \n26 \n27  minimum wage.  \n28 \n  11   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.12   Page 12 of 25\n \n1  63.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe the corporation could not pay him \n2 \nmore than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n3 \nimmigration detention facilities. \n4 \n64.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe that it could require him to work in the \n5 \nFacility Managerโs officer for no pay at all. \n6 \n65.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Gonzalez to believe he had to waive his protections under \n7 \nCaliforniaโs Workerโs Compensation laws while working as an employee at the facility. \n8 \n9  66.  CoreCivic  retained  the  value  of  Mr.  Gonzalezโs  labor  by  realizing  this  value  as \n10  corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \n11 \ndetainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n12 \nB.  Plaintiff Juan Jose Merino-Rodas \n \n13 \n67.  Mr. Merino-Rodas is citizen of El Salvador and an asylum seeker in the United States.  \n14 \nHe lives with his family in Bakersfield, California.       \n15 \n68.  Mr. Merino-Rodas was detained at the Otay Mesa Facility from May 2017 through \n16 \nNovember 2017.  \n17 \n18  69.  Mr. Merino-Rodas has performed work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility and \n19  was not paid the state minimum wage for the work he has performed. \n20 \n70.  As a kitchen worker, Mr. Merino-Rodas washed dishes, prepared and cooked meals, \n21 \nand cleaned the kitchen area. He worked six-hour shifts, up to seven days per week. He used cleaning \n22 \nsupplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic. \n23 \n71.  While employed by CoreCivic as a kitchen worker, Mr. Merino-Rodas suffered an \n24 \nextremely painful burn to his arm that required medical treatment. CoreCivic denied Mr. Merino-\n25 \nRodas access to Californiaโs Workerโs Compensation protections and required him to return to work \n26 \n27  just one day laterโbefore he fully recovered. \n28 \n  12   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.13   Page 13 of 25\n \n1  72.  Detainee laborers at the Otay Mesa Facility have, like Mr. Merino-Rodas, suffered on-\n2 \nthe-job injuries for which they received inadequate treatment and compensation. \n3 \n73.  Mr. Merino-Rodas was also employed to clean and maintain the intake area of the \n4 \nFacility. In this role, he worked three-hour shifts, seven days per week. He used cleaning supplies and \n5 \nequipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n6 \n74.  In return for this labor, Mr. Merino-Rodas was paid $1.50 per day, regardless of the \n7 \nnumber of hours he worked. CoreCivic credited these wages to his commissary account periodically.  \n8 \n9  75.  Mr.  Merino-Rodas  spent  his  wages  on  food  and  medicine  from  the  Otay  Mesa \n10  Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n11 \n76.  Officers at the Otay Mesa Facility threatened to put Mr. Merino-Rodas in disciplinary \n12 \nsegregation, i.e., solitary confinement, if he stopped working or encouraged other detainees to stop \n13 \nworking.   \n14 \n77.  If given a meaningful choice, Mr. Merino-Rodas would not have worked for less than \n15 \nthe minimum wage.  \n16 \n78.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Merino-Rodas to believe the corporation could not pay him \n17 \n18  more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n19  immigration detention facilities. \n20 \n79.  CoreCivic falsely led Mr. Merino-Rodas to believe he had to waive his protections \n21 \nunder Californiaโs Workerโs Compensation laws while working as an employee at the facility. \n22 \n80.  CoreCivic retained the value of Mr. Merino-Rodasโ labor by realizing this value as \n23 \ncorporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane living conditions for \n24 \ndetainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n25 \nC.  Plaintiff Maribel Gutierrez-Canchola \n26 \n27  81.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola is a citizen of Mexico and an asylum seeker in the United \n28  States.          \n  13   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.14   Page 14 of 25\n \n1  82.

She works up to six hours \n7 \nper day, five days a week.  She uses cleaning supplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic. \n8 \n9  85.  In return for this labor, Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola is paid $1.50 per day, regardless of \n10  the  number  of  hours  she  works.  CoreCivic  credits  these  wages  to  Ms.  Gutierrez-Cancholaโs \n11 \ncommissary account periodically.  \n12 \n86.  Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola spends her wages on food, medicine, clothing, soap, and \n13 \nshampoo from the Otay Mesa Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n14 \n87.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola would not work for less than \n15 \nthe minimum wage.  \n16 \n88.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Gutierrez-Canchola to believe the corporation cannot pay \n17 \n18  her more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its \n19  other immigration detention facilities.  \n20 \n89.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Gutierrez-Cancholaโs \n21 \nlabor by realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more \n22 \nhumane living conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n23 \nD.  Plaintiff Gladys Carrera-Duarte \n24 \n90.  Ms. Carrera-Duarte is a citizen of Guatemala and an asylum seeker in the United \n25 \nStates.          \n26 \n27  91.

Ms.  Carrera-Duarte  spends  her  wages  on  food,  medicine,  clothing,  soap,  and \n10  shampoo from the Otay Mesa Facility commissary, among other necessities. \n11 \n96.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Carrera-Duarte would not work for $1.50 per day.  \n12 \n97.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Carrera-Duarte to believe the corporation cannot pay her \n13 \nmore than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n14 \nimmigration detention facilities.  \n15 \n98.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Carrera-Duarteโs labor \n16 \nby realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane \n17 \n18  living conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n19  E.  Plaintiff Jennye Pagoada-Lopez  \n20 \n99.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is a citizen of Honduras and an asylum seeker in the United \n21 \nStates.          \n22 \n100.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is currently detained at the Otay Mesa Facility. She has been \n23 \ndetained there since approximately June 24, 2017.  \n24 \n101.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez performs work for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility, and is \n25 \nnot paid the state minimum wage for the work she performs. \n26 \n27  102.  Ms. Pagoada-Lopez was employed for approximately six weeks as a janitor. She \n28  cleaned and maintained bathrooms, showers, kitchens, lobbies, stairwells, offices, and other areas \n  15   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.16   Page 16 of 25\n \n1  through the Facility. She worked up to six hours per day, five days a week.  She used cleaning \n2 \nsupplies and equipment provided by CoreCivic.  \n3 \n103.  In return for this labor, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez was paid $1.50 per day, regardless of the \n4 \nnumber  of  hours  she  worked.  CoreCivic  credited  these  wages  to  her  commissary  account \n5 \nperiodically.  \n6 \n104.  Currently, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez cleans and maintains communal areas in her pod. She \n7 \nworks for up to two hours each day.    \n8 \n9  105.  In return for this labor, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez is paid nothing at all. Occasionally, \n10  CoreCivic has given Ms. Pagoada-Lopez extra rations of toilet paper and shampoo in exchange for \n11 \nher labor.    \n12 \n106.  Ms.  Pagoada-Lopez  spends  her  wages  on  food,  medicine,  clothing,  soap,  and \n13 \nshampoo  from  the  Otay  Mesa  Facility  commissary,  among  other  necessities.  She  has  lost \n14 \napproximately 30 pounds in detention at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n15 \n107.  If given a meaningful choice, Ms. Pagoada-Lopez would not work for $1.50 per day \n16 \nor for free.  \n17 \n18  108.  CoreCivic falsely led Ms. Pagoada-Lopez to believe the corporation cannot pay her \n19  more than $1.50 per day, despite the fact that it does so as a matter of course at several of its other \n20 \nimmigration detention facilities.  \n21 \n109.  CoreCivic has retained and currently retains the value of Ms. Pagoada-Lopezโs labor \n22 \nby realizing this value as corporate profits, rather than using it to provide for safer, more humane \n23 \nliving conditions for detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility. \n24 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n25 \n110.  Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of themselves, and all others \n26 \n27  similarly situated as members of the proposed class, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n28 \n  16   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.17   Page 17 of 25\n \n1  (b)(2). This action satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, predominance, and \n2 \nsuperiority requirements of those provisions.  \n3 \nA.    Class Definitions \n4 \n111.  Plaintiffs seek to certify the following classes:  \n5 \na.  The Work Program Class: All civil immigration detainees who performed work \n6  for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the Work Program within \nthe past ten years. \n7 \n \nb.  The Unlawful Inducement Class:  All civil immigration detainees held at the \n8 \nOtay  Mesa  Facility  within  the  past  ten  years  who  performed  work  for  no \n9  compensation outside of their pods.   \n \n10  c.  The Injured Worker Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Otay \nMesa Facility within the past ten years who were injured while performing work \n11 \nthrough CoreCivicโs Work Program and denied access to Californiaโs Workerโs \nCompensation benefits. \n12 \n \nd.  The Unpaid Cleaner Class: All civil immigration detainees held at the Otay \n13 \nMesa Facility who performed labor within their pods within the past ten years \n14  under threat of solitary confinement, and/or in exchange for basic necessities. \n \n15  112.  Excluded from the definition are the Sylvester Owino, Jonathan Gomez, defendants, \n16 \ntheir  officers,  directors,  management,  employees,  subsidiaries,  and  affiliates,  and  all  federal \n17 \ngovernmental  entities.  Plaintiffs  reserve  the  right  to  revise  the  Class  Definitions  based  upon \n18 \ninformation learned through discovery.  \n19 \nB.     Class Certification Requirements under Rule 23  \n20 \n113.  Numerosity: Each class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \n21 \nPlaintiffs do not know the exact size of the class since that information is within the control of \n22 \n23  CoreCivic. However, upon information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the number of class members \n24  is numbered in the thousands. Membership in the class is readily ascertainable from CoreCivicโs \n25 \ndetention and employment records.   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  17   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.18   Page 18 of 25\n \n1  114.  Commonality and Predominance: There are numerous questions of law or fact \n2 \ncommon to the Class, and those issues predominate over any question affecting only individual class \n3 \nmembers. The common legal and factual issues include the following: \n4 \na.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members were entitled to the protections of the \n5 \nCalifornia Minimum Wage Act;  \n6 \nb.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members performed compensable work;    \n7 \nc.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members were paid $1 or $1.50 per day for their \n8 \n9  labor; \n10  d.  Whether CoreCivic engaged in conduct that violated California law โ including \n11 \nthe California Minimum Wage Act, the California Unfair Competition Law, and \n12 \nthe California Trafficking Victims Protection Act; \n13 \ne.  Whether  CoreCivic  engaged  in  conduct  that  violated  the  federal  Trafficking \n14 \nVictims Protection Act; \n15 \nf.  Whether Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to equitable relief, including \n16 \ninjunctive and declaratory relief; and  \n17 \n18  g.  Whether Plaintiffs and the Class Members are entitled to damages and other \n19  monetary relief and, if so, in what amount. \n20 \n115.  Typicality: The claims asserted by Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Class, in \n21 \nthat  the  representative  Plaintiffs,  like  all  Class  Members,  were  paid  subminimum  wages  while \n22 \nemployed by CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Facility.  Each member of the proposed Class has been \n23 \nsimilarly injured financially by CoreCivicโs misconduct. \n24 \n116.  Adequacy: Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \n25 \nPlaintiffs have retained attorneys experienced in class and complex litigation, including wage and \n26 \n27  hour class action litigation. Plaintiffs intend to vigorously prosecute this litigation. Neither Plaintiffs \n28  nor their counsel have interests that conflict with the interests of the other class members.  \n  18   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.19   Page 19 of 25\n \n1  117.  Superiority:  Plaintiffs and Class Members have all suffered and will continue to \n2 \nsuffer harm and damages as a result of CoreCivicโs wrongful conduct. A class action is superior to \n3 \nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. Treatment as a class \n4 \naction will permit a large number of similarly situated persons to adjudicate their common claims in a \n5 \nsingle forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the duplication of effort and expense that \n6 \nnumerous individual actions would engender. Class treatment will also permit the adjudication of \n7 \nclaims by many members of the proposed class who could not individually afford to litigate a claim \n8 \n9  such as is asserted in this complaint. This class action likely presents no difficulties in management \n10  that would preclude maintenance as a class action.  \n11 \n118.  This action satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) because CoreCivic has acted \n12 \nand refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \n13 \ninjunctive and/or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to each Class Member. \n14 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n15   \nCOUNT I \n16 \n  CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE LAW \nCal. Labor Code ยงยง 1194, 1197, 1197.1 \n17 \n \n18  119.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above.  \n19  120.  The California Legislature set the following minimum wages for 2011-2017:10 \n20 \nJanuary 1, 2017  $10.50 for employers with 26 employees or more \n21 \nJanuary 1, 2014  $9.00 \n22 \nJanuary 1, 2008  $8.00 \n23 \n \n24 \n121.  The minimum wage is an obligation of the employer and cannot be waived by any \n25 \n26  agreement.   \n27  122.  Detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility do not forfeit their rights to wage protections.  \n                                                 \n28 \n10 See http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/MinimumWageHistory.htm/; https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm  \n  19   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.20   Page 20 of 25\n \n1  123.  Employees protected by Californiaโs minimum wage laws must be paid at least the set \n2 \nhourly minimum wage. \n3 \n124.  Detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility who participate in the Work Program qualify as \n4 \nemployees of CoreCivic under California law. \n5 \n125.  CoreCivic qualifies as an employer under California law.    \n6 \n126.  Labor in the immigration detention context is not intended as a punitive measure.      \n7 \n127.  CoreCivic does not compensate detainees the state minimum wage for the work they \n8 \n9  performed at the Otay Mesa Facility. Instead, CoreCivic pays detainees $1 or $1.50 per day โ or \n10  nothing at all โ for work they perform at its facility.  \n11 \n128.  Plaintiffs seek to recover, on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly \n12 \nsituated, unpaid minimum wages and costs of this suit.   \n13 \n129.  This Count applies to the Work Program Class, the Unlawful Inducement Class, the \n14 \nInjured Worker Class, and the Unpaid Cleaner Class.  \n15 \nCOUNT II \n16 \nUNJUST ENRICHMENT \nCalifornia Common Law \n17 \n18  130.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference herein all allegations above. \n19  131.  CoreCivic  materially  and  significantly  reduced  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n20 \nincreased its profits, because Plaintiffs and Class Members perform undercompensated labor. \n21 \n132.  Plaintiffs and Class Members conferred non-gratuitous benefits upon CoreCivic by \n22 \nperforming work for $1 or $1.50 per day, or for nothing at all, for which CoreCivic would otherwise \n23 \nhave had to pay at least the applicable minimum wage or more, thereby significantly and materially \n24 \nincreasing CoreCivicโs profits, unjustly enriching CoreCivic at the expense of and detriment to \n25 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members. \n26 \n27  133.  CoreCivicโs  retention  of  any  benefit  collected  directly  and  indirectly  from  this \n28  uncompensated labor violated principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.  \n  20   \n \n \n \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-AJB-NLS   Document 1   Filed 12/27/17   PageID.21   Page 21 of 25\n \n1  134.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs forced labor practices, Plaintiffs and \n2 \nClass Members have suffered concrete harm and injury, including physical and emotional injury, \n3 \nmonetary loss, and the unlawful violation of their rights.     \n4 \n135.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that \n5 \nCoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic should be required to disgorge to \n6 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained. Plaintiffs and Class Members are \n7 \nalso entitled to recover exemplary damages. C.R.S. ยง 13- 21-102. \n8 \n9  136.

The  acts,  omissions,  and  practices  of  CoreCivic  constitute  unfair  and  unlawful \n22 \nbusiness acts and practices under the UCL in that CoreCivicโs conduct offends public policy against \n23 \nforced labor, and seeks to profit by violating Plaintiffsโ rights under state and federal law.  \n24 \n141.  As a direct and proximate result of CoreCivicโs unlawful and unfair business practices, \n25 \nPlaintiffs and Class Members have suffered economic injury.   \n26 \n27  142.

CoreCivic  materially  and  significantly  reduced  its  labor  costs  and  expenses,  and \n16 \nincreased its profits, by unlawfully forcing and coercing Plaintiffs and Class Members to perform \n17 \n18  uncompensated labor. In order to drive profits, CoreCivic acted with the intent to obtain forced \n19  labor or services from its detainees.  \n20 \n148.  As alleged herein, CoreCivic did not and does not provide detainees at the Otay Mesa \n21 \nFacility with sufficient provisions and necessities for daily life. In order to purchase these necessary \n22 \nitems, including food, medicine, hygiene products, and clothing, Plaintiffs and Class Members were \n23 \nand are forced or coerced to perform labor and services for CoreCivic for $1 or $1.50 per day.  \n24 \n149.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to recover from CoreCivic all amounts that \n25 \nCoreCivic has wrongfully and improperly obtained, and CoreCivic should be required to disgorge to \n26 \n27  Plaintiffs and Class Members the benefits it has unjustly obtained.

The  Court \n23  permitted the plaintiffs (โOwino Plaintiffsโ) in a related matter, Owino v. CoreCivic, 17-\n24  CV-1112, to intervene for the limited purpose of filing an opposition to this Motion, (ECF \n25  No. 36).  Accordingly, Owino Plaintiffs filed a Response in Opposition, (โOwino Oppโn,โ \n26  ECF No. 37), as did Defendant CoreCivic, Inc., (โDef. Oppโn,โ ECF No. 38), to the \n27  Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ Motion.  The Gonzalez Plaintiffs filed a Reply in Support of, (โReply,โ \n28  ECF No. 41), their Motion.  The Court vacated the hearing and took the matter under \n1 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.367   Page 2 of 10\n \n1  submission without oral argument pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1).  (ECF No. 42.)  \n2  Having considered the Partiesโ arguments and the law, the Court rules as follows.   \n3  BACKGROUND \n4  This case involves two related class actions.  On May 31, 2017, Owino Plaintiffs \n5  filed a putative class action against Defendant in this Court.  (โOwino Compl.,โ ECF No. \n6  1, Case No. 17-CV-1112.)  The Owino Plaintiffs are former civil immigration detainees \n7  and allege they were paid $1 a day for labor while they were interred at Defendantโs Otay \n8  Mesa Detention Facility.  (Id. ยถ 10.)  They also allege that other detainees were forced to \n9  work for no pay.  (Id. ยถ 13.)  Owino Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of โall civil immigration \n10  detainees  who  performed  Forced  Labor  uncompensated  work  for  CoreCivic  at  any \n11  Detention Facility owned or operated by it between November 2, 2004 to the applicable \n12  opt-out date, inclusive.โ  (Id. ยถ 30.) \n13  On December 27, 2017, Gonzalez Plaintiffs filed a second putative class action \n14  lawsuit against Defendant in the Southern District.  (โGonzalez Compl.,โ ECF No. 1.)  The \n15  case was transferred from Judge Anthony J. Battagliaโs calendar to this Court pursuant to \n16  Civil Local Rule 40.1.  The Gonzalez Plaintiffs, like Owino Plaintiffs, are former civil \n17  immigration detainees housed at Defendantโs Otay Mesa facility.  They allege that they \n18  received $1 or $1.50 a day for their labor at the detention facility.  The Gonzales Plaintiffs \n19  seek to certify classes, including โ[a]ll civil immigration detainees who performed work \n20  for CoreCivic at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in the Work Program within the past ten \n21  years.โ  (Id. ยถ 111.)  Gonzalez Plaintiffs now seek to consolidate the two class actions. \n22  LEGAL STANDARD \n23  Consolidation of actions is appropriate โ[i]f actions before the court involve a \n24  common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2).  A district court has broad \n25  discretion in determining whether to consolidate actions pending in the same district.  See \n26  Investors Research Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. Of Cal., 877 F.2d 777, 777 (9th \n27  Cir. 1989) (citing 9 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2383 \n28  (1971); and A/S J. Ludwig Mowinckles Rederi v. Tidewater Const. Co., 559 F.2d 928 (4th \n2 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.368   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  Cir. 1977)).  โIn determining whether to consolidate cases, a court should also weigh any \n2  time and effort saved by consolidation against any โinconvenience, delay, or expense that \n3  [consolidation] would cause.โโ Fialkov v. Celladon Corp., No. 15CV1458 AJB (DHB), \n4  2015 WL 11658717, at *2 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2015) (alteration in original) (citing Huene v. \n5  United States, 743 F.2d 703, 704 (9th Cir. 1984)). \n6  ANALYSIS \n7  All parties across both actions agree that the Owino and Gonzalez actions involve \n8  related facts and claims.  The parties diverge, however, on what steps the Court should take \n9  to manage its docket and proceed forward with this case and the Owino case.  Gonzalez \n10  Plaintiffs argue that their action involves common questions of law and fact such that \n11  consolidation of their action with the Owino action would be appropriate.  (See MTN 4.)1  \n12  Both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant argue that the Court should exercise its discretion to \n13  dismiss,  rather  than  consolidate,  the  Gonzalez  action  because  the  Gonzalez  action  is \n14  duplicative of the Owino action.  (Def Oppโn 11; Owino Oppโn 7.)  In response, Gonzalez \n15  Plaintiffs argue that dismissal of their action would be inappropriate because the two \n16  actions are not duplicative.  (Reply 6.)  The Court proceeds as follows.  First, the Court \n17  determines whether the Gonzalez action is duplicative of the Owino action.  Second, the \n18  Court determines which procedural action best serves the interests of judicial economy and \n19  preserves the rights of all parties going forward. \n20  I.  Whether the Gonzalez Action is Duplicative  \n21  As a threshold matter, the Court clarifies which rules or standards it applies in the \n22  analysis here.  There are three similar rules the Court could apply to the issue before the \n23  Court.  The Gonzalez Plaintiffs urge the Court apply Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42, \n24  which permits the Court to consolidate actions involving โcommon question of law or \n25  fact.โ  The Owino Plaintiffs would have the Court adopt a โfirst-to-fileโ rule, which applies \n26  when two similar actions are filed in different federal courts.  Defendant submits the rule \n27 \n                                                                 \n28 \n1 Pin citations refer to the page numbers electronically stamped on the EM/CMF filings. \n3 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.369   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  against claim splitting applies, which courts invoke when a plaintiff files two actions \n2  against the same defendant based on the same facts.  District courts in this circuit have \n3  analyzed duplicative class actions under both the first-to-file rule, see Weinstein v. Metlife, \n4  Inc., No. C 06-4444 SI, 2006 WL 3201045, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2006), and the claim-\n5  splitting rule, see Chowning v. Kohlโs Depโt Stores, Inc., No. CV 15-8673 RGK (SPx), \n6  2016 WL 7655752, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2016).  The Court applies the claim-splitting \n7  rule because the first-to-file rule applies to cases between different districts.  See Moore v. \n8  Roadway Express, Inc., No. CV 09-1588, 2009 WL 10670954, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 7, \n9  2009). \n10  โDistrict courts retain broad discretion to control their dockets and โ[i]n the exercise \n11  of  that  power  they  may  impose  sanctions  including,  where  appropriate,  default  or \n12  dismissal.โโ  Adams v. Cal. Depโt of Health Servs., 487 F.3d 684, 688 (9th Cir. 2007) \n13  (alteration in original) (quoting Thompson v. Hous. Auth. of City of L.A., 782 F.2d 829, 831 \n14  (9th Cir. 1986) (per curiam); and citing Link v. Wabash R.R., 370 U.S. 626, 629โ30 (1962)), \n15  abrogated in part by Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 904 (2008).  โPlaintiffs generally \n16  have โno right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the \n17  same time in the same court and against the same defendant.โโ  Id. (quoting Walton v. Eaton \n18  Corp., 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc)). \n19  To determine whether a suit is duplicative, courts apply the test for claim preclusion.  \n20  See The Haytian Republic, 154 U.S. 118, 124 (1894).  This is a two-part standard.  Thus, a \n21  court must first determine whether the causes of action and relief sought in the two suits \n22  are identical.  Adams, 487 F.3d at 689.  Then a court determines whether the parties, or \n23  their privies, are the same.  Id. \n24  A. Same Causes of Action \n25  To determine whether two causes of action are similar, courts apply a transactional \n26  test.  Id.  โWhether two events are part of the same transaction or series depends on whether \n27  they are related to the same set of facts and whether they could conveniently be tried \n28  together.โ  Id. (quoting W. Sys., Inc. v. Ulloa, 958 F.2d 864, 871 (9th Cir. 1992); and citing \n4 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.370   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  Restatement (Second) of Judgments ยง 24(1) (1982)).  Courts examine four criteria: \n2  (1) whether rights or interests established in the prior judgment \nwould be destroyed or impaired by prosecution of the second \n3 \naction; (2) whether substantially the same evidence is presented \n4  in the two actions; (3) whether the two suits involve infringement \nof the same right; and (4) whether the two suits arise out of the \n5 \nsame transactional nucleus of facts. \n6   \n7  Id. (quoting Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201โ02 (9th Cir. 1982)).  \n8  โThe last of these criteria is the most important.โ  Constantini, 681 F.2d at 1202. \n9  Gonzalez Plaintiffs argue that while the two actions involve substantially similar \n10  questions of fact and law such that consolidation is appropriate the claims are not identical.  \n11  (Reply 7.)  According to Gonzalez Plaintiffs, their Complaint brings five causes of action \n12  compared to the twelve โscattershotโ causes of action brought by Owino Plaintiffs.  (Id.)  \n13  Gonzalez Plaintiffs also point to at least two factual differences: they allege that some \n14  members of the putative class were paid more than $1 a day and they allege that Defendant \n15  obtains labor through unlawful means.  (Id.) \n16  Both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant explain, in detail, the commonality between \n17  the two suits.  For example, both the Gonzalez and Owino Plaintiffs allege that Defendant \n18  pays civil detainees who voluntarily participate in work programs less than the minimum \n19  wage, (Def. Oppโn 7 (comparing Gonzalez Compl. ยถยถ 40โ47, 127, 132 with Owino Compl. \n20  ยถยถ 11, 13โ15, 73, 123)), and that Defendant coerces or forces detainees to work under threat \n21  of solitary confinement or loss of privileges, (id. (comparing Gonzalez Compl. ยถยถ 8, 32, \n22  38โ39, 147โ48, 153โ54 with Owino Compl. ยถยถ 13, 16, 42, 47, 57โ59)).  Both Owino \n23  Plaintiffs and Defendant point to Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ own Motion to Consolidate where \n24  Gonzalez Plaintiffs argue โboth Actions seek to stop the economic exploitation and abuse \n25  of detainees at the Otay Mesa Facility, to recover unpaid wages, and to remedy unjust \n26  enrichment resulting from CoreCivicโs unlawful failure to pay its detainee workforce legal \n27  wages.โ  (Id. (quoting MTN 5); see Owino Oppโn 10โ11.)  Finally, both cases bring causes \n28  of action sounding in violation of the same laws and both cases ask for similar relief.  (Def. \n5 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.371   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  Oppโn 9โ10.) \n2  The Court agrees with Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant.  Both cases arise from the \n3  same transactional nucleus of fact.  Both cases argue that Defendant is not following \n4  California minimum wage laws and both cases argue that Defendant coerces its detainees \n5  to participate in a work program at its Otay Mesa detention facility.  Both cases bring \n6  similar causes of action and request similar relief.  Indeed, the entire bases for Gonzalez \n7  Plaintiffsโ Motion of Consolidation are the common questions of law and fact.  The test is \n8  not, as Gonzalez Plaintiffs suggest, whether the two cases are exactly identical.  The test is \n9  transactional.  Here, it is clearly metโthe facts are duplicative. \n10  B. Same Parties \n11  At this point, the Courtโs analysis must diverge from Adams.  The Adams court asked \n12  whether a party in an earlier-filed action could be said to have โvirtually representedโ a \n13  party in a later-filed action.  487 F.3d at 691.  The Supreme Court has since made clear that \n14  โvirtual representationโ is not consonant with the claim preclusion test.  See Taylor, 553 \n15  U.S. at 901.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs direct the Court to the Supreme Courtโs decision in Smith \n16  v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S. 299 (2011), which concerned the preclusive effect of an earlier-\n17  filed class action on a later filed class action.  The Supreme Court explained that for claim \n18  preclusion to apply the later filed suit must have presented the same issues as the prior case \n19  and the later filed plaintiff must have been a party to the earlier-filed suit or else fall within \n20  one of a few discrete exceptions to the general rule against binding nonparties.  See id. at \n21  307โ08.  The Supreme Court held that โ[n]either a proposed class action nor a rejected \n22  class action may bind nonparties.โ  Id. at 315. \n23  Here, the Owino Plaintiffs have not been certified as a class under Federal Rule of \n24  Civil Procedure 23.  Instead, Owino is a proposed class action.  The Court agrees with \n25  Gonzalez Plaintiffs that the Owino action cannot bind nonparties, like Gonzalez Plaintiffs.  \n26  See Bayer, 553 U.S. at 315.  Because the Owino action does not have preclusive effect \n27  against the Gonzalez Plaintiffs, the claim-splitting rule must also fail.  See Chowning, 2016 \n28  WL 7655752, at *3 (applying Bayer to find earlier-filed class action that was rejected in \n6 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.372   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  part was not binding on later-filed class action and declining to dismiss later-filed action).  \n2  The Court finds that dismissing the Gonzalez action is not appropriate at this time, given \n3  the early stage of the Owino action and that its class has not been certified. \n4  II.  Consolidation vs. Stay \n5    While the claim-splitting rule is not appropriate at this time, such a finding does not \n6  resolve the issue before the Court: how to proceed with two nearly identical putative class \n7  actions.  The district court in Moreno v. Castlerock Farming & Transport, No. CIV-F-12-\n8  0556 AWI JLT, 2013 WL 1326496 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2013), encountered a similar issue.  \n9  There, two putative class actions were pending before the same court; neither class action \n10  had been certified.  Id. at *1.  The district court reasoned that the scope of the putative class \n11  in the earlier-filed action would depend greatly on an order granting or denying class \n12  certification.  Id. at *2.  Further, the later-filed class would depend on the scope of the \n13  earlier-filed class.  The court stated:  \n14  If the class in [the earlier-filed action] is certified as narrow, then \nthe [later-filed] Plaintiffs can move forward to represent all other \n15 \nworkers  at  [the  defendantโs]  facilities.    Indeed,  all  pre-class \n16  certification discovery received by [earlier-filed plaintiff] could \nbe directly given to the [later-filed] Plaintiffs to save time and \n17 \neffort in that circumstance.  If the class certified in [the earlier-\n18  filed action] is wide, then [the later-filed action] would probably \nbe  considered  duplicative  and  subject  to  dismissal.    If  class \n19 \ncertification is denied for some other reason not having to do \n20  with  [the  earlier-filed  plaintiffโs]  status,  then  [the  later-filed \naction] may or may not be able to proceed depending upon the \n21 \nspecific circumstance. \n22   \n23  Id. (citing Bayer, 564 U.S. at 314). \n24  The Moreno courtโs reasoning and conclusion are persuasive.  Here, the Owino \n25  Plaintiffs  seek  to  certify  sub-classes  potentially  broader  in  scope  than  the  Gonzalez \n26  Plaintiffs.  For example, both lawsuits endeavor to certify a civil detainee sub-class who \n27  performed work for less than Californiaโs minimum wage.   The Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ \n28  putative minimum wage sub-class is limited to all detainees who performed work for \n7 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.373   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  Defendant at the Otay Mesa Detention Center within the past ten years.  (Gonzalez Compl. \n2  ยถ 111a.)  The Owino Plaintiffsโ putative minimum wage sub-class covers all detainees at \n3  any facility located in California owned or operated by Defendant between November 2, \n4  2004 and the applicable opt-out date.  (Owino Compl. ยถ 30.)  The remaining sub-classes \n5  follow similar limitations: the Gonzalez Plaintiffs limit the classes to only the Otay Mesa \n6  facility for the past ten years; the Owino Plaintiffs limit the classes to any Defendant-owned \n7  facility in California since 2004.  (Compare Gonzalez Compl. ยถ 111 with Owino Compl. \n8  ยถ 30.) \n9  Thus, the Owino Plaintiffs could potentially certify a broad class that subsumes the \n10  Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ class.  Or, the Owino Plaintiffs could certify a narrower class that does \n11  not include the putative Gonzalez class.  At the pre-certification stage, the Court cannot \n12  determine the size or composition of a class in either case.  Like Moreno, a stay appears to \n13  be the equitable solution.  See also Clardy v. Pinnacle Foods Grp., LLC, No. 16-cv-4385-\n14  JST, 2017 WL 57310 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2017) (staying later-filed class action). \n15  The other course of action is to consolidate the cases.  Certainly, the Gonzalez \n16  Plaintiffs strongly advocate for this outcome.  Yet, both Owino Plaintiffs and Defendant \n17  object to consolidation.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs warns that โit would be an abuse of discretion \n18  to appoint an attorney as class counsel solely because he may have won the race to the \n19  courthouse.โ  (Reply 6 (quoting Northstar Fin. Advisors Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 779 F.3d \n20  1036, 1048 (9th Cir. 2015)).)  Indeed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) lays out \n21  objective standards to determine appointment of lead class counsel.  Appointment of \n22  interim class counsel, however, is not the issue presently before the Court.  The issue here \n23  is whether to consolidate or whether to stayโnot appointment of interim class counsel.  \n24  Courts have the power to stay proceedings sua sponte.  Ali v Trump, 241 F. Supp. \n25  3d 1147, 1152 (W.D. Wash. 2017); Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Karma, No. 14-00137 \n26  ACK-KSC, 2016 WL 922780, at *8โ9 (D. Haw. Mar. 9, 2016).  The issues involved in the \n27  pending proceedings need not be โcontrolling of the action before the courtโ for the court \n28  to issue a stay.  Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 864 (9th Cir. 1979).  \n8 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.374   Page 9 of 10\n \n1  Indeed, for a court to issue a stay, the parties in the two cases need not be the same and the \n2  issues need not be identical.  See Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). \n3  In determining whether to grant a motion to stay, โthe competing interests [that] will \n4  be affected by the granting or refusal to grant a stay must be weighed.โ  Lockyer v. Mirant \n5  Corp., 398 F.3d 1098, 1110 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 F.2d 265, 268 \n6  (9th Cir. 1962)).  Those interests include: (1) โthe possible damage which may result from \n7  the granting of a stay,โ (2) โthe hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being \n8  required to go forward,โ and (3) โthe orderly course of justice measured in terms of the \n9  simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and questions of law which could be expected \n10  to result from a stay.โ  Id.  \n11  Here, the Court again finds the Moreno courtโs reasoning persuasive as to the first \n12  and second factors.  If the class in Owino is certified as narrow then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs \n13  can move forward to represent all other detainees at Defendantโs facilities.  All pre-class \n14  certification discovery received by Owino Plaintiffs could, in theory, be given to Gonzalez \n15  Plaintiffs to save time and effort.  If the class certified in Owino is wide, then Gonzalez \n16  would probably be considered duplicative and subject to dismissal.  If class certification is \n17  denied for a reason beyond Owino Plaintiffsโ status then Gonzalez Plaintiffs may or may \n18  not be able to proceed.  See Moreno, 2013 WL 1326496, at *2.  The Court recognizes there \n19  is some possibility of damage to the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโif the Owino Plaintiffs certify a \n20  narrow class or their claim is dismissed then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs suffer from the delay \n21  in litigating.  However, the potential damage to the Gonzalez Plaintiffs is mitigated, in part, \n22  because the Court will only stay their proceedings until resolution of the Owino Plaintiffsโ \n23  class certification.2  As to the second factor, the Court finds the hardship on all parties to \n24  be significant if parallel litigation is allowed to proceed on the same issues and the same \n25  Defendant.  On the other hand, the hardship on the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ is measured in the \n26 \n                                                                 \n27 \n2 This assumes that the Owino Plaintiffs reach the class certification stage. If Defendant prevails on its \nmotion to dismiss or some other unforeseen event occurs then the Gonzalez Plaintiffs may request \n28 \nappropriate relief from the stay. \n9 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-NLS   Document 44   Filed 04/04/18   PageID.375   Page 10 of 10\n \n1  potential delay in resolving their rights.  As to the third factor, all parties agree that the \n2  Court  should  simplify  the  issues  by  eliminating  the  parallel  proceedings,  either  by \n3  consolidation or by stay or dismissal.  In sum, the Court finds that the Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ \n4  interest is outweighed by the potential claim-splitting concerns as well as judicial economy. \n5  The Court is under no illusion as to the stakes of this Motion.  Gonzalez Plaintiffs \n6  filed a nearly identical cause of action as the Owino Plaintiffs, seek to consolidate the cases, \n7  and wrest control of interim class counsel from the Owino Plaintiffs.  Owino Plaintiffs and \n8  Defendant seek to dismiss the later-filed action as duplicative to send a strong message \n9  against copy-cat filings.  The truth lies somewhere in between.  Thus, the Court exercises \n10  its discretion to chart a course between the two positions.  The Court will stay this case \n11  pending the outcome of Owino Plaintiffsโ future class certification.  At such a time, the \n12  Gonzalez Plaintiffs may request appropriate relief from the stay. \n13  CONCLUSION \n14  For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Gonzalez Plaintiffsโ Motion to \n15  Consolidate, (ECF No. 23).  On its own motion, the Court STAYS the present case until it \n16  rules on class certification (or other dispositive motions, such as a motion to dismiss with \n17  prejudice) in Owino. \n18    IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n19 \nDated:  April 4, 2018   \n20 \n   \n21   \n \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (NLS) ",

No. 51) \n14 \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,   \n15   \nPlaintiffs, \n16 \nv. \n17 \nCORECIVIC, INC., \n18 \nDefendant. \n19 \n \n20  Presently before the Court is the Partiesโ Joint Status Report (โJSR,โ ECF No. 51).  \n21  For the reasons stated below, the Court CONTINUES ITS STAY of the instant action. \n22  BACKGROUND \n23  This case involves allegations that Defendant CoreCivic, Inc. undercompensated \n24  some civil immigration detainees and forced others to work while detained.  See ECF No. \n25  44 (the โOrderโ) at 5.  The Court previously stayed this action pending the resolution of \n26  class certification in a related case, Owino v. CoreCivic, Inc., 17-CV-1112.  Order at 9โ10.  \n27  After the Court certified the Owino class, the Court asked the Parties to file a joint status \n28  report outlining their anticipated next steps in this litigation.  See ECF No. 50.   \n1 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-SBC   Document 52   Filed 09/28/23   PageID.392   Page 2 of 3\n \n1  In the JSR, Plaintiffs indicate that they โunderstand that they are members in the \n2  Owino [c]lass.โ  JSR at 2.  The Parties therefore โintend to wait for the Owino [a]ction to \n3  proceed  to  its  completionโ  to  take  further  action,  reasoning  that  litigating  this  case \n4  alongside Owino risks the โwaste of judicial resources and/or prejudice [to either] partyโs \n5  position.โ  See id.  Thus, the Court must determine whether to continue its previous stay. \n6  LEGAL STANDARD \n7  The Court may stay an action pending resolution of independent proceedings where \n8  โit is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties.โ  Leyva v. Certified \n9  Grocers of Cal., Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863 (9th Cir. 1979).  When determining whether a stay \n10  is appropriate, the Court must consider (1) โthe possible damage which may result from \n11  the granting of a stay,โ (2) โthe hardship or inequity which a party may suffer in being \n12  required to go forward,โ and (3) โthe simplifying or complicating of issues, proof, and \n13  questions of law which could be expected to result from a stay.โ  CMAX, Inc. v. Hall, 300 \n14  F.2d 265, 268 (9th Cir. 1962).   \n15  ANALYSIS \n16  In the instant action, the above factors weigh in favor of a continued stay.  First, \n17  because Plaintiffs assert that they can obtain relief as members of the Owino class, staying \n18  this case will not delay any potential recovery by Plaintiffs.  See JSR at 2.  Maintaining the \n19  stay will not damage Defendant for a similar reason; if Plaintiffs indeed obtain relief \n20  through the Owino action, that relief โwould satisfy the claims in this action.โ  See id.   \n21  Moreover, because this action and the Owino action involve the same or intertwined \n22  facts, witnesses, and legal claims, proceeding with this case would result in duplicative \n23  discovery, added complexity, and increased litigation costs for both parties.  See Order at \n24  6, 9.  By contrast, continuing the stay in this action will allow the parties in Owino to \n25  resolve those shared legal and factual issues, which will simplify this action should it \n26  resume.  Thus, the second and third factors both weigh in favor of a stay.   \n27  / / / \n28  / / / \n2 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (SBC) \n\nCase 3:17-cv-02573-JLS-SBC   Document 52   Filed 09/28/23   PageID.393   Page 3 of 3\n \n1  CONCLUSION \n2  The Court therefore CONTINUES ITS STAY of the instant action pending the \n3  resolution of Owino.  The Parties SHALL FILE a joint status report, not to exceed ten (10) \n4  pages, within fourteen (14) days of the resolution of Owino.  Should Owino proceed in a \n5  manner that is unsatisfactory to either Party, that Party may move to lift the Courtโs stay \n6  after conferring with the opposing Party.   \n7    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n8  Dated:  September 28, 2023   \n9     \n \n10 \n \n11 \n \n12   \n \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n3 \n17-CV-2573 JLS (SBC) ",
