    "summary": "<p>Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1881a, permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008]</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On March 27, 2018, DOJ and ODNI submitted their annual certifications for 2018. The 2018 Certifications reauthorized certifications under section 702 that the government had submitted on September 26, 2016, as 2016 Certifications. The filing of 2018 Certifications meant that the 2016 Certifications would remain in effect, even past their expiration date of April 26, 2018, until the Court approved or denied the 2018 Certifications.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, 2018, the FISC issued an opinion and order addressing the 2018 Certifications. 402 F.Supp.3d 45. FISC Judge James E. Boasberg granted in part and denied in part the requested approval for the amended certifications. 402 F.Supp.3d 45 (2018).</p>\r\n<p>In outlining the procedural history of the 2018 Certifications, Judge Boasberg touched on the Court's initial concerns with the 2018 Certifications. These were:</p>\r\n<p>1) exemptions in the querying and minimization procedures that seemed unreasonably broad under the Fourth Amendment and FISA's definition of minimization procedures;</p>\r\n<p>2) under the querying procedures, the FBI would keep records of all queries, but those records would not include whether the query was associated with a United States person and thus this practice appeared to violate the statutory requirement that the querying procedures keep a record of each United States person used for a query; and</p>\r\n<p>3) the querying procedures did not require FBI personnel to document the basis for finding that each United States person query term satisfied the relevant standard.</p>\r\n<p>In response, the government amended their certifications on September 18, 2018. The new certifications 1) narrowed the scope of exemptions; 2) did not alter the FBI's record keeping requirements, but addressed the potential operation consequences of more stringent record keeping requirements; and 3) included supplemental procedures for \"categorical batch queries\" where subjection to exceptions, the FBI would be required to seek written approval before reviewing information retried in a categorical batch query.</p>\r\n<p>In Part II of the opinion, Judge Boasberg addressed whether the certifications contained the elements required by Section 702(h). He found that the 2018 Certifications contained all the necessary statutory elements.</p>\r\n<p>In Part III of the opinion, Judge Boasberg addressed the targeting procedures and issues related to the scope of acquisitions. Section 702(d)(1) requires \"targeting procedures to be 'reasonably designed' to 'ensure that any acquisition . . . is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States.'\" This part of the opinion is largely redacted. The reasoning is unclear due to the redactions, but Judge Boasberg found that proposed targeting procedures satisfied the requirements of the statute and are consistent with the Fourth Amendment in that they were reasonably designed to avoid acquisitions of non-target communications. He also approved the proposed scope of acquisitions. Judge Boasberg also adopted recommendations from amici curiae. These included the government reporting what percentage of communications acquired did not stem from a Section 702 target. Amici curiae also recommended the the Court periodically brief Congress. Judge Boasberg chose not to adopt this recommendation, finding that \"the Court sees no need to dictate the terms of executive-branch disclosures to Congress,\" and if Congress sought additional information they could seek that information through the legislative process. The statute set forth for accomplishing acquisitions under Section 702 authorized the AG and DNI to direct an electronic communication service to provide the Government with all information \"necessary to accomplish the acquisition in a manner that [would] protect the secrecy of the acquisition.\" An \"electronic communication service provider\" refers to: 1) a telecommunications carrier; 2) a provider of electronic communication service; and 3) any other communication service provider with access to electronic communications or wire.</p>\r\n<p>In his discussion of the targeting procedures, Judge Boasberg briefly discussed six limitations on acquisitions authorized under Section 702. Two of these stated that an acquisition \"may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\" Three of the limitations prohibit the intentional targeting of persons under particular circumstances, such as anyone known to be in the U.S. or a U.S. person reasonably believed to be outside of the country. The last limitation requires acquisitions to be conducted in a way that is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>In Part IV of the opinion, Judge Boasberg addressed the querying procedures and minimization procedures proposed. He found that the FBI's querying procedures did not comply with the requirements set forth by Section 702(f)(1)(B) to keep records of U.S. persons query terms used. The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act, passed in 2017, required FISC to review government adopted querying procedures. The 2018 Certifications were the first certifications subject to this requirement. The querying procedures had to be consistent with the Fourth Amendment and stipulate a procedure for record keeping of each United States person query term (query is the \"use of one or more terms to retrieve the unminimized contents or noncontents located in electronic and data storage systems of communications of or concerning United States persons obtained\"). The Reauthorization Act also amended Section 702 to require the government to obtain a FISC order before being allowed to access Section 702 acquired information under certain circumstances. This amendment only applied to the FBI and was limited to circumstances in which a query was made of a United States person, a query of a United States person that was not intended to extract foreign intelligence, and only to criminal investigations that did not relate to national security. Furthermore, the FBI did not need a FISC order if the FBI determined there was a reasonable belief that the information sought could assist in mitigating a threat to life or serious bodily harm. Within his discussion, Judge Boasberg found that the FBI's practice of not distinguishing between U.S. persons and other persons in their query terms was not consistent with Section 702. The Government argued that requiring FBI to distinguish between U.S. persons and foreign persons in record keeping would lead to an inefficient use of resources and poor record keeping within the FBI. Judge Boasberg was not moved by this argument, asserting that it was not for the Court to consider policy considerations in lieu of a clear statutory command. At the conclusion of Judge Boasberg's discussion of the procedures, he conceded that FISC was not mandating that the FBI immediately issue a new means of creating appropriate records, but rather take significant steps towards a new record keeping system.</p>\r\n<p>The intention of the querying standards is to avoid acquiring irrelevant information from United States persons. The court found that the FBI has not complied with the querying standard. From April 2017 to October 2019, the government reported a large number of FBI queries that were not likely to produce foreign-intelligence information or criminal evidence. While much of it is redacted, the court briefly outlined the degree to which the FBI acquired information. From March 24-27, the FBI conducted queries for more than 70,000 communication facilities that were associated with persons with access to FBI facilities and systems. They proceeded with these acquisitions even though the FBI Office of General Counsel had advised that they should not be conducted without approval by that office and the National Security Division of the DOJ. On December 1, 2017, the FBI conducted more than 6,800 queries using Social Security Numbers. The government alleges that these queries stemmed from misunderstandings by some FBI personnel about what \"reasonably likely to return foreign intelligence information\" meant. There were also a number of other non-compliant queries reported by the FBI. These include instances where FBI personnel conducted queries for personal reasons, such as running queries on themselves, other FBI employees, and relatives. The Court explicitly noted that they were less concerned with these types of queries compared to instances where the querying standard was misunderstand, because \"it would be difficult to completely prevent personnel from querying data for personal reasons.\" Judge Boasberg outlined three factors in his concern about the large number of queries showing a misunderstanding of the querying standard: 1) limits on the government's oversight procedures; 2) the FBI's policy of encouraging routine and maximal querying of Section 702 information, and 3) complications in applying the querying standard.</p>\r\n<p>In his discussion of limited oversight, Judge Boasberg summarized the process of governmental oversight of the FBI's querying procedures. The Office of Intelligence (OI), a subsidiary of the National Security Division within the DOJ, visited about half of the FBI's field offices annually for oversight purposes. Because OI tends to focus on offices that use FISA authorities more, some offices do not receive oversight visits for periods of two years or more, leading to lengthy delays in detecting violations and reporting them to FISC. The statement is redacted, but it appears that in one instance an office \"had been conducting improper queries in a training context since 2011, but the practice was not discovered until 2017.\" The OI usually reviewed queries taken during a specific interval of time. Within these query records, the FBI failed to distinguish U.S. person queries, to document their reasoning for conducting the query, and to record whether a query was intended to return evidence pertaining to foreign-intelligence or criminal activity. Thus, the OI reviewed only a small batch of queries which often lacked the basic necessary information to identify violating queries. Judge Boasberg concluded that it was \"entirely possible that further querying violations involving large numbers of U.S. person query terms have escaped the attention of overseers and have not been reported to the Court.\"</p>\r\n<p>In his discussion of the FBI's practice of encouraging personnel to maximize querying information, Judge Boasberg outlined the tension in the FBI's policy of maximizing use of queries and Section 702's requirement that queries be used only in circumstances satisfying the querying standard. Judge Boasberg conceded that this policy may help FBI personnel in their goals of protecting national security, but also acknowledged that it likely created an environment where misapplications of the query standard were more likely to occur. Judge Boasberg concluded that the minimizations procedures were not compliant with the statute or the Fourth Amendment. The court also concluded that under a Totality of Circumstances standard, where a court balances the intrusion on individual privacy against how necessary it is for the government's interest, that the procedures were still not consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>In its 2018 Certifications, the government also proposed they be allowed to indefinitely retain metadata from 702 acquisitions and unminimized. In regards to the metadata, Judge Boasberg required that the government explicitly define what they considered to be metadata and the extent to which the data could reveal location information of U.S. persons. Judge Boasberg stipulated in his conclusion that the government had to submit a report describing what it viewed as metadata and to what extent that data could reveal location information about U.S. persons.</p>\r\n<p>Following the 2018 Opinion, on November 15, 2018, the government appealed FISC's finding that a technical procedure was needed to record whether a query term was a United States person query term and the finding that the FBI's proposed querying and minimization procedures did not comply with FISA and the Fourth Amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. On November 16, 2018, the court granted a stay of the implementation of FISC's deficiency orders that would have precluded the FBI from conduction Section 702 queries. The government contested the finding in regards to the record keeping on the same grounds, namely that it would deplete necessary resources.</p>\r\n<p>FISC appeals are decided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (the FISCR). On July 12, 2019, FISCR Judges Cabranes, Tallman, and Sentelle affirmed in part the October 2018 order. In re DNI/AG 702(h) Certifications 2018, 941 F.3d 547 (FISCR 2010). They held that the proposed querying standards did not comply with Section 702 because they did not include procedures for record keeping of U.S. person querying terms. As to whether the querying and minimization procedures complied with FISA and the Fourth Amendment, the court declined to answer because their holding regarding the record keeping would necessitate that the Government amend the procedures anyways. The order also stipulated that the November 16, 2018 stay would stay in effect until FISC issued an opinion concerning the amended procedures.</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2019, the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence amended the 2018 Certifications. The amended querying procedures required that: 1) the query records differentiate between U.S. person query terms and all other terms; 2) the FBI record a written justification stating why a U.S. person query was likely to retrieve criminal or foreign intelligence information before reviewing the contents returned; and 3) that the FBI make available these records to enable oversight. FISCR Judges Cabranes, Tallman, and Sentelle held that these changes were sufficient to comply with Section 702 and the Fourth Amendment. A redacted version of the opinion is available <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/NS-DC-0133-0008.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a> They granted the approval of the 2018 Certifications, contingent on the government submitting a written report detailing the implementation of the new record keeping procedures.</p>",

Such information shall be clearly identified in NCTC systems and \nrecords as information that was acquired pursuant to FISA and that is subject to these \nprocedures.  These procedures do not limit the time period for which NCTC may retain \nsuch information.  Information that is evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed, but is not foreign intelligence information, may only be retained \nor disseminated for law enforcement purposes. \n4.  (U)  Any information received by NCTC that is acquired through the targeting of a \nperson who at the time of targeting was reasonably believed to be a non-United States \nperson located outside the United States but is in fact located inside the United States at \nthe time such information is acquired or is subsequently determined to be a United States \nperson will be promptly destroyed upon recognition, unless the Director ofNCTC \nspecifically determines in writing that each specific item of acquired information to be \nretained is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information or \nevidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be committed. \n5.  (U)  NCTC may temporarily retain specific section 702-acquired information that would \notherwise have to be destroyed under these procedures, ifNSD determines that such \ninformation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  Such determination shall be made in writing \nand shall identify the specific information to be retained and the particular litigation for \nwhich it is retained.  Personnel unconnected to the particular litigation matter shall not \naccess the raw section 702-acquired information that is being temporarily retained for \nsuch litigation matter.  Personnel shall only access the information being retained for \nlitigation-related reasons on a case-by-case basis after consultation with NSD.  Once \nsection 702-acquired information is no longer reasonably believed to be necessary for, or \npotentially discoverable in, such litigation matters, the information shall be promptly \ndestroyed pursuant to these procedures.  Each year, NCTC will provide NSD with a \nsummary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating \npreservation of section 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a \ndestruction requirement pursuant to these procedures, (b) a description of the section 702-\nacquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and (c) if possible, based \non the information available to NCTC, a description of the status of each such litigation \nmatter. \n-\n1 (U) In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked selector is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n6 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 6 of 15 NCTC's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, March 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(U)  NCTC may retain specific section 702-acquired information subject to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures ifNSD determines that such \ninformation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  NCTC will provide NSD with a summary of: \n(a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of \nsection 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures, (b) a description ofthe section \n702-acquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and ( c) if possible, \nbased on the information available to NCTC, a description ofthe status of each such \nlitigation matter.  NSD will promptly notify and subsequently seek authorization from the \nFISC to retain the information as appropriate and consistent with law.  NCTC will restrict \naccess to and retain such information in the manner described in the paragraph above \nuntil either the FISC denies a government request for authorization to retain the \ninformation or the Department of Justice notifies NCTC in writing that such information \nis no longer required to be preserved for such litigation matters.  After receiving such \nnotice, NCTC shall promptly destroy such section 702-acquired information. \nC.  (U)  PROCESSING \n1.

The government's request for approval of the amended certifications and \nprocedures is granted for the reasons stated herein. \nI. BACKGROUND\nThe Court previously reviewed  ertifications executed by the Attorney General and \nthe Director of National Intelligence pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, as amended, codified at 50 U. S.C. § 1881a : \n\"the 2018 Certifications\").  See Mem. Op. and Order, Oct. 18, 2018 (\"October 18, 2018, \nOpinion\").  The 2018 Certifications authorize the acquisition of foreign-intelligence information \npursuant to the targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and querying procedures adopted \ntherein.  See id. at 3-4, 6-8.  They also amend earlier certifications to apply the accompanying \nminimization procedures and querying procedures to the handling of information acquired \npursuant thereto.  Id. at 9.  (Those prior certifications were reviewed by the FISC in Docket \n- -\nTOP QEOltilTX0l#OftOOftf'J  fOFQIVI  Page 2 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 2 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nare collectively referred to as \"the Prior 702 Dockets.\") \nThe Court approved the government's certifications and procedures in most respects. \nSpecifically, the Court found that (1) the 2018 Certifications, as well as the prior certifications, as \namended, contained all the required statutory elements; (2) the targeting procedures were \nconsistent with the requirements of Section 702(d ) and of the Fourth Amendment; (3) the \nminimization procedures and querying procedures to be implemented by the National Security \nAgency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Counterterrorism Center under the \n2018 Certifications were consistent with the requirements of Section 702( e) and Section \n702(f)(l)(A)-(B) respectively and of the Fourth Amendment; and (4) with respect to information \nacquired under the prior certifications, the minimization procedures to be implemented by NSA, \nthe CIA, and NCTC (including as referenced therein the requirements of the respective agencies' \nquerying procedures) were consistent with the requirements of Section 702(e) and of the Fourth \nAmendment.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion at 132. \nThe Court found two deficiencies, however, regarding procedures to be implemented by \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation under the 2018 Certifications: ( l) the FBI querying \nprocedures were inconsistent with the requirements of Section 702(f)(l)(B) to keep records of \neach United States-person query term used to query Section 702 information, id. at 52-62, 133; \nand (2) the FBI minimization procedures and querying procedures were inconsistent with the \nrequirements of Section 702(e) and Section 702(f)(l)(A) respectively and of the Fourth \nrror SECRE'fh'BliYORCON�OPOftl'll  Page 3 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 3 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\n1i8 P   819 @Mlf;l:'Eilti;l8ft@Otiilff O  IJOIV!f \nAmendment because they did not require adequate documentation of the justifications for queries \nthat use United States-person query terms, id. at 133-34.  With respect to information acquired \nunder the Prior 702 Dockets, the Court found that the FBI minimization procedures (including as \nreferenced therein the FBI querying procedures) were inconsistent with the requirements of \nSection 702(e) and of the Fourth Amendment because they did not require adequate \ndocumentation of the justifications for queries that use United States-person query terms.  Id.  In \nother respects, the Court approved the FBI querying procedures and minimization procedures. \nId. at 133.  The Court directed the government, pursuant to Section 702(j)(3)(B), either (l) to \ncorrect the identified deficiencies within 30 days, or (2) to cease, or not begin, the \nimplementation of the FBI minimization procedures and querying procedures, insofar as such \nimplementation involved those deficiencies.  See Docket Nos \nOrders issued on Oct. 18, 2018, at 3. \nThe government appealed those orders to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of \nReview on November 15, 2018. See Docket No  n re DNI/AG 702(h) Certifications \nPredecessor Certification s at 21 (FISCR July 12, 2019) (per \ncuriam) (\"In re DNI/A  G Certifications\").  On November 16, 2018, the FISCR granted the \ngovernment's request \"to stay the implementation of those aspects\" of the FISC's orders \"that \nwould preclude the FBI from conducting queries of Section 702 information\" while the appeal \nwas pending.  Id. at 21 n.60. \nIn an opinion issued on July 12, 2019, the FISCR affirmed the FISC's finding that the \nFBI querying procedures were inconsistent with the recordkeeping requirement of Section \n'fOP SECRE'f/fSIHORCONi'NOFOR..\"\"i  Page4 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 4 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n-\nIOI■ S ECl&f))3£)6fl€51()1tbl bl6It- \niil \n702(f)(l)(B).  See  at 4-5, 22-38, 42-43.  The FISCR did not reach whether, as the FISC had \nfound, the FBI's procedures also were deficient because they did not require adequate \ndocumentation of the justifications for queries that use United States-person query terms. See id. \nat 38, 43. The FISCR declined to reach that issue because its holding regarding Section \n702(f)(l)(B) \"will require the Government to amend the proposed procedures.\" Id. at 38. The \nFISCR explained that, \n[a  ]s the Government undertakes the required revisions, it can consider whether -\nand, if so, how -to respond to the statutory and constitutional deficiencies the \nFISC identified.  The FISC will then be able to evaluate whether the newly \nrevised procedures -which will include, at a minimum, a procedure that complies \nwith Section 702(f)(l)(B)-comport with the requirements of FISA and the \nFourth Amendment. \nId. at 4-5.  Finally, the stay imposed on November 16, 2018, remains \"in effect until further order \nof the FISC when it issues a decision approving or declining to approve ... newly revised \nprocedures.\"  Id. at 43. \nIn order to address this Court's findings of deficiencies, which were affirmed or otherwise \nleft intact on appeal, the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence amended the \n2018 Certifications.  The August 12, 2019, Submission includes an Amendment \nwhich authorize the FBI to use revised querying procedures.  (No other changes are effected by \nthose amendments.)  Each amendment is accompanied by: \n(1)revised FBI querying procedures, which appear at Exhibit I to each amended\ncertification (\"Revised FBI Querying Procedures\"); and\n-\nTOP SEGPFT'.'.SJ((QPGOtl0IOFOPN  Page 5 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release   Page 5 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n-\n-\n• \nIb  i SECNEt;;i:,t,;OftCOfVUOPOMf \n(2)a supporting affidavit of the Director of the FBI.

The amended certifications and the \nRevised FBI Querying Procedures are now before the Court for review pursuant to Section \n702U). \nII. THE REVISED FBI QUERYING PROCEDURES\nThe Revised FBI Querying Procedures incorporate the following changes, which are\nintended to remedy the above-described deficiencies. \nA. Keepin2 Records of United States-Person Query Terms\nQuerying procedures must \"include a technical procedure whereby a record is kept of \neach United States person query term used for a query.\"  § 702(f)(l)(B).  The FBI querying \nprocedures previously examined by this Court and the FISCR stated that the FBI \"intends to \nsatisfy\" that requirement \"by keeping a record of all queries\" of un-minimized Section 702 \ninformation.  See September 18, 2018, Submission, FBI Querying Procedures § IV .B.3 at 4 n.4 \n(emphasis added).  That statement served to codify the \"FBI's longstanding practice of keeping a \nrecord of all queries ... , without distinguishing between U.S. person query terms and other query \nterms.\"  August 12, 2019, Memorandum at 8.  In contrast, other agencies who work with un­\nminimized Section 702 information would keep records that identify when United States-person \nquery terms are used.  See October 18, 2018, Opinion at 50-52.  Both this Court and the FISCR \nheld that it would be inconsistent with Section 702(f)(l)(B) for the FBI's records not to indicate \n- -\n161 I SE@Mf))J[))blt@bf()ltbi Gtdt  Page 6 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 6 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n-\n-\nTAP SFCRFT11Sl11CPCONNOFOPN \nwhether a term used to query Section 702 information is a United States-person query term.  See \nid. at 52-62; In re DNI/ AG Certificationsat 22-38. \nThe government has now removed from the Revised FBI Querying Procedures the \nproblematic  statement of intent.  The revised procedures simply state: \"The FBI must generate \nand maintain an electronic record of each United States person query term used for a query of \nunminimized content or noncontent information acquired pursuant to section 702.\" Revised FBI \nQuerying Procedures § IV.B. l. The electronic record must include, \"at a minimum,\" \"the query \nterm(s) used\"; \"the date of the query\"; and \"the identifier of the user who conducted the query.\" \nId.  \"In the event it is impracticable for an FBI system to generate an electronic record of each \nUnited States person query term,\" or an electronic record cannot be generated due to \"an \nunanticipated circumstance,\" \"the FBI must generate and maintain a written record of each \nUnited States person query term\" used.  See§ IV.B.2 (emphasis added).  FBI personnel may \nconduct \"a query in a system that does not generate\" electronic records of queries only after \ndetermining that querying a system that does so \"would be insufficient for technical, analytical, \noperational, or security reasons.\"  Id. The FBI must maintain records of such United States­\nperson query terms for at least five years in a manner that will allow the National Security \nDivision (NSD) of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (ODNI) to conduct effective oversight.  See§ IV.B.3.  NSD and ODNI will review \nFBI queries that involve U.S.-person query terms to monitor compliance with the procedures.  Id. \nBecause the above-summarized provisions \"require the FBI to keep records that identify \nwhich queries of unminimized Section 702 information use a U.S. person identifier\" as a query \n-\n-\n'fOP QIJOM'f,41tJl;410R.eON:'JlOFOIVl  Page 7 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 7 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n-\nJOB SEGPEI'.'.SJ\".OPCODJNOEOPDJ \nterm, August 12, 2019, Memorandum at 7-8, the Revised FBI Querying Procedures, as written, \ncomport with Section 702(f)(l)(B). \nB. Documentin2 the Factual Basis for Use of United States-Person Query Terms\nAs stated above, this Court also found a deficiency because the FBI' s procedures did \"not \nrequire adequate documentation of the justifications for queries that use United States-person \nquery terms.\"  October 18, 2018, Opinion at 133. While CIA, NSA, and NCTC personnel were \nrequired to provide written statements of why their U.S.-person queries met the applicable \nquerying standard, FBI personnel were not.  Id. at 73.  In the Court's estimation, the lack of such \ndocumentation contributed to the risk that the FBI would continue to conduct unjustified U.S.­\nperson queries and hindered oversight of FBI querying practices.  See id.at 68-74, 93-94. \nTo address those concerns, amici curiae proposed that \"FBI personnel be required to \ndocument in writing their bases for believing that queries of Section 702 data using U.S. -person \nquery terms were reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence information or evidence of \ncrime before they examine content information returned by such queries.\" Id. at 92 (emphasis in \noriginal). The Court expressed the view \"that adopting and implementing that proposal, in \ncombination with the other protections\" of the FBI's procedures, would satisfy statutory and \nFourth Amendment requirements.  kL. at 96-97.  The FISCR described the proposal as \"a modest \nmeasure\" that \"could have several potential benefits,\" including facilitating oversight and \n\"motivat[ing] FBI personnel to carefully consider ...w  hether a query satisfies the querying \nstandard.\"  In re DNI/A  G Certifications at 41. \n-\n-\nIb  i■ S  EEi& I;; 3th OKCOIUH  O  POftH  Page 8 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 8 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n.,il_  i_f_ _ o,__rL ?.._P _f_il_'.'.0_5'._li_P. .J ?...__ i!l_?J __ O__._F_  @_P_?I_ __  \nThe government has now adopted amici 's proposal.  \"Prior to reviewing the unminimized \ncontents of section 702-acquired information retrieved using a United States person query term,\" \nFBI personnel will be required to \"provide a written statement offa  cts showing that the query \nwas reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence ofa  crime,\" and the \nFBI will maintain those statements \"in a manner that will enable oversight by NSD and ODNI.\" \nRevised FBI Querying Procedures§§ IV.A.3, IV.B.4.  FBI personnel are not required to provide \nsuch a written statement before reviewing noncontents information. See§  IV.A.3 n.4. \n(\"Contents\" is defined as as \"any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a \ncommunication.\" §  III.A.) \nThe new documentation requirement does not apply to contents information retrieved by \nqueries that are described in Section 702(f)(2) ofF ISA. See Revised FBI Querying Procedures \n§§  IV.A.2, IV.A.3. That section requires FBI personnel to obtain from the FISC a probable­\ncause-based order before accessing contents retrieved by using a U.S.-person query term to query \nun-minimized Section 702 information, if the query was conducted \"in connection with a[n] \n[FBI] predicated criminal investigation ... that does not relate to the national security of the \nUnited States\" and was \"not designed to find and extract foreign intelligence information.\"  FISA \n§ 702(f)(2)(A), (D). A FISC order is not required, however, if\"there is a reasonable belieft hat\nsuch contents could assist in mitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.\"  § \n702(f)(2)(E). \nIn sum, FBI personnel may query un-minimized Section 702 information for foreign­\nintelligence or law-enforcement purposes ift he queries are reasonably likely to retrieve foreign-\n-\nTOP SFGPFT11Sl11CPGON0IOFOPN  Page 9 \n■ \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 9 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\nIOF■ S  ECRElhSD)ORCON)NOFORN \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime.

See§§  IV.A.2, IV.A.3. In the latter \ncase, FBI personnel must apply for and obtain an order from the FISC before accessing the \ncontents information retrieved, unless they reasonably believe it could assist in mitigating or \neliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.  See FISA §  702(f)(2)(A), (E); Revised FBI \nQuerying Procedures§   IV.A.2. As written, the Revised FBI Querying Procedures remedy the \npreviously found deficiency regarding documentation of the basis for U.S.-person queries. \nIII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS\nThe authorization to use the Revised FBI Querying Procedures comes into effect on the\ndate that the Court issues an order regarding the amendments in the August 12, 2019, \nt 3-4. As a result, the FBI is required to \nimplement the revised procedures as of the date of this Opinion and Order.  The government \nacknowledges, however, that the FBI is not yet able to comply fully with those procedures.  It \nrepresents that the new recordkeeping and documentation requirements described above \n\"necessitate modifications to FBI systems, as well as training of FBI personnel, in order to \nfacilitate full compliance ....

Indeed, \nif FBI personnel create written records that properly identify U.S.-person query terms and, when \nrequired, document the factual basis for U.S.-person queries, they may be complying with the \nRevised FBI Querying Procedures.  Those procedures contemplate \"a written statement of facts \nshowing that the query was reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or \nevidence of a crime\" that is \"maintained in a manner that will enable oversight,\" without \nspecifying how it is created or in what form it is kept. See§§  IV.A.3, IV.B.4.  And if it \"is \nimpracticable\" fo  ystem ''to generate an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term\" used for a query, and it \"would be insufficient for technical, analytical, \noperational, or security reasons\" to run the query on a system that would generate such an \nelectronic record, then it would be permissible to query  \"generate and maintain a \nwritten record\" of each U.S.-person query term used. See § IV.B.2. \nMoreover, Section 702(f)(l )(B) \"is best interpreted as requiring some kind of technical \nprocedure that requires intelligence agency personnel to memorialize, to the extent reasonably \nfeasible, whether a particular query term is a United States person query term.\"  In re DNI/AG \nCertifications at 38 (emphasis added). Standards ofreasonableness also apply under the Fourth \nAmendment, see,�. In re Certified Question of Law, 858 F.3d 591, 604 (FISCR 2016) (per \ncuriam) (\"The touchstone oft he Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.\"), and FISA's \nminimization requirements,�.�. 50 U.S.C. § l 801(h)(l) (requiring procedures to be \n\"reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular surveillance, to \n- -\n• \n101  SECIWIHBZ:OIECOHlHOfOH!f  Page 12 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 -  Authorized Public Release  Page 12 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nminimize ... the retention, and prohibit the dissemination\" of private U.S.-person information, \n\"consistent with the need of the United  States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign \nintelligence information\"). In the short term, the only reasonably available means of complying \nwith the new recordkeeping and documentation requirements for queries on  ystem is \nfor the FBI to maintain written records outside of that system. The Court expects that, in the \nlonger term, the FBI will seriously consider upgrading or replacing  ystem to support \nthe generation of electronic records in response to the new requirements. \nB. \nThe FBI assesses that it will have completed the necessary modifications \ny \napproximately November 15, 2019, and t  y approximately December 13, 2019.  See \nC \nAugust 12, 2019, Memorandum at 10.  The necessary training will be made available to FBI \npersonnel by November 15, 2019, and anyone who has not completed the training by December \n13, 2019, will lose access to un-minimized  Section 702 information on those systems.  Id. \nby December 13, 2019, the FBI expects to have completed the steps necessary for users o \nand  o comply with the new provisions of the Revised FBI Querying Procedures. \nIn comparison to  ystem, the government plans to upgrade \nmore quickly, but not to  o anyt. mg to comply with the new requirements until the upgrade is \nfinished.  The government contends that creating separate written records for queries on \nas the FBI will do for queries on  ystem, \"would be impractical and overly \nburdensome,\" \"given the magnitude of queries conducted\" on  \"as compared to \nugust 12, 2019, Memorandum at 11.

In Fiscal Year 2017, FBI personnel \"ran approximately 3.1 million queries\" \n\"against raw FISA-acquired information i  eclaration ofthe Director ofthe FBI \nincluded within the September 18, 2018, Submission, at 6.  But burden to the FBI is not the only \nrelevant factor.  On the government's proposal, a large volume of U.S.-person queries of Section \n702 information  before December 13, 2019, entails a correspondingly high \nincidence ofnon-compliance with the new requirements. \nOne alternative to the government's proposal would be to prohibit FBI personnel from \nconducting U.S.-person queries of un-minimized Section 702 information in \nuntil the upgrading and training related to those systems have been completed.  The Court is \nmindful, however, ofthe important national-security interests furthered by the FBI's querying \nu ,\nsuch information.  See,  In re DNI/AG Certifications at 12 (\"The ability to query Section 702 \ninformation - as opposed to reviewing it communication-by-communication - greatly facilitates \nthe agencies' ability to assess and respond to potential national security threats.\").  Another \nalternative would be for the FBI to create written records responsive to the new recordkeeping \nand documentation requirements for queries o  in the same manner as it will for \nqueries on th  ystem.  After careful consideration, the Court has concluded that it would \nnot be reasonable to expect the FBI now to instruct all the users o  o create \nwritten records ofU.S.-person queries outside ofthose systems, only to train them in late \nNovember and early December on how to create electronic records within those systems.  Rather, \nthe Court believes that the efforts ofthe trainers and the attention of the systems' users should be \n,or \n@lff!l@MTi\\ 81!'.;IOROOHlJOPOllff  Page 14 \nDATE~  Authorized Public Release  Page 14 of 18  FISC Opinion, Sep. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n'f6P ffl!CREU/Slii'OR@OPVP,OFORiN \nfocused on proper implementation of the long-term solution -creating the requisite records in \nelectronic form on \nThat conclusion, however, depends on the FBI's completing the systems modification and \ntraining fi  n accordance with the timetable described above.

(U) These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant\nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or \"the\nAct\"), by the National Counterterrorism  Center (\"NCTC\"), and apply in addition to separate\nminimizationprocedures  forNCTC adoptedpursuantto subsectionT}2(e) oftheAct. These\nquerying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minimizatíon\nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be\nprohibited by those minimization procedures. NCTC employees who have completed training in\nthese procedures and NCTC's section 702 minimization procedures may query NCTC systems\ncontaining unminimized information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act. Authorized\nusers with access to unminimized section 7}2-acquired  information should process the results of\nan appropriate query of unminimized section 7}2-acquired information in accordance with\nNCTC' s applicabl e section 702 minim ization procedures.\nil. (U) If NCTC determines that it must take action in apparent deparlure from these querying\nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or hostage\nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, NCTC\nmay take such action immediately. NCTC will make a record of the action taken, to include any\nquery term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National\nlntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"),\nwhich will promptly notiôr the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity.\nm. \nru) Delinitions and Presumptions\nA.

United States\nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when\ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United\nStates persons. Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identifu one or more\nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment\nby a trained intelligence professional. \"United States person query term\" is not limited to\nany single category of information or technology.

The term \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains\nunminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized\nsection 702-acqtired information in response to the query either because the user has not\nbeen granted access to the unminimized section 7l2-acquired information, or because a user\nwho has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve\nunminimized section 70}-acquired information. The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a\nsystem user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of\nthat query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved,2 or (2) examining or\nmanipulating, including by technical means, communications  or documents for the pu{pose\nof minimizing such communications  or documents.3\n(U) \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a\ncommunication.\n(U) \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated\nwith a communication,  but does not include information concerning the substance, purport,\nor meaning of the communication.\n(U) \"¡{CTC employee\" means (i) individuals directly employed byNCTC, (ii) personnel\ndetailed to NCTC from other departments or agencies who work underNCTC management\nand supervision in a manner substantially the same as individuals directly employed by\nNCTC, and (iii) contractors working under NCTC management  and supervision who are\nauthorized to perform services in support of NCTC on FlSA-related matters.\nt \nSuch terms may include the use of keywords, identifiers,\n2 6¡ \nFor example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually\nretumed to p system user from a query) by date, time, etc.\n3 6¡ For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all\ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"lJ.S.

NCTC shall maintain a\nrecord of each such statement of facts.\n3. (U) In the event it is impracticable for a NCTC system to generate an electronic\nrecord, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents the\ngeneration of such an electronic record, NCTC must generate and maintain a written\nrecord of each United States person query term that contains the same information\nrequired for electronic records, as described above. Before conducting a query in a\nsystem that does not generate an electronic record of a query, NCTC employees must\nreasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that generates an\nelectronic record would be insufficient for technical, analylical, operational, or\nsecurity reasons.\n4.

(U) POST-TARGETING ANALYSIS BY NSA \n(U) After a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will conduct post-targeting \nanalysis.  Such analysis is designed to detect those occasions when a person who when targeted \nwas reasonably believed to be located outside the United States is located in the United States, \nand will enable NSA to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition ofany communication as \nto which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time ofacquisition to be located \nin the United States, or the intentional targeting of a person who is inside the United States. \nSuch analysis may include: \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n6 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 6 of 10 NSA’s Section 702 Targeting Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \na)  (S//NF) For telephone numbers: \n•  NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target has entered or \nintends to enter the United States.

IfNSA determines that a target who at the time of targeting was \nbelieved to be a non-United States person is believed to be a United States person, it will follow \nthe procedures set forth in section IV ofthis document, including the termination ofthe \nacquisition from the target without delay. \nIII. (U) DOCUMENTATION \n(U) Analysts who request tasking will document in the tasking database a citation or citations to \nthe information that led them to reasonably believe that a targeted person is located outside the \nUnited States.  Before tasking is approved, the database entry for that tasking will be reviewed in \norder to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations. \n(S// NF) A citation is a reference that identifies the source ofthe information, such as a report \nnumber or communications intercept identifier, which NSA will maintain.  The citation will \nenable those responsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led \nNSA analysts to conclude that a target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates. \n(U) Analysts also will identify the authorized foreign power or foreign territory about which they \nexpect to obtain foreign intelligence information pursuant to the proposed targeting, and will \nprovide a written explanation ofthe basis for their assessment, at the time oftargeting, that the \ntarget possesses, is expected to receive, and/or is likely to communicate foreign intelligence \ninformation concerning that authorized foreign power or foreign territory. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n8 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 8 of 10 NSA’s Section 702 Targeting Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \nIV. (U) OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE \n(U) NSA will conduct compliance and oversight activities, on an ongoing basis, with respect to \nits exercise ofthe authority under section 702 of the Act, including the associated targeting, \nminimization, and querying procedures adopted in accordance with section 702.  NSA will \ndevelop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure NSA personnel \nresponsible for approving the targeting of persons under these procedures, as well as NSA \npersonnel with access to the acquired foreign intelligence information understand their \nresponsibilities and the procedures that apply to this acquisition.  NSA has established processes \nfor ensuring that raw traffic is labeled and stored only in authorized repositories, and is \naccessible only to those who have had the proper training.  NSA will conduct ongoing oversight \nactivities and will make any necessary reports, including those relating to incidents of \nnoncompliance, to the NSA Inspector General and OGC, in accordance with its NSA \ncharter.  NSA will also ensure that necessary corrective actions are taken to address any \nidentified deficiencies. To that end, NSA will conduct periodic spot checks oftargeting decisions \nand intelligence disseminations to ensure compliance with established procedures, and conduct \nperiodic spot checks ofqueries in data repositories. \n(U) The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director ofNational Intelligence \n(ODNI) will conduct oversight ofNSA's exercise ofthe authority under section 702 of the Act, \nwhich will include periodic reviews by DOJ and ODNI personnel to evaluate the implementation \nof the procedures.  Such reviews will occur approximately once every two months. \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil \nLiberties Protection Officer any incidents of noncompliance with these procedures by NSA \npersonnel that result in the intentional targeting of a person reasonably believed to be located in \nthe United States, the intentional targeting of a United States person, or the intentional \nacquisition of any communication in which the sender and all intended recipients are known at \nthe time ofacquisition to be located within the United States.  NSA will provide such reports \nwithin five business days oflearning ofthe incident.  Any information acquired by intentionally \ntargeting a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United \nStates at the time of such targeting will be purged from NSA databases. \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National \nSecurity Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI \nOffice of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer, any incidents of \nnoncompliance (including overcollection) by any electronic communication service provider to \nwhom the Attorney General and Director ofNational Intelligence issued a directive under \nsection 702.  Such report will be made within five business days after determining that the \nelectronic communication service provider has not complied or does not intend to comply with a \ndirective. \n(U) In the event that NSA concludes that a person is reasonably believed to be located outside \nthe United States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside the United States, \nor ifNSA concludes that a person who at the time oftargeting was believed to be a non-United \nStates person is believed to be a United States person, it will take the following steps: \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n9 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 9 of 10 NSA’s Section 702 Targeting Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n1)  Tenninate the acquisition without delay from all facilities tasked in accordance with \nthese procedures and used by that target, and detennine whether to obtain \nauthorization under another section ofthe Act.

Any United  States  person  query term  used  to  identify  and  select unminimized \nsection  702-acquired  content must  first be  approved  by NSA’s  Office  of General  Counsel. \nNSA  personnel  seeking  such  an  approval  must provide  a  statement  of facts  establishing that \nthe  use  of any such  identifier  as  a  selection  term  is  reasonably  likely to  retrieve  foreign \nintelligence  information,  as  defined  by  FISA.  NSA  may  approve  the use  of a United  States \nperson  query term  to  query unminimized  section  702-acquired  content  for  no  longer than  a \nperiod  of one  year;  such  approvals  may be  renewed  for periods  up  to  one  year.  Any use  of a \nUnited  States  person  query term  to  query unminimized  section  702-acquired metadata must \nbe  accompanied  by  a  statement  of facts  showing that  the  use  of any  such  query term  is \nreasonably  likely to  retrieve  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined by FISA.

(U)  Creation  and  Maintenance  of Query  Records \n1.  (U)  NSA  must  generate  and  maintain  an  electronic  record  of each  United  States \nperson  query term  used  for  a  query  of unminimized  information  acquired  pursuant  to \nsection  702.  Such  electronic  record  must,  at  a minimum,  include  the  following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the  query  term(s)  used  or  approved; \nb.  (U)  the  date  of the  query  or  approval  of query term(s); \nc.  (U)  the  identifier  of the  user who  conducted  the  query  or  sought  approval  of \nthe  query term(s); \nd.  (U)  the  statement  of facts  showing  that  the use  of the  query term(s)  is \nreasonably likely to  retrieve  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined by \nFISA;  and \ne.  (U)  in  the  case  of content  queries,  the  approving  official  in NSA’s  Office  of \nGeneral  Counsel  and  duration  of the  approval. \n2.  (U)  In  the  event it  is  impracticable  for  an NSA  system  to  generate  an  electronic \nrecord,  or in  the  event  an  unanticipated  circumstance  arises  that prevents  the \ngeneration  of such  an  electronic  record,  NSA must  generate  and  maintain  a  written \nrecord  of each  United  States  person  query term  that  contains  the  same  information \nrequired  for  electronic records,  as  described  above.  Before  conducting  a  query  in  a \nsystem  that  does  not  generate  an  electronic record  of a  query,  NSA  personnel  must \nreasonably determine  that  conducting  that  query in  a  system  that  generates  an \nelectronic  record  would  be  insufficient  for  technical,  analytical,  operational,  or \nsecurity reasons. \n3.  (U)  NSA  will  maintain the  query records  required by this  subsection  in  a manner  that \nwill  allow  NSD  and  ODNI  to  conduct  oversight  and  compliance  in  an  effective \nmanner.  Such records  (both  electronic  and  written),  including  the  statements  of facts, \nmust be maintained  at  least  five  years  from  either  the  date  of the  query  for  queries  of \nunminimized  section  702-acquired  metadata,  or the  date  of the  approval  of the  U.S. \nperson  query term  for  queries  of unminimized  section  702-acquired  content.  NSD \nand  ODNI  will  conduct  oversight  of NSA’s  activities  with  respect  to  United  States \npersons  that  are  conducted pursuant  to  these procedures. \n“SECRET TNOFORN—— \n4 \nDATE  Oct 8,  2019 - Authorized  Public Release  Page 4  of 6  NSA's Section  702  Querying  Procedures,  Sep.  2018\nDocument regarding the Section  702  2018  Certification  ODNI  Authorized for Public  Release \nihe an \nC.

The \ngovernment's request for approval of the amended certifications and related procedures is \ngranted in part and denied in part for the reasons stated in this Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder. \nPart I of this Opinion summa1izes the government's submissions and the procedural \nhistory of these matters.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe Court begins with a description of the 2018 certifications and their amendments ande\nthen describes their subject matter. \nA. The 2018 Certifications and Amendments\nThe March 27, 2018, Submission includes  ertifications executed by the Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence pursuant to Section 702: \nEach of those certifications (c ollectively referred to as \"the March 27, 2018, Certifications\") is \naccompanied by: \n(1)Supporting affidavits of the Director of the National Security Agency, the Director ofe\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, ande\nthe acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center;e\n(2)eTwo sets of targeting procedures, which govern NSA and the FBI respectively.

The minimization procedures for NSA appear as Exhibit B to each\ncertification, those for the FBI appear as Exhibit D, those for the CIA appear as Exhibit E,\nand those for NCTC appear as  it F\nidentifies \nThe \n(4) One set of querying procedures (\"March 27, 2018, Querying Procedures\") for NSA,\nthe FBI, the CIA, and NCTC, which appears as Exhibit H to each certification.\nThe March 27, 2018, Submission also includes an explanatory memorandum prepared by the \nDepartment of Justice (\"March 27, 20 I 8, Memorandum\"). \nThe Court was initially required to review and rule on the certifications and procedures \nwithin 30 days of their submission -i.e., by April 26, 2018. See§ 702(j)(I)(B). In order to \nallow for pa1ticipation of amici curiae, however, the Court extended this period by 90 days, until \nJuly 25, 2018, under Section 702(k)(2). See Order, April 5, 2018. The Court appointed Jonathan \nG.Cedarbaum, Esq., and Amy Jeffress, Esq., to serve as amici curiae. � Order Appointing\nAmici Cuiiae, Apr. 23, 2018.  At the request of Ms. Jeffress, the Court later appointed John \nCella, Esq., as amicus curiae to assist in amici's work. SeeOrder Appointing Additional Amicus \nCuiiae, May 7, 2018. The Court appreciates the diligent and learned assistance provided by \namici, both in their written submissions and in their oral advocacy at hearings. Their efforts have \ngreatly benefited the Court's review of these matters. \nFollowing briefing by amici and the government, the Court heard oral arguments by amici \nand representatives from the government on July 13, 2018.

Those exemptions seemede\nunreasonably broad under the standards of the Fourth Amendment and FlSA'se\ndefinition of \"minimization procedures.\" See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 (h), 1821 (4);e\nan \n(2)eUnder the querying procedures, the FBI would keep records of  queiies rune\nagainst Section 702 data, but those records would not indicate whether the querye\nterm used was associated with a United States person.  This recordkeepinge\npractice appeared to be inconsistent with the statutory requirement that thee\nquerying procedures \"include a technical procedure whereby a record is kept ofe\neach United States person query term used for a query.\"  § 702(t)(l)(B); ande\n(3)eThe querying procedures did not require FBI personnel to document the basise\nfor finding that each United States-person query term satisfied the relevante\nstandard -i.e., that queries be reasonably designed to retum foreign-inte1ligencee\ninformation or evidence of c.,Time.  Without such documentation and in view ofe\nreported instances of non-compliance with that standard, the procedures seemede\nunreasonable under FISA's definition of\"minimization procedures\" and possiblye\nthe Fourth Amendment.  The Court noted it was favorably inclined toward amici'se\nsuggestions that the Court require that, if FBI personnel want to examine thee\ncontents of Section 702 infonnation retumed by a United States-person query,e\nthey would first be required to document why that query met the applicablee\nstandard.e\nOn July 20, 2018, the government filed a motion seeking a further extension until \nOctober 18, 20 I 8, in order for it to amend its procedures in an effort to address at least some of \nthe Court's concems.  See Mot. for Order Extending Time Limit Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \n§e1881 a(k)(2).

See \nSeptember 18, 2018, Memorandum \n11. REVIEW OF THE 2018 CERTIFICATIONS AND PRIOR CERTIFICATIONS,\nAS AMENDED\nThe Court must review a Section 702 certification \"to detennine whether [it] contains alle\nthe required elements.\" § 702(j)(2)(A).

See \nIll.  TARGETING PROCEDURES AND SCOPE OF ACQUISITION \nSection 702(d )( I) requires targeting procedures to be \"reasonably designed\" to \"ensure \nthat any acquisition authorized under[§ 702(a)] is limited to targeting persons reasonably \nbelieved to he located outside the United States\" and to \"prevent the intentional acquisition of \nany communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of \nthe acquisition to be located in the United States.\"  Additiona1Ly, the government uses the \ntargeting procedures to ensure acquisitions do \"not intentionally target a United States person \nreasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\"  § 702(b)(3).  Pursuant to \n§e702(i)(2)(B), the Court assesses whether the targeting procedures satisfy those criteria.  Thee\nComt must aJso assess whether the targeting procedures, along with the querying and \nminimization procedures, are consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  See \n§e702(i)(3)(A)-(B).e\nln January 2018, Congress enacted the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 \n(\"Reauthorization Act\"), Pub. L. No. 1 I 5-118, 132 Stat. 3 (2018).

It specifically imposed, with na1Tow exceptions for exigent \ncircumstances, a requirement of congressional notification and a 30-day congressional-review \npe1iod before the government can resume abouts collection u11der Section 702.  See id. \n§eI 03(b )(1 )-{4  ).  This Opinion refers to that requirement as the \"abouts limitation.\" In addition,e\nthe government must \"fully and currently inform\" the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees of \nthe House and Senate of \"significant noncompliance ... conceming any acquisition of abouts \ncommunications.\"  § 702(m){4) (enacted by Reauthorization Act§ J 03(b)(5)). \nA. Backi:round on Section 702 Acquisition\nThe govemment targets a person under Section 702 by tasking for acquisition one or \nmore selectors (e.g., identifiers for email or other electronic-commu11ication accounts) associated \nwith that person.  Section 702 encompasses different fonns of acquisition.  The government may \nacquire information \"upstream,\" as it transits the facilities of an Internet backbone carrier, as well \nas \"downstream,\" from systems operated by providers of service \nApril 26, 2017, Opinion at 15.  Traditional telephone communications may also be acquired \nupstream, but those acquisitions have not presented issues regarding scope of acquisition in the \nway that upstream Intemet acquisitions have.  In the following discussion, \"upstream\" collection \nrefers to upstream acquisition of Internet communications under Section 702. \n'f'OP SECRE'fWSl,'fORCONf:P�OFORN  Page 11 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 11 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\nI0  1• tJ l!Clll!lI  ;; JI;;O  ltCOfU  f8  ifPOftff •  \nNSA is the only agency to conduct upstream collection under Section 702, while both the \nNSA and FBI have roles in  downstream.  Under the procedures, NSA is \nthe lead agency in making targeting decisions under Section 702. The FBI Targeting Procedures \nTargeting Procedures § I. l at 1.  \"Thus, the FBI Targeting Procedures apply in addition to the \nNSA Targeting Procedures,\"  See Docket No \nem. Op., Sept. 4, 2008 (\"September 4, 2008, Opinion\") at 20 (emphasis in original). \nIt is worth highlighting two salient features of upstream collection as conducted prior to \nMarch 17, 2017, that bear on the issues raised by the abouts limitation: \n(I)eNSA sometimes acquired \"multiple communication transactions,\" or \"MCTs,\"e\nthrough upstream collection.

See id. For that reason, and because such MCTs \ncould be acquired regardless of whether the active user was a Section 702 target, those additional \nemail messages could be wholly unrelated to any target.  See id. at 16-17. \nAs a result, upstream collection as conducted prior to March 17, 2017, was \"more likely \nthan other fonns of Section 702 collection to contain information of or conceming United States \npersons with no foreign intelligence value.\" Id. at 17 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Heightened restrictions were accordingly placed on NSA's retention, use, and \ndissemination of infonnation acquired through upstream collection, including a prohibition on \nqueries that used U .S.-person identifiers as query terms. See id. at 17-18. \nBeginning in October 2016, while the 2016 Ce11ifications were pending before the FISC, \nthe government reported that NSA had violated that querying prohibition much more frequently \nthan had been previously disclosed.  The FISC discussed this issue at length in its opinion \nultimately approving the 2016 Certifications, which were amended by the government to address \nthat non-compliance. See id. at 14-30. Specifically, the government chose to stop acquiring \nabouts communications under Section 702 and memorialized that change in amended procedures \nfor the 2016 Certifications. For example, the NSA Targeting Procedures were amended to state \nthat \"[a]cquisitions conducted under these procedures wi11 be limited to communications to or\nfrom persons targeted in accordance with these procedures.\"  20 l 6 NSA Targeting Procedures, as \nAmended, Mar. 30, 2017, § I at 2 (emphasis added).

This Court has  reviously w1derstood that definition to \nFor purposes of the abouts limitation, it is impo11ant that all of the above-described \ncommunications would be in transit to or from a person who is accessing or using the account in \nquestion -i.e., the active user-at the time they could be acquired by upstream collection.  So \nlong as the active user is properly targeted under Section 702, the acquired communications \nwould be to or from that target and therefore would fall outside the abouts limitation.  And \ngenerally speaking, the active user of the account in question will be an authorized Section 702 \ntarget if the account is properly tasked for acquisition under Section 702.  That is because, with a \nnatTow exception for  all users of a facility tasked for acquisition under \nSection 702 are considered targets.

See Gov't \nResponse at 1-2.  For example, a report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) \ndescribed Section 103 of the Reauthorization Act as \"codif{ying] the Intelligence Communitis \n(JC's) current prohibition on a subset ofFISA collection under [Section 702] known as 'Abouts' \nUpstream collection.\"  S. Rep. No. 11 S-182 at 1 (2017). A report ofthe House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence (HPSCl) stated: \nThe Committee understands that the targeting procedures currently used by the \nNSA to conduct acquisitions pursuant to FISA Section 702 prohibit the \nacquisition of communications that are not \"to\" or \"from\" a FISA Section 702 \ntarget.  The new limitation established by Section [103) is intended to codffy only \ncurrent procedures and is not. intended to affect acquisitions currently being \nconducted under FJSA Section 702. \nH.R.

Amici point out that the same \ngeneral expectation was reflected in statements made by multiple members during floor debate \non the Reauthorization Act.

SeeGov't Response at 2-4, 7. \nThe Court is not well positioned to assess congressional understanding on this point.  In \nany event, it must be mindful that \"(t]he starting point in disceming congressional intent is the \nexisting statutory text.\"  Laime v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004); accord. e.g. .

Here, the text of Section 702(b) (5) \ndoes not distinguish between upstream and downstream collection or otherwise refer to how \nacquisition is conducted. The provision merely describes communications that are not to or frome\na target, but contain a reference to a target, and subjects the intentional acquisition of such \ncommunications to the notification and delay requirements of Section l 03(b) of the \nReauthorization Act. The Court discerns no absurdity in applying the abouts limitation, by its \nterms, to downstream collection and will adve1i to legislative history below only insofar as \nambi ities are confronted in doing so.

For their acquisition to be autho1ized under the 2018 Certifications, such \ncommunications must be to or from a target. \nThe statutory provisions describing the abouts limitation do not speak to this question, so the \nCourt looks next to the broader statutory text and framework of Section 702. \nUpon a detennination of exigent circumstances under Section 702(c)(2) or the issuance of \na FISC order w1der Section 702(j)(3), \"the (AG] and [DNI] may authorize jointly, for a period of \nup to 1 year from the effective date of the autho1ization, the targeting of persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence infonnation.\" \n§o702(a).

The abouts \nlimitation is now one of them.  It appears in Section 702{b) along with five other limitations on \nacquisitions authorized under Section 702(a).  One of those other limitations, like the abouts \nlimitation, applies to a certain type of communication and provides that an acquisition \"may not \nintentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are \nknown at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\"  § 702(b)(4). The other \nlimitations do not refer to communications. Three of them prohibit the intentional targeting of \npersons under certain circumstances- e.g., a U.S. person reasonably believed to be outside the \nUnited States or anyone known to be in the United States, § 702(b )( 1 )·(3) -while the remaining \none states that acquisitions shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth \nAmendment.  � § 702(b)(6). \nThe statute also provides the means of accomplishing acquisitions authorized under \nSection 702(a): the AG and DNI \"may direct, in writing, an electronic communication service \n-\n-\n• \nIO  f SECREI;;  :,u,01tcon,ne1•01tu  Page 34 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 34 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nprovider to ...i mmediateJy provide the Govemment with all infonnation, facilities, or assistance \nnecessary to accomplish the acquisition in a manner that will protect the secrecy of the \nacquisition and produce a minimum of interference with the services\" provided to the target of \nacquisition.

Both sections involve \"the targeting\" of persons \n\"reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence \ninfonnation,\" §§ 702(a), 703(a)(l ), and both provide for directing \"an electronic communication \nservice provider\" to give the government \"all infonnation, facilities, or assistance necessary to \naccomplish [such] acquisition,\"§§ 702(i)(l)(A), 703(c)(S)(B). \nI I ii  .Uh II W: ... ,: ,:2,t;1JilN (iF{i1'1ii,lfi';(iffi(i)ff P~  Page 36 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 36 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocumentregarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n■■,,.._,,,. • \"'\",• .-n..,   11, ■ •••• ■ ,,.,..  .., , ■,\" ■, ,n,\n110f 9ECftB'FN9th'8R€0PNN8F8RPi  Page 37 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 37 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\nTOPI  l'.Jl!!@Rl!!::P;;Ql;:'Olt@ON1'HOFONJ  Page 38 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 38 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocumentregarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nIO  P SECREIJJSl})OkLOMi◄OPOl'd�  Page 39 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 39 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\n•er \nOft@llJBIf  )f,I0  1n 8R08rt:HOFOR4!(\nThe government, in contrast, argues that Congress was probably silent on this point \nbecause it did not contemplate or intend that the abouts limitation would apply to downstream \nacquisitions at all.

THE QUERYING AND MINIMIZATION PROCEDURES\nA. Statutory Provisions\nPursuant to § 702U)(2)(C)-(D), the Court must assess whether the querying procedures \nand minimization procedures comply with specified statutory requirements.  Those statutory \nrequirements are summarized separately below. \n1. Requirements for Querying Procedures\nThe Reauthorization Act required the government to adopt querying procedures and \nprovided for FISC review of them.  See Reauthorization Act§ 1 Ol(a)(l)(B), (b)(l)(F), 132 \nStat. 3.  The 2018 Certifications are the first ones subject to that requirement.  Id.§ 101 (a)(2). \nSpecifically, the AG, in consultation with the DNI, must \"adopt querying procedures consistent \nwith the requirements of the fourth amendment ... for infonnation collected\" pursuant to a \nSection 702 certification, see § 702(f)(l )(A), and must \"ensure\" those procedures \"include a \ntechnical procedure whereby a record is kept of each United States person query tenn used for a \nquery.\" § 702(f)(1 )(B).  \"Query\" is defined as \"the use of one or more tenns to retrieve the \nunminimized contents or noncontents located in electronic and data storage systems of \n- IOI ■S  ECREJ))§l))bkCOl◄ll4010164  Page 45 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 45 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocumentregarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nI 01 tJl!!CM!.-ll81Ul8ft@OfMf@IFOftff \ncommunications of or concerning United States persons obtained through acquisitions \nauthorized\" under a Section 702 certification.  See§ 702(f)(3)(B).  The FISC must detennine \nwhether querying procedures satisfythe requirements of§ 702(f)(1 ).  See§ 702(j)(3)(A)-(B). \nThe Reauthorization Act further amended Section 702 to require the govenunent in \nspecified circumstances to obtain a FISC order before accessing Section 702-acquircd \ninfonnation.  See Reauthorization Act§   101 (a)(] )(B).  Those amendments are codified at \nSection 702(f)(2). Specifically, that new statutory requirement applies: \n(1)eonly to the FBI, not the CIA, NSA or NCTC.  See§ 702(f)(2)(A);e\n(2)eonly to accessing \"the contents of communications ... that were retrieved pursuant toe\na query made using a United States person query te1m.\"  Id.  For purposes of Sectione\n702(f), the term \"contents,\" \"when used with respect to any wire, oral, or electronice\ncommunication, includes any infonnation concerning the substance, purport, or meaninge\nof that communication.\" 18 U .S.C. § 2510(8) (incorporated by § 702(f)(3)(A)).  The newe\nrequirement does not limit the authority of the FBI to conduct a lawful query, by whiche\nthe contents of communications may be retrieved.  See § 702(f)(2)(F)(i);e\n(3)eonly with regard to \"a query made using a United States person query tenn that wase\nnot designed to find and extract foreign intelligence information.\" § 702(f)(2)(A).  Thee\nnew requirement does not limit the FBl's authority \"to review, without a court order, thee\nresults of any query ... that was reasonably designed to find and extract foreigne\ninte1ligence infon11ation, regardless of whether such foreign intelligence infonnatione\ncould also be considered evidence of a crime.\" § 702(f)(2)(F)(ii); ande\n(4)eonly \"in connection with a predicated criminal investigation opened by the [FBI] thate\ndoes not relate to the national security of the United States.\" § 702(t)(2)(A). The newe\nrequirement does not Jimit the FBl's ability \"to access the results of queries conductede\nwhen evaluating whether to open an assessment or predicated investigation relating to thee\nnational security of the United States.\" § 702(f)(2)(F)(iii).e\nIn addition, the FBI need not obtain a Coul1 order if it \"detennines there is a reasonable \nbelief' that the contents sought \"could assist in mitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious \nbodily hann.\" § 702(f)(2)(E). \n-\n'.],OPi  liCi:ilJi'.], H6111CRCAN0  JOFOPN  Page 46 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 46 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\n'f'8P 8f!Cftl3ifh1Sil\\'8D@8i'VN8fl8ftN \nWhen the triggering conditions are satisfied, FBI perso1mel must apply for and receive a \nFISC order before accessing contents rettieved by such a query.  See§ 702(f)(2)(A). The \napplication must be made upon oath or affimiation and approved by the AG based upon a finding \nthat the application satisfies the statutory requirements.  See§ 702(f)(2)(C).  It must include \"a \nstatement of the facts and circumstances relied upon ... to justify the belief ... that the contents\" \nsought \"would provide evidence of: (I) criminal activity; (II) contraband, fruits of a crime, or \nother items illegally possessed by a third party; or (III)  property designed for use, intended for \nuse, or used in committing a crime.\" § 702(1)(2)(C)(ii).  Upon such an application, \"the Court \nshall enter an order approving the accessing of the contents of communications\" if it \"finds \nprobable cause to believe that such contents would provide any of the evidence\" described above. \nSee§ 702(f)(2)e(D).  If such an 6rdei· is not obtained when required, infonnation concerning a \nU.S. person obtained through the pertinent query may not be used in a criminal proceeding \nagainst that person unless the AG detennines the criminal proceeding relates to the national \nsecurity or one of several specified serious crimes.  See 50 U.S.C. § 188le(a)(2)(A). \n2. Requirements for Minimization Procedm·es\nSection 702(e )(]) requires minimization procedures that \"meet the definition of \nminimization procedures under ( 50 U.S.C. § 1801( h) or I 821 (4  )].\" That definition requires \n(1)especific procedures ... that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose ande\ntechnique of the particular surveillance ( or physical search], to minimize thee\nacquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly availablee\ninfonnation concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with thee\nneed of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligencee\ninfonnation;e\n-\n'JaOP 61iwRlii1:'::0U'OiA'1JQN 1aiQFQAP:I  Page47 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 47 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\n• \n101 31!.CllETh 31;;· 1e  ftCONJ ue,ettu \n(2)eprocedures that require that nonpublicly available information, which is note\nforeign intelligence infotmation, as defined in [50 U.S.C. § 180l{e)(1)], shall note\nbe disseminated in a manner that identifies any United States person, without suche\nperson's consent, unless such person's identity is necessary to understand foreigne\nintelligence infonnation or assess its importance; [and]e\n(3)enotwithstanding paragraphs ( l) and (2), procedures that allow for the retentione\nand dissemination of infonnation that is evidence of a c1ime which has been, ise\nbeing, or is about to be committed and that is to be retained or disseminated fore\nlaw enforcement purposes[.]e\n§e180 l( h). The definition of \"minimization procedures\" at § 1821 (4) is substantively identical toe\nthe definition at§ 1801 (h) (although § J 821(4)(A) refers to \"the purposes ... of the particular \nphysical search\").  For simplicity, subsequent citations refer only to§ 180l{h). \nEach agency having access to \"raw,\" or unminimized, infonnation obtained under Section \n702 is governed by its own set of minimization procedures in handling that infonnation. (This \nopinion uses the terms \"raw\" and \"unminimized\" interchangeably.  The NCTC Minimization \nProcedures define \"raw\" infonnation as \"section 702-acquired infonnation that (i) is in the same \nor substantially the same fonnat as when NSA or FBI acquired it, or (ii) has been processed only \nas necessary to render it into a fonn in which it can be eva]uated to determine whether it \nreasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information or to be necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information or assess its importance.\" NCTC Minimization Procedures § A.3.d \nat 2). \nThe minimization procedures submitted in the Prior Dockets contained rules for querying \nraw Section 702 infonnation. See, e.g., 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures § Ill.D at 11-12. In \nresponse to the enactment of§ 702(f), the AG and DNI have adopted querying procedures for \neach agency that appear in a document separate from the relevant set of minimization procedures. \n- -\n. \n120P ifiGAliiJzU6f;!:'OIUi10tl '1 llOFOA>I  Page48 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 48 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n1f8P S@CR@111f,1EIIXOM!CON/fiOFORf l \nSee page 6 above.  Each agency's procedures nonetheless make clear that the querying and \nminimization procedures are to be read and applied together.  See, e.g. • NSA Querying \nProcedures§   I at 1 (\"These querying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with \n[the separate] minimization procedures, and nothing in these procedures penuits any actions that \nwould otherwise be prohibited by those minimization procedures.\"); FBI Querying Procedures \n§e1 at 1 (same); NSA Minimization Procedures§ I at 1 (''These minimization procedures apply ine\naddition to separate querying procedures. ... [They] should be read and applied in conjunction \nwith those querying procedures, and nothing in these procedures pennits any actions that would \notherwise be prohibited by those querying procedures.\"); FBI Minimization Procedures § I.A at 1 \n(same). The Court therefore will assess whether each agency's minimization procedures, in \nconjunction with the corresponding querying procedures, satisfy§ 180l(h). \nB. Recordkeeping Reguirement for U.S.-Person Query Terms\nThe statute's text plainly requires the relevant agencies, including the FBI, to keep \nrecords of U.S.-person query terms used to query Section 702 infonnation.  The FBI's practice of \nkeeping records of all query tenns in a manner that does not differentiate U.S.-person terms from \nother tenns is inconsistent with that requirement. The Court begins with the statute and a textual \nanalysis and then separately explains why the government's arguments regarding text, legislative \nhistory, and policy considerations do not alter the outcome. \nI.e Backeround\nAs noted above, the querying procedures must \"include a technical procedure whereby a \nrecord is kept of each United States person query tem1 used for a query.\" § 702(f)(l)(B).

The re..c;ulting FBI records, in other words, will \nnot distinguish between United States-person query tenns and other query tenns.  See March 27, \n2018, Memorandum at 27. In fact, the government represents that the FBI already keeps records \nof all Section 702 query tenns without distinguishing between U.S.-person query tenns and non­\nU.S.-person query tenns and contends that Section 702(f)(I)(B) requires no change. See id. \nat 26. \n2. Application of Section 702({)(1)(8) to FBI Recordkeeping Practices\nThe issue presented by the FBl's current recordkeeping is straightforward: Is the \nrequirement for \"a technical procedure whereby a record is kept of each United States person \nquery tenn used for a query\" satisfied by a procedure that results in records that do not indicate \nwhether tenns are United States-person query tenns?  The plain meaning of the statutory text \nsuggests that the answer is \"no.\" \na. Textual Analysis\nA \"record\" serves to memorialize information.  See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary(I0 th \ned. 2014) (d efining \"record\" as, among other things, \"1. A documentary account of past events, \nusu. designed to memorialize those events\"); Webster's II New College Dictionary927 (2001) \n(defining \"record\" as \"l. a. An account, as of infonnation, set down esp. in writing as a way of \npreserving knowledge. b. Something on which such an account is made ... 2.  Jnfonnation or \ndata on a specific subject collected and preserved\").  Section 702{f )( 1 )(B) identifies \"each United \nmarSFCRET((SJ(P  R CON'N  OFARN  Page 52 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 52 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\nfJiOP fiiillliTf!61'.'0RCOt:'.DJOFOPN \nStates person query tem1 used for a que1y\" as the infonnation that must be memorialized. \nThe government argues that records that document all terms used to query Section 702 \ninformation, regardless of whether the te1m is a United States-person query tenn or not, satisfies \nSection 702(t)(l)(B) because that provision \"does not include any other tenn, such as \n'separately' or 'segregated,' specifying that United States person query tenns must be retained \napart from other queries.\" March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 27; see also Gov't Response \nat 28-29 (statute \"does not include any additional language specifying that U.S. person query \ntenns must be retained separate and apart from other queries\").  The government's argument, \nhowever, misses the essential aim of the recordkeeping requirement, which is to memorialize \nwhen a United States-person query tem1 is used to query Section 702 infonnation.  Just as \nrecords of all applicants admitted to a university are not records of out-of-state applicants \nadmitted if they do not differentiate out-of-state from in�state, records that do not memorialize \nwhether a query tenn used to query Section 702 data meets the definition of a United States­\nperson query tenn do not preserve the infom1ation specifically required by Section 702(f)(l)(B). \nSection 702(f)(J)(B), moreover, imposes a recordkeeping requirement only for queries \nthat use United States-person que1y terms, not for all que1ies.

Section 603 \nrequires the DNI to repo1t publicly on, among other things, \"the number of search tenns \nconceming a known United States person used to retrieve the unminimized contents of electronic \ncommunications or wire communications obtained\" under Section 702 and \"the number of \nqueries concerning a known United States person of unminimized noncontents infonnation \nrelating to electronic communications or wire communications obtained\" under Section 702, \n§e603(b)(2)(B)-(C); however, \"information or records held by, or queries conducted by,\" the FBIe\nare explicitly exempted from that reporting, except insofar they relate to FISC orders issued \nunder Section 702(f)(2).  See§ 603(d)(2)(A).  The government attributes this exemption of FBI \nqueries to congressional recognition that the FBI lacked the capacity to provide the relevant \ninformation.  SeeMarch 27, 2018, Memorandum at 29 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 114-109, pt. 1, \nat 26 (2015) (\"the FBI is exempted from repo1ting requirements that the agency has indicated it \nlacks the capacity to provide\")). \nThe government suggests that because Congress generally exempted FBI queries from the \nDNI's annual reporting (only requiring reporting for FBI queries that relate to Section 702(f)(2) \norders), the recordkeeping requirement of Section 702(f)(l)(B) should be read to make similar \nallowances for the FBI's limited capabilities.

The premise of the government's argument is that the only purpose for \nkeeping records that identify United States-person query tenns is to satisfy the DNI's reporting \nobligations.  That premise is belied by the government's own briefing, which acknowledges \noversight of the agencies' querying practices as another purpose of Section 702(f)(l )(B)'s \nrecordkeeping requirement. See March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 27.  Because the \nrecordkeeping requirement serves a purpose separate from the reporting obligations, there is no \ninconsistency between exempting from public repo1ting the number of U.S.-person queries \nconducted by the FBI and requiring the FBI to keep records that identify which Section 702 query \nten11s are United States-person query terms. The explicit exemption set forth in Section \n603( d)(2)(A) demonstrates, moreover, that if Congress intended for Section 702(t)(l )(B) to make \nsimilar allowances for the FBI, it would have been easy to provide for them expressly. \nIn support of its position, the govemment also cites Section 112 of the Reauthorization \nAct, which requires the Inspector General of DOJ to repo1t to Congress on the FBJ's \nimplementation of querying procedures within one year of their approval by the FISC. See \nMarch 27, 2018, Memorandum at 31.  In addition to requiring the Inspector General to assess \nseveral aspects of FBI' s implementation of the querying procedures, Section 1 12 requires the \nInspector General to assess any \nimpediments, including operational, technical, or policy impediments, for Lhe \n[FBI] to count -\n(A)ethe total number of queries where the FBI subsequently accessed informatione\nacquired w1der ... section 702;e\nTOP SECftE'fh'SIHORCONtNOFOR:N  Page 55 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 55 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n'f8 11 S661l:IHW61:4'QACQN,~0'60;A:i>l \n(B)ethe total number of such queries that used known United States person\nident{fiers; ande\n(C) the total number of queries for which the [FBI] received an order of thee\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court pursuant to [Section 702(f)(2)].e\n§ l 12(b)(8) (emphasis added).

Le�islative History\nThe government further argues that the legislative history of the Reauthorization Act \nsupports its conclusion that the FBI's recordkeeping is consistent with Section 702(f)(l)(B). \nEven if one assumes arguendo that the statute is reasonably susceptible to the government's \ninterpretation, such that ambiguity justifies recourse to legislative history,� Part JII.B.2.c(i) \nabove, the government's arguments are unavailing. \nThe government points to the following statement in a HPSCI report: \n[Section 702(f)(] )(B)] does not impose a requirement that an Intel1igence \nCommunity element maintain records of United States person que,y terms in any \nparticular manner, so long as appropriate records are retained and thus available \nfor subsequent oversight. This section ensures that the manner in which [ an \nagency] retains records of United States person query terms is within the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of National \nIntelligence and subject to the approval of the FISC. \nH.eRep. No.115-475, pt. 1, at 18 (emphasis added) (quoted in March 27, 2018, Memorandum ate\n27).  The government suggests that the FBl's recordkeeping practices reflect a pennissible \nexercise of the discretion of the AG and the DNI «to detennine how an agency would keep \nrecords of queries in a manner that allows for meaningful oversight.\"  March 27, 2018, \nMemorandum at 27 (emphasis added).  But the issue presented is whether the FBI's records will \nmemorialize the infom1ation required by the statute. The passage from the HPSCI report cJearly \nindicates that, however records are kept, they must be ''records of United States query tenns.\" It \nprovides no reason to think that (I) HPSCJ understood \"records of United States person query \n- -\n• \nIbi .9ECRfJIJHU~li Ib  l\\COftftePeftU  Page57 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 57 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \ntenns\" to include records that do not indicate whether query tenns are United States-person query \nte1ms, or (2) HPSCI intended to leave that detennination to executive-branch discretion. In \naddition, the first sentence of the paragraph from which the above quotation is taken describes \nthe required records in language that closely tracks the statutory text: \"Section 201 [ of the \nReauthorization Act] further mandates that all querying procedures include a provision requiring \nUi1ited \nthat a record is kept for each  States person que1y term usedfor a query of FISA Section \n702 data.\" H. Rep. No. 115-475, pt. 1, at 18 (emphasis added). HPSCI's reiteration of the \"U.S. \nperson\" nature of query terms that must be recorded makes clear that the discretionary manner in \nwhich an agency keeps the required records does not include the freedom to decide not to record \nthe fact that a query tennis a United States-person query tem1. \nThe report's reference to \"subsequent oversight,\" moreover, is consistent with an intent \nthat the records document use of United States-person query tenns, as such, particularly in view \nof HPSCI's acknowledgment \"that certain lawmakers and p1ivacy advocates wo1ry about the \nability of the Intelligence Community to query lawfully acquired data using query tenns \nbelonging to United States persons.\"  Id. at 17.  Such oversight would be best served if the \nrecords indicate whether a particular query tennis a United States-person query tenn - i.e., a \nterm reasonably likely to identify one or more specific U.S. persons. \nThe govemment also relies on a statement in the same report that \"the Committee \nbelieves that the Intelligence Community should have separate procedures documenting their \ncurrent policies and practices related to the querying oflawfully acquired FISA Section 702 \ndata.\"  Id. at 17-18 (emphasis added) (quoted in March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 28).

See March 27, 2018, Memorandum \nat 26, 28.  But the report's generic reference to current po]icies and practices of the Intelligence \nCommunity appears in a discussion of the general requirement to adopt querying procedures, not \nthe specific recordk:eeping requirements of Section 702(f)(1 )(B). The report, furthermore, does \nnot mention any technical limitations of FBI systems or desc1ibe, let alone endorse, the FBI­\nspecific practice of keeping records that do not identify which query terms are United States­\nperson query tenns. Neither the plain language of the statute nor the plain language of the report \ncited by the government supports its contention that Congress intended no changes to FBI's \nexisting querying practices in response to the Reauthorization Act. \nc. Policy Considerations\nFinally, the government contends that requiring the FBI to maintain records that \ndifferentiate United States-person query tenns from other Section 702 query tenns will have \nadverse consequences.  SeeSupplemental FBI Declaration at 8-15.  In his declaration, the \nDirector of the FBI does not desctibe as a source of difficulty any \"limitations of FBI systems' \ntechnical record-keeping functions.\"  March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 26, 28.  Instead, he posits \nthat such a requirement would leave the FBI with two possible means of implementation, neither \nof which is desirable.  Under one option, FBI personnel would conduct research in FBI holdings \nto infom1 their assessments of which proposed query tenns are United States-person query tenns \n'i>0P Sli!CM'¥J¥S1,¥8R0OM,'l'i8F91L'I  Page 59 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 59 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n'f8  P 813 CJH:il35FOS l:':'9RCOl'Ul>J Oi>OR'\\l \nfor pu1poses of Section 702(t)(l)(B). See Supplemental FBI Declaration at 8-9. The Director \nanticipates that approach would divert resources from investigative work, delay assessment of \nthreat infonnation, and discourage its personnel from querying W11ninimized FISA infonnation, \nto the dettiment of public safety. Id. at 9-12.  He also describes an alternative approach whereby \npersom1el would be allowed to forgo such research and rely solely on their \"personal knowledge\" \nin making those assessments. Id. at 12.  The Director expects that practice would \"result in \ninconsistent and unreliable infonnation in FBl systems,\" id., thereby complicating other aspects \nof the FBl's work -e.g., implementing its Section 702 targeting procedures.  Id. at 13-14.  The \nDirector also expresses concern that such an approach would be inconsistent with the FBJ's \n\"strong culture that places great emphasis on personnel consistently conveying true and accurate \ninfonnation.\"  Id. at 14. \nAll of those points raise policy considerations regarding the advisability ofrequiring the \nFBI to keep records that identify United States-person query terms it has used to query Section \n702 infonnation. The Court, it should be emphasized, makes no detennination as to the \nadvisability of a particular policy on this subject.  Regardless of how persuasive the FBI 's \nconsiderations may be, the Court is not free to substitute its understanding of sound policy-or, \nfor that matter, the understanding of the Director of the FBI -for the clear command of the \nstatute.  See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247,270 (2009) (\"Absent a constitutional \nbanier, 'it is not for us to substitute our view of ... policy for the legislation which has been \npassed by Congress.\"') (quoting Florida Dept. of Revenue v.

In sum, the Coutt is it is merely enforcing what Section 702(t)(l )(B) \nplainly imposes. \nd. Conclusion\nIn sho1t, the Court should follow the \"'first canon\"' of statutory construction:  to presume \nthat Congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says.  Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. at 461-62 (quoting Connecticut Nat'! Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992)). \nSection 702(f)(l )(B) plainly states that the querying procedures must include \"a technical \nprocedure whereby a record is kept of each United States person query te1m used for a query.\" \nThat requirement is not satisfied by procedures under which the FBI does not keep such records \nin a readily identifiable manner. The Court accordingly finds that the FBI Querying Procedures \ndo not comport with Section 702(f)(l )(B). \nThe Supplemental FBI Declaration touches on another point that the Court will address \nbecause it may bear on curing this deficiency. Section III.B of the FBI Querying Procedures \nprovides for certain presumptions regarding U.S.-person status. FBI Querying Procedures§ III.B \nat 3.  The Declaration, however, discounts their potential utility in alleviating the problems \nanticipated by the FBI because \"they would genera11y require FBJ personnel to evaluate \ninformation in FBI holdings before applying a presumption.\" Supplemental FBI Declaration \nat 13 n. 7.

Such revised procedures, \nof course, wou]d be subject to FISC review pursuant to Section 702(i).  In any event, there are \nclearly some queries for which FBI personnel know they are using United States-person query \ntenns, and the obligation to keep adequate records of those te1ms pursuant to Section \n702(f)( 1 )(B) will be readily apparent. \nFinally, the Court does not ho]d that the FBI must immediately deploy a comprehensive \ntechnical means of generating appropriate records.  So long as it is taking serious steps toward \nimplementing such teclmical means, it may rely on \"written\" records, as desciibed at FBI \nQuerying Procedures § IV.B.2 at 4. \nC. FBI Querying Practices and Statutory and Constitutional Requirements\nThe Court next independently finds that tl1e FBI's repeated non-compJiant queries of \nSection 702 infonnation preclude (1) a determination that its minimization and querying \nprocedures are reasonably designed to minimize the retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of \nprivate information concerning U.S. persons, consistent with the government's foreign­\nintelligence needs, and (2) a finding that such procedures are consistent with the requirements of \nthe Fourth Amendment. \nThis section begins by describing the role of querying rules within minimization \nprocedures and discussing the reasonableness of the FBl's querying standard, as written.  The \nCourt then reviews numerous instances of non-compliance with that standard and three factors \nthat contribute to the Court's concerns about the FBI's querying practices.  The Court then \n-\nor \nI 8R@A!i@IJj'.JIQtt'OABUfliJ  JOPOIUl  Page62 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 62 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\n'f6P Sl!J@ftl5'fh:SIOOR!CON:1N8F8Rf4 \nconsiders steps the government has taken to respond to non-compliant queries, including \nrequiring FBI personnel to obtain attorney approval before examining content infonnation \nreturned by certain categorically justified queries, and concludes they are insufficient to suppmt \nthe required findings.  Finally, the Court examines amici's proposal regarding FBI \ndocumentation of query justifications, adoption of which the Court believes would remedy the \ndeficiency. \n1.\nQuerying and Effective Minimization\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR) has instructed: \nBy minimizing retention, Congress intended that \"infonnation acquired, which is \nnot necessary for obtaining[,] producing, or disseminating foreign intelligence \ninfom1ation, be destroyed where feasible.\" Furthenuore, u[e]ven with respect to \ninformation needed for an approved purpose, dissemination should be restricted to \nthose officials with a need for such infom1ation.\" \nIn Re Sealed Case, 3 JO F.3d 717, 731 (FISCR 2002) (per curiam) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n1283, pt. 1 at 56 (1978) and adding emphasis; internal citations omitted). \nNotwithstanding that preference for destruction of non-pertinent information when \nfeasible, the F[SC has approved minimization procedures that pe1mit retention for considerable \npe1iods of time, even after infonnation has been reviewed and not found to relate to foreign \nintelligence or evidence of crime.  See, e.g. . 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures§ Ill.G.l .bat 23 \n(such information may be retained for up to 15 years, with enhanced access controls in place after \nten years).  The FBI minimization procedures now before the Cou1t propose the same approach. \nSee September 18, 2018, FBI Minimization Procedures§   III.D.4.c at 17 (same).

But it \nalso importantly depends on querying rules and other access restrictions that guard against the \nindiscriminate review and use ofU.S.-person information.  See  p.and \nOrder, May 17, 2016 (\"May 17, 2016, Opinion\") at 25 (\"because raw FISA-acquired infonnation \nnay be accessible by large numbers of persons in the FBI \nfor a wide variety of investigative and analytical purposes, it is especially impmtant for U.S. \nperson infonnation on those systems to be subject to appropriate access restrictions,\" including \nquerying rules); id. at 43 (\"substantive standards for.querying data\" \"guard against indiscriminate \ns\nor improper accessing or use of U.S. person information\"); \nem.

They can, for example, \nreview Section 702 data on a communication-by-communication basis and thereby encounter \nU .S.-person infom1ation.  See Gov't Response at 14-15.  Despite the availability of that \nalternative, the rules for U.S.-person queries -i.e., queries that use a \"United States person query \nterm\" as defined at FBI Querying Procedures §Ill.A-are important to proper minimization of \n- -\nTOP 8@eR:E1'¢110tJ;f8'.R@ONfN8FORN  Page64 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 64 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n• \n- II b  l SECltZ lll31l:c5R@c5ff;lf8fi!8ftff \nSection 702 infonnation.  The government's own submissions emphasize the operationa1 \nimportance of the FBI being able to query infonnation and the large number of que1ies of FISA \ninfonnation conducted by the FBI.  See, e.g., Supplemental FBI Declaration at 6 (\"[ d]atabase \nqueries are a critical tool,\" and in one system during fiscal year 2017, FBI ran approximately 3.1 \nmillion queries \"against raw FISA-acquired infonnation ...,  including section 702-acquired \ninformation\"). Given the importance and prevalence of querying, it is a logical focus for efforts \nto balance protection of U.S. persons' privacy interests against foreign-intelligence needs.  The \nenactment of Section 702(f) indicates Congress drew a similar conclusion. \nIndeed, the rules for U.S.-person queries are especially important for minimization of \nSection 702 information. Section 702 provides a means for the government to target individuals \nwho are reasonably believed to be non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. See \n§e702(b )(1) , (3) (prohibiting intentional targeting of U.S. persons and any persons located insidee\nUnited States); (d)(l)(A) (requiring targeting procedures reasonably designed to ensure only \npersons reasonably believed to be located outside United States are targeted).  The government \nmay acquire the full contents of communications under Section 702 without a finding of probable \ncause, as is needed for electronic surveillance and physical search w1der FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§§ l 805(a)(2), I 824(a)(2).  When the government queries Section 702 data to identify ande\nexamine infonnation about a particular U.S. person, moreover, it typically has an investigative or \nanalytical interest regarding that person, who necessarily was not a target of the acquisition.  As \nsuggested by amici, it can also result in a further intrusion into the privacy of such U.S. persons, \nwho may have enjoyed \"the protection of anonymity\" until inforn1ation concerning them was \n-\n-\nIJOP iii ill.iii flil'.'.92G  Oll '.tIOEOPN  Page 65 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 65 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized forPublicRelease \nretrieved by use of an individualized U.S.-person query directed at them.  See Amici Reply at 9. \nAnd FBI queries intended to retrieve evidence of crime may be conducted in the course of law­\nenforcement investigations that are unrelated to national-security threats. \nThe FBI's querying practices under Section 702 are especially important because the FBI \nconducts many more U.S.-person queries than the other agencies.  In 2017, NCTC, the CIA, and \nNSA collectively used approximately 7500 terms associated with U.S. persons to query content \ninformation acquired under Section 702, seeAmici Brief at 51 n.47; Gov't Response at 32, while \nduring the same year FBI personnel on a single system ran approximately 3.1 million queries \nagainst raw FISA-acquired information, including section 702-acquired information.  See \nSupplemental FBI DecJaration at 6.  (As explained above in Part IV .B . l, FBI records do not \ndifferentiate between U.S.-person query tem1s and other query tenns, but given the FBI's \ndomestic focus it seems likely that a significant percentage of its queries involve U.S.-person \nquery tenns).  The large number of U.S.-person queries run by the FBI makes its querying \npractices significant, despite its receiving only a small percentage of the total information \nacquired under Section 702.  See Gov't Response at 26-27 (it was reported in October 2017 that \nFBI received infonnation for approximately 4.3% of persons targeted under Section 702). \n2. The FBl's Querying Standard\nThe FBI Querying Procedures require: \"Each query of FBI systems containing \nunminimized content or noncontent 1nfonnation acquired pursuant to section 702 of [PISA] must \nbe reasonably like(}' to retrieve.foreign intelligence i�formation, as defined by FISA, or evidence \nofa crime, unless otherwise specifically excepted in these procedures.\"  FBI Querying \nICC SFGPET((SJ 119969N019FOPN  Page66 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 66 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n- II 0  1I IQ  IU!IRBT!i8  1:;i8ROOHJIO  li  iftfl \nProcedures§ IV.A. 1 at 3 (emphasis added).

As written and in the context of restrictions on the use and disclosure ofU.S.-person \ninformation within the FBI Minimization Procedures, that querying standard is consistent with \nthe statutoiy definition of minimization procedures; however, as implemented by the FBI, it is \nnot. \nThe minimization procedures now in effect a1ticulate the standard for FBI queries of \nSection 702 infonnation differently: \"To the extent reasonably feasible,\" FBI personnel \"must \ndesign\" queries of unminimized Section 702 information \"to find and extract foreign intelligence \ninformation or evidence of a crime.\" 2016 FBl Minimization Procedures § IIJ.D at 11.  The \ngovernment represents that \"[i]n practice, the applicable standard remains the same .... \" March \n27, 2018, Memorandum at 24.  Counsel for the government has characterized the FBI querying \nstandard as a high one, having three elements: (1) a query cannot be \"overly broad,\" but rather \nmust be designed to extract foreign-intelligence infonnation or evidence of crime; (2) it must \n\"have an authorized purpose\" and not be run for personal or improper reasons; and (3) there must \nbe \"a reasonable basis to expect [it] will return foreign intelligence infonnation or evidence of \ncrime.\" July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 9; see also March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 25 (there \nmust be \"a reasonable basis to believe the query is likely to return foreigri intelligence \ninformation or, in the case of the FBI only, evidence of a crime.\"). \nThe FBI querying standard -as written and as explicated in the manner summarized \nabove -presents no impediment to finding that the FBI Querying Procedures and FBI \nMinimization Procedures satisfy the definition at § 180 I (h).

In this \ncase, the government contends that the FBl's implementation of the querying standard has \nprovided appropdate protection for U.S. persons' privacy.  See Gov't Response at 32-33. For \nreasons explained below, the Court does not agree. \nSince April 2017, the government has reported a large number of FBI queries that were \nnot reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence infonnation or evidence of crime. In a \nnumber of cases, a single improper decision or assessment resulted in the use of query terms \ncorresponding to a large number of individuals, including U.S. persons.

(U)  These  procedures  apply  to  the  querying  of unminimized  information,  acquired pursuant \nto  section  702  of the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  of  1978,  as  amended  (‘‘FISA”  or  “‘the \nAct”),  by  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (“CJA”),  and  apply  in  addition  to  separate \nminimization  procedures  for  CIA  adopted  pursuant  to  subsection  702(e)  of the  Act.  These \nquerying  procedures  should  be  read  and  applied  in  conjunction  with  those  minimization \nprocedures,  and  nothing  in  these procedures  permits  any  actions  that  would  otherwise  be \nprohibited  by  those  minimization  procedures.  CJA  personnel  who  have  completed  training  in \nthese  procedures  and  CJA’s  section  702  minimization  procedures  may  query  CIA  systems \ncontaining  unminimized  information  acquired  pursuant  to  section  702  of the  Act.  Authorized \nusers  with  access  to  unminimized  section  702-acquired  information  should  process  the  results  of \nan  appropriate  query  of unminimized  section  702-acquired  information  in  accordance  with  CJA’s \napplicable  section  702  minimization  procedures. \nIJ.  (U)  If CIA  determines  that  it  must  take  action  in  apparent  departure  from  these  querying \nprocedures  to  protect  against  an  immediate  threat  to  human  life  (e.g.,  force  protection  or  hostage \nsituations)  and  that  it  is  not  feasible  to  obtain  a  timely  modification  of these  procedures,  CIA \nmay  take  such  action  immediately.  CIA  will  make  a  record  of the  action  taken,  to  include  any \nquery  term(s)  used,  and  report  the  action  taken  to  the  Office  of the  Director  of National \nIntelligence  (“ODNI’”)  and  to  the  Department  of Justice’s  National  Security  Division  (“NSD”), \nwhich  will  promptly  notify  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (“FISC’’)  of such  activity. \nIII.  (U)  Definitions  and  Presumptions \nA.  (U)  Definitions  for  purposes  of these  procedures \n(U)  These  procedures  adopt  the  definitions  set  forth  in  50  U.S.C.  §  1801  for  the  terms \n“foreign  intelligence  information,”  “person,”  “United  States,”  and  “United  States  person.” \n€}+  When  used  to  conduct  a  query,  “United  States  person  query term”  means  a  term  that  is \nreasonably  likely  to  identify  one  or more  specific  United  States  persons.  United  States \nperson  query  terms  may  be  either  a  single  item  of information  or  information  that,  when \ncombined  with  other  information,  is  reasonably  likely to  identify  one  or  more  specific  United \nStates  persons.  Determining  whether  information  is  reasonably  likely  to  identify  one or more \nspecific  United  States  persons  in  a  particular  context  may require  a  case-by-case  assessment \nby  a  trained  intelligence  professional.  ‘United  States  person  query  term”  is  not  limited  to \nany  single  category  of information  or  technology.

(U)  A  person known  to  be  located  in  the  United  States  will be  treated  as  a  United \nStates  person  unless  the  person  is  identified  as  an  alien  who  has  not been  admitted  for \npermanent  residence,  or the  circumstances  give  rise  to  the  reasonable belief that  such \nperson  is  not  a  United  States  person. \n2.  (U)  A  person  known  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States,  or whose  location  is \nunknown,  will  be  treated  as  a non-United  States  person unless  the  person  is  identified \nas  a  United  States  person  or the  circumstances  give  rise  to  the  reasonable  belief that \nsuch  person  is  a United  States  person. \n3.  (U)  A  person  who  at  any time  has  been known  to  have been  an  alien  admitted  for \nlawful  permanent  residence  is  treated  as  a United  States  person,  unless  a \ndetermination  that  such person  is  no  longer  a United  States  person  is  made  in \nconsultation  with  the  CIA  Office  of General  Counsel. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated  association  whose  headquarters  or primary  office  is  located \noutside  the  United  States  is  presumed  not  to  be  a  United  States  person  unless  there  is \ninformation  indicating  that  a  substantial  number  of its  members  are  citizens  of the \nUnited  States  or  aliens  lawfully  admitted  for permanent residence. \nIV.

Each  query  of CIA  systems  containing unminimized  content  or \nnoncontent  information  acquired  pursuant  to  section  702  of the  Act must be  reasonably \nlikely to  retrieve  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined  by  FISA,  unless  otherwise \nspecifically  excepted  in  these  procedures. \nB.  (U)  Creation  and  Maintenance  of Query  Records. \n1.  (U)  CIA  must  generate  and  maintain  an  electronic  record  of each  United  States \nperson  query term  used  for  a  query of unminimized  information  acquired  pursuant to \nsection  702.  Such  electronic record  must,  at  a minimum,  include  the  following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the  query term(s)  used; \nb.  (U)  the  date  of the  query;  and \nc.

(U)  Any use  of a  United  States  person  query term  also  must be  accompanied  by  a \nstatement  of facts  showing  that  the use  of that  query term  is  reasonably  likely to \nretrieve  foreign  intelligence  information,  as  defined by  FISA.  CIA  shall  maintain  a \nrecord  of each  such  statement  of facts. \n3.  (U)  In  the  event  it  is  impracticable  for  a  CIA  system  to  generate  an  electronic record, \nor in  the  event  an unanticipated  circumstance  arises  that prevents  the  generation  of \nsuch  an  electronic record,  CIA  must  generate  and  maintain  a  written record  of each \nUnited  States  person  query term  that  contains  the  same  information required  for \nelectronic  records,  as  described  above.  Before  conducting  a  query in  a  system  that \ndoes  not  generate  an  electronic record  of a  query,  CIA personnel  must  reasonably \ndetermine  that  conducting  that  query in  a  system  that  generates  an  electronic  record \nwould be  insufficient  for  technical,  analytical,  operational,  or  security reasons. \n4.  (U)  CIA  will  maintain  the  query records  required  by this  subsection  in  a manner that \nwill  allow NSD  and  ODNI  to  conduct  oversight  and  compliance  in  an  effective \nmanner.  Such  records  (both  electronic  and  written),  to  include  the  statements  of facts, \nmust be maintained  at  least  five  years  from  the  date  the  United  States  person  query \nterm  was  used.  NSD  and  ODNI  will  review  CIA’s  queries  of unminimized  section \n702-acquired  information using  any  such  query  terms  to  ensure  that  they were \nreasonably likely to  retrieve  foreign  intelligence  information,  or were  otherwise \nconducted  pursuant  to  one  of the  exceptions  provided below. \nC.  (U)  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding  subsections  IV.A  and  IV.B.2  above,  nothing  in  these \nprocedures  shall  prohibit  the  lawful  oversight  functions  of NSD  or  ODNI,  or the \napplicable  Offices  of the  Inspectors  General,  or restrict  CIA  from  providing the \nassistance  necessary  for these  entities  to  perform  their lawful  oversight  functions,  and \nnothing in these procedures  shall  prohibit  CIA  from  conducting  queries  it  determines  are \nnecessary to: \n1.  (U)  CIA’s  performance  of lawful  training  functions  of its  personnel  regarding  the \nproper implementation  of section  702  and  CIA’s  section  702  procedures.  However, \nCIA  shall  use  non-United  States  person  identifiers  to  perform  such  queries,  unless \nCIA  determines  that  there  is  a particular need  to  use  a United  States  person  identifier \nin  such  a  query to  conduct  training  on  the  implementation  of an  aspect  of CIA’s \nsection  702  procedures; \n2.

Boasberg, Judge) decided both issues adversely \nto  the  Government,  concluding  that  (1)  the  FBI' s  practice  of \nmaintaining records that do not identify United States person query \nterms as such does not comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B); and (2) the \nFBI' s proposed querying and minimization procedures do not comply \nwith  the  requirements  of  FISA and  the  Fourth  Amendment.  The \nGovernment appealed. \nWe conclude that the FBI's proposed querying procedures do \nnot comply with Section 702(£)(1)(8) insofar as they do not include a \nprocedure whereby FBI personnel document, to the extent reasonably \nfeasible, whether a particular query term relates to a United States \nperson  or  a  non-United  States  person.  Because  this  conclusion \nnecessarily  requires  the Government to amend the FBI' s proposed \nprocedures, we decline to reach the second issue presented. As the \nGovernment  undertakes  the  required  revisions,  it  can  consider \nwhether-and,  if  so,  how-to  respond  to  the  statutory  and \nconstitutional deficiencies the FISC identified.

BACKGROUND\nA. FISA Section 702\nEnacted in  1978,  FISA  \"authorize[sJ  and  regulate[s]  certain \ngovernmental electronic surveillance of communications for foreign \nintelligence purposes.\"1 FISA is a critical component of our national \nsecurity  infrastructure,  not  least because  it  \"authorizes  extremely \npowerful investigative techniques\" that \"can help the [GJovernment \nprevent (or mitigate) terrorism, espionage, and other foreign threats to \nnational security.\"2\n1 Clapper v.

The  2008  Amendments  Act \n4 \nadded to FISA a new section, 702, which was intended to \"creat[e] a \nnew framework under which the Government may seek the FISC's \nauthorization of certain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the \ncommwtlcations  of  non-[United  States]  persons  located  abroad.\"5\nUnder Section 702, on \"the issuance of an order\"  by the FISC, \"the \nAttorney  General and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  may \nauthorize jointly, for a period of up to 1 year from the effective date of \nthe authorization, the targeting of persons reasonably believed to be \nlocated  outside  the  United  States  to  acquire  foreign  intelligence \ninformation.\"6  As  the  Supreme  Court  has  observed,  \"[u]nlike \n3 Id.§ 17:1. \n4 \nSee FISA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub.

Accordingly, we agree with the \nFISC that the FBI' s  proposed querying  procedures, which do not \ncontain such a procedure, do not comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B). \nz. The Text of Section 702(j)(l)(B)\nWe begin, as we must, with the statute's text.64 As previously \nnoted, Section 702(£)(1 )(B) requires that querying procedures \"include \na technical procedure whereby a record is kept of each United States \nperson query term used for a query.\"65 The question with which we \nare faced is whether procedures that do not require agency personnel \nto memorialize whether a query term is a United States person query \n64 See, e.g., Maslenjak v.

This is where the Government would end the \nanalysis. \nIn our view, Section 702(f)(l)(B) requires something more. The \nFBI' s proposed recordkeeping practices, comprehensive as they might \nbe, fail to \"perpetuate ... knowledge\" of a specific type of information \nexpressly identified in the statute's text: whether a query term is a \nUnited States person query term.

For instance, the FBI would be unable to provide, for the \npurposes  of oversight  by  other  relevant  offices  of the  Executive \nBranch, Congress, or the FISC, a comprehensive list of United States \nperson query terms that FBI personnel had used to query Section 702 \ninformation. Nor would it be able to provide a representative sample \nof such query terms. Indeed, one would be unable to discern from \nreviewing any particular record whether the documented query term \nrelates to a United States person or a non-United States person. Thus, \nalthough  the  records  the  FBI  proposes  to  keep  might  fairly  be \ndescribed as records of \"each... query term,\" no particular subset \nthereof constitutes a record of \"each United States person query term.\" \nThe  Government's  interpretation  saps  of  much  significance  the \nreference in Section 702(f)(l)(B) to \"United States person[s].\" And it is \nwell-settled that \"[i]t is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every \nclause and word of a statute.\"68\nThe  Government  contends  that  our  reading  of  the  statute \neffectively  reads  the  word  \"separate\"  into  the  statute's  text-i.e., \nquerying procedures must \"include a technical procedure whereby a \n[separate] record is kept of each United States person query term used \nfor a query.\" The Government overreacts to our reading of the statute. \nDuncan v.

Rather, we simply conclude that records of United \nStates person query terms must, to the extent reasonably feasible, be \nidentifiable as such-that is, that one generally must be able to deduce \nfrom a record whether the documented query term relates to a United \nStates person.7\n0\nTo be clear, we do not understand Section 702(f)(l)(B) as setting \nforth  an  inflexible  substantive  requirement  that  FBI  personnel \nexhaustively investigate  whether every query term used  to query \nSection 702  information  relates  to a United States person.

But to the extent the procedures do \nquery \nnot require agency personnel to memorialize whether a  term relates to a \nquery \nUnited States person, they do not comport with Section 702(£)(1)(8). \n71 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(f)(1)(B) (emphasis added). \n26 \n.  - . \n-- - - - - 4 - - -\nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 26 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nIOI SZ@tttiilblli Gtt@Of J)if IOJORI r \nits personnel  to apply the presumptions concerning  United States \nperson status that are presently set forth in its proposed procedures.72 \nAnd, finally, in those cases in which the presumptions fail to provide \nan answer, United States person status might simply be unknown or \nunknowable. The FBI can address such cases consistently with Section \n702(f)(1)(B)  by, for example,  presuming that such query terms are \nUnited States person query terms or designating United States person \nstatus  as  \"unknown\"  or  \"to  be  determined.\"  These  are  merely \nsuggestions, however, and we leave the ultimate decision regarding \nhow best to comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B) to the Executive Branch. \nIn sum, we conclude that the plain text of Section 702(f)(l)(B) \nrequires some kind of technical recordkeeping  procedure whereby \nagency personnel document, to the extent reasonably feasible, whether \na query term used to query Section 702 information relates to a United \nStates person or a non-United States person. Accordingly,  the FBI' s \nproposed querying procedures, which provide no means by which FBI \npersonnel can document this information, do not comply with Section \n702(f)(l)(B). \n12  See App. 234 (September 2018 FBI Querying Procedures § ill.B at 3) \n(describing \"guidelines [that] apply in determining whether a person whose status \nis unknown is a United States person\"). \n27 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release\nTOP 9L@WE IJ)'0ffft)ft@Ol:t,'UOliOIUI \nDATE  blic Release  Page27 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\n- -\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nIb  l ■S  Z@lltL  I BUIC  tt@CI4J  It  6  2 Sittt  \nii. Statutory Context\nThe  Government  contends  that  relevant  statutory  context \nsupports  its  interpretation  of  Section  702(f)(l)(B).  We  find  its \narguments largely unavailing. \nFirst, the Government focuses on Section 702(£)(2), which was \nalso added to the statute as part  of the 2017 Reauthorization Act. \nSection 702(£)(2) requires the FBI-but no other agency-to obtain an \norder of the FISC before reviewing Section 702 information returned \nbyanarrow category of queries that (1) involve a United States person \nquery  term;  (2)  are  not  designed  to  return  foreign  intelligence \ninformation; and (3) are conducted in connection with a predicated \ncriminal  investigation  unrelated  to  national  security.73  We  are \ninformed by the Government that, before Congress passed the 2017 \nReauthorization Act, the FBI kept undifferentiated records of all query \nterms  used  to  query  Section  702  information.  According  to  the \nGovernment, Section 702(f)(2) contains a clear mandate to alter that \npreexisting  practice  in  certain  cases.  Because  the  general \nrecordkeeping requirement set forth in Section 702(£)(1 )(B) contains no \nsuch specific command, it follows (in the Government's view), that \nCongress could not have intended to compel the FBI to change its \npractice in all cases. \n73 See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(f)(2)(A). \n28 \n-\n-\n1.i�P iliGRlili:'.'filaUORwOtHNOFORN   \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 28 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\n-\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  OD-NI Authorized for Public Release \nICtI  BIJ@RE•JfJlBIH'tJR@OlI ft  @I f  QfQRJf   \nWe  draw  from  this  provision  a  different  set  of  inferences. \nSection 702(£)(2), it appears to us, is intended to address a different \nissue-compliance with the Fourth Amendment. We have previously \nheld that \"a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment's \nwarrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain \nforeign intelligence for national security purposes  and is  directed \nagainst  foreign  powers  or  agents  of  foreign  powers  reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States.\"74 But this exception \nmight  not  apply in  everyday criminal  investigations  unrelated  to \nnational  security  and  foreign  intelligence  needs.  Section  702(£)(2) \ntherefore appears to be designed to avert any constitutional challenge \nto the FBI's  conduct, and it is reasonable to assume that Congress did \nnot view it as  affecting the general recordkeeping requirement set \nforth in Section 702(f)(l)(B). In other words, rather than narrowing the \ncircumstances  in  which  the  FBI  must  employ  the  \"technical \nprocedure\"  that  Section  702(£)(1)(8)  requires,  we  may  reasonably \nunderstand Section 702(£)(2) as setting forth additional substantive \nrequirements for a  subset  of  the  queries to  which  that  \"technical \nprocedure\" should already be applied.75 In addition, insofar as Section \n74 In re Directives Pursuant to Section 105B of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, 551 F.3d 1004, 1012 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2008); cf In re Terrorist Bombings, 552 F.3d at \n167 (holding that Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement does not apply to \nsearches of United States citizens conducted outside of the United States). \n75  In any event, if the  FBI uses some  kind of mechanism to document \nwhether a query involves a United States person query term for the purposes of \n- 29  -\nI5  1 I JE@H£,:1;1Qtifllftl!ll 1!1 Uilllalf \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 29 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nTeP -'eCftl!'fh'-'l{/flftCONfNOfOftf◄ \n702(£)(2) says anything of note about recordkeeping, it makes clear that \nCongress  understood  the  FBI  to  be  capable  of  ascertaining and \ndocumenting whether a query term relates to a United States person \nbecause it is plain that, to comply with Section 702(£)(2), FBI personnel \nmust know whether a query involves a United States person query \nterm. \nSecond,  the  Government  draws  our  attention  to  Section \n603(d)(2)(A) of FISA, which exempts the FBI from being required to \nreport \"a good faith estimate  of ...  the number of search terms \nconcerning a known United States person\" and \"the number of queries \nconcerning a known United States person\" used to retrieve Section 702 \ninformation.76  The  Government  urges  that  Congress'  decision  to \nrecodify this exception in the 2017 Reauthorization Act shows that it \nintended to permit the FBI to comply with Section 702(f)(l)(B) by \nkeeping undifferentiated records.  Like the FISC, we are ultimately \nunpersuaded.  As  the FISC  observed,  the Government's argument \nassumes  that Section 702(f)(l)(B)  is  intended  only to  improve the \nagencies' ability to comply with public reporting requirements.77 But \nthe Government admits that Section 702(f)(l)(B) is also intended to \ncomplying with Section 702(f)(2), expanding that procedure to other circumstances \nwould, we think, require minimal effort. \n76 50 U.S.C § 1873(b)(2)(B),(b)(2)(C). \n77 App. 55 (FISCOp.). \n30 \n1\n161 JE@fttlJlfJJi91W81l!C!8tf/, fOFORI I\n- I  I  1  • \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 30 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Sectio-n 702 2018 Certification  OD-NI Authorized for Public Release \n• \nfO  f SECREf)}31))0fteOt'1,fOPOltflf \nfacilitate oversight by other offices of the Executive Branch, Congress, \nand the FISC over the agencies' querying practices.

Thus,  without more,  Congress's decision to recodify this \nexception does not overcome what we view as the best reading of \nSection 702(£)(1)(8). \nFinally, we tum to another provision that Congress added to \nt\nFISA in the 2017 Reauthorizaion Act, which requires the Inspector \nGeneral of the Deparbnent of Justice to report information concerning \nthe FBI' s querying practices to certain committees of the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives.78 Specifically, rmder Section 112 of the 2017 \nReauthorization Act, one year after the FISC first approves the FBI' s \nproposed querying procedures, the Inspector General must provide to \nthe  designated  committees  information  concerning,  among  other \nthings, \"[a]ny impediments, including operational, technical, or policy \nimpediments, for the [FBI] to count ... the total number of ... queries \nthat used known United States person identifiers.\"79 The Government \nargues that  this  provision  would have  little meaning if Congress \nintended Section 702(f)(l)(B) to require the FBI to track which queries \nuse United States person query terms. In the Government's view, it \nwould make little sense for Congress to require the FBI to adhere to a \n78 See 2017 Reauthorization Act,§ 112(a). \n79 Id.§ 112(b)(8)(B). \n31 \n-\n• \nI bl 3E  LKE I)) SI)) Gtt@Ghl 24C  l CRH \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 31 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nTOP 6ECRETli'611/0RCO�l,'JilQ'6QR�J \nrequirement  while  also  soliciting  information  concerning  why \nt\ncompliance might present difficulies. \nThis argument is not without force, but the opposite view is \nequally plausible.

[Section 702](f)(2)\" and \"a \ngood faith estimate of ... the number of targets of such orders.\"80 To \nenable compliance with these requirements, the FBI must document, \nat a minimum, the subset of United States person query terms that \ntrigger  the  requirements  of  Section  702(f)(2).  At  the  same  time, \npursuant to the 2017 Reauthorization Act, the Inspector General must \nreport on \"[a]ny impediments ... for the [FBI] to count ... the total \nnumber of queries for which the [FBI] received an order of the [FISC] \npursuant  to  [Section  702(£)(2)].\"81  Accordingly,  that  the  2017 \nReauthorization  Act  requires  the  Inspector  General  to  provide \ninformation concerning the difficulties the FBI faces in meeting certain \nstatutory requirements  by no means precludes  the  possibility  that \nCongress in fact intended the FBI to comply with those requirements. \nUltimately, these related provisions lend little, if any, support \nfor the Government's interpretation of the statutory text. \nu.s.c.\n80 50  § 1873(b)(2). \n812017 Reauthorization Act,§ 112(b)(8)(C). \n32 \n-~AP !'iH?f7DF:PC'Al'CAACAlt:J:<aJA12ARN-\nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 32 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section- 702 2018 Certification  O-DNI Authorized for Public Release \n'POP 81s@HESfJ'i'81;1;10RCOU)HOFOIUl \niii.

For instance, a House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence  report  concerning  the 2017  Reauthorization  Act  (the \n#House Report\") states, in reference to Section 702(£): \nThe Committee understands that certain lawmakers and \nprivacy  advocates  worry  about  the  ability  of  the \nIntelligence Community to query lawfully acquired data \nusing query terms belonging to United States persons. ... \nThe Committee is dedicated to providing assurances to \nthe American public that the procedures and processes \ncurrently in place satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and do \nnot impede on United States person privacy. ... [Section \n702(f)(l)(B)1  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not  impose  a \nrequirement that an Intelligence Community element maintain \nrecords of United States person quen; terms in any particular \nmanner, so long as appropriate records are retained and thus \n82 See N.L.R.B. v. SW General Inc., 137 S. Ct. 929, 942 (2017) (\"The [statutory] \ntext is clear, so we need not consider . . . extra-texhlal evidence\" consisting of \n\"legislative history, purpose, and post-enactment practice.\"). \n33 \n-\n• \nI bl SUCREI  \"§£) etteeuntOPOftH \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 33 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\n- -\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nTOP Sl!@IU!TJ';1SL1;1@)ft@8U:1NOfOIUJ\navailable for  subsequent  oversight.  This  [S]ection  ensures \nthat the manner in which the element retains records of \nUnited States person query terms is within the discretion \nof the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director \nof National Intelligence and subject to the approval of the \nFISC.83\nThis passage suggests that Congress enacted Section 702(f)(l)(B) \nin  part  to  respond  to  concerns  that  the intelligence  community's \nquerying practices might themselves intrude on United States persons' \nprivacy. Moreover, it makes clear that Congress envisaged that the \nrecords  Section  702(f)(l)(B)  requires  would  be  available  for  its \noversight. Records that  do not differentiate between United States \nperson query terms and other query terms serve only a single, limited \noversight goal: investigating individual queries, regardless of United \nStates person status. But such records in no way facilitate-and, in fact, \nrender impossible-oversight over the agencies' United States person \nquerying practices as a whole. It seems unlikely that Congress would \nhave sought to effectuate only the first goal using language that better \nlends itself to both. \nThe  Government  contends  that  the  FBI' s  proposed \nrecordkeeping procedures  are consistent  with  the House Report's \nsuggestion that the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence have \"discretion\" concerning \"the manner in which [an \n83 H.R.

The question here, however, is  they must \ndo so, a question on which this excerpt from the House Report is silent. \nFinally, the Government draws our attention to one sentence \nfrom the House Report, which states that \"the Committee believes that \nthe  Intelligence  Community  should  have  separate  procedures \ndocumenting their current policies and practices related to querying \nof  lawfully  acquired  FISA  Section  702  data.\"85  The  Government \ncontends that this  passage  supports the proposition that Congress \nintended  to allow  the  agencies to continue employing their then­\ncurrent practices. We disagree. Read in context, this statement plainly \nrelates to the general requirement, set forth in Section 702(f)(l)(A), that \nthe agencies document their querying procedures-something that \nCongress had never before required. But this sentence in no way \nsuggests that Congress intended to ratify those existing practices. \nOn the whole, these snippets of legislative history, which either \nsupport our view or are ambiguous at best, do not undermine the \nconclusion we draw from the text of Section 702(£)(1)(6).86\nld. \n84  at 18. \nId. \n85  at 17-18. \nSee Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

Although  the  Government's \narguments are not without some appeal, we cannot substitute either \nthe Government's policy view, or our own, for the expressed will of \nCongress.87 \nIn broad strokes the Government contends that interpreting \n., \nSection 702(£)(1 )(B) as we have today will not enhance oversight over \nthe FBI' s practices and, indeed, might hamper the FBI' s ability to carry \nout its vital missions. As to the first we respectfully disagree with the \n., \nGovernment's contention that documenting, to the extent reasonably \nfeasible, whether a query term relates to a United States person will \nnot  enhance  oversight.  Such  a  requirement  serves  a  number  of \noversight  purposes-among  others,  enabling  specific  auditing  of \nqueries that involve United States person query terms, and providing \nof the text and statutory context. If the text is dear, it needs no repetition in the \nlegislative history; and if the text is ambiguous, silence in the legislative history \ncannot lend any clarity.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \n87 See Hall v. United States, 566 U.S. 506,523 (2012) (Although \"there may be \ncompelling policy reasons\" for a proposed interpretation, \"it is not for us to rewrite \nthe statute\" in light of its \"plain language, context, and structure.\"); Florida Dep't of \nRevenue v.

Although Congress has chosen \nto  exempt  the  FBI  from  certain  public  disclosure  requirements, \nadditional transparency withln the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial \nBranches alone enhances their ability to engage in oversight and make \nwell-informed decisions concerning Section 702 programs. \nIn  addition,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  recordkeeping \nrequirement, as construed herein, will have the deleterious effects the \nGovernment identifies. The Government contends that determining \nwhether each query term constitutes a United States person query \nterm  would  drain  FBI  resources,  create  unreliable  records,  and, \npotentially, harm national security. Like the FISC, we are sensitive to \nthese concerns, which undoubtedly weigh in the Government's favor. \nBut, as we have already indicated,  we do not understand Section \n702(£)(1)(8) as imposing a burdensome substantive requirement. The \nGovernment  might  elect  to comply  with  Section  702(f)(l)(B)  in  a \nnumber of  ways,  many of which would significantly mitigate  the \nburden on agency resources and limit whatever potential harm might \nflow from adding one (largely ministerial) item to the checklist that \nFBI personnel most likely already work through when conducting \nqueriesfor investigative purposes. The only option not available to the \nGovernment is the one it proposes here-namely, a procedure that \nprovides  no  mechanism  by  which  FBI  personnel  can  distinguish \nbetween United States person query terms and other query terms. \n37 \n-\n-\nIOI■ S  ECREIHSDJJREGICJh©IORif \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 37 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the S-ection 702 2018 Certification  OD-NI Authorized for Public Release \nl'QP li'lii<w.Ril',Mli'1''0.RGObl 'blOEORN   \nv. Conclusion\nTo summarize: the requirement in Section 702(f)(l)(B) of FISA, \nthat quexying procedures \"include a technical procedure whereby a \nrecord is kept of each United States person query term used for a \nquexy,\"  is  best  interpreted  as  requiring  some  kind  of  technical \nprocedurethat requires intelligence agency personnel to memorialize, \nto the extent reasonably feasible, whether aparticular query term is a \nUnitedStates person query term. Because the FBI' s proposed querying \nprocedures  do  not  contain  any  such  technical  mechanism,  and \ntherefore create records that do not distinguish between United States \nperson que:ty terms and other query terms, they do not comport with \nSection 702(f)(l)(B). \nC. Compliance with the Requirements of FISA and the\nFourth Amendment\nThe Government also challenges the FISC' s conclusion that the \nFBI' s  querying  and  minimization  procedures  do  not  satisfy  the \nrequirements  of  FISA  and  the  Fourth  Amendment.  Because  our \nconclusion  with  respect  to  the  proper  interpretation  of  Section \n702(£)(1)(8)  will  require  the  Government  to amend  the  proposed \nprocedures pertaining to the FBI, we decline to reach this issue at this \ntime. We do, however, offer some guidance that might be of use to the \nGovernment as it undertakes the necessa:ty revisions, and to the FISC \nas it evaluates the product thereof. \nFirst, \nthe manner  in  which  an  agency  implements  existing \nminimization procedures can  be  relevant  to determining  whether \n38 \n-\nWOP ?FGPFW!:SJff@PGSSJf!IGF@Ptl \n■ \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 38 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\n-\n-\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n'JOP 6EfiMEiiflflf'QDGQJU'tIOFOPtl \nl. \nproposed  procedures  comply  with  FISA' s  requirements.  Section \n702(e)(1)  requires  the  Attorney  General,  in  consultation  with  the \nDirector of National Intelligence, to \"adopt minimization procedures \nthat meet the [statutory] definition of minimization procedures11  set \nforth elsewhere in the statute. 88 This definition requires, among other \nthings, procedures that are \"reasonably designed ... to minimize the \nacquisition  and  retention,  and  prohibit  the  dissemination  of \nnonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United \nStates persons.\"89 The Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence  must  submit  proposed  minimization  procedures  for \napproval by the FISC in connection with the certifications required by \nSection 702(h).90 In reviewing proposed procedures, the FISC must of \ncourse evaluate whether they comply with statutory requirements as \nwritten.  In  certain  circumstances,  the  FISC  can  also  consider  the \nmanner in which existing procedures have been implemented.91  But \n88 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e)(l). \na9  Id.  § 1801(h)(l); see also id. § 1821(4)  (setting forth virtually identical \ndefinition). \n90 See id. § 1881a(h)(2)(B), 0)(1)(A). \nSee \n91  App. 68 (FISC Op.)

And, it almost goes without saying, where \nthe  proposed  procedures  deviate  significantly  from  existing \nprocedures, prior practice might have little bearing on whether the \npropos�d procedures comply with FISA's requirements. \nSecond, \nwe agree with the FISC that there are some reasons to \nquestion whether the FBI has implemented its existing querying and \nminimization  procedures  in  a  manner  consistent  with  statutory \nrequirements-and, thus, whether it will do so in the future. As the \nGovernment  undertakes  to  revise  the  FBI' s  proposed  procedures \npursuant  to  our  holding  with  respect  to  the  recordkeeping \nrequirement, it might consider addressing further some of the FISC' s \nconcerns. The Government can also, if it deems appropriate, provide \nthe FISC with additional information concerning the practical effect, if \nany, of changes it has already implemented, such as the advice-of­\ncounsel requirement for \"categorical batch queries.\"92 This will enable \nthe FISC to better evaluate whether the FBI is likely to implement the \nnewly  revised  procedures  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the \nrequirements of FISA and the Fourth Amendment. \nstatutory standards is a requirement that it comply with those procedures.\"). \n92 See App. 235 (September 2018 FBI Querying Procedures § IV.A.3 at 4). \n40 \n-\n- IIO  I ■S  EClltf))SlllGICCGIIU  1If  8J8RH \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 40 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\n-\n-\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nIb  l■ S  EGCEf J)  J  I)) GRCGICJ14  01 Sith \nFinally,  the  remedy  Amici  propose-a  requirement  that FBI \npersonnel document in writing their justification for running a query \nusing a United States person query term before examining the contents \nof Section 702 information returned by such queries-appears to us a \nmodest measure that would alleviate the most significant concerns \nraised by  the  FISC.  Titls  procedure  could  have  several  potential \nbenefits.  For  instance,  the  need  to  contemporaneously  record  a \njustification  for running a  query could  motivate FBI personnel  to \ncarefully consider, in a way that existing ex post review might not, \nwhether  a  query  satisfies  the  querying  standard.  The  records \nproducedby this process would facilitate Executive Branch oversight, \nwhich currently relies principally on the memories of FBI personnel \nand whatever limited context can be gleaned from a chronological \nsample of queries. These improvements might help the relevant offices \nof the Executive Branch detect practices that do not comply with the \napproved procedures, undertake appropriate remedial measures, and, \nultimately, report on the  foregoing  to  the FISC-and, perhaps,  to \nCongress. \nOn the other side of the ledger, Amici' s proposed remedy does \nnotappear overly burdensome or likely to impede the FBI in carrying \noutthe critical tasks that help ensure our safety. The requirement does \nnot preclude FBI personnel from querying Section 702 information or \nreviewing the metadata of communications returned by such queries. \nMoreover, many queries might not return any Section 702 information, \nand,  in  such  cases,  the requirement  simply  would  not  apply.  In \naddition, the FBI' s proposed procedures already require FBI personnel \n41 \n-TOP SPCRPT11SI110RCON(MOFORN \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 41 of 43  FISC-R Opinion, Jul. 2019 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n'fOP SECftE'f//St/lORCOfiiJ'NOfORP.J \nto know the information that they would be asked to record-namely, \ntheir reason for believing that a query satisfies the querying standard. \nThe physical act of documenting this information, perhaps in no more \nthan a single sentence or  by making a check-mark next to one of \nseveral pre-written options, is unlikely to be overly onerous. As with \nthe recordkeeping requirement, we are not persuaded that complying \nwith this modest ministerial procedure will meaningfully handicap \nthe FBI's ability to carry out its missions-if, indeed, it does so at all. \nThat said, like the FISC, we decline to require the Government \nto adopt this particular measure. Accordingly, we leave the decision \nregarding whether-and, if so, how-to address the FISC's statutory \nand  constitutional  concerns  in  the  first  instance  to  the  Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence. \nIII. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we conclude that: \n(1) Section 702(f)(l)(b) of FISA, which states that procedures\nfor querying information  acquired pursuant to Section\n702  must  \"include  a  technical  procedure  whereby  a\nrecord is kept of each United States person query term\nused for a query,\" is best interpreted as requiring some\nkind  of  technical  procedure  that  requires  intelligence\nagency  personnel  to  memorialize,  to  the  extent\nreasonably feasible, whether a query term is a United\nStates person  query term.

(U) These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant\nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or \"the\nAct\"), by the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (\"FBI\"), and apply in addition to separate\nminimization procedures for the FBI adopted pursuant to subsection 702(e) of the Act.  These\nquerying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minimization\nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be\nprohibited by those minimization procedures.  FBI personnel who have completed training in\nthese procedures and the FBI's section 702 minimization procedures may query FBI systems\ncontaining uinninimized information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act to find, extract,\nreview, translate, and assess whether such information reasonably appears to be foreign\nintelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess\nits importance, or to be evidence of a crime. Authorized users with access to unminimized\nsection 702-acquired information should process the results of an appropriate query of\nunminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with the FBI's applicable section\n702 minimization procedures.\nII. (U) If the FBI determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying\nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force protection or hostage\nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, the FBI \nmay take such action immediately. The FBI will make a record of the action taken, to include \nany query term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nIll.  (U) Definitions and Presumptions \nA. (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures\n(U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms\n\"foreign intelligence information,\" \"person,\" \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\"\n(£'NF) iWhen used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that\n-----L--■ \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons. United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons.

Depending on the context, examples of \n· \n. \nUnited States person query terms may include: names or  ides·  overnment-\n.  .  ... \n·.,  rsonal or corporate identification \nnd street address, telephone, and \n,:\nUnited States person query term does not include a reference to a product  y  ran  or \nmanufacturer's name ( or related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n(e.g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 321\"). \n(U) \"Query\" means the use of one or more terms1 to retrieve the unminimized contents or\nnoncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located in an\nFBI system.  The term \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains\nunminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized\nsection 702-acquired information in response to the query either because the user has not\nbeen granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user\nwho has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve\nunminimized section 702-acquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a\nsystem user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of\n2 \nthat query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved,  or (2) examining or\nmanipulating, including by technical means, communications or documents for the purpose\nof minimizing such communications or documents.3\n(U) \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a\ncommunication.\n(U) \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated\nwith a communication, but does not include information concerning the substance, purport,\nor meaning of the communication.\n(U) The terms \"Federal Bureau oflnvestigation\" and \"FBI personnel\" refer to any\nemployees of the FBI, as well as all contractors and others authorized to work under the\ndirection and control of the FBI.\n2 \n(U) For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually\nretwned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 \n(U) For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all\ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person l .\" \n-ancnrrncaronar,:::--\n2 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 2 of 6  FBl's Section 702 Amended Querying Procedures, Aug 2019 \n\nDocument Regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nSECft:E'iYfNOfilORN \nB. (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n1.  (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown,  will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n3.  (U)  A person who at any time has been known to have been an alien admitted for \nlawful permanent residence is treated as a United States person, unless a \ndetermination that such person is no longer a United States person is made in \nconsultation with the FBI Office of General Counsel. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV. (U)  Querying Procedures \nA.  (U) Query Standard. \n1.  (U)  Each query of FBI systems containing unminimized contents or noncontents \n(including metadata) acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably \nlikely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, or evidence of \na crime, unless otherwise specifically excepted in these procedures. \n2.  (U)  For queries conducted using United States person query terms that are not \ndesigned to find and extract foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, the \nFBI will follow the procedures in subsection 702(f)(2) of FISA before accessing the \nunminimized contents of communications retrieved by such queries in connection \nwith a predicated criminal investigation that does not relate to the national security of \nthe United States, unless there is a reasonable belief that such contents could assist in \nmitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.  Consistent with \nsubsections 702(f)(2)(F)(ii)-(iii) of the Act, this restriction does not prohibit or limit \n(1) the FBI's ability to review, without a court order, the results of any query of \nsection 702-acquired information that was reasonably designed to find and extract \nforeign intelligence information, regardless of whether such foreign intelligence \n3 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 3 of 6 FBI's Section 702 Amended Querying Procedures, Aug. 2019\n\nDocument Regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\ninformation could also be considered evidence of a crime; and (2) the FBI's ability to \naccess the results of queries that were conducted when evaluating whether to open an \nassessment or predicated investigation related to the national security of the United \nStates. \n3.  (U)  Prior to reviewing the unminimized contents of section 702-acquired information \nretrieved using a United States person query term, FBI personnel will provide a \nwritten statement of facts showing that the query was reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.4  Such written statement will \ncomply with the documentation requirements set forth in Section N.B.4 below. \n(U) This section does not apply to queries conducted using United States person \nquery terms that are not designed to find and extract foreign intelligence information \nand that are conducted in connection with a predicated criminal investigation.  Such \nqueries must comply with the requirements in Section IV.A.2. \nB.  (U)  Creation and Maintenance of Query Records. \n1.  (U)  The FBI must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized content .or noncontent \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702.  Such electronic record must, at a \nminimum, include the following information: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used; \nb.  (U)  the date of the query; and \nc.  (U)  the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n2.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for an FBI system to generate an electronic record \nof each United States person query term, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance \narises that prevents the generation of such an electronic record, the FBI must generate \nand maintain a written record of each United States person query term that contains \nthe same information required for electronic records, as described above.  Before \nconducting a query in a system that does not generate an electronic record of a query, \nFBI personnel must reasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that \ngenerates an electronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, \noperational, or security reasons. \n4 (U) FBI personnel are not required to provide a written statement of facts before conducting any query \nor before reviewing the unminimized section 702-acquired noncontents (including metadata) retrieved \nusing a United States person query term. \nSECH'fffNOF'OKN \n4 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 4 of 6 FBI's Section 702 Amended Querying Procedures, Aug. 2019\n\nDocument Regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\n3.  (U)  The FBI will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner \nthat will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner.  Such records (both electronic and written) must be maintained at least five \nyears from the date the United States person query term was used.  NSD and ODNI \nwill review the FBI's queries of unminimized section 702-acquired information using \nany such query terms to ensure that they were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, or were otherwise conducted pursuant \nto one of the exceptions provided below. \n4.  (U)  The FBI shall maintain a record of each statement of facts required by Section \nIII.A.3 above in a manner that will enable oversight by NSD and ODNI. \nC.  (U)  Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection IV.A above, nothing in these procedures \nshall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the applicable Offices \nof the Inspectors General, or restrict the FBI from providing the assistance necessary for \nthese entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and nothing in these procedures \nshall prohibit the FBI from conducting queries it determines are necessary to: \n1.  (U)  the FBl's performance oflawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation ofFISA and the FBl's FISA procedures, including its section \n702 procedures.  However, the FBI shall use non-United States person query terms to \nperform such queries, unless the FBI determines that there is a particular need to use a \nUnited States person query term in such a query to conduct training on the \nimplementation of an aspect of the FBI's section 702 procedures; \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of FBI systems that process or \nstore unminimized section 702-acquired information; \n3.  (U)  comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight; \n4.  (U)  comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; \n5.  (U)  conduct vulnerability or network assessments using unminimized information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not \nor have not been compromised; \n6.  (U)  identify information that must be produced or preserved in com1ection with a \nlitigation matter; or \n7.

(U)  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 180l(h), 1821(4), and 1881a(c)(l)(A), these\n· Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (FBI) minimization procedures govern the acquisition, retention,\nand dissemination of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States\npersons that is acquired by targeting non-United States persons reasonably beli_ eved to be located\noutside the United States pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of\n1978, as amended (FISA or \"the Act\"), 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  The Attorney General, in\nconsultation with the Director ofN  ational Intelligence (DNI), has adopted these procedures after\nconcluding that they meet the requirements under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h) and 1821(4) becatlse\nthey are specific procedures that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of\nthe particular surveillance or physical search to minimize the acquisition and retention, and\nprohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United\nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate\nforeign intelligence information and otherwise comport with the statutory definition of\nminimization procedures.  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. § 403-l(f)(6), the DNI has provided\nassistance to the Attorney General with respect to the dissemination procedures set forth herein\nso that PISA-acquired information may be used efficiently and effectively for foreign\nintelligence purposes.  These minimization procedures apply in addition to separate querying\nprocedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702(f)(l) of the Act.  These minimization procedures\nshould be read and applied in conjunction with those querying procedures, and nothing in these\nprocedures permits any actions that would otherwise be prohibited by those querying procedures.\nB.

Illustrative \nexamples of raw FISA-acquired information include audio recordings of interce  ted \ncommunications (including copies thereof); soft or hard copies of e-mails \nigital images obtained \nlectronic storage media; verbatim·translations of documents or \ncommunications; and intercepted communications that have been processed into the form of \n\"tech cuts\" but have not been evaluated to determine whether the tech cuts reasonably appear to \nbe foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime.  Raw PISA-acquired \ninformation, however, does not include information the FBI has determined, in accordance with \nthese procedures, to reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to \nunderstand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a \ncrime. \n3. (U) (S,l�lf) An \"electronic and data storage system\" is any FBI application, program,\ndevice, or process that retains or provides access to raw FISA-acquired information in electronic \nform and meets the requirements in Sections III.C and 111.D.

(U)  The FBI may make raw FISA-acquired information\navailable to authorized personnel on a continuing basis for review, translation, analysis, and use \nin accordance with these procedures.  Authorized personnel may continue to access raw PISA­\nacquired information to determine whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, to be necessary to understand foreign inteUigence information or to assess its \nimportance, or to be evidence of a crime notwithstanding the fact that other FBI personnel \npreviously may have reviewed such information and determined that it did not reasonably appear \nto be foreigl). intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime at the time of such review. \n(U) FBI personnel with authorized access to raw PISA-acquired information may review,\ntranslate, copy, transcribe, analyze, summarize, and use all such information only in accordance \nwith these procedures and FISA and only as necessary for the purpose of evaluating or \ndetermining whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary \nto understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a \n6  U) For example, the action ofa system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the infonnation actually returned\n( \nto a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n7 (U) For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all instances of a\nknown United States person's name with a generic term, such a \"U.S. Person l.\" \n-\n81JCM1WNOtaOIUi \n■ \n10 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 14 of 51  FBl's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n-0--13'@M----'F--/,'P-l-0'-P-0-10---l · \ncrime.

All FBI personnel having access to information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act will be informed of and provided access to these minimization procedures. \nb. (U) Information meeting criteria. Once FBI personnel have assessed that\nraw PISA-acquired information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be \nevidence of a crime, the FBI may retain that information for further investigation and analysis \nand may disseminate it in accordance with these procedures.  Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h)(3) \nand 1821( 4 )(C), however, information.that is assessed to be evidence of a crime but not to be \nforeign intelligence information or necessary to understand foreign intelligence information may \nonly be retained and disseminated for law enforceme�t purposes. \nc. (U)  United States person identities.  Before using PISA-acquired\ninformation for further investigation, analysis, or dissemination, the FBI shall strike, or substitute \na characterization for, information of or concerning a United States person, including that \nperson's identity, if it does not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, or to be \nevidence of a crime.  Processing or analyzing FISA-acquired information within an electronic \nand data storage system or ad hoc system does not trigger this requirement.  This requirement is \nalso not triggered by transferring PISA-acquired information between or among electronicand\n_\ndata storage systems, ad hoc systems, collection platforms, or systems used solely for audits and \n-\n80CftMiflN61i361tN•  \n11 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 15 of 51  FBl's Section 702 Minimization Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n;:  oversight.  However, when FBI transfers or copies FISA-acquired information from an electronic \nand data storage system, ad hoc system, or system used for transitory retention onto a medium, \ndevice, or system that is not an electronic and data storage system or ad hoc system as defined by \nthese procedures, any information of or concerning a U.S. person, including that person's \nidentity, that is being transferred that does not meet the retention standard (i.e., reasonably \nappears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime) must be stricken or a \nsubstitution made priorto the transfer. \nd. ·(U)  Disclosure and dissemination.  The FBI may disclose or disseminate\ncopies, transcriptions, summaries, and other documents containing FISA-acquired information \nonly in accordance with the disclosure and dissemination procedures set forth in Section IV \nbelow. \nand \ne. (U) Exculpatory, impeachment,  discoverable material. The FBI shall\nretain FISA-acquired information that is not foreign intelligence information that has been \nreviewed and reasonably appears to be exculpatory or impeachment material for a criminal \nproceeding, or reasonably appears to be discoverable in a criminal proceeding, and shall treat \nthat information as if it were evidence of a crime. \nf.

It would be difficult \nto completely prevent personnel from querying data for personal reasons. As a general rnle, \ninadvertent queries of Section 702 infonnation and queries intended to retrieve finished \nintelligence reports or other FBI work product do not seem likely to return raw 702 infonnation \nor, if they happen to do so, to result in personnel examining U.S.-person infonnation contained \ntherein, the above-described queries regarding \nnotwithstanding. \n4. Factors Contributine to the Court's Concerns\nOf serious concem, however, is the large number of queries evidencin  a \nmisunderstanding of the querying standard --or indifference toward it: \nqueries were conducted against the advice of FBI OGC. That concern is heightened by three \nfactors:  (I) limitations on the govemment's oversight mechanisms; (2) the FBI's policy to \nencourage routine and maximal querying of Section 702 infom1ation; and (3) apparent \ncomplications in applying the querying standard. The Court discusses each. \nLimitations on Oversieht\na.\nAs noted above, in 2017 the FBI conducted over three million queries of PISA-acquired \ninfonnation on just one system  See Supplemental FBI Declaration at 6.

Moreover, 01 understandably devotes more resources to \noffices that use FISA authorities more frequently, so those offices \nare visited annually, id. at 35 n.42, which necessitates that some other offices go for \nperiods of two years or more between oversight visits.  The intervals of time between oversight \nvisits at a given location may contribute to lengthy delays in detecting querying violations and \nreporting them to the FISC.

FBI Policy on Queries\nIn addition to articulating the above-described querying standard, the 2016 FBJ \nMinimization Procedures require FBI personnel, to the extent reasonably feasible, to design \nqueries of Section 702 data to find and extract foreign►intelligence infonnation or evidence of \ncrime.  See 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures § III.D at 1 1. They also state it is \"a routine and \nencouraged practice for the FBI to query\" 702 infonnation in fm1herance of authorized \nintelligence and Jaw-enforcement activities, including when \"making an initial decision to open \nan assessment.\" Id. at 11 n.3.  The FISC previously approved FBI minimization procedures \ncontaining that statement prior to the disclosure of the above-described querying violations.  See \nNovember 6, 2015, Opinion at 29 n.27.  The FBI Querying Procedures do not contain the quoted \nlanguage, but the FBl's policy has not changed.  See Supplemental FBI Declaration at 6 (FBI \nuses queries, among other reasons, \"to quickly detennine whether a new tip or lead ... warrants \nopening an investigation, is related to an existing investigation,\" or requires no further action); \nid. at 7 (\"FBI encourages its perso1mel to make maximal use of queries -provided they are \ncompliant with the FBI's minimization procedures and other applicable law -in order to perfonn \ntheir work.\"). \nOn the one hand, the FBI is obligated to query Section 702 and other FJSA infonnation \nonly in circumstances satisfying a querying standard that does not apply to FBI information \ngenerally.  On the other hand, it has set up its systems to facilitate running the same query \nsimultaneously across FISA and non-FISA datasets, id. at 5, and encourages personnel to make \nmaximal use of such queries, even at the earliest investigative stages.

If 100 employees of the contractor are known to have access to \nthat technology, the \"government assesses that the FBI could run a categorical query of the \nidentifiers associated with these 100 employees as there is a reasonable basis to assess that the \nqueries would return foreign intelligence informatiort of evidence of a crime.\" Id. \nBy no stretch oflanguage could one say that an individual query for a randomly selected \none of those 100 employees would be reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence infonnation \nor evidence of crime.  The government's assessment that it nonetheless would be pennissible to \nque1y using the identifiers of all 100 employees must rest on the idea that, if those identifiers are \naggregated and run together in ostensibly a single query, there would be a reasonable likelihood \nthat foreign-intelligence infonnation or evidence of crime would be returned.

See FBI Querying Procedures § IV .A.1 at 3. \n5. The Government's Response to the Non-Compliant Queries\nThe govemment has taken steps in response to the FBT's non-compliance with the \nquerying standard.  It reports that it now emphasizes issues related to categorical query \njustifications in training, see Gov't Response at 38, and has promulgated within the FBI detailed \nguidance on querying requirements, which also focused on categorical justifications for queries. \nSee id.; July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 50.  That guidance recommended consultation with FBI \nlawyers regarding queries based on a \"categoiical reason,\" rather than an \"individual reason for \neach identifier.\"  Ju]y 13, 20 I 8, Proposed Tr. at 50. \nAs part of the amended procedures submitted on September 18, 2018, the government has \nadded to the FBI Querying Procedures a requirement in certain circumstances to consult with an \nFBI attorney regarding queries supported by categorical justifications.  That provision, which \napparently fonnalizes a version of the above-noted recommendation, states: \nPrior to reviewing the unminimzed content of section 702-acquired infonnation \nretrieved using a categorical batch que,y (as opposed to queries conducted  the \n011 \nbasis ofi ndividualized assessments), FBI personnel will obtain approva] from an \nattorney from either their Chief Division Counsel's Office or the National \nSecurity and Cyber Law Branch.  This requirement does not apply if the persons \nwhose identifiers are queried are (l) targets of lawful coJlection, (2) subjects of \npredicated investigations, or (3) in contact with targets oflawful collection or \nsubjects of predicated investigation.  Approvals to review the content returned by \nsuch queries will include a justification for the queries, the approving official, and \nthe duration of such approval. \nFBI Querying Procedures § IV.A.3 at 4 (e mphasis added). \n-rroo f:'PCDRT/(£1/IODCO'Dt,J0\\IOPOPJ\\._  Page 79 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 79 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n\"Per \n81!9t.!ft:@'P;';'.�l,rOftCON,'f(OFORN \nThe govemment apparently promulgated the enhanced guidance in June 2018. See Gov't \nResponse at 38 (guidance \"expected to be provided to appropriate FBI personnel in June 2018\"). \nThere accordingly has been insufficient time to assess its effect.  As to Section IV.A.3, the \nrequirement to consult with an attorney applies in narrow circumstances: after a categorical batch \nquery has been conducted and prior to FBI personnel's reviewing content infonnation returned \nby the query, unless one of three exceptions applies.  The government explains that the provision \nis \"tailored to focus on a particular type of query that potentially presents greater compliance risk \nand piivacy impact\" -those \"based on a categorical, rather than individualized, justification.\" \nSee September 18, 2018, Memorandum at 21.

Sept. 28, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 24, 26. \nAnalysis\n6.\nThe Court finds that the FBI's Section 702 minimization procedures, as they have been \nimplemented, are not consistent with the requirements of Section 1801 (h)(]) and (h)(3), or the \nFourth Amendment. \na. Statutoi·y Deficiency\nAs noted above, minimization procedures must be \nreasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of the particular \nsurveillance, to minimize ... the retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of \nnonpublicly available infonnation concerning unconsenting United States persons \nconsistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate \nforeign intelligence information. \n-xon PFCDJ?T//C:1//0PCOJ\\1/NOPOP?!t\"  Page 80 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 80 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n'fOf 9ElCltEl'fh'91//8ltCOP~'f,OFOftN \n§ 180 I (h)( I).  In this case, the \"purpose and technique\" of Section 702 collection involvese\ntargeting non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to obtain \nforeign-intelligence information with the assistance of communications service providers.  See \n§ 702(a ), (b) (3), (i)(l ).  Those acquisitions include the contents of communications to or from \nnon-target U.S. persons.  Queries that are in fact reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence \ninfonnation are responsive the government's need to obtain and produce foreign-intelligence \ninformation, and ultimately to disseminate such information when warranted.  For that reason, \nqueries that comply with the que1ying standard comport with § 1801 (h), even insofar as they \nresult in the examination of the contents of private commw1ications to or from U.S. persons.  On \nthe other hand, queries that lack a sufficient basis are not reasonably related to foreign­\nintelligence needs and any resulting intrusion on U.S. persons' privacy lacks any justification \nrecognized by§ 1801 (h)(l).  Because the FBI procedures, as implemented, have involved a large \nnumber of unjustified queries conducted to retrieve infonnation about U.S. persons, they are not \nreasonably designed, in light of the pu1pose and technique of Section 702 acquisitions, to \nminimize the retention and prohibit the dissemination of private U.S. person infonnation. \nWith regard to evidence-of-crime queries, the FISC has previously found that by \nproviding for minimization procedures that pennit the retention and dissemination of evidence of \ncrime for law-enforcement purposes, Section 180 I (h)(3) fairly contemplates queries reasonably \ndesigned to retum evidence of crime.  See November 6, 2015, Opinion at 32-33. The issue in \nthis case, however, is the prevalence of FBI queries that were unlikely to return evidence of crime \n(e ven though they may have been subjectively intended to do so).

It has concluded that, while the government \nhas taken constructive steps, they do not adequately justify such a finding. \nFirst, as discussed above in Part IV.C.2, many, though not all, recent misapplications of \nthe querying standard by the FBJ involved categorical batch queries.  More significantly, the \nCourt is doubtful that in practice FBI personnel will consistently channel categorical batch \nqueries into § JV.A.3 's approval process before they examine content info1111ation retrieved by \nthose queries. As stated in § IV .A.3, a query conducted on the basis of an individualized \nassessment is not a categorical batch query.  hnplementation of§ JV.A.3 will depend on the \nability of the FBI's front�Jine personnel to detem1ine which queties are supported by \nindividua1ized assessments, and therefore not subject to the approval requirement of§ IV.A.3, \nand which rely on categorical justifications and are subject to the approval requirement.  Given \nthe documented misunderstandings of the querying standard among FBI personnel, the \ngovernment's reliance on them to make those distinctions seems misplaced.  Indeed, the \npersonnel most in need of guidance from an attorney may not receive it because they have \ndifficulty in dete1111ining when they are supposed to consult with one. \n- -\nFfOP 8J.§@llJ.§GF;%101;1;'.OM!OOftl:'fl0Fi!lWl  Page 82 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 82 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nT(JI \"~cn,wsti'/6RCONiNOPORN \nFinally, the broad exceptions to Section IV.A.3's approval requirement are also of \nconcem.

Houghton, 526 U.S. 295,300 (1999)). \"The moree\nimportant the government's interest, the greater the intrusion that may be constitutionally \ntolerated.\" In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1012. \nIf the protections that are in place for individual privacy interests are sufficient in \nlight of the governmental interest at stake, the constitutional scales wi11 tilt in \nfavor of upholding the government's actions.  If, however, those protections are \ninsujficienJ. to alleviate the risks o.fgovernment error and abuse, the scales will tip \ntoward a finding of unconstitutionality. \nId. ( emphasis added). \nThe Cout1 regards the privacy interests at stake as substantial.  As described above in \nPart IV.C.3, the FBI has conducted tens of thousands of unjustified queries of Section 702 data. \nBased on the infonnation available -e.g., queries for  and for \nPage 88 \nTAP SFCPPZ?ff?J ffARGOIJ llJAFOPI \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 88 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\n-\n- '.JJIQ  Pl  ■.,I1Hs\\1Us  1W�Il I,'£  QIR  GI  I0  �I�  0I  :6I  0.IUI \npersons with access to FBI facilities - it appears that many subjects of those queries were U.S. \npersons. Beyond that, it is difficult on the record before the Court to assess to what extent U.S.­\nperson infonnation was returned ru1d examined as a result of those queries.  At a minimum, \nhowever, the reported querying practices present a serious risk of unwarranted intrusion into the \nprivate communications of a large numberof U.S. persons. \nThe Court believes that serious risk weighs substantially in the assessment of \nreasonableness.  The goal of the Fourth Amendment is to protect individuals from arbitrary \ngovernmental intrnsions on their privacy.  See Camenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2213 (\"'basic purpose\"' of \nthe Fourth Amendment \"'is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary \ninvasions by governmental officials'\") (quoting Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County \nof San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523,528 (1967)).  The FBI's use of unjustified queries squarely \nimplicates that purpose: the FBI searched for, ru1d presumably examined when found, private \ncommunications of particular U.S. persons on arbitrary grounds \nPart IV.C.3 above. \nThe government is not at liberty to do whatever it wishes with those U.S.-person \ncommunications, notwithstanding that they are \"incidental collections occurring as a result of' \nauthorized acquisitions.  In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015.  The FISCR in In re Directives relied \non the governmenfs assurance \"that it does not maintain a database of incidentally collected \ninfonnation from non-targeted United States persons\" when it held on the facts of that case that \n\"incidentally collected communications of non-targeted United States persons do not violate the \n5Jil8P BE ODOFJill%'81XODOON:'JJOf301lJJ  Page 89 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release\n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\n•or \n81!@1\\l!T;:'Olh OR@Ofl:1i8F8RP1\nFou11h Amendment.\" Id. ln this matter, while the FBI may not maintain a separate database of \nU.S.-person communications acquired under Section 702, it routinely queries raw Section 702e\ndata in order to identify and examine communications of pa1ticular U.S. persons.  Whether those \nquerying practices adequately protect the privacy of those U.S. persons, or instead unjustifiably \ninvade U.S. persons' privacy, bears on the analysis of reasonableness under the Fomth \nAmendment.  See In re Certified Question, 858 F.3d at 609 (examining intra-FBI restrictions on \naccess to information acquired pursuant to a FISA pen register/trap-and-trace authorization as \npart of assessment of Fou1th Amendment reasonableness). \nUnder the totality-of-circumstances framework, the Court must take into account \nprotections afforded by other provisions of the government's procedures and assess whether their \ncombined effect is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Those protections include \nrequirements in the targeting procedures that \"direct the govemment's acquisitions toward \ncommunications that are likely to yield foreign intelligence information\" and \"substantial \nrestrictions on the use and dissemination of infonnation derived from queries.>' November 6, \n2015, Opinion at 41-42.  Compliance with those provisions mitigates the intrusion on U.S. \npersons' privacy resulting from unjustified queries, either by limiting the scope of infom1ation \nacquired and therefore subject to querying or limiting the further use or disclosure of U.S.-person \ninfonnation retumed by queries. The Court nonetheless views as substantial the intrusion on \nU.S. persons' privacy inherent in FBI personnel's examination of infonnation-especially \ncontent information -returned by unjustified U.S.-person queries. \n'fOP 91!lCHlffh'91f>'ORCONi'fl�0FO��  Page90 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 90 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\nliQR 61iC:AJi1i ((fiiif 110:AC  ON NOEOPN \nOn the other side of the balance, it must be acknowledged that acquiring \"forei!,'11 \nintelligence with an eye toward safeguarding the nation's security serves ... a particularly \nintense interest.\" In re Certified Question,858 F.3d at 606 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nFor that reason, the FISCR has observed that \"the government's investigative interest in cases \narising under FISA is at the highest level and weighs heavily in the constitutional balancing \nprocess.\" Id. at 608.

Here, the relevant governmental action is the FBl's continuing to run queries \nwithout taking further measures to ensure they actually satisfy the querying standard FBl \npersonnel are supposed to apply. \nWhether the balance of interests ultimately tips in favor of finding the procedures to be \ninconsistent with the Fourth Amendment is a close question.  Reasonableness under the Fourth \nAmendment does not require perfection.  See In Re Directives, 551 F.3d at J 015 (\"the fact that \nthere is some potential for en·or is not a sufficient reason to invalidate\" surveillances as \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment).

Here, there are \ndemonstrated risks of serious error and abuse, and the Court has found the govenunent's \nprocedures do not sufficiently guard against that risk, for reasons explained above in the \ndiscussion of statutory minimization requirements. \n-wo» QDCDPT((OJ((ODCOIJ0JOPODne:-- Page 91 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 91 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized forPublicRelease \nFinally, for reasons explained below, the government has not made a persuasive case that \nthe documentation requirement proposed by amici, which would provide a fw1her check against \nunjustified intrusions on the privacy of U.S. persons and should also enhance oversight of FBI \nquelies, would impede the FBI's ability to respond to national-security threats.  On the current \nrecord and subject to future oversight of the FBJ's querying practices, the Court believes that its \nadoption would remedy the statutory and Fourth Amendment deficiencies discussed above. \nTI1e Court accordingly finds that the FBJ's querying procedures and minimization \nprocedures are not consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. \n7.e Amici's Documentation Proposal as a Remedy\nThe government offers§ IV.A.3 in part as an alternative to a proposal made by amici.  See \nSeptember  l 8, 2018, Memorandum at 21.  Amici propose that FBI personnel be required to \ndocument in writing their bases for believing that queries of Section 702 data using  U.S.-person \nquery tenns were reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence infonnation or evidence of crime \nbefore they examine content infonnation returned by such queries.  See Amici Brief at 69, 72. \n(Amici alternatively discussed a more far-reaching requirement to document the basis for queries \nbefore they are conducted, see July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 34, but stated at the September 28, \n2018, argument that the above-described option would be adequate. The FISC declined to adopt a \npre-querying documentation requirement in a prior Section 702 proceeding, seeNovember 6, 2015, \nOpinion at 39-41, though the record in that case did not reflect similar problems with the FBI's \nquerying practices.) \n- -\nffO  f s@eR�'fih101#8RCONs11'� OF8Wl  Page 92 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 92 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n'FOP SFJCRl!l'Fh'Sln'ORCOl'Hl'J0FOAl>I \nLike§ IV.A.3, the documentation requirement proposed by amici would apply only when \na query has returned Section 702-acquired content infonnation that FBI perso1mel wish to \nexamine. The amici proposal is further limited to U.S.-person queries. Because of those \nlimitations, it applies only to the subset of queries that are particularly likely to result in \nsignificant intrusion into U.S. persons' piivacy.  In contrast to§ IV.A.3, the documentation \nrequirement proposed by amici would impose a less onerous requirement on FBI personnel who \nwish to examine such contents (written memorialization of the basis for the query vs. attorney \napproval), but in a larger number of cases (U.S.-person queries vs. categorical batch queries). \nIn the Court's assessment, the documentation requirement proposed by amici would \nfacilitate oversight of queries likely to have intruded on U.S. persons' privacy interests by \nproviding contemporaneous documentation of why FBI personnel believed the querying standard \nwas satisfied.  The requirement to create that documentation would also help ensure that FBI \nperso1mel, in fact, have thought about the querying standard and articulated why they believe it \nhas been met.  By so doing, it would prompt FBI personnel -much more frequently than the \nattorney-approval process under § IV .A.3  to recall and apply the guidance and training they \nhave received on the querying standard.  Over time and with review by oversight personnel, those \nwritten statements may also suggest how to improve that guidance and training, or even the \nfonnulation of the standard in the querying procedures. \nThe government, however, objects that such a requirement would not be effective and \nwould unduly burden and hinder the FBI's work.  Regarding effectiveness, the government \ncontends that such a documentation requirement would not have prevented the most serious \n-\n�OP 8:ECRBT,¥Sl,¥8ROON�J9F91ltJ  Page93 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 93 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nrepo1ted instan  1-compliance, such as the queries performed at \nfor persons witl  July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 12.  In the government's estimation, the \nrelevant personnel in those cases mistakenly but genuinely thought they had a sufficient basis for \nthe queries, so they would have docwnented that basis and proceeded to examine the content \ninfonnation retrieved. See Gov't Response at 36-37; July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. at 9-10. The \nCourt has not heard from the personnel who conducted those non-compliant queries and is not \nwell positioned to assess what courses of action they would have taken if they had been obligated \nto state in writing why they thought the queries were justified. But it accords with common sense \nand experience that some persons in comparable circumstances may, as amici suggest, realize \ntheir queries \"could not be justified\" when they are required to a1ticulate the justification. See \nAmici Brief at 54. \nThe government further objects that requiring a written justification to examine the \ncontents provided in response to U.S.-person queries of Section 702 infonnation \"would \nsubstantially hinder the FBI's ability to investigate and protect against threats to national \nsecurity.\"  Supplemental FBI Declaration at 17.  Different fo1ms of hindrance are claimed. \nFirst, the government identifies burdens and potential enor costs associated with \nidentifying which tenns are U.S.-person query tenns.  Jd. at 15; July 13, 2018, Proposed Tr. \nat 13, 15.  But those are the same burdens and costs anticipated by the government with regard to \nthe statutory obligation to keep records that differentiate U.S.-person query tem1s from other \ntenns. See Part IV.B.2.c above.

The government is not, however, able to quantify that \nimpact.  Id. at 15-16. For example, given the above-described FBI recordkeeping practices, it \ncannot say how often the FBI conducts U.S.-person queries, nor can it state how often queries \nreturn content information acquired under Section 702, id. at 6 n.3, or how often FBI personnel \nreview PISA infonnation returned in response to a query. Id. at 15-16.  The government does \nacknowledge, however, that a U.S.-person query of Section 702 infonnation may not return any \nsuch inforn1ation, and even if it does, the FBI may not review it. See Gov't Response at 35 n.41. \nIn either of those situations, the documentation requirement would not apply. \nThe government nonetheless contends that \"a requirement that FBl must include a written \njustification prior to reviewing any section 702-acquired results that are returned using a U.S. \nperson query term would ... hinder the FBI's ability to perfom1 its national security and public \nsafety missions.\" Supplemental FBI Declaration at 15 (e mphasis added). But the burden \nassociated with documenting the basis for any pa1ticularquery should be minimal. FBI \npersonnel must detennine that every query they conduct is reasonably likely to return foreign­\nintelligence information or evidence of a crime before they run it.  See Gov't Response at 33-34 \n(\"The lack of a requirement for written documentation of the query justification does not mean \nthat FBI personnel are not required to have a justification for each query\" and they are \"required \n-\n-\n'JOP 66 '91Ut'J./ 'ii'' QRCQN 'l>1QEQRN  Page 95 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 95 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nT8P 91BCRl!~'J'91:'f8RCOPVNOfiOllN \nto have a justification for each query of raw PISA-acquired infonnation, as each query has to \nmeet the substantive query standard ....\" ).  For that reason, memorializing the basis for a query \nshould involve no additional research or analysis. Nor should composing the written statement \nbe time consuming. The Court contemplates a bdef statement of the query justification -in \nmany cases it should suffice to succinctly complete a sentence that starts \"This query is \nreasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence infonnation [ or evidence of crime] because ....\"  \nAt the heart of the government's objections to the documentation requirement proposed \nby amici is an understandable desire to ensure that FBI personnel can \nperform their work with the utmost efficiency and \"connect dots\" in an effort to \nprotect the national security. Given the lessons learned fol1owing 9/11 and the \nFort Hood shooting, as well as the FBI's significant reliance on queries to \neffectively and efficiently identify threat streams in its holdings, the FBI is \nextremely concerned about anything that would impede, delay, or create a \ndisincentive to querying FBI databases. \nSupplemental FBI Declaration at 7 (emphasis added).  But amici's documentation proposal \nwould in no way affect the FBI's ability to query its databases. Only if a U.S.-person query \nreturns Section 702 content infonnation and the FBI decides to review that infonnation is the \ndocumentation requirement triggered. Non-content metadata, which may help the FBI \"connect \nthe dots,\" will be immediately available without having to document the basis for a query.  And \nFBI personnel could dispense with the otherwise-required documentation if needed to protect \nagainst an immediate threat to human life. See FBI Querying Procedures§ II at 1. \nThe Court regards amici's documentation proposal as a measured and reasonable \nresponse to the statutory and Fourth Amendment deficiencies it has found in the FBI's \nimplementation of its querying standard.

Indeed, \nwhile other modifications to the procedures could have the same effect, it is difficult to conceive \nof their doing so while imposing so modest a burden on the FBI's work. \nExemptions in the Minimization and Queryine Procedures\nD.\nThe minimization and querying procedures proposed by the government contain several \nexemptions for activities relating to oversight and training, as well as activities responsive to \ncongressional mandates.  Although the Cou1t assessed that the oversight and training exemptions \nincluded in the March 27, 2018, Submission were unreasonably broad, it concludes that the \nrevised exemptions in the September 18, 2018, Submission comport with the statutory \nrequirements and the Fourth Amendment. \n1.\nExemptions for Oversight Activities\nOne broad category of exemptions proposed by the govenunent in March 20 J 8 concerned \noversight activities conducted by independent executive-branch entities or the agencies \nthemselves. \nThe first type of exemption, which is not new, addresses oversight conducted by \nindependent executive-branch entities.  This exemption is included in each of the four sets of \nminimization procedures.  For example, Section I ofNSA's proposed minimization procedures \nprovides: \"Nothing in these procedures shall restrict the lawful oversight functions of [NSD, \nODNI] or the applicable Offices of the blspectors General, or the provision by NSA of the \n- -\nTOP OH@R<81Ji{J10f;%'O1tOON:IJ.fO  FOWf  Page 97 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 97 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\n-\nIe, \"l!!elll!J II  I JJ!

See FBI Que1ying Procedures§ IV.Cat 5; NSA Querying Procedures§ IV.Cat 5; CIA \nQuerying Procedures§ JV.Cat 4; and NCTC Querying Procedures§ JV.Cat 4. \nThe second type of exemption -for oversight conducted by the agencies themselves -\nwas quite broad as initially proposed by the government.

See Gov't Response \nat 21 ( asserting \"a strong government interest in supervising personnel to mitigate the risk of•· \nnon-compliance by government employees accessing raw section 702 infonnation\"); id. at 43 \n(the exemption \"permits the government to engage in essential oversight activities that in fact \npromote the privacy interests of U.S. persons\").  The government also contended that the \nproposed exemption provided greater specificity without expanding the scope of exempted \nconduct as previously approved by the FlSC. See Gov't Response at 42-43. \nThe Cou11 did not accept the govemment's premise that the proposed modifications \nresulted in exemptions that were no broader than those previously approved.  Although similar \nlanguage did appear in previously approved minimization procedures, the govenunent did not \ndisclose, nor did the Court recognize, how broadly the government understood \"lawful oversight \nfunctions\" until June 2017.  In an attempt to mitigate the scope of the minimization violations \nraised by the FBI's retention of umninimized Section 702-acquired infom1ation in repositories \ncontainin  lassified email and instant messages (see Part IV.E.2 below), the \ngovernment articulated a view of\"lawful oversight functions\" that spanned a wide range of \n-\n-\nWOPH  JUi11UiTf!lilUORCOtI0JOFOPN  Page99 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 99 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\n1\n'Ji18P SJ3CIU3ifW81,'f8ROONfl410F81lN\ndisparate functions, such as overseeing compliance with federal records-management \nrequirements, identifying executive-level email messages subject to an archiving requirement \nimposed by the National Archives and Records Administration, and conducting \nSee Report Regarding Retention of Raw FISA-Acquired Jnfonnation in Certain FBI Special \nPurpose Systems, June 16, 2017, at 4-5, 10-12.  The Court, moreover, agreed with amici \nregarding the unjustified breadth and lack of specificity of the lawful-oversight exemption \ninitially proposed by the government. \nIn response to those concerns, the government significantly modified the proposed \nexemption.  In the modified procedures submitted on September 18, 20 I 8, it described more \nparticularly the types of activity conducted by each agency that constitute lawful-oversight \nfunctions. For example, the FBJ's modified procedures identify the following types of activity as \nlawful-oversight functions: (1) review of Section 702-acquired infonnation the FBI detennines is \nnecessary to remediate a potential spill of Section 702-acquired information; (2) review, \nretention, and disclosure of Section 702-acquired infonnation subject to destruction, including \nunder these minimization procedures; and (3) review and retention of umninimized Section 702-\nacquired infonnation contained in employee electronic communications by the FBI's Inspection \nDivision, as part of its record of what it has provided to the Office of the Inspector General.

IOPBftff \nPrior minimization procedures under Section 702 did not have a comparable exemption \nfor training, which the government proposed in March 2018 after numerous instances of queries \nconducted during training that did not comply with the FBI minimization procedures. SeeMarch \n27, 2018, Memorandum at 8 n.9. The Couii notes that the practice of conducting queries of \nunminimized Section 702-acquired information that do not meet the querying standard during \ntraining was not limited to isolated mistakes, see, e.g., Jan. 5, 2018, Notice at 2; May 2, 2018, \nNotice at 2, but appears to have been a systemic practice that went largely undetected for years. \nSee Jan. 18, 2018, Notice at 2-3 (reporting that since 2011, a unit in FBI's \nad been routinely conducting training sessions with FBI employees on the use \nof databases containing PISA-acquired information, including Section 702 information, during \nwhich trainees were asked to conduct queries using tenns provided by the trainers, which \ngenerally involved the use of names of former subjects of FBI investigations as query terms). \nAmici objected to the provisions proposed in March 2018 insofar as they sought a \nwholesale exemption from otherwise-applicable querying, retention, and dissemination rules. \nSee Amici Brief at 61-63, 82-84; Amici Reply at 13-16. Specifically, amici questioned whether \neffective training really required the use ofU.S.�person query tenns, see Amici Brief at 62, or \ndepartures from retention and dissemination standards.  Id. at 83.  Amici also noted that \"the \nprocedures do not assign any responsibility for training, provide any guidance as to what it \n14.. \nshould entail, or describe how it must be designed .... \"  at 61. \nThe government responded that queries \"conducted for training purposes promote both \nthe government interest in ensuring an effective workforce while simultaneously protecting the \n'fOf SECftlf'fh'Sth'ORCONfP �OF0Rfi  Page 104 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 104 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\nTAP SFCPETfffl((QPCODI'NOWPN \ninterests of U.S. persons by reducing the risk of non-compliant use or disc1osure of sensitive \ndata.\" Gov't Response at 19. That rationale was undercut by the breadth of the provisions, \nwhich by their tenns were not limited to training that pertains to protecting U.S.-person \ninformation. The government also disclaimed any intent to use the exemptions to retain \ninformation otherwise subject to destruction requirements or to make otherwise prohibited \ndisseminations.  Id. at 41-42. \nIn response to concerns regarding the breadth of the proposed training exemption raised \nby amici and the Cou1i, the government narrowed the training exemption in the procedures in \nthree significant ways.  First, the training exemption in the minimization procedures was \nnarrowed to only permit deviations from procedures goveming access and review of information, \nand limited those deviations to only those reasonably necessary for effective training.  See. e.g. . \nSeptember 18, 2018, NSA Minimization Procedures§ 2(b) at 2; September 18, 2018, FBI \nMinimization Procedures § l.G at 4; September 18, 2018, NCTC Minimization Procedures § B. l \nat 5.  The training exemption in the CIA minimization procedures was removed after the CIA \ndetennined that such an exemption was unnecessary.  See September 18, 2018 Memorandum \n> \nat 6.  In addition, the government limited the exemption for training queries to quedes the agency \ndetennines are necessary to the training of its personnel regarding proper implementation of \nFISA and FISA procedures, and to pennit the use ofU.S.-person identifiers to perform such \nqueries only when there is a particular need to do so in the conduct of such training.  See FBI \nQuerying Procedures§ IV.C.1 at 5; NSA Querying Procedures§ IV.C. l at 4; CIA Querying \nProcedures§ IV.CJ at 4; NCTC Querying Procedures§ JV.C.1 at 4. \n- -\n$OP iGGAsi'fHilUQUCQNNOFORN  Page 105 \n•  I  I.

In light of the long-tenn non-compliance with the querying \nstandard during training sessions conducted by the FBI's \nhowever, it appears prudent to clarify the Court's understanding of the limited exemption from \nthe querying procedures sought for queries conducted using U.S.-person query tenns deemed \nnecessary for effective training.  It is not apparent why U.S.-person query terms that are known to \nobjectively meet the general querying standard (i.e., reasonably likely to retrieve foreign­\nintelligence information or evidence of a crime) should not be used whenever U.S.-person query \nterms are necessary to effective training.  Trainers should pre-select U.S.-person query tem1s \nknown to return foreign-intelligence infom1ation to prevent any unnecessary querying ofU.S.­\nperson identifiers unassociated with national-security investigations.  The deviation from the \nquerying standard for training queries should be understood to permit the use of queries \nconducted for training rather than foreign-intelligence purposes, but which nevertheless are \nreasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence infonnation or evidence of a crime. \nExemptions for Responding to Congressional Mandates\n3.\nEach set of proposed minimization procedures includes new language regarding agency \ncompliance with congressional mandates that would require the agency to deviate from \notherwise-applicable rules.  The new language describes the types of process that would bigger \nthis exemption as \"a subpoena or similar process consistent with congressional oversight. \"  See \nSeptember 18, 2018, NSA Minimization Procedures§ 2(b)(3) at 2 (\"Nothing in these procedures \nshall restrict: ... the retention, processing, analysis, or dissemination of infonnation necessary to \nPage 106 \nTOD £J?CDFTf/Slf/OPCObI0TOFOPJ!::. \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 106 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\n5F8P SE@llflif:':'81s1f81l08PUPI8  fl8ft,r \ncomply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific congressional mandate, \nsuch as a subpoena or other similar process consistent with congressional oversight\") ( emphasis \nadded); see also September 18, 2018, FBI Minimization Procedures § J.G at 4; September 18, \n2018, CIA Minimization Procedures§ 6.h at 4-5; September 18, 2018, NCTC Minimization \nProcedures § A.6.d at 4.

The Court approved the \nrevised language hut reiterated its expectation that the provision be narrowly interpreted, id., and \ndirected the government to provide prompt written notification of any instance in which an \nagency acted in contravention of othe1wise-applicable minimization procedures in reliance on \nthat provision. See id. at 96-97. \nTo date, the government has not relied on the exemption for activities responsive to a \nspecific congressional mandate.  The government did, however, receive a congressional request \nto calculate the number of communications of U.S. persons that have been acquired pursuant to \nSection 702.  That request \"was not in the fom1 of a subpoena or other legal process\" and \ntherefore would not have constituted a legal mandate for purposes of the exemption. See id. \nat 54.  The govemment asserted, however, that any action it undertook in response to the request \nin contravention of otherwise-applicable minimization requirements would be pe1mitted under \nthe lawful-oversight exemption.  Id.  Although the Court believed both provisions could be \nclearer, it did not take issue with the government's interpretation.  The Comi did, however, direct \nthe government to provide prompt notification of any instance in which an agency acts in \ncontravention of otherwise-applicable minimization requirements to respond to an oversight \nrequest from any outside entity other than the executive-branch entities specified in the \nprocedures.  See M.. at 55, 97.  The government filed a notice of such actions taken in an effort to \nrespond to the above-described congressional request.

March 27, \n2018, NSA Minimization Procedures § 1 at 1), amici asse11ed that the exemption concerning \ncongressional mandates did not adequately protect privacy interests because it was not clear \nwhether a letter from a single member of Congress could be considered a mandate for purposes \nof the exemption. See Amici Brief at 6 7.  Amici also recommended that the Court's \ninterpretation of the tenn as directives in \"the fonn of a subpoena or other legal process\" be \nadded to the querying procedures.  Id. at 67-68. And, given the government's historical intent to \nrely on the \"lawful oversight function\" exemption when a congressional request for infonnation \ndoes not qualify as a \"mandate,\" amici argued that the congressional-mandate exemption \nappeared to be superfluous, unless it could be narrowed in a way that made it distinct from the \n\"lawful oversight\" exception.  Id. at 68. \nIn response to these concerns, the government proffered the revisions to the \ncongressional-mandate language noted above -i.e., adding the descriptor \"such as a subpoena or \nother similar process consistent with congressional oversight\" in both the minimization \nprocedures and querying procedures.  The Court believes that the requirement that such process \nbe \"consistent with congressional oversight\" sufficiently circumscribes the type of mandate \nsubject to the exemption. \n-\n-\nFfOP OOOROIFOBIX81l@0Pl{l'l0F9R.l1  Page 109 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 109 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\nIO  f SECRE I})  $i})bkCOMl◄OIIOftl4 \nThe Court also believes that the modifications made to the lawful-oversight functions \nprovision (discussed above) help claiify the respective spheres of that exemption and the \nexemption for specific congressional mandates: responding to a congressional request is not \namong the specified lawful-oversight functions, and the provision pennitting deviations \nnecessary to the conduct of unspecified lawful-oversight functions only applies to such functions \nof the agency over its personnel and systems.  See, e.g. . September 18, 2018, FBI Minimization \nProcedures§ I.Hat 5.  Should an agency rely on this provision to deviate from generally \napplicable rules to respond to a request from a member of Congress, it would be required to \nconsult with NSD and ODNI beforehand and report promptly to the FISC the specific oversight \nactivity involved. Id. § J.H at 5-6.  Any such submission should also explain why the action \ntaken constitutes lawful oversight of the agency's personnel or systems. \nThe Cou11 is satisfied that the congressional-mandate provisions and lawful-oversight \nprovisions of the procedures as now proposed adequately address the concerns raised regarding \nthe potentia] breadth of the congressional-mandate exemption.  Consistent with prior approvals, \nhowever, the Cou11 will require the government to promptly report the circumstances of any \ndeviation from applicable minimization or querying procedures taken in reliance on the \ncongressional-mandate provision. \nOther· Changes to the FBI Minimization Procedures\nE.\nThe government proposes changes to the FBI's minimization procedures conceming \nretention of Section 702-acquired metadata and retention of unminimized Section 702 \n-\n16f I OE@llt!lfiJl110f;%18R88fl1'Ji8P8R:ll  Page 110 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 110 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \ninfonnation in copies of emails and instant messages in  he Court assesses \neach proposal below. \n1. Retention of Metadata\nIn assessing the metadata proposals, it is useful to disting1.1ish between provisions relating \nto the use of metadata for link analysis and those relating to que1ies for other purposes. \na. Metadata Used for Link Analysis\nSection IIJ.G.1 of the 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures currently exclude Section 702-\nacquired metadata in systems used solely for link analysis from the retention timetables that \ngenerally apply to raw Section 702 infonnation in electronic storage.  Sec 2016 FBI \nMinimization Procedures§ Ill.G.1 at 22.  The govemment seeks to modify Section IIJ.G to \npennit the FBI to indefinitely retain such metadata for purposes of link analysis on all electronic \nand data-storage systems and ad hoc systems.  See September 18, 2018, FBI Minimization \nProcedures§ III.G.2 at 32.  This change would hannonize the FBI's Section 702 minimization \nprocedures with a parallel provision of the FBI's minimization procedures applicable to \nelectronic surveillance and physical search under Titles I and 111 of FISA, which the Court \napproved in May 2016.  See May 17, 2016, Opinion at 46-48. \nOne incident of FBI over-retention of Section 702-acquired metadata was reported du1ing \nthe prior authorization period and is worth noting here.  In imp]ementing the change allowing \nindefinite retention of metadata acquired pursuant to Title l and III, the FBI mistakenly \nreconfi red its systems to eliminate the time Hmits on retention for all FISA-acquired metadata, \ngu\nincluding Section 702-acquired metadata that should have aged off systems not used solely for \n-\n-\n'f@P Sl!@IU�'tW81,�tOft00Pf/NOPORPJ  Page 11 J \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 111 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 7022  018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\nIOI ■S  ECR£1))31))0REUIC140I OICl14 -\nlink analysis.

The \nFBI remediated the violation by limiting access to the over-retained Section 702-acquired \nmetadata to a tool used solely for link analysis.  See Supplemental Notice of Compliance Incident \nInvolving Retention of Raw Section 702-Acquired Metadata by FBI, July 2, 2018, at 2-3.  That \nrestriction would become unnecessary if the Court approves the proposed modification to Section \nIII.G to pennit indefinite retention of Section 702-acquired metadata on systems other than thosee\nused so]ely for link analysis. \nIn suppo1t of the modification to the FBI Title I and 1II minimization procedures \nrequested in 2016, the government argued that the limitations on retention periods for FISA­\nacquired metadata based on the nature of the system on which the metadata resides impaired the \nFBI's ability to use metadata in data-storage systems not solely used for link analysis without \ncommensurately increasing privacy protections, and that the ability to conduct link analysis of \nmetadata in other systems would enhance the FBI's capacity to make connections about targets \nand their networks.  See Gov't Mot. to Amend Standard Minimization Procedures for FBI \nElectronic Surveillance and Physical Search Conducted Under FISA, May 17, 2016, at 35-38. \nThe Court concluded that the FBl's compliance with the querying standard as well as other \nprotections set fo1th in the applicable minimization procedures strikes a reasonable balance \n- T  P .illf E 11 lllf 11.'iU ii lilll P RilTPiAIOAflf  Page 112 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 112of138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nbetween the government's foreign-intelligence needs and the protection of U.S. persons' privacy, \nand approved the modification.  SeeMay 17, 2016, Opinion at 47-48. \nThe government presents similar arguments now. See March 27, 2018, Memorandum \nat 71-73. When evaluating the government's current request to add Section 702-acquired \nmetadata to the cache of infom1ation indefinitely retained on all electronic-data storage and ad \nhoc systems, the Court must consider the same governmental and privacy interests in relation to \nthe protections afforded by the applicable procedures. \nThe FBl's procedures seek to protect privacy in a variety of ways. Most pe1iinent to the \nrequested modification is the requirement that FBI personnel may only conduct queries of \nSection 702-acquired infonnation that are \"reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence \ninfonnation\" or \"evidence of a crime.\" FBI Querying Procedures§ IV.A.I at 3.  That standard \napplies to queries of Section 702-acquired metadata, not just content information.  (For reasons \ndiscussed in Pa1t IV.B above, the Court has found the FBI's querying practices deficient and is \ncontemporaneously ordering the government to correct that deficiency.)  ln addition, any \ndissemination of metadata acquired under Section 702 that is of or concerning a U.S. person \nmust meet the criteria of Section IV of the September 18, 2018, FBI Minimization Procedures, \nand disclosure for law-enforcement purposes must comply with Section III.H .2 of those \nprocedures. \nConsistent with the May 2016 approval of the FBI's standard minimization procedures \nfor electronic surveillance and physical search, the Court finds that the FBI's proposed Section \n702 minimization and querying procedures provide sufficient protection for U.S.-person privacy \n- -\nTOP Ol!@ftl!Ffl/J10M18R@8f J:'Jlf8  F8RJf  Page 113 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 113 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\n,er Sft@ttft l111s1,reR@Of4:'f4o  roRH\n7P\nconcerns related to the indefinite retention of Section 702-acquired metadata on all FBI data-\nstorage and ad hoc systems when balanced against the important and substantial interests asserted \nby the government.  The Court notes, however, that for purposes of evaluating Section 702 \nminimization procedures, the diminished privacy interest in non-content infonnation generally \nrecognized (including by amici, seeAmici Brief at 73), does not equate to no privacy interest. \nAnd, in a digital era in which U.S. persons share an expanded amount of data electronically, the \ntype and volume of metadata associated with U.S. persons' communications acquired under \nSection 702 may also expand.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the type of metadata available \nfor querying across all FBI data-storage and ad hoc systems, particularly when retained \nindefinitely and aggregated over longer periods of time, could provide a cache of infonnation the \nuse of which might implicate greater privacy concerns.

See 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures § III.G. l .a at 22.  Infonnation that has been \nreviewed but not identified as meeting the retention standard -i.e., infonnation that reasonably \nappears to be foreign-intelligence infonnation, to be necessa1y to understand foreign-intelligence \ninformation or assess its impmtance, or to be evidence of a crime -must be access-restricted \nafter ten years and purged after fifteen years, unless a specific extension is obtained.

Retention on Email and Instant-Messa\nThe government seeks modifications to the FBI's 702 minimization procedures that \nwould permit the FBI to retain unminimized Section 702 infom1ation in certain repositories that \ndo not comply with the FBI's current minimization procedures.  The government seeks these \nmodifications as part of an effort to address such noncompliance, which was first reported to the \nCouit in the context of infonnation acquired pursuant to Titles I and III of FISA in December \n2016. \n-\nTOP 8@Clt@'tW81X8RCON,'P�8f'8Wl  Page 116 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 116 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nTor ~~Cltl!fMSIMt,ftCONtN0¥'6ft\"N \nIn December 2016, the government infonned the Court that FBI systems containing \nclassified email and instant messages might be retaining unminimized FISA information in \nviolation of FBI' s standard minimization procedures. See April 26, 2017, Opinion at 88 n. 70.  In \nMarch 2017, the government identified the same systems as presenting compliance issues under \nthe FBI's 702 minimization procedures. SeeQuarterly Report to FISC Concerning Compliance \n,\nMatters Under Section 702 of FISA, Mar. 17, 2017 (\"March 2017 Quarterly Report ,) at 78-79.e\nAccording to that report, all email messages on the FBl's secret-level email system are \netained i  naintained by the FBI' \nFBI in responding to discovery requests.

See Supplemental Information \nRegarding Retention of Raw PISA-Acquired Infonnation in Certain FBI Special Purpose \nSystems, Dec. 14, 2017, at 2.  The government further advised that the FBI was working on a \nsolution that would require  instant messages and emails (e xcept for those subject to \nlitigation holds) to age off within five years.  See id. at 2-3.  Recognizing these measures would \nnot bring the FBI into full compliance with the minimization procedures, the govemment advised \nthe Court it also intended to seek modifications to the applicable procedures.  See id. at 3. \nIn the March 27, 2018, Submission, tl1e government proposed changes to the FBJ's \ncurrent Section 702 minimization procedures.  The first change would prohibit the further \nplacement of unminimized Section 702-acquired information in classified-email and instant­\nmessage systems.  See March 27, 2018, Memorandum at 81-82.  Even though the FBI assesses \nthere is still an operational need to place such information on classified email systems, the \nrovemment is prepared to take that step because of its inability to delete information from the \nmail system and instant-message repositories in confonnance with the generally \napplicable retention limits while stiU retaining infonnation subject to a litigation hold.  See id. \nat 81-82.  Because the non-compliant systems will not ingest any additional unminimized Section \n702-acquired information, the volume of information \"over-retained\" in those systems willa\neffectively be capped. \n-\n-\n130P 6fii!IUii7c'lil'.'.ORCCllltJOEOPtl  Page 118 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 118 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nWith regard to info1mation already in  mail system and instant-message \nrepositories, the govemment contends that it is not currently possible to globally search for \nmessages containing unminimized Section 702-acquired infonnation.  Id. at 82-83.  The \ngovernment therefore proposes two new provisions to the FBl's Section 702 minimization \nprocedures, which would permit the indefinite retention of unminimized Section 702-acquired \ninfonnation on these systems notwithstanding othe1wise-appiicable retention limits. See \n•  I  \"  . \"I  \" \nystem\") and § III.F.6 at 31-32 (''FBI-Designated \nSystems\") (e xempting those systems \nfrom specified retention rules).

Id. at 30-32. \nFinally, FBI personnel authorized to access these repositories may do so only \"to assist in \ninvestigations, and to respond to inquiries related to records management and discovery,\" and \nmay only query those systems to find and provide infonnation, which may include raw FISA-\nPage 119 \nTAD £FCDFTI/SI//OPCA7'r:1!NOFOPLJ \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 119 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nacquired infonnation, in furtherance of such inquiries, functions, and investigations.  Id.  Any \nqueries in those repositories must also comply with the querying standard described above.  Id. \nAmici expressed several concerns regarding the government's proposal, including lack of \nspecificity regarding who may have access to  mail system and instant-message \nrepositories, the purposes for which those repositories are used, and the justification for \nexempting them from U.S.-person masking requirements. SeeAmici Brief at 92-94. Amici also \nrecommended that the FBI be required to provide a w1itten statement justifying access.  Id. at 94. \nThe Cowi shares amici's concerns to some extent but is also cognizant of the general \nnature and purpose of these systems, which do not include the retention ofumninimized Section \n702 information in any amount approaching the quantity found in systems primarily used by the \nFBI for analytical and investigative work.  ln that light, the proposed modifications to the FBI's \nminimization procedures greatly mitigate the potential impact of indefinite retention of \numninimized Section 702 infonnation in those systems. The necessity of categorically \nexempting them from any limits on retention, however, is not apparent.  The Court will t11erefore \napprove proposed Sections l1I.F.5 and III.F.6 subject to the following: in the event the FBI \nrecognizes unminimized Section 702-acquired infonnation in a system defined by Section JII.F.5 \nor IJI.F.6, and seeks to retain such information in that system, the govemment shall report in its \nnext quarterly report concerning compliance matters under Section 702: ( 1) whether the \ninfonnation could be retained on an FBI classified-email or instant-messaging system as \ndescribed in Section lJJ.F.4, or in connection with litigation matters as described in Section \nPage 120\nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 120 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n- -\n• \nIOI SECICEl))SJ))Gfl@O:tll!GlGIGt \nIIl.1.3; and (2) if not, the reason retention of the infonnation in that system is necessary to the \npurposes served by the system. \nConclusion\nF.\nFor the reasons stated in Parts JV.Band VI .C above, the Coui1 finds that the FBJ \nQuerying Procedures do not comply with the recordkeeping requirement at § 702(f)(l )(B) and \nthat, in view of the FBI's querying practices, the FBI Querying Procedures and FBI Minimization \nProcedures do not, as implemented, satisfy the definition of \"minimization procedures\" at 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801 (h) and are unreasonable under the Fou11h Amendment. \nIn other respects, the government's querying and minimization procedures, including \nthose provisions examined in Parts JV.D and IV.E above, comport with applicable statutory \nrequirements and the Fourth Amendment. In particular, the changes to the FBI Minimization \nProcedures that provide more detailed guidance on the storage and handling of infonnation on \nvarious types of systems and related organizational changes to those procedures, see March 27, \n2018, Memorandum at 43-70, 74-75, present no impediment to making those findings. \nV. OTHER NON-COMPLIANCE\nAlthough the other instances of non-compliance reported by the government do 119t beare\nsignificantly on the Court's disposition of these matters, it is desirable to touch briefly on the \ncurrent status of two additional matters discussed in the April 26, 2017, Opinion, as well as two \nmore recent matters. \n- -\nli'OP OD ODlili'ff  lilff OR QQ)lI i, IQECRtl  Page 121 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 121 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized forPublicRelease \nA.\nIncidents Addressed in the April 26, 2017. Opinion\nSeveral significant compliance issues were addressed in the Apiil 26, 2017, Opinion, four \nofwhich were not fully resolved at the time of the Opinion: (1) issues a1ising from NSA's \nupstream co11ection of Internet communications, see April 26, 2017, Opinion, at 78-81 ; \nkt \n(2)eimproper disclosure of unminimized Section 702 infonnation by the FBI,  at 83-87;e\nkt \n(3)econcerns about the fr uency of NSA's post-tasking review of contents,  at 75-78; ande\neq\n(4)ethe potential over-retention of unminimized Section 702 infonnation by the FBIe\nId. at 87-89.  The first and fourth issues are discussed above in Part III.A and \nPart IV.E.2, respectively.  The other two are discussed briefly below. \n1. Freguency of NSA's Post-Taskin¥ Review of Contents\nNSA 's targeting procedures require that analysts take reasonable steps to confirm that a \nselector continues to be used by a non-U.S. person located outside the United States.  Such steps \nmay include content review, as weJI as ascertaining whether a tasked facility is being used inside \nee NSA Targeting Procedures§ II at 6-7.  NSA's targeting \nprocedures provide that content review \"will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence \nrequirements and priorities\" and do not require analysts to review the contents of \ncommunications acquired from tasking a particular selector at fixed intervals.  See id. at 7.  The \ngovernment has advised the Court, however, that NSA fol1ows a policy whereby such content \nreview is perfonned no later  fter the first acquisition and at intervals of \n'FOP 86CR6'F/,'6lh'QACQl'J,1l'IQF8R\"l  Page 122 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 122 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \nno more th a  1ereafter. See Update Regarding Post-Targeting Content \nReviews, Sept. 13, 2016, at 2. \nAs indicated in the April 26, 2017, Opinion, the Court has had concerns about the \ngovemment's ability to monitor analysts' compliance with this policy.  See April 26, 2017, \nOpinion at 76-77 (citing Supplement Letter Regarding Post-Targeting Content Reviews, Mar. 13, \n2017 (indicating that NSA ha  or monitoring compliance with the policy \nin only one of its Section 702 repositories and therefore does not comprehensively monitor or \nvelify analysts' compliance with the policy)). To address the Court's concern, the government \nundettook to include in its quaiterly reports any instances in which a failure to conduct timely \ncontent review in accordance with this policy was discovered, whether or not such failwe \nresulted in a violation of the targeting procedures themselves (e.g., a delayed detasking resulting \nfrom the failure to conduct timely post-targeting content review).  April 26, 2017, Opinion at 77. \nThe infonnation submitted in the six quarterly repo11s filed since April 2017 revealed \nseveral instances in which NSA did not comply with the policy, only a small fraction of which \nled to violations of the targeting procedures.  See, e.g., Quarterly Report to FISC Concerning \nCompliance Matters Under Section 702 of PISA, Sept. 14, 2018 (\"September 2018 Quarterly \nf failure to conduct timely post-targeting content review, \nikely resulted in delayed detasking); see also Quarterly Report to FISC Concerning \nCompliance Matters Under Section 702 of FISA, June 15, 2018 (\"June 2018 Quarterly Report\") \nat 101 (reporting  f failure to conduct timely post-targeting content review, \nssociated with delayed detaskings); Qua1terly Report to FISC Concerning \n-xon  Page 123 \nSFCPFT/JSI/{ODCONNOFOPI:'-\nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 123 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n-\n-\nSfi0P 81UiJllliTi!JIl 8II 1l11QllOON:'tiOfQIUl \nCompliance Matters Under Section 702 of FISA, Mar. 16, 2018, at 91 (reportin \nfailure to conduct timely post-targeting content review  ssociated with \ndelayed detaskings); Quarterly Report to FISC Concerning Compliance Matters Under Section \n702 of PISA, Dec.

See Supplemental Letter Regarding Post Targeting \nContent Reviews, June 12, 2018, at I. \nDespite these setbacks, the Couit does not view the reported deviations from the policy as \npresenting significant concems, principally because ( 1) only a small fraction of the deviations \nfrom NSA's post-tasking content review policy resulted in an improper delay in detasking; and \n(2)ethe number of missed or untimely reviews repo1ted, regardless of whether a delay ine\ndetasking resulted, is small when viewed in relation to the total number of cuffent taskings.  See, \nM:., September 2018 Quarterly Report at 1, 97 (repo1ting  ·cilities under \ntask at any given time between June 1, 2018, and August 31,201 \ntimely posMargeting content review during the same period).  The Court notes, however, that \ncompliance with NSA's post-targeting content-review policy remains an area susceptible to \nimprovement. The govemment is encouraged to continue to explore additional means of \nprompting analysts to conduct the content reviews required by NSA's policy ai1d, to the extent \nthe FBI or the CIA is responsible for conducting such review, to ensure compliance with the \npolicy.  The government is also expected to continue to report instances of non-compliance with \nthe policy in its quarterly reports. \n2. \nThe April 26, 2017, Opinion also discussed  he FBI allowed \nunauthorized personnel to access Section 702 infonnation, only one of which presented a \ncontinuing issue of concern to the Court.  See April 26, 2017, Opinion at 83-87.

At the time of the Court's April 2017 decision, \neturned the infonnation in question to the FBI, but the FBI still planned \npersonnel to install the software on an FBl system.  See April 26, 2017, Opinion at 86.

SeeApril 26, 2017, Opinion at 98. \nOn June 8, 2017, the government reported that its investigation had revealed no \nadditional instances of improperly accessed, unminimized Fl SA-acquired information on FBI \nsystems between 2008 and March 20 I 7.  See Supplemental Response Regarding Improper \nDisclosures by FBI of Raw FISA-Acquired lnfonnation, Including Section 702-Acquired \nInfomrntion, June 8, 2017, at 2.  The government also reported  ot installed th.e \nsoftware and undertook to infonn the Court of the circumstances o \nat 4. \nThe results of the FBJ's investigation reported in June 2017 eased the Court's concerns \nregarding the possibility of further noncompliance with access restrictions.

New Compliance Issues\nln addition to the incidents of non-compliance concerning querying practices and over­\nretention of Section 702-acquired information discussed above, the government has identified a \nnumber of other incidents of noncompliance with the applicable procedures.  For example, there \nhave been several instances in which NSA has tasked selectors under Section 702 without \nconducting the necessary foreignness checks, failing to perfonn timely foreignness checks (i.e., \nthe results of a foreignness check had grown stale by the time the selector was tasked), or failing \nto consider the totality of circumstances when making a foreignness detennination.  See. e.g., \nSeptember 2017 Quarterly Report at 6-41.  In other instances, the govemment failed to timely \ndetask accounts because of human error, staffing issues, communications failures between \nagencies, or misunderstandings of the ru1es. See, e.g. • December 2017 Quarterly Report at 28-63. \nNotices filed over the last year also indicate that the FBI continues to encounter difficulty with \nthe timely establishment of review teams, which its minimization procedures require when a \nSection 702 target has been charged with a federal crime, see, e.g., Supplemental Notice of \nCompliance Incident Regarding Two Section 702-Tasked Facilities, Aug. 8, 2018; Rule 13 \nNotice Regarding [Target and Multiple Docket Numbers] and Three Section 702-Tasked \nFacilities, Jan. 11, 2018, and that NSA continues to experience problems of varying magnitude \nwith the over-retention of 702-acquired info1mation on its many systems.  See, e.g., June 2018 \nQuarterly Report at 85-87, 93, 97. \n-•A~ \nPage 127 \n.iH'PRW.Yh'.liilffARPANH~i!AOOkN \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 127 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \nI OJ  5:l!!Cft'I!,,,, :,,,, 01teef M140P(nu, \nAfter considering these and other incidents reported since April 2017, the Court finds \nreasonable and sufficient the steps taken by the government to address them and to prevent \nsimilar occurrences.

She directed the govemment to report on its progress in writing every two weeks. \nPage 129 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release Page 129 of 138  FISC Opinion, Oct.2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for PublicRelease \n- -\nIOI ■S  ELICEIHJ())bltCOIOUOP<JftU \nAs of October 1, 2018, NSA has successfully automated its processing of purge-discovery \norders in some but not all of its SSRs, and is processing new purge-discovery orders at a rate \nsimilar to its pre-September 2017 rate.  See Ninth Update at 2.  Accordingly, the NSA considers \nacklog to have been eliminated. The government has not yet, however, provided to \nthe Court a proposed standard for detennining whether a backlog in processing purge-discovery \norders develops in the future.  As a result, until the government is able to assure the Court that \npurge-discovery orders are being timely processed, NSA will continue to: (1) \nand (2) provide bi-weekly reports with the number of \npending purge discovery orders.  See id. \nBased on the NSA's processing of previously backlogged purge-discovery orders and its \nbi-weekly checks and updates, the Court finds that the  backlog issue does not \nimpede a finding that the NSA's purge procedures, as cunently implemented, are consistent with \nstatutory and Fourth Amendment requirements. \n2. Insider-Threat Monitorin2\nIn the March 27, 2018, Submission, the government infonned the Court that it had \nidentified certain insider-threat-monito1ing activities, \nand the subsequent placement of that \nMemorandum at 11.

These minimization procedures apply in addition to\nseparate querying procedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702(f)(l) of the Act.  These\nminimization procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those querying\nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be\nprohibited by those querying procedures.\n(U) IfNSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these\nminimizationprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e .g., force\nprotectionor hostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of\nthese procedures, NSA may take such action immediately.  NSA will report the action taken\nto the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and to the National Security Division of\nthe Department of Justice, which will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt (FISC) of such activity.\n(U) Nothing in these procedures shall restrict the performance of lawful oversight functions\nof the Department of Justice's National Security Division (NSD), the Office of the Director\nof National Intelligence, or the applicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or the provision\nby NSA of the assistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight\nfunctions.  Nothing in these procedures shall restrict NSA's performance of lawful training\nfunctions of its personnel or activities undertaken for creating, testing, or maintaining its\nsystems.  Similarly, nothing in these procedures shall prohibit the retention, processing,\nanalysis, or dissemination of information necessary to comply with a specific congressional\nmandate or order of a court within the United States.  Additionally, nothing in these\nprocedures shall restrict NSA's ability to conduct vulnerability or network assessments using\ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that NSA systems\nare not or have not been compromised. Notwithstanding any other section in these\nprocedures, information used by NSA to conduct vulnerability or network assessments may\nberetained for one year solely for that limited purpose.

Should NSA \nintend to rely on this provision regarding lawful oversight functions of its personnel or \nsystems, in whole or in part, to deviate from an aspect ofthese procedures and the purpose o.f \nsuch deviation is not listed above, NSA shall consult with NSD prior to conducting such an \nactivity.  NSD shall then report the deviation promptly to the FISC.

The government had submitted versions of those certifications and procedures in draft\nform between February 8 and February 15, 2018. \nThe 2018 Certifications reauthorize certifications under section 702 that the government \ninitially submitted on September 26, 2016, and amended in a submission made on March 30, \n2017 (\"the 2016 Certifications\").  The Court approved the 2016 Certifications, as amended, on \nApril 26, 2017.  The 2018 Certifications also amend the 2016 Certifications, as well as \npredecessor certifications under section 702, to provide that infonnation acquired pursuant to \n•SECPET-\nDONE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 1 of 4  FISC Court Order, Apr. 2018 \n\nODNI Authorized for Public Release \nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification \nthose certifications will be governed prospectively by the minimization procedures that \naccompany the 2018 Cetr ifications.  Now that the 2018 Certifications have been filed, the 2016 \nCertifications will remain in effect -even past their expiration date of April 26, 2018 -until the \nCourt enters an order that either approves the 2018 Certifications and the use of the \naccompanying procedures, or finds a deficiency and directs the government to take remedial \nsteps.  See § 702(j)(5)(B).  The Court is required, \"simultaneously with the order,\" to provide \"a \nwritten statement of the reasons\" for the Court's action.  § 702(j)(3)(C). \nThe Court is required to conduct its review of the government's submission, and issue its \norder and statement of reasons within 30 days of the submission.  See§ 702(j)(l)(B). Thirty days \nfrom March 27, 2018, is April 26, 2018. The Court may extend this period, however, \"as \nnecessary for good cause in a manner consistent with national security.\" See§ 702(k)(2). \nAs the Court previously stated, based on its review of the drafts filed between February 8 \nand February 15, \"it appears likely that this matter will present one or more novel or significant \ninterpretations of the law, which would require the Court to consider appointment of an amicus \ncuriae\" under section 103(i)(2) of FISA, codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1803(i)(2). Docket Nos. \nrder issued on March 20, 2018, at 2. The Court further \nstated that meaningful amicus participation would require the Court to extend the 30-day review \nperiod.  Seeid. at 3. The Court ordered the government to \nexplain in writing whether an extension of time -and, if so, what length of an \nextension ... -for the Court to review the 2018 Certifications ... would be \nconsistent with national security, taking into account that once the 2018 \nCertifications are filed with the Court, the 2016 Certifications and procedures will \nremain in effect for the duration of an extended review period pursuant to section \n702(j)(5)(B). \n--------\niFQEiiil  Page 2 \nDONE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release  Page 2 of 4  FISC Court Order, Apr. 2018\n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  - - ODNI Authorized for Public Release\n8IJ@Mfifi' \nOn March 26, 2018, the government timely filed a response to that Order, which advised \nthat \"the government assesses that an extension of90 days ... would be consistent with national \nsecurity.\"  Docket Nos. \nAfter reviewing the 2018 Certifications and accompanying procedures in final form, \ntogether with the government's explanatory memorandum, the Court continues to assess that this \nmatter likely presents one or more novel or significant interpretations of law, the consideration of \nwhich would benefit from amicus participation. The Court further finds that the need for an \nextension to allow for such participation constitutes \"good cause\" under section 702(k)(2). \nThe Court therefore has decided to extend the period for Court review under section \n702(j)(l)(B) by 90 days, the maximum period consistent with the government's assessment of \nnational security interests.  The Court believes that full length of time will likel \nmeaningful amicus participation and is ordering it now to avoid \nAccordingly, it is HEREBY ORDERED that, for the reasons stated above and as \nnecessary for good cause in a manner consistent with national security, the time period for the \nCourt's review of the 2018 Certifications and accompanying procedures under section \n702(j)(l )(B) is extended, pursuant to section 702(k)(2), through July 25, 2018.  As requested by \nthe government, see Response at 7, the Court is simultaneously issuing a Notice of Extension for \neach of the 2016 Certifications. \nPage 3 \nDONE: Oct 8, 2019 -Authorized Public Release  Page 3 of 4  FISC Court Order, Apr. 2018\n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n6EQJiHff  ~. \n.  . \n•• \nI  •  ~  ' •  •. ,..'   \n. \n. \n. \n: \n~ \n' \n. \n• ! .  tat s Foreign \nSurveillance Court \nChief DepL1ty Clerk. \n;. ·�.>. .·. . c.;�i �ny rna this docurner:t is a  fiiE@IIR  Page4\n1,u(? .;1::d ,:;om.ect C,'.)\".J• of tr,e 8rig::,al \nPage4 of 4  FISC Court Order, Apr. 2018 \n·DONE: Oct 8, 2019 - Authorized Public Release",

The opinions were publicly released in \nredacted form in 2014.  Op. 1 (Jan. 25, 2017).  No sealing or other discretionary orders were \nissued by the FISC to impede public access to the judicial opinions.  Op. 28 (Jan. 25, 2017). \nOn January 25, 2017, Presiding Judge Rosemary Collyer dismissed Movants' motion \nafter holding that they failed to establish constitutional standing sufficient to confer FISC \njurisdiction.  Order 1 (Jan. 25, 2017), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/ \nfiles/Misc%2013-08%200pinion%20and%200rder_O.pdf.  A majority of FISC judges thereafter \nvoted in favor of en bane reconsideration and, after entertaining additional legal briefing from \nthe parties, the en bane court issued closely-divided majority and dissenting opinions on \nNovember 9, 2017. Ops. (Nov. 9, 2017), available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/ \nfiles/Misc%20l3-08%200pinion%20November%209%202017 .pdf (copies attached).  The \nmajority opinion, which was joined by six of the eleven FISC judges, held that Movants asserted \na sufficient injury-in-fact, vacated the January 25, 2017 decision, and remanded for further \nproceedings.  Majority Op. 18 (Nov. 9, 2017).  Ten of eleven FISC judges subsequently agreed \nthat the question of law should be certified to the FISCR pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § l 803(j) because \nreview by the FISCR would serve the interests of justice, a dispositive issue about standing was \ninvolved, and the split among the FISC Judges was very close and involved a difference of \nopinion about the law to apply, among other considerations. \n-2 -\n\nAccordingly, it hereby is ORDERED that the following question of law be certified to the \nFISCR:  Whether Movants have adequately established Article III standing to assert their claim \nof a qualified First Amendment right of public access to FISC judicial opinions. \n5~ \nSO ORDERED this  day of January, 2018. \nPresiding Judge, United States Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court \n- 3 -\n\nFiled \nUnJted StatH Foreign \nlntelllgonce Survem:mce Court \nNOV  0 9 2017 \nUNITED STATES \nFOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE C0tflfTFlynn Hall, Clerk of c urt \nWASHINGTON, D.C. \nIN RE OPINIONS & ORDERS OF THIS COURT \nADDRESSING BULK COLLECTION OF DATA  Docket No. Misc. 13-08 \nUNDER THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE \nSURVEILLANCE ACT. \nBOASBERG, J., writing for the Court and joined by JJ. SAYLOR, DEARIE, RUSSELL, JONES, and \nCONTRERAS: \nFiguring out whether a plaintiff has standing to bring a novel legal claim can feel a bit like \ntrying to distinguish a black cat in a coal cellar.  \"Although the two concepts unfortunately are \nblurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the same thing. Standing is a prerequisite \nto filing suit, while the underlying merits of a claim ... determine whether the plaintiff is entitled \nto relief.\"  Arreola v. Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 794-95 (7th Cir. 2008).  The Initial Opinion in this \naction decided that Movants - the American Civil Liberties Union and Yale Law School's Media \nFreedom and Information Access Clinic - had suffered no injury-in-fact and thus lacked st~nding \nto bring their First Amendment claim for access to redacted portions of certain of this Court's \nopinions.  Sitting en bane for the first time in our history, we now vacate that decision.  Whatever \nthe merits ofMovants' suit, we conclude that they have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact to pursue \nit. \n\nI.  Background \nBy necessity, this Court conducts much of its work in secrecy.  But it does so within a \njudicial system wedded to transparency and deeply rooted in the ideal that \"justice must satisfy the \nappearance of justice.\"  Levine v. United States, 362 U.S. 610, 616 (1960). \nIt comes as no surprise, then, that members of the public may at times seek to challenge \nwhether certain controversies merit our continued secrecy or, instead, require some degree of \ntransparency.  The matter before us was born from two such challenges.  On June 6, 2013, two \nnewspapers  released  certain classified information about  a surveillance  program run  by the \nGovernment since 2006.  Within a day, the Director of National Intelligence declassified further \ndetails about this bulk-data-collection program, acknowledging for the first time that this Court \nhad approved much of it under Section 215 -the \"business records\" provision-ofthe Patriot Act, \nu.s.c. \n50  § 1861. \nVery shortly thereafter, Movants filed a motion in this Court asking that we unseal our \n\"opinions evaluating the meaning, scope, and constitutionality of Section 215.\"  FISC No. Misc. \n13-02, Motion of June 2, 2013. They argued that, because officials had now \"revealed the essential \ndetails of the program,\" there was no  legitimate interest in continuing to  withhold its  legal \njustification.  Id. at 18.  Movants thus contended that their First Amendment right of access to \ncourt proceedings and documents, as recognized by the Supreme Court in Richmond Newspapers. \nInc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980), now compelled the release of these rulings.  Id. at 6-15. \nThey alternatively  asked  that we  invoke  FISC  Rule  of Procedure  62(a)  to  request that the \nGovernment review the opinions' classification and publish any declassified portions.  Id. at 15-\n18. \n-2-\n\nJudge Saylor opted for the latter discretionary route in this first action.  In re Orders of this \nCourt Interpreting Sec. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, 2013 WL 5460064 (Foreign Intel. \nSurv. Ct.  Sept.  13, 2013).  Before doing so, however, he concluded that Movant ACLU had \nestablished Article III standing to pursue its First Amendment challenge, as its asserted injury \nsatisfied the familiar tripartite standing requirement - i.e., it was \"concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to  the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"  Id. at *2 (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013)).  More \nspecifically, he reasoned that, because the ACLU had alleged that the continued withholding of \nour opinions violated its First Amendment right of access to them, its claimed injury was  I) \n\"actual,\" as the opinions were not available, 2) \"traceable\" to the Government's decision not to \nmake them public, and 3) redressable by \"this Court's directing that those opinions be published.\" \nId.  Judge Saylor also determined that the injury was sufficiently particularized because Movants \nwere \"active particip[ ants] in the legislativ,e and public debates about the proper scope of Section \n215,\" and the withheld information would assist them in these conversations. Id. at *4. Ultimately, \nhowever, he did not reach the merits of their First Amendment claim, choosing instead to order \nthe Executive Branch under Rule 62( a) to conduct a declassification review of certain of our prior \nopinions.  Id. at *8. \nAround  the  same  time,  the  Government  released  more  details  about  the  bulk-data \ncollection program, including a white paper that explained how FISC Judges had periodically \napproved the directives to telecommunications providers to produce bulk telephonic metadata for \nuse  in  the  Government's  counterterrorism  efforts.  See  Administration  White  Paper:  Bulk \nCollection of Telephony Metadata Under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Aug. 9, 2013). \nThis Court, too, took steps to make more information available to the public.  In particular, we \n- 3 -\n\nasked the Executive Branch to review several of our opinions, and we released redacted versions \nof two about the collection of bulk telephony metadata under Section 215. In re Opinions & Orders \nof this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *2-3 (FISC Jan. 25, 2017). \nWhile these revelations may have slaked some ofMovants' thirst for information, they also \nopened up new lines of inquiry.  Movants thus filed another motion - which kicked off the current \naction - on November 7, 2013, asking us to unseal classified sections of our opinions laying out \nthe legal basis for the data collection.  See Movants'  Motion of Nov. 7, 2013, available at \nhttp://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-08%20Motion-2. pdf.  Here,  again, \nthey claimed that these passages were \"subject to the public's First Amendment right of access\" \nand should be released because \"no proper basis exists to keep the legal discussions in [them] \nsecret.\"  Id. at 1.  They further contended that we should once more exercise our discretion under \nRule 62(a) to ask for a second classification review by the Government and then verify ~hat its \nresponse complied with the dictates of the First Amendment.  Id. at 24-27. \nOn  November  18,  2013,  however,  while  briefing  was  ongoing  on  this  issue,  the \nGovernment published two more redacted opinions by this Court.  In re Opinions & Orders of this \nCourt Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *3.  Including the \nprevious pair we had already released, these four opinions constituted all of our rulings that were \nresponsive to Movants' second Motion.  In other words, before the Government had even filed an \nOpposition, the relevant opinions had been \"subjected to classification review and the unclassified \nportions released\" with - according to the Government - \"as much information ... as possible \nconsistent with national security.\"  Opp. of Dec. 6, 2013, at 2. \n-4-\n\nGiven such release, the Government's subsequent Opposition argued that the Court should \nnow dismiss Movants' second action.  Any further review, it maintained, would merely \"duplicate \nthe[se] result[s],\" and there was \"no basis for th[is] Court to order [it].\" Id.  The Government also \ncontended that Movants lacked standing to seek such relief because Rule 62(a) allowed only a \nparty to the proceeding that generated the opinion to move for publication, and Movants had not \nbeen involved in the underlying actions.  Id. at 2-3.  Finally, the Government urged this Court not \nto order yet another review since Movants could challenge the classification decisions through a \nFreedom of Information Act case in federal district court.  Id. at 3-4. \nOn January 25, 2017,  in a  lengthy and thoughtful  Opinion,  Presiding Judge  Collyer \ndetermined that Movants had no standing to press their case, and she thus dismissed it.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL \n* \n427 591, at  1.  Her Opinion focused in particular on a potential standing problem that the parties \nhad not previously identified - namely, whether Movants had alleged the invasion of a \"legally \nand judicially cognizable\" interest sufficient to establish the injury-in-fact prong of the standing \nanalysis.  Id. at *7.  The Court first took the position that an interest was not legally protected \n\"when its asserted legal source - whether constitutional, statutory, common law or otherwise -\ndoes not apply or does not exist.\"  Id. at *8. \nOn this basis, the Court then engaged in a lengthy merits analysis ofMovants' claim under \nthe  Richmond  Newspapers  \"experience  and  logic\"  test  to  determine  whether  such  a  First \n* \nAmendment right existed in the unique context of FISC judicial proceedings.  Id.  at  16-21. \nAlthough the Constitution does not expressly provide for access to judicial records, in Richmond \nNewspapers, the Supreme Court \"firmly established for the first time that the press and general \npublic have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials.\"  Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior \n- 5 -\n\nCourt, 457 U.S. 596, 603 (1982).  Since then, it has extended this right to other judicial processes, \nbut has also recognized that such a First Amendment right of access is not absolute.  Id. at 607. \nRather, to determine whether the public has a right of access to particular judicial proceedings, \ncourts must ask two questions: \"whether the place and process have historically been open to the \npress and general public\" (the experience inquiry) and \"whether public access plays a significant \npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question\" (the logic inquiry).  Press \nEnterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 8 (1986).  Applying this test, \nJudge Collyer in this case ultimately answered both prongs in the negative, and she therefore \nconcluded that the right of access did not extend to FISC judicial proceedings.  In re Opinions & \nOrders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection of Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *16-\n21.  For this reason alone, the Court then held that Movants had not alleged a sufficient injury-in \nfact and thus lacked standing to bring their claim.  Id. at *21. \nMovants quickly moved for reconsideration.  As the resolution of the first and second \nactions had created an intra-court split on the standing issue, we sua sponte granted en bane review \nto reconsider the narrow question of whether Movants have asserted a sufficient injury-in-fact for \nstanding purposes.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a)(2)(A); FISC R. P. 45 (allowing the Court to order a \nhearing or rehearing en  bane if \"necessary to secure and maintain uniformity of the Court's \ndecisions\").  After substantial and reasoned debate and discussion among all eleven judges of this \nCourt, we now answer that inquiry in the affirmative. \nII.  Analysis \nArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual \"Cases\" and \n\"Controversies.\" U.S. Const., art. III,§ 2.  But not just any dispute will do.  See Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992). The Constitution instead confines the judiciary to deciding \n-6-\n\ncontests that are \"appropriately resolved through the judicial process,\" as distinguished from those \nbetter left to the legislative or executive branches in a democratic government.  Id. at 560 (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)).  Standing doctrine helps police this boundary \nby requiring, as an \"irreducible constitutional minimum,\" that a plaintiff establish three elements \nto proceed with a claim: 1) an injury-in-fact that is 2) caused by the conduct complained of and 3) \n\"likely\" to be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"  Id. at 560-61 (quotations omitted). \nThe focus here is on the first prong.  A term of art, an injury-in-fact is the \"invasion of a \nlegally protected interest which is both (a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural, or hypothetical.\"  Id. at 560 (footnote, internal citations, and quotation omitted). \nFor the purposes of evaluating whether a plaintiff has made this showing, though, \"we must assume \n[Movants'] claim has legal validity.\"  Cooksey v.  Futrell, 721  F.3d 226, 239 (4th Cir. 2013) \n(quotation omitted).  Put another way, in deciding whether Movants have alleged a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact for standing purposes, we \"must be careful not to decide the question on the merits \nfor or against [Movants], and must therefore assume that on the merits the [Movants] would be \nsuccessful in their claims.\"  City of Waukesha v. EPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see \nalso Citizen Ctr. v.  Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014) (same); Parker v.  District of \nColumbia, 478 F.3d 370, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"The Supreme Court has made clear that when \nconsidering whether a plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must assume arguendo the \nmerits of his or her legal claim.\"), affd sub nom. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 \n(2008); see also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501-02 (1975) (assuming validity of legal theory \nfor purposes of standing analysis). \nStarting from the premise that Movants' claim is meritorious means that we must assume \nthat withholding our classified opinions violates their First Amendment right of access to judicial \n-7-\n\nproceedings under the Richmond Newspapers test.  From this base, we can readily conclude that \nthis injury is \"concrete,\" as well as \"actual,\" because the opinions are currently not available to \nthem.  For  at  least  the  reasons  articulated  by  Judge  Saylor,  moreover,  it  is  sufficiently \n\"particularized\" from  that of the public because of Movants' active participation in ongoing \ndebates about the legal validity of the bulk-data-collection program. \nThe Initial Opinion, of course, did not quibble with these conclusions, but instead homed \nin on the prefatory language of the definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact. While not every \nSupreme Court decision even specifies that an alleged injury-in-fact must be to a \"legally protected \ninterest,\" see. e.g., Clapper, 568 U.S. at 409, the Opinion correctly pointed out that some cases \nhave treated this as an independent requirement to establish standing in appropriate circumstances. \nBut from this starting point, the Initial Opinion faltered in concluding that Movants had alleged no \nlegally protected interest because the First Amendment's right of access to court proceedings \"did \nnot apply\" to FISC Opinions.  In re Opinions & Orders of this Court Addressing Bulk Collection \nof Data under FISA, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \nAs courts have repeatedly affirmed, \"For purposes of standing, the question [simply] \ncannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends protection to the plaintiffs \nasserted right or interest.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th \nCir.  2006) (en  bane) (emphasis added).  \"If that were the test, every losing claim would be \ndismissed for want of standing.\" Id.; see also Ass'n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs .. Inc. v. Camp, \n397 U.S. 150, 153 & n.1 (2003) (admonishing against use of\"legal interest\" test as part of standing \nanalysis when it goes to merits of claim).  We must instead assume that Movants are correct that \nthey have a constitutional right of access, Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235 - so long as that right is \ncognizable.  That is, we ask only whether courts are capable of knowing or recognizing such an \n- 8 -\n\ninterest. See Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"cognizable\" as \"[c  ]apable of being \nknown or recognized\"); see also Judicial Watch. Inc. v. U.S. Senate, 432 F.3d 359, 364 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (Williams, J ., concurring) (explaining Supreme Court uses terms \"legally protected\" and \n\"judicially  cognizable\"  interchangeably  \"( 1)  to  encompass  the  other  conventionally  stated \nrequirements (that the injury be concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent) and (2) \npossibly to serve as a screen (perhaps open-ended) against interests that it would make little sense \nto treat as adequate\"). \nA plaintiff, for instance, might lack standing \"to complain about his inability to commit \ncrimes because no one has a right to a commit a crime,\" and no Court could recognize such an \ninterest.  Citizen Ctr. v. Gessler, 770 F.3d 900, 910 (10th Cir. 2014).  On the other hand, he would \nhave standing to bring colorable First Amendment claims, even if he would ultimately lose on the \nmerits.  Take the seminal example of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976).  There, the Supreme \nCourt allowed plaintiffs to attack campaign-finance laws as unconstitutional, even though, as it \nturned  out,  there  is  no  specific  \"First  Amendment  right  to  make  unlimited  campaign \ncontributions.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1092-93 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n96).  As the Tenth Circuit noted, \"We could use any unsuccessful constitutional claim to illustrate \nthe point.\"  Id. at 1092.  Indeed, were we to define rights with any greater level of specificity, no \nplaintiff would have standing to challenge established First Amendment precedent.  This  is \ncertainly not the case.  See. e.g., Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310,. 365-66 (2010) (overturning \nprecedent that upheld restrictions on corporate independent expenditures). \nAt bottom, the legally-protected-interest test is not concerned with determining the proper \nscope of the First Amendment right or whether a plaintiff is correct that such right has in fact been \ninvaded; that is a merits inquiry. Waukesha, 320 F.3d at 235. The test instead seeks only to assess \n-9-\n\nwhether the interest asserted by the plaintiff is of the type that \"deserve[s] protection against \ninjury.\"  13  Charles  Alan  Wright,  Arthur R.  Miller,  et  al.,  Federal  Practice  &  Procedure \n§ 3531.4 (3d ed. 2008). \nAgainst this backdrop, the sufficiency of Movants' allegation of such a legally protected \ninterest appears clear.  They identify the invasion of an interest - the First Amendment right to \naccess judicial proceedings - that courts have repeatedly held is capable of \"being known or \nrecognized.\"  The Supreme Court first acknowledged that this interest is one the Constitution \nprotects against wrongful invasion in Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 555, when a plurality held \nthat  the  public's  \"right  to  attend  criminal  trials  is  implicit  in  the  guarantees  of the  First \nAmendment.\"  Id. at 580 (footnote omitted).  Since then, that Court has also held that this right \nsafeguards  the  public's  qualified  access  to  other  criminal  proceedings,  including  witness \ntestimony, Globe Newspaper, 457 U.S. at 603-11, voir dire, Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court \n(Press Enterprise I), 464 U.S. 501, 505-10 (1984), and preliminary hearings.  Press Enterprise II, \n478 U.S. at 10-15. \nMany federal Courts of Appeals have likewise held this legally protected interest invaded \nwhen the public is walled off from other aspects of criminal trials, such as bail, plea, or sentencing \nhearings.  See. e.g., N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 297-98 (2d \nCir. 2012) (collecting cases); In re Wash. Post Co., 807 F.2d 383, 388-89 (4th Cir. 1986) (plea and \nsentencing hearings);  In re  Hearst Newspapers.  LLC,  641  F.3d  168,  175-86 (5th Cir.  2011) \n(sentencing). Finally, at least six Circuits have concluded that the First Amendment qualified right \nof access also extends to \"civil trials and to their related proceedings and records.\"  N.Y. Civil \nLiberties Union, 684 F.3d at 298 (emphasis added) (so holding and collecting cases from the Third, \nFourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits). \n- 10 -\n\nThese cases all demonstrate that Movants, in asserting a First Amendment right of access \nto judicial processes, are seeking to vindicate \"the sort of interest that the law protects when it is \nwrongfully invaded.\" Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. 2006) \n(emphases modified).  No more than this is necessary for standing purposes, even if Movants \nultimately fail to prove that the precise scope of the First Amendment right extends to redacted \nportions of our judicial opinions under the Richmond Newspapers test.  The dissent, by contrast, \nwould require Plaintiffs to make that more specific showing at the standing stage - an inquiry that \nwould swallow any merits determination on the First Amendment's contours.  It is erroneous to \nunderstand the cognizable-interest requirement as \"beg[ging] the question of the legal validity of \nthe[ir] claim.\"  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093 n.3.  Rather, as the Tenth Circuit \nsitting en bane has instructed, courts must avoid any such \"mischief' inherent in \"us[ing] standing \nconcepts to address the question whether the plaintiff has stated a claim.\" Id. (quoting 13 Wright \n& Miller, § 3531.4 (2d ed. Supp. 2005)). \nOur  conclusion  that  Movants  have  met  this  cognizable-interest  requirement  is  also \nconsistent with the approach adopted by every Circuit to consider a similar claim.  As far as we \ncan tell, courts have uniformly found standing to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so \nlong as plaintiffs allege an invasion related to judicial proceedings. That is so no matter how novel \nor meritless the claim may be.  Some courts have stretched the right-of-access even farther for \nstanding purposes.  In Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), for example, journalists \ncreatively contended that they had a First Amendment right of access to travel with military \ncombat units to cover the war in Afghanistan.  Id. at 698.  Although the D.C. Circuit ultimately \nheld that \"no such constitutional right exists\" - in fact, having deemed Richmond Newspapers \nentirely inapplicable - it nevertheless easily concluded that plaintiffs had standing to bring their \n- 11 -\n\nsuit. Id. at 698, 702-04. This was the case even though the journalists' desire to embed with troops \nwas much farther afield from the core Richmond Newspapers right than the one Movants hope to \nestablish today.  Here, they ask only to extend the public's right of access to another Article III \ncontext - i.e., FISC judicial proceedings. \nThe dissent criticizes the Court of Appeals' analysis in flym, see post at 20, but its dislike \nof the decision does not diminish its import.  In any event, the D.C. Circuit does not stand alone \nin its approach.  The Seventh Circuit, for example, has considered a historian's standing to bring \na common-law right-of-access claim to sealed grand-jury materials.  See Carlson v. United States, \n837 F.3d 753, 757-61 (7th Cir. 2016). The plaintiff, it reasoned, \"need[ed] only a 'colorable claim' \nto a right to access these documents, because '[w]ere we to require more than a colorable claim, \nwe would decide the merits of the case before satisfying ourselves of standing.\"'  Id.  at 758 \n(internal citation omitted); see also Okla. Observer v. Patton, 73 F. Supp. 3d 1318, 1321-22, 1325 \n(W.D. Okla. 2014) (holding plaintiffs had standing to bring First Amendment right-of-access claim \nto view executions, but dismissing suit as right did \"not extend to the circumstances existing \nhere\"); United States v. Ring, 47 F. Supp. 3d 38, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding criminal defendant \nhad standing to  sue for public access to PowerPoint presentation used during proffer session \ndespite holding on merits that \"neither a common law nor First Amendment right of access\" \nattached to the record). \nMany courts - including the Supreme Court - have not even felt it necessary to address \nstanding in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims, despite judges' obligation to raise sua \nsponte any jurisdictional defects.  Indeed, courts have routinely ignored what the dissent would \nbelieve is a serious question, even while expressly addressing their jurisdiction in other respects. \nFor example, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits rejected mootness challenges to suits asserting a First \n- 12 -\n\nAmendment right of access to search-warrant proceedings, despite ultimately deciding that the \nplaintiffs had no such right to these sealed records under the Richmond Newspapers test.  See In \nre Search of Fair Finance, 692 F.3d 424, 428-29, 433 (6th Cir. 2012) (finding claim not moot); \nBait. Sun Co. v. Goetz, 886 F.2d 60, 63-65 (4th Cir. 1989) (same).  Mootness, of course, shares a \ncommon undergirding with standing: \"[T]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the \ncommencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\" \nFriends of the Earth. Inc. v.  Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC). Inc., 528 U.S.  167,  189 \n(2000) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68 n.22 (1997)).  To \nsurvive a mootness challenge, then, the plaintiffs must have necessarily demonstrated that the \nrequisite personal injury existed at least in the first instance.  Even more recently, in Phillips v. \nDeWine, 841F.3d405 (6th Cir. 2016), the Sixth Circuit rejected a much more farfetched challenge \nby inmates to the constitutionality of Ohio's \"statutory scheme concerning the confidentiality of \ninformation related to lethal injection.\" Id. at 410, 419-20.  At the outset, the court concluded that \nthe plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their free-speech and prior-restraint causes of action, as their \nasserted injuries were too hypothetical.  But it apparently had no similar concern as to their First \nAmendment right-of-access claim, holding instead on the merits that no such right existed.  Id. at \n417-20. \nA long list of courts have acted in this fashion.  See. e.g., Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1, 7-15 (1978) (holding First Amendment provides the media no right of access to county jail, \nbut never questioning standing); Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (holding \nplaintiffs have no \"right under the First Amendment to receive properly classified national security \ninformation filed\" in habeas action, but not questioning standing); Wood v. Ryan, 759 F.3d 1076, \n1088 (9th Cir. 2014) (Bybee, J. , dissenting) (criticizing \"majority's newfound right of access\" for \n- 13 -\n\ndeath row inmate seeking information on method of his execution as \"dramatic extension of \nanything\" previously recognized, but never questioning standing), vacated, 135 S. Ct. 21 (mem.) \n(summarily vacated on merits, not standing); In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section \n2703(0),  707  F.3d 283,  291-92  (4th  Cir.  2013)  (holding no  First Amendment right under \nRichmond Newspapers to court orders and proceedings pursuant to Stored Communications Act, \nbut never questioning standing); In re N. Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F .3d 40 I, 409-11 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting, under Richmond Newspapers, newspaper's request to unseal wiretap \napplications and related materials, but not questioning standing to bring novel claim); Calder v. \nIRS, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. 1989) (applying Richmond Newspapers and holding plaintiff \nhad no  First Amendment or statutory right of access to  IRS  records, but never questioning \nstanding).  Although we do not directly rely on any of these cases, we find the uniformity is telling. \nSimilarly, two former judges of this Court also found it unnecessary to call standing into \ndoubt when rejecting claims premised on the public's right of access to FISC records, see In re \nProceedings Required by §  702(i) of PISA Amendments Act of 2008, No.  08-01, 2008 WL \n9487946 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) (McLaughlin, J.); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 \nF. Supp. 2d 484 (FISC 2007) (Bates, J.), and, as explained above, Judge Saylor expressly held that \nplaintiffs did have standing to bring such claims under the First Amendment in Movants' first \naction.  See In re Orders of this Court Intemreting Section 215 of the Patriot Act, No. 13-02, 2013 \nWL 5460064, at *2-4 (FISC Sept. 13, 2013). \nThe Initial Opinion, by contrast, relies on no case that concludes that a plaintiff lacks a \nlegally cognizable interest, and thus standing, simply because that party cannot show a First \nAmendment right of access applies or exists in the context of the judicial proceeding at issue.  The \nbest it could muster is a single case where the plaintiff sought a common-law right of access to \n- 14 -\n\ndiscovery materials.  Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1074 (7th Cir. 2009).  The Seventh Circuit \nheld that these discovery files - exchanged between parties - \"had never been filed with the court \nand [had] never influenced the outcome of a judicial proceeding.\" Id.  Whatever the merits of that \ndecision, it provides no guidance here, where Plaintiffs seek material far more rooted in judicial \nproceedings: our opinions.  Perhaps recognizing Bond as thin support, the dissent relegates that \ncase to a footnote.  Otherwise, no case appears throughout its 25 pages in which any court declined \nto find standing in like circumstances.  This lack of precedential support speaks volumes. \nAt times, the dissent suggests a variant justification for dismissing the suit: it sees \"no legal \nbasis to find that Movants present a colorable claim.\"  Post at 13 (emphasis added); see also id. at \n17 n.16 (\"In the instant matter, the question is whether Movants have a colorable right under the \nFirst Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nwas classified.\"). This alternative argument seems decidedly weaker to us. Courts have repeatedly \nset an exceedingly low bar to establish colorability.  See Kennedy v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 924 \nF .2d 698, 700 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding only if claim is \"frivolous is jurisdiction lacking\"); Panaras \nv. Liguid Carbonic Indus. Cor_p., 74 F.3d 786, 790 (7th Cir. 1996) (describing the requirement as \n\"not ... stringent\").  Under this colorability standard, only \"a plaintiff whose claimed legal right \nis so preposterous as to be legally frivolous may lack standing on the ground that the right is not \n'legally protected.\"'  Initiative & Referendum Inst., 450 F.3d at 1093.  Whatever the merits of \nMovants' First Amendment right-of-access claim, it finds its basis in well-established law.  The \nright to access, even in its more narrow formulation, at least covers \"a right of access to certain \ncriminal [and civil] proceedings and the documents filed in those proceedings.\" Phillips, 841 F.3d \nat 418.  Movants merely allege that those \"certain\" documents include our FISC opinions - i.e., \nopinions filed in an Article III judicial proceeding.  This asserted right is certainly more analogous \n- 15 -\n\nto the historical right than - for example - a claim that the First Amendment also grants access to \ntravel with troop battalions on a foreign battlefield.  Yet, in flmt, 355 F.3d 697, the D.C. Circuit \nnever mentioned that it might be frivolous to consider such an extension. In fact, the dissent points \nto no federal court that has ever dismissed as frivolous a novel claim seeking to extend the First \nAmendment right of access to a new judicial process.  We decline to be the first. \nThe dissent also suggests our analysis should differ because Plaintiffs seek \"classified \ninformation.\"  Post at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is true that courts rarely presume \nto review the Executive Branch's decisionmaking, at least without a statutory hook.  See Dep't of \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 538 (1988).  Yet the classified information here is not housed in the \nExecutive Branch; instead, it arises within an Article III proceeding, and Plaintiffs seek access to \nportions of judicial opinions.  As explained above, the right to access judicial proceedings is well \nestablished.  Courts have thus not hesitated to review claims involving secret court proceedings, \neven when they ultimately find good reason to deny them.  See In re Search of Fair Finance, 692 \nF.3d at 428-29, 433 (sealed search warrants); Goetz, 886 F.2d at 63-65 (same); In re N.Y. Times \nCo. to Unseal Wiretap, 577 F.3d at 409-11 (sealed wiretap applications). \nNor do we agree with the dissent that we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.  See post at 23-25.  Even if \nthe Supreme Court applies an \"especially rigorous\" standing analysis in this context, Raines v. \nByrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819-20 ( 1997), it has never suggested such an analysis would involve jumping \nto the merits of the dispute.  More to the point, the dissent cites Clapper v. Amnesty International, \n568 U.S. 398 (2013), which noted that courts have declined to find standing when reviewing \n\"actions of the political branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.\"  Post \n- 16 -\n\nat 23-24 (quoting Clapper, 568 U.S. at 469).  Although that decision admittedly contains some \nbroad language, none offers much insight into the standing question posed here. \nIn Clapper, the Supreme Court considered a separate facet of the injury-in-fact test -\nnamely,  whether the  plaintiffs'  theory of future  injury was  too  speculative  to  be \"certainly \nimpending.\"  Id. at 409.  In fact, Clapper's definition of what constitutes an injury-in-fact did not \neven include the requirement of a \"legally protected\" interest upon which the Initial Opinion relies \nhere.  Id. at 409 (\"To establish Article III standing, an injury must be 'concrete, particularized, and \nactual or imminent;  fairly traceable to the challenged action;  and redressable by a favorable \nruling.\"') (citation omitted).  Clapper, then, does not impose any special standing requirement on \nthis score; in fact, it might be better read to impose no such showing at all.  Schuchardt v. President \nof the United States, 839 F.3d 336, 348 n.8 (3d Cir. 2016) (\"Despite Clapper's observation that \nthe standing inquiry is especially rigorous in matters touching on intelligence gathering and foreign \naffairs,\" no court has held that \"'Article III imposes [a] heightened standing requirement for the \noften  difficult  cases  that  involve  constitutional  claims  against  the  executive  involving \nsurveillance.\"') (quoting Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. 2011)) (internal quotations \nfrom Clapper omitted)).  In any event, the claim presented here survives because the injury is a \nlack of access to the proceedings of a court, rather than one directly traceable to the activities of \nthe political branches in intelligence gathering or foreign affairs. \n* * * \nAt the end of the day, the question that the Initial Opinion asked and answered is not one \nof standing.  It instead goes to the merits of Movants' legal claim - i.e., whether they have a \nqualified right of access under the First Amendment to portions of our opinions redacted by the \nExecutive Branch under its classification authority.  See Arreola, 546 F.3d at 794-95 (\"Although \n- 17 -\n\nthe two concepts unfortunately are blurred at times, standing and entitlement to relief are not the \nsame thing.\").  As that is not what concerns us today, we hold that Movants have sufficiently \nalleged the invasion of a legally cognizable interest as necessary to establish an injury-in-fact. \nWhether or not they will ultimately succeed in establishing that the  Richmond Newspapers \nexperience-and-logic test entitles them to relief, we believe that they should not be barred at this \nthreshold  procedural  stage.  We  further  offer  no  opinion  on  whether  other jurisdictional \nimpediments exist to this challenge, but hold only that Movants have established a sufficient \ninjury-in-fact. \nIII.  Conclusion \nBecause we hold that Movants have the requisite cognizable interest to  pursue their \nconstitutional claim, we vacate the Initial Opinion in this action and remand the matter to Judge \nCollyer for further consideration of Movants' Motion. \n- 18 -\n\nCOLLYER, Presiding Judge, joined by EAGAN, MOSMAN, CONWAY and KUGLER, Judges, \ndissenting: \nIn law as in life, the answer depends upon the question.  Only by framing the question \nbefore us in its most general terms can the Majority answer with the unremarkable proposition \nthat some courts - but not the Supreme Court - have found a First Amendment right of access to \nsome federal court proceedings in civil cases when the place and process historically have been \npublic.  But the question the Majority poses is not the one presented by the motion in this case.  I \nrespectfully dissent and would affirm the decision in In re Opinions & Orders of this Court \nAddressing Bulk Collection of Data Under the FISA [hereinafter In re Opinions of This Court], \nNo. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591 (FISA Ct. 2017). \nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") is a special court with a special and \ndiscreet mission: to protect the rights of U.S. persons while reviewing surveillance measures to \nprotect national security.  FISC proceedings are classified and the Court operates under specific \ncongressional direction that everything it does must respect and protect the secrecy of those \nclassifications.  No member of the public would have any \"right\" under the First Amendment to \nask to observe a hearing in the FISC courtroom.  Still less should we be inventing such a \"right\" \nin the present circumstances. \nTo be precise, what Movants seek is not \"access to judicial proceedings,\" as the Majority \nwould have it.  Rather, their current request is more limited and specific: having already received \nthis Court's opinions and orders addressing bulk collection of data with classified material \nredacted, Movants want us to rule that they have a \"right\" of access to the information classified \nby the Executive Branch and that Executive Branch agencies must defend each redaction in the \nface of Movants' challenges. \n- 1 -\n\nThe effect of the Court's decision today is to displace Congress's judgment that access to \nclassified and ex parte FISC judicial opinions shall be resolved through the procedures set forth \nin Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act, which, as relevantly titled, governs the \n\"[d ]eclassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\" of the FISC.  Just as in the days \nof John Marshall, it is imperative that the Judiciary avoid the appearance of eroding the very \nprinciples intended to maintain the careful balance of powers set forth in the Constitution. 1 The \nCourt's decision today unfortunately fails in that effort. \nOne last introductory comment is due.  FISC judges come from district courts around the \ncountry.  Few of us knew each other before our appointments to the FISC.  In our work on the \nFISC, as with our work in our home courts, we decide alone.  The occasion of this en bane \nreview of the In re Opinions of This Court decision has given us a rare and wonderful \nopportunity to wrestle together over some weighty legal principles and issues. This dissent is \nwritten in the same spirit. \nI. \nThe question pending before the en bane Court is whether Movants have shown an injury \nin fact sufficient to establish constitutional standing and this Court's jurisdiction.  There is no \ndispute between the parties or the members of the Court that Article III of the Constitution limits \nthe judicial power to the adjudication of cases or controversies in which a party seeking relief \ndemonstrates standing for each asserted claim.  There likewise is no dispute that the prevailing \n\"Much more than legal niceties are at stake here. The statutory and (especially) \nconstitutional elements of jurisdiction are an essential ingredient of separation and equilibration \nof powers, restraining the courts from acting at certain times, and even restraining them from \nacting permanently regarding certain subjects.\"  Steel Co. v.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court has signaled that the \nphrase \"legally protected interest\" has meaning independent of the requirement that the alleged \ninvasion be concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent.  Adarand Constructors. \nInc. v.

In other words, we consider whether there is some law that at least arguably could be \ndeemed to protect Movants' legal interest such that they can be said to have advanced a colorable \nclaim to the asserted right.  Aurora Loan Servs .. Inc. v. Craddieth, 442 F.3d 1018, 1024 (7th Cir. \n2006).  As the Seventh Circuit has explained: \nThe point is not that to establish standing a plaintiff must establish that a right of \nhis has been infringed; that would conflate the issue of standing with the merits of \nthe suit. It is that he must have a colorable claim to such a right. It is not enough \nthat he claims to have been injured by the defendant's conduct. \"The alleged injury \nmust be legally and judicially cognizable. This requires, among other things, that \nthe plaintiff have suffered 'an invasion of a legally protected interest.\"' \nId. (quoting Raines, supra note 2, at 819 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560)).  To be clear, \"[w]hile \nstanding does not depend on the merits of the party's contention that certain conduct is illegal, \nstanding does require an injury to the party arising out of a violation of a constitutional or \n· statutory provision or other legal right.\"  Fed. Deposit Ins. Cor.p. v. Grella, 553 F.2d 258, 261 (2d \nCir. 1977).  Accord Cox Cable Commc'ns. Inc. v.

U.S. ex rel. Stevens, \n529 U.S. 765, 772 (2000). \nII. \nA. \nApplying these legal standards, the Supreme Court has directed that \"[a]lthough standing \nin no way depends on the merits of the plaintiffs contention that particular conduct is illegal, it \noften turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.\"  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500 \n(1975).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has agreed unanimously that \"standing is gauged by the \nspecific common-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\"  Int'l Primate Prot. \n-4-\n\nLeague v. Adm'rs of Tulane Educ. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, 77 (1991).  \"Typically ... the standing \ninquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegations to ascertain whether the \nparticular plaintiff is entitled to adjudication oft he particular claims asserted.\"'  Id. (internal \nquotation marks omitted, emphasis in original). \nAccordingly, to determine whether Movants have a legally protected interest the first step \nis to examine the specific constitutional claims Movants present.  Id.  Movants assert a First \nAmendment-protected interest to access information in certain FISC judicial opinions that the \nExecutive Branch determined is classified national security information.  Movants further assert \na First Amendment-protected interest to require the Executive Branch to explain its rationale for \nclassification and respond to Movants' challenges to their constitutionality, and for the FISC to \ndecide between them.3  Movants' Mot. 1, 24.  They invoke no other source of right for their \nclaims. \nThe Majority Opinion strays from Movants' \"particular claims\" and recasts their legal \ninterest as broadly as possible into \"access to judicial proceedings,\" Majority Op. 10.  By doing \nso, the Majority scrambles the scope of an interest recognized under the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access and the scope of an interest recognized under the common law \n3  Specifically, Movants seek access to classified information that was redacted from four \nFISC judicial opinions that were declassified, in part, and made public in 2013.  Now that the \nopinions are public, Movants ask the Court to compel the Executive Branch to conduct a second \ndeclassification review and \"require the government to justify its proposed redactions, permit \nMovants an opportunity to respond, and then make findings on the record about whether the \nproposed redactions are narrowly tailored to avert a substantial risk of harm to a compelling \ngovernmental interest.\"  Movants' Reply Br. 2, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/ \ndefault/files/ Misc%2013-08%20Reply-1.pdf.  Movants claim the qualified First Amendment \nright of public access mandates these procedures as a matter of right, although they concede that \n\"much of this Court's work may not be subject to a constitutional right of access ....\"   Movants' \nReply Br. 1. \n- 5 -\n\nright of access.  The result is a legal analysis that ignores the Supreme Court's direction to \nexamine the nature and source of Movants' claims and gauge their standing by the specific \nconstitutional claims they present.  This confusion has consequences because the First \nAmendment and the common law are analyzed differently. \nThe First Amendment provides no general right of access to government proceedings. \nHouchins v. KOED. Inc., 438 U.S. 1, 15 (1978) (plurality) (\"The Constitution itself is neither a \nFreedom of Information Act nor an Official Secrets Act\" and \"[n]either the First Amendment nor \nthe Fourteenth Amendment mandates a right of access to government information or sources of \ninformation within the government's control.\").  Accord Phillips v. DeWine, 841F.3d405, 419 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (rejecting a broad assertion of a First Amendment right to government \ninformation that pertains to a government proceeding and noting that \"[n ]either this court nor the \nSupreme Court has ever recognized a right so broad\").  Nor does the First Amendment provide a \npresumptive4 or general right of access to \"judicial proceedings\" as a subset of government \nproceedings.  See. e.g., id. (noting that Houchins \"sets the baseline principle for First \nAmendment claims seeking access to information held by the government\").  Richmond \nNewspapers and its progeny offer an \"exception\" to the Houchins rule that there is no First \nAmendment right to access government proceedings, id. at 418, but that exception is limited to \njudicial proceedings that satisfy what has come to be known as the \"experience\" and \"logic\" tests \n4  When courts refer to a \"presumptive First Amendment right of access,\" see. e.g., N.Y. \nCivil Liberties Union v. New York City Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 296 (2d Cir. 2012), that \n\"presumption\" only comes into play after the First Amendment actually applies or attaches. \nThere is, however, no \"presumption\" that the First Amendment applies or attaches to any \nparticular judicial proceeding or document; instead, the Supreme Court established the non \npresumptive test set forth in Richmond Newspapers. Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980) \n(plurality opinion), and its progeny. \n-6-\n\nset forth by the Supreme Court to determine when the First Amendment applies to a particular \njudicial proceeding to which access is sought, see Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. l, \n9 ( 1986) (\"Press-Entemrise II\") (\"If the particular proceeding in question passes these tests of \nexperience and logic, a qualified First Amendment right of public access attaches.\"). \nThe D.C. Circuit observed in Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004), that the \nSupreme Court has found that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to \ncriminal judicial proceedings only when the place and process historically have been open to the \npublic and public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular \nprocess in question.  355 F.3d at 704.  Lower courts have extended the Richmond Newspapers \nexception to certain trial-like civil proceedings found to satisfy the same experience and logic \ntests, but the Supreme Court has never ratified that approach.  Id. \nAgain, standing must be \"gauged by the specific ... constitutional claims that a party \npresents.\" lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77.  The \"specific\" constitutional claims \nMovants present are claims under the First Amendment to access information in FISC judicial \nopinions that the Executive Branch has determined is classified national security information. \nThe FISC issued those opinions in ex parte proceedings that are unique to its jurisdiction under \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1842(b) and 1861(b)(l).  Movants also assert a concomitant right to challenge the \nconstitutionality of each of those classification decisions, to require the Executive Branch to \ndefend them, and to obtain FISC rulings on it all.  Because the unclassified portions of the FISC \nopinions at issue have already been made public, Movants' alleged interest can only be described \nas accessing \"classified information in FISC judicial opinions\"5 and not the broader universe of \n5  This framing of the interest is consistent with the Court's prior precedent addressing \nwhether the qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified FISC judicial \nproceedings.  See In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484, 491-97 (FISA \n- 7 -\n\n\"access to judicial proceedings\" generally, as perceived by the Majority Opinion.6  See,~' \nDoe, 749 at 266 (limiting the First Amendment to \"secur[ing] a right of access only to particular \njudicial records and documents\" and not to \"all judicial documents and records\"). \nTo be sure, one can find broad statements about a right of the public to access judicial \nproceedings more generally.  But those statements concern the common law right of access, \nwhich is a right that was not invoked by Movants and is analytically distinct from the First \nAmendment right they claimed.  As the Fourth Circuit cogently explained, \"[t]he common-law \npresumptive right of access extends to all judicial documents and records\" whereas \"[b] y \ncontrast, the First Amendment secures a right of access only to particular judicial records and \ndocuments\" when it applies.  See Doe v. Pub. Citizen, 749 F.3d 246, 265-66 (4th Cir. 2014) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted, emphases added). 7  The Sixth Circuit echoed this \nCt. 2007) (concluding that the First Amendment provides no public right of access to FISC \njudicial records). \n6  Movants contend their interest is in \"opinions containing significant legal interpretation \nof the Constitution and statutory law\" and they argue that \"[f]or those sorts of opinions, at least, \nthe First Amendment has always required courts to operate openly ....\"   Movants' Reply Br. I. \nThis argument is clearly erroneous.  For example, the Supreme Court has implied, and federal \ncircuit courts of appeal have expressly held, that the qualified First Amendment right of public \naccess does not apply to grand jury proceedings where significant opinions are frequently made. \nSee, e.g., Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 218-21 (1979) (making \nclear that grand jury proceedings historically have been closed to the public and public access \nwould hinder the efficient functioning of those proceedings so such proceedings impliedly would \nnot satisfy the test of experience and logic set forth in Richmond Newspapers); In re Motions of \nDow Jones & Co., 142 F.3d 496, 499 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (\"A settled proposition, one the press does \nnot contest, is this: there is no First Amendment right of access to grand jury proceedings.\"); \nUnited States v. Smith, 123 F.3d 140, 148 (3d Cir. 1997) (\"Not only are grand jury proceedings \nnot subject to any First Amendment right of access, but third parties can gain access to grand \njury matters only under limited circumstances.\"). \n7  Accord In re U.S. for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(D), 707 F.3d 283, 291 n.8 \n(4th Cir. 2013) (rejecting plaintiffs' contention that the First Amendment protects a general right \nto access judicial orders and proceedings because \"[t]his interpretation of the First Amendment \n- 8 -\n\nsentiment when it stated that the First Amendment covers only \"certain proceedings and \ndocuments filed therein and nothing more.\"  Phillips, 841 F.3d at 419 (internal quotation marks \nomitted, emphasis added). \nIn describing the right of access to judicial records under the common law, the Supreme \nCourt has stated that \"[i]t is clear that the courts of this country recognize a general right to \ninspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.\" \nNixon v. Warner Commc'ns. Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978).  That right, however, is not \nsacrosanct and yields when, for example, \"Congress has created an administrative procedure for \nprocessing and releasing to the public\" the material sought by a litigant, id. at 603, which \narguably is the case here.  Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act of20158-fittingly titled \n\"Declassification of significant decisions, orders, and opinions\"-now provides procedures for \nmaking FISC judicial opinions publicly available.  In addition, the Freedom of Information Act \n(\"FOIA\") dictates what \"[e]ach agency shall make available to the public ....\"   5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a).  Moreover, this Court previously held that, with respect to FISC proceedings, the \ncommon law right of access is preempted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, \ncodified as amended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1885c (West 2015) (\"FISA\").  In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 490-91 (rejecting the ACLU's claim of a common \nlaw right of access because, among other reasons, \"[t]he requested records are being maintained \nunder a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to protect FISC records from routine public \nright of access is too broad, and directly contrary to our holding that this right extends only to \nparticular judicial records and documents\"). \n8  Pub. L. No. 114-23, 129 Stat. 268 (2015), as codified at 50 U.S.C. § 1872. \n-9-\n\ndisclosure\").  The essential point, however, is that Movants have not claimed a violation of the \ncommon law right of access. \nB. \nAfter properly framing Movants' interest as an interest in accessing classified \ninformation in FISC judicial opinions rather than the expansion adopted by the Majority, it is \nnecessary to decide whether that interest is protected by law.  Movants cite the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access as their only legally protected interest. 9  The only interest \nprotected by the qualified First Amendment right of public access, however, is an interest in \naccess to trial-like judicial proceedings to and related documents when the place and process \nhistorically have been open to the public and public access plays a significant positive role in the \nfunctioning of the particular process in question.  See. e.g., Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9 \n(stating that the \"particular proceeding\" in question must pass the tests of experience and logic \nfor the qualified First Amendment right of access to attach); Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. v. \n9  In re Opinions of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL 427591, at *21. \n10  As discussed supra page 7, the Supreme Court has never extended the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access to non-criminal proceedings and the D.C. Circuit continues to \nadhere to the Supreme Court's application.  See. e.g., Elm!, 355 F.3d 697 at 704 {\"To \nsummarize, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has ever applied Richmond Newspapers \noutside the context of criminal proceedings, and we will not do so today.\").  Other courts, \nthough, have extended the right to certain trial-like civil and administrative proceedings.  See. \n~' N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2012). \nWhile we all recognize this contrary authority, it remains true that, \"[b] olstered by the Sixth \nAmendment's express right for a 'public trial' in 'all criminal prosecutions,' public access to \ncriminal trials forms the core of this First Amendment constitutional right.\"  In re Application of \nWP Co. LLC, 201 F. Supp. 3d 109, 117 (D.D.C. 2016) (internal citations omitted).  See also \nUnited States v. Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir. 1995) (reciting history of open criminal trials and \nnoting \"[i]n Gannett [Co .. Inc. v. DePasguale], 443 U.S. 368] 379-81, the Supreme Court, \nstriking the balance in favor of the criminal defendant, determined that the Sixth Amendment \nguarantee of a public trial was personal to the accused and did not grant the press and general \npublic an independent right of access, at least to pretrial suppression hearings\"). \n- 10 -\n\nGen. Electric Co., 854 F.2d 900, 903 (6th Cir. 1988) (applying the same tests to a civil \nproceeding).  To distill this point to its essence for our purposes, it is fair to say that the qualified \nFirst Amendment right of public access protects only an interest in judicial proceedings and \nrelated documents involving places and processes that have been historically public. 11  That \nrubric patently does not apply to the FISC, FISC proceedings or FISC judicial opinions, or to \ninformation classified by the Executive Branch and redacted in declassified versions of FISC \njudicial opinions. \nWorking in secrecy at the FISC is not simply a matter of \"necessity.\" Majority Op. 2.  It \nis a legislative imperative under FISA.  See. e.g., 50 U.S.C. §§ 1803(c) (stating that \"[t]he record \nof proceedings under this chapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall be \nmaintained under security procedures established by the Chief Justice in consultation with the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence\"), 1805(a) (mandating that, \"[u]pon \nan application made pursuant to section 1804 of this title, the judge shall enter an ex parte order \nas requested or as modified\" if certain specified findings are made), 1842(d  )( 1) (same), \n1861(c)(l) (same).  The FISC has twice emphasized this congressional mandate.  See In re \nOpinions & Orders of This Court, No. Misc. 13-08, 2017 WL427591, at *15; In re Motion for \nRelease of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 488-90.  And at least twice the FISC has \nemphasized that its proceedings have never been public, it has never held a public hearing, and \nthe number of opinions released to the public is statistically minor relative to the thousands of \nclassified decisions it has issued.  See In re Opinions & Orders of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, \n11  The Majority agrees.  Majority Op. 6 (admitting that \"to determine whether the public has \na right of access to particular judicial proceedings, courts must ask ... whether the place and \nprocess historically have been open to the press and general public\" (internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n- 11 -\n\nat *17-20; In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 487-88, 492-93. \nNotably, too, in this matter no sealing order or other discretionary action has been taken by the \nCourt to impede public access to its classified opinions or the classified information redacted \nfrom its declassified and public opinions.12  The point is not just that FISC proceedings and \njudicial documents have never been historically public, but, importantly, the FISC does not \nexercise discretionary decision making about whether to conduct its proceedings in a non-public \nfashion-it is required to do so by statute. \nThis history of non-public proceedings weighs heavily against Movant's asserted First \nAmendment right of access to information classified by the Executive Branch.  Even \"[m]ore \nsignificant is that from the beginning of the republic to the present day, there is no tradition of \npublicizing secret national security information ....\"   Dhiab v. Trump, 852 F.3d 1087, 1094 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).  \"The tradition is exactly the opposite.\" Id. \nMovants argue that this Court should not defer to the Executive Branch's classification \ndecisions but should review and potentially reject those decisions.  Movants' Reply Br. 2.  This \nargument is considered only to determine whether Movants have identified a right that the First \nAmendment protects, not to rule on its merits.  They have not identified such a First Amendment \nright to FISC review of Executive Branch classification decisions.  Furthermore, this Court has \n12  In Bond v. Utreras, 585 F.3d 1061, 1073 (7th Cir. 2009), the Seventh Circuit noted that \nthe common law offers a presumptive right of access to most documents filed in court based on \nthe principle that courts \"are public institutions that operate openly\" and \"judicially imposed \nlimitations on this right are subject to the First Amendment.\"  Because the FISC issued no \nsealing order or protective order preventing Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, there has been no \"judicially imposed limitation\" that would be subject to the First \nAmendment.  Furthermore, contrary to the Majority Opinion's assertion that Bond is \"thin \nsupport,\" Majority Op. 15, it stands for the very proposition asserted in the January 25, 2017 \nOpinion, 2017 WL 427591, at *10, which is that when there is no law that applies to protect a \nplaintiffs asserted interest, there is no legally protected interest sufficient to establish Article III \nstanding. \n- 12 -\n\npreviously said that \"[u  ]nder FISA and the applicable Security Procedures, there is no role for \nthis Court independently to review, and potentially override, Executive Branch classification \ndecisions\" and, even \"if the FISC were to assume the role of independently making \ndeclassification and release decisions in the probing manner requested by the ACLU, there \nwould be a real risk of harm to national security interests and ultimately to the FISA process \nitself.\"  In re Motion for Release of Court Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d at 491. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to accord these principles the governing weight to which they \nare entitled.  Richmond Newspapers specifically established a two-part test for determining when \nthe qualified First Amendment right of access applies - and that standard requires both the place \nand the process to have been historically public. 13  The Majority Opinion appears to accept this \nprinciple, 14 even as it fails to apply it.  There is no legal basis to find that Movants present a \ncolorable claim the First Amendment protects their asserted interest in accessing a place and \nprocess that is distinctly not public and required by law to not be public. \nIII. \nThe Majority Opinion most strenuously decries the January 25, 2017 decision in In re \nOpinions of This Court because the Majority believes that deciding Movants have no legally \nprotected interest necessarily, and improperly, involved deciding the merits of Movants' cause of \naction.  The Majority Opinion chastises the decision for having \"engaged in a lengthy merits \nanalysis of Movants' claim under the Richmond Newspapers 'experience and logic' test,\" \n13  \"The First Amendment guarantees the press and the public access to aspects of court \nproceedings, including documents, 'if such access has historically been available, and serves an \nimportant function of monitoring prosecutorial or judicial misconduct.\"'  United States v. El \nSayegh, 131 F.3d 158, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Accord Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 9. \n14  See note 11, supra. \n- 13 -\n\nMajority Op. 5.  But the Majority fails to explain why it believes that addressing Richmond \nNewspapers constituted deciding the merits of the motion.  Plainly an examination of the law \ninvoked by Movants may be part of-even essential to-a proper analysis of standing.  See \nWarth, 422 U.S. at 500 (\"[S]tanding ... often turns on the nature and source of the claim \nasserted.\"); lnt'l Primate Prot. League, 500 U.S. at 77 (\"[S]tanding is gauged by the specific \ncommon-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.\").  Because application of \nthe experience and logic tests revealed that Movants have no right of public access to classified \nFISC judicial documents or proceedings, they failed to identify an interest that is legally \nprotected and, thus, have no standing. \nThe Majority takes the mistaken and circular view that, because the Court must assume \nthat on the merits Movants would be successful in their claims when it evaluates standing, it \ntherefore follows that, \"[t]rom this base,\" the Court can conclude that Movants satisfy the \nrequirements of Article III standing.  Majority Op. 8.  The Majority misinterprets the Supreme \nCourt's edict that consideration of Article III standing does not involve consideration of the \nmerits.  \"Because a review of standing does not review the merits of a claim, but the parties and \nforum involved, our assumption during the standing inquiry that the plaintiff will eventually win \nthe relief he seeks does not, on its own, assure that the litigant has satisfied any element of \nstanding.\"  Fla.

As demonstrated below, whether Movants can establish the \nelements of their cause of action alleging that the Court improperly withheld information that the \nExecutive Branch improperly determined was classified national security information requires \nconsideration of factual and legal issues separate from the question of whether the First \nAmendment applies at all to certain FISC judicial opinions and proceedings.  The Majority \noverlooks this important nuance in the Supreme Court's legal standard that otherwise prohibits \nconsideration of standing from reaching the merits of the cause of action. \nThe Majority's error also represents a misreading of Richmond Newspapers and its \nprogeny, as well as cases that find no standing when a plaintiff fails to identify a legally \nprotected interest.  The Majority Opinion notes the Tenth Circuit's statement in Initiative & \n15  \"Although the standing question is often dressed in the dazzling robe of legal jargon, its \nessence is simple-what kind of injuries are courts empowered to remedy and what kind are they \npowerless to address?\"  Schaffer v. Clinton, 240 F.3d 878, 883 (10th Cir. 2001). \n- 15 -\n\nReferendum Inst. v. Walker, 450 F.3d 1082, 1092 (10th Cir. 2006) that, '\"[f]or purposes of \nstanding, the question cannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends \nprotection to the plaintiffs asserted right or interest.\"'  Majority Op. 8 (quoting Walker, 450 \nF .3d at 1092).  But the Majority misunderstands the import of the statement:  its principle applies \nwhen, unlike this matter, there is an applicable constitutional provision and both standing and the \nmerits involve the same question about the scope of that applicable constitutional provision.  See \nDay v. Bond, 500 F.3d 1127, 1136-1138 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"Critically, however, in Walker, the \nplaintiffs' asserted injury and their claimed constitutional violation were one and the same.\"). \nWhen standing and the merits require different legal analyses, standing can be, and must be, \ndecided first and independently.  Id.  The Tenth Circuit explained: \n[W]e did note [in Walker] that \"the term 'legally protected interest' must \ndo some work in the standing analysis ... [and] has independent force and \nmeaning without any need to open the door to merits considerations at the \njurisdictional stage.\"  Id. at 1093 .... \nPractically  speaking,  Walker  mandates  that  we  assume,  during  the \nevaluation of the plaintiffs standing, that the plaintiff will prevail on his \nmerits argument-that is, that the defendant has violated the law.  See id. \n(\"For purposes of standing, we must assume the [p]laintiffs' claim has \nlegal  validity.\").  But there  is  still work to  be done by the  standing \nrequirement,  and  Supreme  Court  precedent  bars  us  from  assuming \njurisdiction based upon a hypothetical legal injury.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130.  While Walker addressed an instance in which the \nmerits of the plaintiffs' claims mirrored the alleged standing injury, that is \nnot always the case.  There are cases,  such as the one before us here, \nwhere  the  alleged injury  upon  which  the  plaintiffs  rely  to  establish \nstanding is distinct from the merits ofc laims they assert. E.g., In re Special \nGrand Jurv 89-2, 450 F.3d 1159, 1172-73 (10th Cir.2006) (\"[A] plaintiff \ncan have standing despite losing on the merits-that is, even though the \n[asserted legally protected] interest would not be protected by the law in \nthat case.\"); see also Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envt'l Study Grp., Inc., \n438 U.S. 59, 78-79, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978). \nHere, the issue of standing is not necessarily determined by the merits \ndetermination. The merits issue is whether K.S.A. § 76-731 a is preempted \nby 8 U.S.C. § 1623.  The standing question is whether§ 1623 creates a \nprivate cause of action.  Each of these issues is separate and independent, \n- 16 -\n\nand we may determine whether the Plaintiffs here have standing to assert \na private cause of action under § 1623 without reaching the merits of \nwhether §  1623  preempts § 76-73la.  See DH2. Inc.  v.  U.S.  Sec.  & \nExchange Comm'n, 422 F.3d 591, 592 (7th Cir. 2005) (determining that \nthe plaintiff lacked standing because its injury was speculative, without \naddressing the merits of the underlying claim). \nUnder these conditions, Walker simply does not apply.  Accordingly, we \nnow tum to the pure standing question whether § 1623 confers a private \ncause of action upon the Plaintiffs. \nId. (emphases added).16  Day makes a useful distinction that is helpful to the immediate \ndiscussion. \nAccording to the Tenth Circuit, decisions on standing and the merits remain independent \nlegal inquiries whenever a decision on the merits would not necessarily decide standing.  Only \nwhen both merits and standing require a decision on the same legal question does that Circuit \nfind them conjoined so that standing cannot be separately decided first.17  That is not the case \nhere. \nIn Press-Entemrise II the Supreme Court made clear that, when the qualified First \nAmendment right of public access applies (which is an antecedent inquiry Movants failed to \n16  To be clear, Walker itself involved a recognized First Amendment right because plaintiffs \nwere asserting a free-speech interest expressly protected by the First Amendment.  450 F.3d at \nI 088.  In the instant matter, the immediate question is whether Movants have a colorable right \nunder the First Amendment to access information in FISC opinions that the Executive Branch \ndetermined was classified. \n17  The Tenth Circuit has also recounted \"instances in which courts have examined the \nmerits of the underlying claim and concluded that the plaintiffs lacked a legally protected interest \nand therefore lacked standing.\"  Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d \n1223, 1236 (10th Cir. 2004).  The D.C. Circuit has clearly held that when \"plaintiff's claim has \nno foundation in law, he has no legally protected interest and thus no standing to sue.\" \nClaybrook v. Slater, 111 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (citations omitted).  Deciding standing \ncan often come close to the merits without violating legal principles.  See Arjay Assocs., Inc. v. \nBush, 891 F.2d 894, 898 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (stating that \"[b]ecause appellants have no right to \nconduct foreign commerce in products excluded by Congress, they have in this case no right \ncapable of judicial enforcement and have thus suffered no injury capable of judicial redress\"). \n- 17 -\n\nsurmount in this case), a cause of action arises if ( 1) access was denied (2) without specific, on \nthe-record findings (3) demonstrating that '\"closure [was] essential to preserve higher values\"' \nand (4) closure was \"narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"' 478 U.S. at 13-14 (quoting Press \nEnter. Co. v. Superior Ct., 464 U.S. 501, 510 (1984) (\"Press-Entemrise I\")).  Movants contend \nthat their cause of action also includes as an element a right to challenge the government's \nclassification decisions.  Movants' Reply In Support of Their Mot. for the Release of Court \nRecords 4, available at http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Misc%2013-\n08%20Reply-l.pdf.  These elements form Movants' cause of action, the merits of which were \nnever discussed in In re Opinions of This Court. \nAs to standing, however, the question focuses on whether classified FISC judicial \nopinions and proceedings have been historically open to the public and arise from a trial-like \nsetting, see Richmond Newspapers, so that Movants have a colorable legally protected interest. \nThis latter question does not run to the merits of their cause of action but, instead, to \"whether \nthe plaintiffs have a legal right to do what is allegedly being impeded.\"  Citizen Ctr., 770 F.3d at \n91 O; see also Grella, 553 F.2d at 261 (\"standing does require an injury to the party arising out of \na legal right\"); Cox Cable Commc'ns, Inc., 992 F.2d at 1182 (there is no injury \"unless an \ninterest is protected\"). \nThe Majority ignores this directly-applicable precedent in opining that the January 25, \n2017 decision ruled improperly on the merits in deciding that Movants had not asserted a legally \n- 18 -\n\nprotected interest under the First Amendment.18  The Majority confuses proper application of the \nArticle III requirement that a litigant present a cognizable legal interest with a merits decision on \nwhether that legal interest was unlawfully impaired. \nIV. \nThe Majority Opinion raises other considerations that, in my estimation, are not \npersuasive and do not detract from the foregoing analysis.  From the outset, the Majority Opinion \nnot only confuses the scope of the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the \ncommon law presumptive right of access, but the Majority also characterizes as \"novel\" \nMovants' theory that a qualified First Amendment right of public access applies to classified and \nex parte FISC judicial proceedings that historically never have been public.  However, it is not \nnovel.  Movants initially presented their First Amendment theory to the FISC more than a decade \nago, at which time it was considered and decisively rejected.  See In re Motion for Release of \nCourt Records, 526 F. Supp. 2d 484.  This same theory has been re-litigated without success \nmultiple times since. 19 \n18  See In re Opinions of This Court, 2017 WL 427591, at *9-13 (listing cases).  The \nMajority Opinion fails to distinguish these cases and cites no applicable precedent to the \ncontrary.  Each of the cases cited in In re Opinions of This Court involved dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, which is not a decision on the merits.  See. e.g., Havens v. Mabus, \n759 F.3d 91, 98 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (stating that \"[w]e have previously held that dismissals for lack \nof jurisdiction are not decisions on the merits\"). \n19  See In re Orders of This Court Interpreting S. 215 of the Patriot Act, No. Misc. 13-02, \n2013 WL 5460064, at *1 (FISA Ct. 2013) (stating that the ACLU \"assert[ed] a qualified First \nAmendment right of access to the opinions in question\"); In re Proceedings Required by 702(i) \nofFISA Amendments Act of 2008, Misc. No. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *3 (FISA Ct. 2008) \n(observing that the ACLU's request for release under the First Amendment \"is similar to a \nrequest it made on August 9, 2007\"); In re Motion for Release of Court Records, Misc. No. 07-\n01 (FISA Ct. Feb. 8, 2008) (rejecting on reconsideration the ACLU's First Amendment theory). \n- 19 -\n\nMore importantly, the Majority suggests that novelty might have legal significance to the \nreal issue, i.e., whether Movants' claims involve injury to a legally protected interest.  For \nexample, the Majority Opinion states, \"[a]s far as we can tell, courts have uniformly found \nstanding to bring a First Amendment right-of-access suit so long as plaintiffs allege an invasion \nrelated to judicial proceedings\" and \"[t]hat is so no matter how novel or meritless the claims may \nbe.\" Majority Op. 11.  The Majority Opinion cites no case to support this claim of \"uniform\" \njudicial \"findings.\" At best, the Majority Opinion goes on to assert that \"[s]ome courts have \nstretched the right-of-access even farther for standing purposes,\" Majority Op. 11, then cites a \nsingle D.C. Circuit decision, namely Flynt v. Rumsfeld, 355 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nThe Flynt decision does not do the work the Majority asks of it.  Contrary to the \nMajority's characterization, the .ElYill court found that appellants \"asserted no cognizable First \nAmendment claim.\"  355 F .3d at 703 (emphasis added).  Nonetheless, the .ElYill court found that \nthey had standing to bring (at best some of) their claims alleging a press right to embed with \ncombat troops, which was advanced based on the First Amendment's express guarantees of free \npress and speech, not the qualified First Amendment right of public access.  Id.  The .ElYill court \ndiscussed standing in a single paragraph that omits without explanation Lujan 's definition of \n\"injury in fact\" as \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"20  504 U.S. at 560 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted, emphasis added).  Since .ElYill, the Supreme \nCourt has repeatedly reiterated that required element of an injury-in-fact, see supra page 3, \ncalling into question the perfunctory discussion of standing in .ElYill.  Finally, the .ElYill court's \n20  .ElYill also makes no mention of the alternative formulation that an \"injury in fact\" must \nbe legally and judicially cognizable.  See Raines, 521 U.S. at 819. \n- 20 -\n\nstanding analysis did not give any consideration to the novelty of the appellants' claim of a right \nto embed with troops and did not involve a request for access to judicial proceedings. \nThe Majority Opinion adds that \"many courts-including the Supreme Court-have not \neven felt it necessary to address standing in dealing with tenuous right-of-access claims,\" \nMajority Op. 12, and \"[a] long list of courts have acted in this fashion,\" Majority Op. 13.  The \nMajority Opinion then cites eight decisions from six courts:  (1) Houchins v. KQED. Inc., 438 \nU.S. 1 (1978); (2) Dhiab, 852 F.3d 1087; (3) Phillips, 841 F.3d 405; (4) In re United States for an \nOrder Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(0), 707 F.3d 283; (5) In re Search of Fair Finance, \n692 F.3d 424 (6th Cir. 2012); (6) In re New York Times Company to Unseal Wiretap and Search \nWarrant Materials, 577 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2009); (7) Baltimore Sun Company v. Goetz, 886 F.2d \n60 (4th Cir. 1989); (8) Calder v. Internal Revenue Service, 890 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. \n1989)).  All of these cases collapse upon examination. \nThree of the cases cited by the Majority-Dhiab, In re New York Times Company and \nBaltimore Sun-did not address standing because they involved permissive intervenors.21  The \nfederal circuits are split about whether third-parties moving to intervene permissively under Rule \n24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in ongoing litigation in which a case or controversy \nalready exists must themselves demonstrate Article III standing.  See Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, \n317 F.3d 45, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that \"the circuits are split on the question of whether \nstanding is required to intervene if the original parties are still pursuing the case and thus \nmaintaining a case or controversy\").  Cf. In re Endangered Species Act§ 4 Deadline Litig., 704 \n21  See Dhiab, 852 F.3d at 1090 (stating that the district court \"granted the [press] \norganizations' motion to intervene\"); In re N.Y. Times Co. to Unseal Wiretap & Search Warrant \nMaterials, 577 F.3d at 401 (stating in background section that newspaper moved to intervene and \nciting the district court case confirming that fact); Baltimore Sun, 886 F.2d at 62 (stating that the \nBaltimore Sun had petitioned the district court to intervene). \n- 21 -\n\nF.3d 972, 980 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"It remains, however, an open question in this circuit whether \nArticle III standing is required for permissive intervention.\"). \nHouchins involved news media organizations that sought to expand the scope of the First \nAmendment's express protections for a free press into an \"implied special right of access to \ngovernment-controlled sources of information.\"  438 U.S. at 7-8.  It is not surprising that the \nSupreme Court did not discuss standing given that the question was not whether the First \nAmendment's right of a free press applied but, rather, whether, properly interpreted, the scope of \nthat right mandated the access sought by the news media organizations.  Id. \nBecause the remaining cases, Phillips, In re United States for an Order Pursuant to 18 \nU.S.C. Section 2703(0), In re Search of Fair Finance and Calder were silent about the question \nof standing22 it is inappropriate to draw any conclusion about what they \"felt\" about standing. \nAriz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 125, 144 (2011) (\"The Court would risk \nerror if it relied on assumptions that have gone unstated and unexamined.\").  At best, it might be \nargued that the absence of any relevant discussion of standing by these courts implies that they \nthought there was standing, except that \"[w   ]hen a potential jurisdictional defect is neither noted \nnor discussed in a federal decision, the decision does not stand for the proposition that no defect \nexisted.\" Id. 23  \"There is no such thing as a precedential sub silentio jurisdictional holding[.]\" \nCuba v. Pylant, 814 F.3d 701, 709 (5th Cir. 2016). \n22  Although the Sixth Circuit in Phillips addressed standing with respect to other \nconstitutional claims asserted by the plaintiffs, it failed to do so for the so-called \"right-of \naccess-to-govemment-proceedings\" claim.  841 F.3d at 414-20. \n23  See also United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 38 (1952) (\"Even \nas to our own judicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Chief Justice \nMarshall who held that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where \nit was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.\"). \n- 22-\n\nv. \nThe Majority Opinion fails to persuade.  It confuses the scope of a legally protected \ninterest under the qualified First Amendment right of public access with the scope of such an \ninterest under the common law.  It further confuses the standing requirement under Article III \nthat a litigant present an injury to a protected legal interest with the merits decision on whether \nthe litigant can actually prove that the asserted legal interest was impaired.  Under Richmond \nNewspapers, the qualified First Amendment right of public access patently does not apply to \nnon-trial-like judicial proceedings that are not public and never have been. The errors in the \nMajority Opinion effectively relax the requirements for Article III standing when members of the \npublic ask to review and comment on redacted classified information in FISC judicial opinions. \nAs a result, anyone in the United States apparently has a legally protected First Amendment \ninterest in accessing information in FISC judicial opinions that the Executive Branch determined \nis classified and may invoke this Court's statutorily-limited and specialized jurisdiction to \nchallenge those classification decisions as unconstitutional.  I cannot agree.  For these reasons I \nwould conclude that Movants lack standing to assert their claims as Article III standing \nrequirements are understood and applied in any case.  But the Court should apply those \nrequirements with particular rigor in this case. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed the lower courts to apply a more rigorous analysis of \nstanding when a party seeks to challenge actions by the Executive or Legislative Branches on \nconstitutional grounds.  See, e.g., Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  To be precise, the Supreme Court \nhas stated that \"our standing inquiry has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of \nthe dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of \nthe Federal Government was unconstitutional.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  Accord Crawford v. \nUnited States Dep't of the Treasury, 868 F.3d 438, 457 (6th Cir. 2017).  Layered onto this \n- 23 -\n\n\"especially rigorous\" analysis is the Supreme Court's observation that \"we have often found a \nlack of standing in cases in which the Judiciary has been requested to review actions of the \npolitical branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs,\" as also is the case \nhere.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013).24 \nIntelligence gathering is one of the \"vital aspects of national security.\"  Gen. Dynamics \nCorp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 486 (2011).  \"Matters intimately related to ... national \nsecurity are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention.\"  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 \n( 1981 ).  Accordingly, \"unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally \n24  The Majority disagrees that \"we should change our conclusion simply because we \nconsider a constitutional challenge involving the Executive Branch.\"  Majority Op. 16.  The \nMajority's position is difficult to follow; one cannot avoid a Raines analysis here.  An especially \nrigorous standing analysis is required-without reference to the merits-whenever the merits of \nthe disp.ute would force a court to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two \nbranches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional.  Raines, 521 U.S. at 819-20.  Movants \nare asking the FISC to do exactly that.  Critically, there has been no sealing, closure, or \nprotective order issued by the FISC to impede Movants' access to the classified information they \nseek, so there is no discretionary judicial action being challenged by Movants, unlike cases in \nwhich the qualified First Amendment right of access was found to apply.  See. e.g., Press-Enter. \nII, 478 U.S. at 4 (judicial closure order); Press-Enter. I, 464 U.S. at 503-504 (same); Globe \nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 598 (1982) (same); \nRichmond Newspapers, 448 US. at 559-60 (same). \nThe Majority Opinion also seizes on the dissent's quotation from Clapper to insist that there is no \n\"special standing requirement\" for plaintiffs seeking review of acts by the political branches in \nthe fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.  Majority Op. 17 (claiming that the dissent \nis reading Clapper to impose such a requirement and citing Schuchardt v. President of the United \nStates, 839 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2016)).  But Schuchardt addressed a heightened standing \nrequirement in line with the analysis in Jewel v. Nat'l Sec. Agency, 673 F.3d 902, 913 (9th Cir. \n2011), in which the Ninth Circuit rejected a district court's requirement that plaintiffs \ndemonstrate a \"strong\" and \"persuasive\" claim to Article III standing when suing NSA.  This \ndissent quotes Clapper to caution against relaxing standing requirements and expanding judicial \npower, 568 U.S. at 408-409, not to advocate for special standing requirements.  Like this dissent, \nClapper made no mention of a \"special\" or \"heightened\" requirement to establish standing in the \nnational security realm or otherwise.  Rather, in combination, Raines and Clapper require courts \nto ensure the vigor of the principles of separation of powers by giving close attention and \nexacting consideration to the elements of standing when asked to review actions of the political \nbranches involving intelligence gathering. \n- 24-\n\nhave been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in ... national security \naffairs,\" Dep't of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988), including \"the protection of classified \ninformation,\" which the Supreme Court has directed \"must be committed to the broad discretion \nof the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have \naccess to it,\" id. at 529. \n\"'Relaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial \npower[.]\"' Clapper, 568 U.S. at 408-409 (quoting United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 \n(1974) (Powell, J., concurring)).  \"The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation \nof-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers \nof the political branches.\"  Id.  Importantly, \"decision-making in the field[] of ... national \nsecurity is textually committed to the political branches of government.\"  Schneider v. Kissinger, \n412 F.3d 190, 194 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  In the exercise of that textually-committed decision \nmaking, Congress has already provided two avenues for any member of the public to obtain \naccess to FISC judicial opinions (Section 402 of the USA FREEDOM Act and FOIA), subject to \nExecutive Branch classification decisions which, under FOIA, are subject to examination in \nfederal district courts insofar as specifically provided by statute. \nThe Majority Opinion provides no basis in law for the FISC to expand its jurisdiction \ncontrary to Supreme Court guidance, statutory provisions that limit its jurisdiction to a \nspecialized area of national concern, and the evident congressional mandate that the Court \nconduct its proceedings ex parte and in accord with prescribed security procedures.  Applying \n- 25 -\n\nwell-established principles of Article III standing with the rigor appropriate to a constitutional \nchallenge to Executive Branch determinations in the national security sphere, I continue to \nconclude that Movants lack standing to assert the constitutional claim in question. \nFor all these reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n- 26 -",

These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant\nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or \"the\nAct\"), by the National Security Agency (''NSA\"), Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"),\nCentral Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\"), and National Counterterrorism Center (\"NCTC\")\n(collectively, \"covered agencies\"), and apply in addition to separate minimization procedures for\nthe covered agencies adopted pursuant to subsection 702(e) of the Act.

That agency will make a record of\nthe action taken, to include any query terrn(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National\nSecurity Division (\"NSD\"), which will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\nCourt (\"FISC\") of such activity.\n(U) III.  Nothing in these procedures shall restrict the lawful oversight functions of NSD or\nODNI, or the applicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict a covered agency from\nproviding the assistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions.\nNothing in these procedures shall restrict a covered agency's performance oflawful training\nfunctions of its personnel, or creating, testing, or maintaining its systems.  In addition, nothing in\nthese procedures shall restrict a covered agency's performance of lawful oversight functions of\nits personnel or systems, which includes queries performed for the following reasons: in support\nof a covered agency's investigation and remediation of a possible compliance incident, including\na potential spill of classified information; to identify information subject to destruction, including\nunder a covered agency's minimization procedures; to ensure the effective application of\nmarking or segregation requirements in relevant agency minimization procedures or federal\nrecords requirements; in support of a covered agency's audit or review, for quality control\npurposes, of work done by agency personnel; in support of authorized work conducted in\nsystems used solely for audits and oversight; or in support of agency investigations of potential\nmisconduct by an employee that otherwise would not meet the query standards detailed for each\n- .:tW I  IS W.T dFdi IITI ill hi \nClassified by.

Should a covered agency intend to rely on the provision regarding lawful \noversight functions of its personnel or systems, in whole or in part, to deviate from an aspect of \nthese procedures and the purpose of such deviation is not listed above, the covered agency shall \nconsult with NSD and ODNI prior to conducting such a query.  NSD shall then report the \ndeviation promptly to the FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from \nthe procedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was necessary. \nSimilarly, nothing in these procedures shall prohibit the querying of information necessary to \ncomply with a specific congressional mandate or order of a court within the United States. \nMoreover, nothing in these procedures shall prohibit the querying of information necessary to \ncomply with the requirements of the Freedom oflnformation Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, or the \nPrivacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a.  Additionally, nothing in these procedures shall restrict a covered \nagency's ability to conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have not been \ncompromised.  Covered agencies are permitted to conduct queries designed to identify \n· information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a litigation matter.  The \ncovered agencies must keep a record of any United States person query term used for a query of \nunminimized section 702-acquired informatfon in support of the activities described in this \nSection. \n(U)  IV.  The covered agencies must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United \nStates person query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702.  Such electronic record must, at a minimum, include the following information: the \nquery term(s) used or approved, the date of the query or approval of query term(s), the identifier \nof the user who conducted the query or sought approval of the query term(s ), and, in the case of \nNSA content queries, the approving official in NSA's Office of General Counsel and duration of \nthe approval.  NSA, CIA, and NCTC shall also maintain records of the statement of facts \nestablishing that the use of any United States person query term is reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information. In the event it is impracticable for a covered agency system to \ngenerate an electronic record, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents \nthe generation of such an electronic record, the covered agency must generate and maintain a \nwritten record of each United States person query term that contains the same information \nrequired for electronic records, as described above.  Before conducting a query in a system that \ndoes not generate an electronic record of a query, the covered agency personnel must reasonably \ndetermine that conducting that query in a system that generates an electronic record would be \ninsufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or security reasons.  For NSA content queries, \nsuch records of United States person query terms must be maintained at least five years from the \ndate a United States person query term was approved; for NSA metadata queries and for queries \nconducted by the FBI, CIA, and NCTC, such records of United States person query terms must \nbe maintained at least five years from the date a United States person query term was used. \nSECRETh'NO~OR.~ \n2 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page 2 of 7 Consolidated Set Section 702 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n(U) V.  Definitions and Presumptions\n(U) A.  Definitions for purposes of these procedures\n(U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms\n\"foreign intelligence information,\" .\"person,\" \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\"\n(S/015) \n�When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that is \nreasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons. United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons.  Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assess�ent \nby a trained intelligence professional. \"United States person query term\" is not limited to \nany single category of information or technology.  Depending on the context, examples of \nUnited States person query terms may include: \nI I  - - 'I  ·11u·1 \nrsonal or corporate identification n \n-and street address, telephone, and \nes person query term does not incluI   t I  i•   i. .l j I  t \nmanufacturer's name (or related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n(e.g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 321 \"). \n1 \n(U) \"Query\" means the use of one or more terms  to retrieve the unminimized contents or\nnoncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located in a\ncovered agency's system.  The term \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that\ncontains unminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive\nunminimized section 702-acquired information in response to the query either because the\nuser has not been granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or\nbecause-a user who has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot\nretrieve unminimized section 702-acquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not\ninclude (1) a system user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting\n2 \nthe results of that query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved, or (2)\nexamining or manipulating, including by technical means, communications or documents for\n3\nthe purpose of minimizing such communications or documents.\n2 \n(U) For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually\nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 \n(U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replac� all\ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such a \"U.S. Person l.\" \nSElClllis'F/,4',JOFOR.� \n3 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page 3 of7  Consolidated Set Section7  02 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\nSECRE'fffNOli'ORN \n(U)  \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a \ncommunication. \n(U)  \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated \nwith a communication, but does not include information concerning the substance, purport, \nor meaning of the communication. \n(U)  The terms \"National Security Agency\" and \"NSA personnel\" refer to any employees of \nthe National Security Agency/Central Security Service (\"NSA/CSS\" or \"NSA\") and any \nother personnel engaged in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) operations authorized pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act if such operations are executed under the direction, authority, or \ncontrol of the Director, NSA/Chief, CSS (DIRNSA). \n(U)  The terms \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" and \"FBI personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of the FBI, as well as all contractors and others authorized to work under the \ndirection and control of the FBI. \n(U)  The terms \"Central Intelligence Agency,\" \"CIA,\" and \"CIA personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of CIA and any other personnel acting under the direction, authority, or control of \nthe Director of the CIA, as well as to employees of other U.S. Government agencies who are \nphysically located at CIA and who are granted access to CIA systems to perform duties in \nsupport of CIA operations, but who retain the authorities and responsibilities of their parent \norganization. \n(U)  \"NCTC employee\" means (i) individuals directly employed by NCTC, (ii) personnel \ndetailed to NCTC from other departments or agencies who work under NCTC management \nand supervision in a manner substantially the same as individuals directly employed by \nNCTC, and (iii) contractors working under NCTC management and supervision who.are \nauthorized to perform services in support ofNCTC on PISA-related matters. \n(U)  B. Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n(1) (U)  A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence, or unless the nature or circumstances of the person's \ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is not a United \nStates person. \n(2) (U)  A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be \npositively identified as such, or the nature or circumstances of the person's \n4 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page 4 of 7 Consolidated Set Section 702 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\ncommunications give rise to a reasonable belief that such person is a United States \nperson. \n(3) (U)  A person who at any time has been known to have been an alien admitted for \nlawful permanent residence is treated as a United States person, unless a \ndetermination that such person is no longer a United States person is made in \nconsultation with the covered agency's Office of General Counsel or equivalent. \n(4 ) (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \n(U)  VI. Querying Procedures for the National Security Agency (NSA) \n(U)  NSA personnel who have received training in these procedures and NSA' s section 702 \nminimization procedures may query NSA systems containing unminimized information \nacquired in accordance with section 702 of the Act.  Except as provided above in Sections II \nand III, such queries must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as \ndefined by FISA.  Any United States person query term used to identify and select \nunminimized section 702-acquired content must first be approved by NSA's Office of \nGeneral Counsel.  NSA personnel seeking such an approval must provide a statement of facts \nestablishing that the use of any such identifier as a selection term is reasonably likely to \nretrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA.  NSA may approve the use of a \nUnited States query term to query unminimized section 702-acquired content for no longer \nthan a period of one year.  As provided in Section IV above, NSA will maintain records of all \nUnited States person query terms approved for use as selection terms, including the identifier \nof the approving official in NSA' s Office of General Counsel, the duration of such an \napproval, and the additional information required by Section IV.  Any use of a United States \nperson query term to query unminimized section 702-acquired metadata must be \naccompanied by a statement of facts showing that the use of any such query term is \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA.  As \nprovided in Section IV above, NSA will maintain records of all such United States person \nquery terms and the additional information required by Section IV.  Internet transactions, as \ndefined in NSA's section 702 minimization procedures, acquired on or before March 17, \n2017, will be sequestered in NSA systems to prevent NSA analysts from accessing or using \ncomputer selection terms to scan such transactions until such transactions are destroyed. \nNSA will maintain the above records in a manner that will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct \noversight and compliance in an effective manner and such records will be maintained for five \nyears from either the date of the query for queries of unminimized section 702-acquired \nmetadata, or the date of the approval of the U.S. person query term for queries of \nunminimized section 702-acquired content.  NSD and ODNI will conduct oversight of \nNSA's activities with respect to United States persons that are conducted pursuant to these \nprocedures. \nSECltE'f'7'fNOFORN \n5 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page 5 of 7 Consolidated Set Section 702 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section 702 2018 Certification ODNI Authorized for Public Release\n81!:CltE'fftNOPOltN \n(U)  VII. Querying Procedures for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \n(U) FBI personnel who have received training in these procedures and FBI's section 702 \nminimization procedures may query FBI systems containing unminimized information \nacquired in accordance with section 702 of the Act to find, extract, review, translate, and \nassess whether such information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to \nbe necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance, or to be \nevidence of a crime.  Except as provided above in Sections II and III, such queries must be \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or evidence of a crime. \n(U)  For queries conducted using United States person query terms that are not designed to \nfind and extract foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, the FBI will follow the \nprocedures in subsection 702(f)(2) ofFISA before accessing the contents of communications \nretrieved by such queries in connection with a predicated criminal investigation that does not \nrelate to the national security of the United States, unless there is a reasonable belief that \nsuch contents could assist in mitigating or eliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm. \nConsistent with subsections 702(f)(2)(F)(ii)-(iii) of the Act, this restriction does not prohibit \nor limit (1) the FBI' s ability to review, without a court order, the results of any query of \nsection 702-acquired information that was reasonably designed to find and extract foreign \nintelligence information, regardless of whether such foreign intelligence information could \nalso be considered evidence of a crime; and (2) the FBI' s ability to access the results of \nqueries that were conducted when evaluating whether to open an assessment or predicated \ninvestigation related to the national security of the United States. \n(U)  As provided in Section IV above, the FBI shall maintain records4 of all United States \nperson query terms used for five years from the date the United States person query term was \nused in a manner that will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an \neffective manner.  NSD and ODNI will review FBI's queries of unminimized section 702-\nacquired information to ensure that they were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, or were otherwise conducted pursuant to one \nof the exceptions provided above. \n(U)  Except as provided above in Sections II and III, queries of unminimized se.ction 702-\nacquired metadata must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or \nevidence of a crime.  The FBI shall maintain records of such queries that use United States \nperson query terms for five years from the date the United States person query term was \nused. \n4 (U) The FBI intends to satisfy this record-keeping requirement by keeping a record of all queries of \nunminimized information that is acquired by targeting non-United States persons reasonably believed to \nbe located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence information in accordance with section \n702. \n6 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page 6 of 7 Consolidated Set Section 702 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 \n\nDocument regarding the Section7  02 2018 Certification  ODNI Authorized for Public Release \n(U) VIII. Querying Procedures for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\n(U) CIA personnel who have received training in these procedures and CIA's section 702\nminimization procedures may query CIA systems containing unminimized information\nacquired in accordance with section 702 of the Act.  Except as provided above in Sections II\nand III, such queries must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as\ndefined by FISA.  Any use of a United States person query term must be accompanied by a\nstatement of facts showing that the use of any such query term is reasonably likely to retrieve\nforeign intelligence information.  As provided in Section IV above, CIA will maintain\nrecords of all such United States person query terms, including the additional information\nrequired by Section IV, for five years from the date the United States person query term was\nused.  CIA will maintain these records in a manner that will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct\noversight and compliance in an effective manner. NSD and ODNI will review CIA's queries\nof unminimized section 702-acquired infonnation using any such query terms to ensure that\nthey were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or were otherwise\nconducted pursuant to one of the exceptions provided above.\n(U) IX. Querying Procedures for the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC)\n(U) NCTC employees who have received training in these procedures and NCTC's section\n702 minimization procedures may query NCTC systems containing unminimized\ninformation acquired in accordance with section 702 of the Act.  Except as provided above in\nSections II and III, such queries must be reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence\ninformation, as defined by PISA. Any use of a United States person query term must be\naccompanied by a statement of facts showing that the use of any such query term is\nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information.  As provided above in Section\nIV, NCTC will maintain records of all such United States person query terms, including th�\nadditional information required by Section IV, for five years from the date the United States\nperson query term was used.  NCTC will maintain these records in a manner that will allow\nNSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective manner.  NSD and\nODNI will review NCTC's queries of unminimized section 702-acquired information using\nany such query terms to ensure that they were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign\nintelligence information, or were otheiwise conducted pursuant to one of the exceptions\nprovided above.\n'<k\"ail' \n�\nS  I \nA...i,.,..,.,,,:,;f, General of the United States \n-\n-\ntJIBCMT/J'l'ili8F8RM \n7 \nDATE: Oct 8, 2019  - Authorized Public Release  Page7   of7  Consolidated Set Section7  02 Querying Procedures, Mar. 2018 ",
