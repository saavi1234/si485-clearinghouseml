    "summary": "<p>On July 12, 2011, a prisoner subjected to long-term solitary confinement filed this pro se complaint against various officials at the Indiana Department of Corrections (IDOC) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. He sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, and 42 U.S.C. § 1986 for violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights forbidding cruel and unusual punishment and violations of his substantive due process rights. The plaintiff sought declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.</p><p>Judge Joseph Van Bokkelen struck the plaintiff's initial complaint on October 21, 2011 (2011 WL 13365780) because it brought as a single suit separate claims that occurred in different IDOC facilities. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint in response on November 16, but Judge Van Bokkelen struck this complaint on similar grounds on February 2, 2012. </p><p>The plaintiff's second amended complaint, which Judge Van Bokkelen eventually allowed in part, was filed on March 7, 2012. This complaint alleged that staff at the Michigan City, Indiana State Prison unlawfully moved him to an isolation unit at that prison after the plaintiff refused to answer questions regarding an escape of prisoners with whom the plaintiff socialized regularly. The plaintiff alleged that he did not participate in the escape, and that this punitive conduct violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He next wrote that, because of this non-cooperation, the staff conspired to transfer him to the Westville Control Unit (WCU), a Supermax isolation facility, where he stayed for over 900 days and continued to be held. He described difficult conditions in the WCU, including extreme cold, lack of access to religious services and outside contact, and unlawful searches of his mail; this tied into state law tort claims for taking his possessions while in prison. He alleged that WCU staff refused to reconsider his detention at the facility, despite 30-day review plans.</p><p>In a May 8, 2012 order (2012 WL 13189032), Judge Van Bokkelen issued an order on the new complaint, saying that it still involved multiple defendants across multiple prisons. He dismissed conspiracy claims against the defendants involved in his transfer, saying that the plaintiff did not sufficiently plead facts surrounding their motivations and could only speculate on the existence of a conspiracy. However, he allowed claims to proceed against Michigan City prison staff that arranged the transfer to the WCU without allowing the plaintiff to defend himself, saying that this may be a violation of his due process rights. </p><p>Discovery on the remaining claim began. On October 7, 2013, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the claim, asserting an affirmative defense that the plaintiff did not exhaust all administrative avenues available to him before going to the court system. Judge Van Bokkelen approved this motion on March 19, 2014 (2014 WL 1116888), stating that, even though the plaintiff never received written notice of his transfer, he had an opportunity to contest the transfer within ten days of arriving at the new facility. Judge Van Bokkelen dismissed the case. </p><p>The plaintiff appealed the judgment on June 16, 2014. On March 5, 2015, a Seventh Circuit panel composed of Chief Judge Diane Wood and Judges Ilana Rovner and Diane Sykes vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded it for further review (604 F. App'x 508). They wrote that the IDOC's manual stipulated that the prisoners must file an appeal only after receiving a classification decision, which he never received. The Seventh Circuit added that more defendants could be added to his complaint, saying that the plaintiff plausibly described a conspiracy after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right to end questioning. The panel noted that the District Court improperly dismissed the state law tort claims as well. The panel recommended that this case move to the Southern District of Indiana, since the plaintiff was then housed in a facility there. The case was transferred the following day.</p><p>The plaintiff, now represented by pro bono counsel from private law firms and the MacArthur Justice Center, filed a final amended complaint on May 8, 2015. This complaint reiterated the allegations that the plaintiff was unfairly incarcerated in a separate lockdown facility after refusing to answer questions regarding the break-out, transferred to the WCU after inadequate process, and continued to be held there and denied access to basic necessities after insufficient review.</p><p>Discovery began on this complaint in the Southern District, and the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on January 26, 2018. On May 22, 2018, Judge Richard Young, now presiding over this case, granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Judge Young dismissed the conspiracy claim to separate the plaintiff before transfer to the WCU, saying that the decision to separate him was based not on his willingness to answer questions, but rather to separate him pending an internal affairs investigation into the jailbreak situation, which was reasonable. He also granted the motion regarding mail, saying that prisons have the right to inspect mail to ensure it doesn't contain contraband. He partially dismissed due process claims for his expedited transfer to WCU, removing certain defendants that played less of a role in the transfer, but declined to dismiss the claim in regards to other defendants. The Judge completely upheld the cruel and unusual punishment claim for detention in WCU, saying that the plaintiff's continued detention there was not justified by continued disciplinary infractions. </p><p>After this motion was filed, the parties transitioned to settlement negotiations. On October 18, 2019, the parties came to a settlement agreement. The judge dismissed the case at this point, and no other docket activity is present. The terms of the settlement agreement were not in the docket, but <a href=\"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/10/inmate-kept-solitary-get-400-k-state-lawyers-say/2454201001/\">press reports</a> detailed that the state agreed to pay $425,000 to the plaintiff, $100,000 for each year he was in solitary confinement.</p>",

Thus,  it  is  my  opinion  that  the  harms \ndescribed  by  Dr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  in  their  review  of the  literature  are  not  universally \nexperienced.  Furthermore,  it can be  expected that  the use  of restrictive housing  (such  as AS)  will, \non  average,  produce  mild  to  moderate  physical  and  mental  health  effects  comparable  to  the \neffects  of incarceration  as  a general  matter. \nIn  reviewing  Dr.  Kupers’  expert  report,  I  noted  several  methodological  concerns  that  render  his \nclinical  interpretations,  conclusions,  and  opinions  questionable.  First  and  foremost,  the  plaintiff \nin  this  matter  is  seeking  compensatory  damages  in  his  complaint  such  that  he  has  motive  to \nexaggerate  his  mental  health  problems.  Dr.  Kupers  did  not,  however,  conduct  a  structured \nassessment  of  the  plaintiff's  response  style  (i.e,  no  malingering  testing  was  done)  as  is \ncustomary  with  such  evaluations.  This  leaves  open  the  very  real  possibility  that  the  plaintiff was \nless  than  truthful  in  his  self-report  rendering  the  obtained  data  unreliable.  This  is  particularly \ntroubling  given that the  plaintiff reported to  Dr.  Kupers  significant mental health  concerns  during \nhis  AS  placement,  a  report  that  is  grossly  inconsistent  with  medical  records  which  are  void  of \nany  such  reported  concems  by  the  plaintiff  during  and  after  his  period  of  AS  placement.  Dr. \nKupers  also  failed  to  account  for  possible  confirmation  bias  and  preexisting  conditions  presented \nby  the  plaintiff.  Finally,  Dr.  Kupers  asserts  that  the  plaintiff  presents  with  a  constellation  of \nsymptoms  that  is  consistent  with  the  Special  Housing  Unit  (SHU)  Post-Release  Syndrome,  a \nsyndrome  that  has  not  been  accepted  in  the  greater  scientific  community.  It  is  my  opinion  that \nthe  methodological  errors  in  Dr.  Kupers’  evaluation  of the  plaintiffs  mental  health  functioning \nand  the  effect  of  AS  placement  on  that  mental  health  functioning  results  in  conclusions  and \nopinions  that are  unreliable  and potentially  invalid. \nOf concern  with  Mr.  Pacholke’s  report  is  that  he  appears  to  be  holding  the  IDOC  responsible  for \na  lack  of rehabilitation  programming;  however,  at the time  of the plaintiff's  placement  in AS  this \nhad  yet  to  be  identified  as  best  practice.  Thus,  it  is  my  opinion  that  Mr.  Pacholke  is  holding  the \n{DOC  to  standards  of  practice  regarding  rehabilitation  programming  that  was  not  commonly \nrecognized  during  the  time  period  in  question  (i.e.,  during  the  time  period  of the  plaintiffs  AS \nplacement). \nEXPERT  QUALIFICATIONS \nLOT  CV4   GsUePiD g  E SeEeBe  A  P~ L  Ny  aAYhm    LPwaNy I eOnCdU MpGeinE IN  oo~i e TES d4  a  PEmOe   GPoYom  reEO   ly~   TPna dAwge e  Ne  4a   OwFoky    wALaLysN    r% a2 g \noe\nbere \ncee \nI  received  a  Bachelor’s  of  Science  (B.S.)  degree  in  psychology  (minor  in  biology)  from  the  AWMPL Aa tregee \nUniversity  of  Nebraska  at  Kearney  in  1991,  a  Master’s  of  Science  (M.S.)  degree  in  clinical \npsychology  from  Fort  Hays  State  University  (Kansas)  in  1993,  and  a  Doctor  of  Philosophy \n(Ph.D.)  in  counseling  psychology  from  Oklahoma  State  University  in  1999.  I  completed  a  pre- \ndoctoral  internship  in  correctional  psychology  at  the  Federal  Correctional  Institution  — \nPetersburg  (FCI-Petersburg;  Virginia)  in  1998-1999,  and  a  postdoctoral  fellowship  in  forensic \npsychology  at  the  Department  of  Psychiatry,  University  of  Missouri-Kansas  City  School  of \nMedicine  and  Missouri  Department  of  Mental  Health  in  1999-2000.  I  am  a  Licensed \nPsychologist  (Texas;  #31546)  and annually  meet the  Texas  Code  of Criminal  Procedures  (Article \n46B)  Yearly  Continuing  Medical  Education  Requirements  (“8  hours  of  education  relating  to \nforensic  evaluations”). \nCurrently,  I  am  the  Department  Chairman  and  the  John  G.  Skelton,  Jr.  Regents  Endowed \nProfessor  in  Psychological  Sciences  at  Texas  Tech  University  (TTU).  J  am  also  Director  of the \nInstitute  for  Forensic  Sciences  at  TTU.  I  began  my  academic  career  at  TTU  in  2000  and  was \npromoted  to  full  professor  in  2011.  During my tenure  at TTU,  I  also  served  as  Associate  Chair  of \nthe  Department  of  Psychology  (2003-2004)  and  Director  of  Training  for  the  counseling \npsychology  doctoral  program  (2005-2007).  I  was  appointed  Director  of the  Institute  for  Forensic \nSciences  in 2014  and  Chair of the Department  of Psychological  Sciences  in  2015, \nAt  TTU,  I  have  taught  Abnormal  Psychology  and  Forensic  Psychology  to  undergraduate \nstudents;  however,  my  primary  teaching  responsibilities  are  to  graduate  students  enrolled  in  the \nAmerican  Psychological  Association  accredited  doctoral  programs  in  clinical  and  counseling \npsychology.  These  courses  include  Practicum  in  Intelligence  Testing,  Advanced  Counseling \nPracticum,  and  Psychology  and  the  Law.  The  practicum  courses  are  geared  toward  teaching \ndoctoral  students  how  to  conduct  cognitive  assessments  (i.e.,  I  taught  doctoral  students  how  to \n-administer,  score,  interpret  and  report  findings  from  standardized  intelligence  and  cognitive \nassessments),  and  provide  psychological  assessments  and  psychotherapy  in  diverse clinical \n_  settings,  to  include  correctional  and  forensic  contexts.  The  Psychology  and  Law  course  provides \ndoctoral  students  a  foundation  in  the  interface  between  psychology  and  the  legal  system, \nincluding  topics  in  forensic  and  correctional  psychology,  court  and  judicial  testimony  and \npsychologists’  influence  in policy  legislation.  My  current  clinical  supervision  (2007  — present)  is \nof doctoral  students providing psychological  services  at the  Lubbock-Crosby  County  Community \nSupervision  and  Corrections  Department,  which  provides  services  to  adults  on  probation, \nincluding  adult  males  admitted to  a residential  treatment program. \nThe  core  purpose  of  my  research  and  scholarly  activities  is  to  help  criminal  justice  involved \nindividuals  achieve  a  higher  quality  of  life  that  is  crime  free  and  that  ultimately  results  in \nincreased  public  safety.  It  is  my  professional  mission  to  (1)  disseminate  evidenced-based \ncorrectional  practices  to  clinicians,  administrators  and  policy  makers,  and  (2)  to  provide \nobjective  and  scientifically  based  correctional  and  forensic  services  to  assist  fact  finders  in  legal \ndecision  making  and  agencies  in  the  quest  to  reduce  criminal  offending  and  increase  public \nsafety.  Notably,  I  actively  engage  in research  designed to  contribute to  a best practices  model  for \nthe  provision  of mental  health  services  in  correctional  environments.  In this  regard,  my  work has \nfocused  on the  investigation  of the  effects  of incarceration  on  inmates’  mental  health  functioning \nand  evaluations  of  effective  correctional  treatment  programming.

I  am  lead  editor  on  the  four  volume  Encyclopedia  of  Criminal  Psychology.  In \naddition,  I  co-developed  a treatment  program  for  inmates  placed  in  segregated housing  units  (i.e., \nStepping  Up  and  Stepping  Out:  A  Mental  Health  Treatment  Program for  Inmates  Detained  in \nRestrictive  Housing).  \\  have  provided  a  number  of  conference  presentations,  trainings  and \nworkshops,  and  invited  presentations  at  a  number  of  conferences  across  the  United  States  and \nCanada. \nMy  research  extends  from  my  20  years  of providing  correctional  and  forensic  services  to  inmates \nand  criminal  defendants.  From  1993  to  1995,  I  served  as  a  Mental  Health  Professional  with \nPrison  Health  Services  at the  El  Dorado  Correctional  Facility  (EDCF),  a  maximum  security \nfacility  with  multiple  segregation  units,  and  the  Winfield  Correctional  Facility  (WCF),  a_ \nminimum  security  facility  in  the  Kansas  Department  of  Corrections  (KDOC).  My  primary \nassignment  at  EDCF  was  to  provide  mental  health  services  in  one  of the  institution’s  restricted \nhousing  units  (i.e.,  a  segregation  unit).  In  this  role,  |  conducted  weekly  mental  health  rounds  to \nmonitor  inmates  for  decompensated  mental  health  functioning  (1.e.,  increased  psychiatric \nsymptomatology,  loss  of  functioning,  etc.),  and  |  served  as  a  member  of the  segregation  review \nboard.  I  also  provided  crisis  management  services  on  an  as-needed  basis.  Lastly,  I  provided \npsychotherapy  services  to  inmates  segregated  for  various  periods  of  time,  including  five-to-ten \nyear  time  periods,  in  part,  to  prepare  them  for  release  back  to  the  general  population.  At  WCF,  I \nwas  responsible  for  all  mental  health  services  at  the  facility  to  include  individual  and  group \npsychotherapy,  psychological  assessments,  and  crisis  intervention,  as  well  as  monitoring  the \nmental  health  functioning  of  inmates  in  segregation.  As  this  was  a  minimum  security  facility, \ninmates  placed  in  segregation  remained  segregated  from  the  general  population  for  shorter — \nperiods  of  time  (i.e.,  typically  less  than  thirty  days).  I  also  completed  correctional  internships  in \nthe  United  States  Penitentiary  at.

From  2006  to  2011,  I  was  a  member  of  the \nMental  Health in  Corrections  Consortium  Advisory  Board,  and  in  2008,  I  served  as  a  consultant \nto  the  Justice  Center:  The  Council  of  State  Government  for  the  development  of  a  monograph \nentitled  Improving  outcomes  for  people  with  mental  illness  under  community  supervision:  A \nresearch  guide for policymakers.  |  am  Editor-in-Chief  of Criminal  Justice  and  Behavior  (2018- \npresent),  and  was  recently  appointed  to  the  Board  of Directors  of the  National  Commission  on \nCorrectional  Health  Care  Educational Foundation. \nMy  curriculum vitae  is  attached to  this  report as  Attachment A. \nTESTIMONY, PUBLICATIONS, AND  COMPENSATION \nAttachment B  sets  forth a  list  of cases  in which  I  have  provided  expert testimony in  deposition  or \n \nat  trial  over  the  past  four  years,  publications  I  have  authored  in  the  past  ten  years,  and  the \ncompensation for my work  in  this  matter. \nOPINIONS \nThe  opinions  I offer  in this  report  are  to  a reasonable  degree  of psychological  certainty. \nA.

I  have  reviewed  the  reports  of  Dr \nKupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  and  offer  a  rebuttal  to  address  methodological  concerns  (Dr.  Kupers), \nas  well  as  a  concern  regarding  the  use  of  a  syndrome  that  is  not  scientifically  accepted  (Dr. \nKupers),  and  reference  to  best  practices  that  were  not  professionally  identified  during  the  ut \nplaintiff's  confinement  in  AS  (Mr.  Pacholke), \nB.  Overarching  Opinions   sipan\nn\ne\nGiven my  investigation to  date in this  case,  I  offer the  following  opinions:  Wa esp \n1.  The  literature  clearly  demonstrates  that  some  inmates  placed  in  AS  experience  the  harms \ndescribed  by  Dr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  in  their  expert  reports;  however,  these  harms \nare  not  universally  experienced.  At  the  population  level,  it  can  be  expected  that  the  use  of \nrestrictive  housing  (such  as  AS)  will,  on  average,  produce  mild  to  moderate  health  and \nmental  health  effects  comparable  to  the  effects  of incarceration  as  a  general  matter.  At the \nindividual  level,  some  inmates  placed  in  AS  will  experience  negative  effects,  some  will \nnot  experience negative  effects,  and  some will  experience  improved  functioning. \n2.  Methodological  errors  in  Dr.  Kupers’  evaluation  of  the  plaintiffs  mental  health \nfunctioning,  and  the  effect  of AS  placement  on  this  mental  health  functioning,  results  in \nconclusions  and  opinions  that  are  unreliable  and  potentially  invalid.  Furthermore,  the \nplaintiff's  mental  health  concerns  during  and  after  his  AS  placement,  as  reported  to  Dr. \nKupers,  are  inconsistent  with  medical  records,  which  are  void  of  any  such  reported \nconcems  by  the plaintiff both  during  and  after the period  of time  in which he  was  in AS, \n3.  Mr.  Pacholke  is  holding  the  IDOC  to  standards  of  practice  regarding  rehabilitation _ \nprogramming  that were  not  commonly recognized  during  the  time period  in  question  (1.e., \nduring the  time period  of the  plaintiff's  AS  placement). \nC.  Basis  and Reasons  for  Opinions \nThe list  below identifies  the  facts  and  data  I  considered  to prepare this  report: \n1.

Incomplete Reviews  of the  Literature Examining Segregated Housing \nDr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  provided  reviews  of the  literature  on  AS;  however,  their  reviews \nare notably  incomplete.  I  agree  with  Dr.  Kupers  in that  much  has  been written about the  potential \nadverse  and  harmful  effects  of  segregation.  Specifically,  it  has  been  reported  by  some  that \ninmates  experience  a  myriad  of  mental  health  concerns  and  symptoms,  including  appetite  and \nsleep  disturbance,  anxiety  (including  panic),  depression  and  hopelessness,  irritability,  anger  and \nrage,  lethargy,  psychosis,  cognitive  rumination,  cognitive  impairment,  social  withdrawal,  and \nsuicidal  ideation,  as  well  as  self-injurious  behaviors  (see  Grassian,  2006,  n.d.;  Haney,  2003, \n2009;  Kupers,  2008;  Andersen,  Sestoft,  Lillebaek,  Gabrielsen,  Hemmingsen,  &  Kramp,  2000; \nBonner,  2006;  Brodsky,  &  Scogin,  1988;  Cloyes,  Lovell,  Allen,  &  Rhodes,  2006;  Cohen,  2006, \n2008,  2012;  Hayes,  &  Rowan,  1988;  Haney,  1993;  Hresko,  2006;  Lovell,  2008;  Miller,  & \nYoung,  1997;  and  Smith,  2008).  It  has  also  been  alleged  that  persons  with  mental  ulness  are \nparticularly  vulnerable  to  placement  in  AS  (Metzner  &  Fellner,  2010),  where  they  generally \nappear  to  experience  more  mental  health  disturbance  (.e.,  greater  symptomatology)  than persons \nwith  mental  illness  not  placed  in  AS  (O’Keefe,  2007).  Lastly,  inmates  released  directly  from \nsegregation  to  the  community  have  shown  poorer  post-release  outcomes  than  inmates  not \nreleased  from  segregation  (Lovell,  Johnson,  &  Cain,  2007).  Dr.  Kupers  adequately  summarizes \nthis  literature. \nThe  collection  of  studies  that  are  used  to  support  the  conclusion  that  AS  is  harmful  to  one’s \nhealth  (including  mental  health)  and  well-being,  however,  do  not paint  a  complete  picture  of the \neffects  of  AS.  There  are  also  a  number  of  studies  that  found  minimal or  no  deleterious  effects   \nresulting  from  the  use  of AS.  Remarkably,  both  Dr.  Kupers’  and  Mr.  Pacholke’s  reviews  ignore \nthe  number  of  studies  that  draw  opposing  conclusions.  In  fact,  their  literature  reviews  omitted \nstudies  in  conflict  with  their  opinions.  When  examining  very  brief  periods  of  segregation  (as \nbrief  as  a  few  days),  almost  no  deleterious  effects  have  been  found  (see  Gendreau  &  Bonta, \n1984;  Bonta  &  Gendreau,  1995;  and  Suedfeld,  Ramirez,  Deaton,  &  Baker-Brown,  1982). \nControlled  studies  looking  at  longer  periods  of  segregation  have  also  found  no  deleterious \neffects.  For  example,  Zinger  and  colleagues  (2001)  conducted  a  longitudinal  study  of  inmates \né er  eo i  y o we  a  oe  a  Pad oy >  pow  ap  bh wo \nsegregated  for  60  days.  They found  no significant mental  health  decompensation  for  segregated \ninmates  compared  to  their  peers  in  the  general  prison  population.  These  results  appear  to  hold  up \nacross  longer  periods  of  AS  placement  as  well.  Chadick  and  colleagues  (2018)  found  that \ninmates  in  AS  for  one  year  or  more  evidenced  no  significant  differences  in  mental  health \nconcerns  (with  the  exception  of  subclinical  depression)  when  compared  to  their  non-segregated \npeers  in the  general population. \nAdditionally,  it  should be  noted  that the  majority  of studies  investigating  psychological  outcomes \nfrom  AS  consist  of case  studies  of small,  nonrandom  samples  of inmates  and  do  not  include  pre- \nAS  baseline  psychological  measures,  or  appropriate  comparison  groups  (Labrecque  &  Smith, \n2013).  Further,  much  of  the  AS  literature  includes  studies  employing  the  weakest  type  of \nresearch  methodology  (e.g.,  use  interview  strategies  without  accounting  for  honesty  of responses \nrather  than  objective  measures). \nFor  example,  in  1983  Dr.  Stuart  Grassian  published  an  article  in  which  he  coined  the  term  SHU- \nSyndrome  (i.e.,  a  constellation  of  symptoms  and  mental  health  deficits  that  are  alleged  to  result \nfrom  long-term  placement  in  segregated  housing).  Although  at  the  time  this  was  a  significant \nmanuscript  that  raised  awareness  of  the  possible  consequences  of  the  use  of  segregation  as  a \ncorrectional  management  strategy,  it  should  be  noted  that  this  research  is  now  almost  36  years \nold,  It  is  of questionable  generalizability  to  the  issue  of contemporary  segregation  given changes \nin  corrections  and  inmate  populations.  Moreover,  this  study  consisted  of a  clinical  interview  with \n14 segregated  inmates  and  thus,  data  collection  was  limited  to  self-report  information  with  no \nefforts  to  verify  the  inmates’  self-report  (e.g.,  file  review,  use  of  objective  measures).  This \nmethodology  is  particularly  problematic  given  these  evaluations  were  directed  by  court  order  in \n‘response  to  the  inmates’  class  action  suit  against  the  state  department  of corrections;  thus,  raising \nthe  concern  of  response  bias  (intentional  effort  by  an  individual  to  respond  in  a  dishonest \nmanner).  In  other  words,  the  inmates  had  reason  and  were  likely  motivated  to  present  as \nimpaired  for  purposes  of  their  lawsuit  regardless  of  their  actual  mental  health  functioning. \nAdditional  concerns  include  the  absence  of  a  comparison  group  from  which  to  compare \nresponses,  an  exceedingly  small  sample  size,  and  an  absence  of  data  regarding  pre-existing \nsymptoms  or  mental  health  concern.  It  is  my  opinion  that  these  significant  limitations  render  the \nreliability  and  validity  of  the  results  from  this  study  meaningless.  In  fact,  as  editor  of a  leading \ncriminal  justice  and  psychology  journal,  I  would  not  publish  this  paper  as  it  does  not  meet \ncurrent  scientific  standards  and  I  believe  no  other  reputable journal  would  today  publish  a  paper \nof this  quality. \nOn  the  opposite  end  of  the  scientific  spectrum  are  the  results  from  O’Keefe  and  colleagues \n(2010)  who  conducted  the  most  sophisticated  segregation  study  to  date.  In  this  study,  commonly \nrmeefne rrferdo mt o ASi,n  tthhee   gceonrerreaclt iopnrsi solni teproaptuulrea tiaosn ,t hea nd“ Cao lposryacdhioa trSitcu dyc,ar”e  pfaacritliictiy.p anRtess eacroncshiesrtse d asosfe ss2e47d   E Ei GED\nU\ninmates  across  multiple  time  periods  on  the  following  domains:  psychosis;  anxiety,  depression,  thick W\nand  hopelessness;  somatization;  social  functioning;  cognitive  functioning;  anger;  and \nhypersensitivity.  Contrary  to  the  researchers’  hypotheses,  results  indicated  that  AS  confinement \nof one  year  was  generally  not  associated  with  the  onset  of psychological  symptoms  or  cognitive \nimpairment  for  mentally  ill  and non-mentally  ill  inmates,  nor  did  inmates  with  mental  illness  fare \n+,  a  SPPwiH yAoe  P A,  pe RrrryCmo Lik ao  vyY d eo   RA KUEaS    LPLmoA AA ai oORw e bt   e >  y  Ishe ¥t   Sa4sf d 7oyA 9e A   MPame?:a :  gOy e  Ltyc UoSe   4  O2 wFt  oe  AS ,  RPio  oafae  egat  e~  SP PaAa   tF#Fa  e \nworse  in  AS  than their  non-mentally  ill  peers.  In  fact,  some  inmates  with  mental  illness  actually \nimproved with regard to  their  psychological  functioning. \nIt  is  my  opinion  that  the  Colorado  Study  is  the  gold  standard  when  it  comes  to  methodological \napproaches  to  examining  effects  of  AS.  Specifically,  the  researchers  applied  research \nmethodology  that  provided  several  advantages  over  previous  investigations  that  examined  the \neffects  of administrative  segregation.  First,  this  study  was  longitudinal  in  that  it  used  a  repeated    \nmeasures  design that  assessed  inmates  up  to  five  time  periods  at three-month  intervals,  a notable    \nstrength  of  the  study  (see  also  Berger,  Chaplin,  &  Trestman,  2013).  Additionally,  the  study \nincluded  multiple  groups  to  allow  for  comparisons  between  segregated  and  non-segregated \npopulations.  Most  impressive,  the  researchers  incorporated  a  multi-method  assessment  strategy, \nanother  significant  improvement  over  the typical  research  approach  of relying  solely  on  a review \nof records,  or  even  more  problematic,  observation  and  clinical  interviews  without  controlling  for \nbias  or  intentional  manipulation  (although  not  reviewed  in  this  report,  the  scientific  literature \nsummarizing  mental  health  professionals’  ability  to  accurately  predict  likely  outcomes  based  on \nobservation  and  interviews  is  notoriously  weak;  see  critique  of Dr.  Kupers  report  in  section  B). \nFinally,  the  Colorado  Study presents  a  “reasonable  real-world  test  of the  hypotheses”  outlined  in \nthe  study  (p.  1;  Berger  et  al.,  2013).  Apparently,  the  National  Institute  of  Justice,  a  highly \nreputable  federal  agency  in  the  United  States  offering  competitive  research  grants,  was  similarly \nimpressed  with  the  methodological  approach  as  the  agency  funded  this  research  project. \nNevertheless,  the  Colorado  Study  is  not  without  limitations.  It  is  a  truism  that  all  studies  in  the \npsychological  literature  {including  those  relied  upon  by  Dr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  in  their \nexpert  reports)  are  replete  with  limitations.  However,  I  strongly  disagree  with  those  who  state \nthat  the  Colorado  Study  is  “fatally  flawed”  (see  for  example  Grassian  &  Kupers,  2011).  Simply \nstated,  there  are  no  perfect  studies,  Given  that  this  study  represents  the  most  sophisticated  and \nmethodologically  sound  longitudinal  study  to  date  on  the  effects  of segregation on  inmate  mental \nhealth  functioning,  the  findings  are  certainly  relevant  and highly informative. \nIn  a  follow-up  to  the  Colorado  Study,  Walters  (2018)  used  this  data to  further  examine  the  effect \nof  AS  placement  on  inmate  mental  health  functioning.  Specifically,  he  sought  to  determine   tan\nii“nnwdmhiaevttiehdseu ra lwsipt lhaw icmteehm netnnaotl   hihines atalodtryhm  innoiefs etdmrsea nttihavoleu  sehsdee aglritenh g aAntSei eodntsh ,a n( AaSin)td  ,i s haiffso  rn oat i,nd mealwtehteeestr hieworiu tsh t hpeas  ymceefhnfoetlcaotl g iicsh eaalslt trhoe nffgheeicrst t ofrooynr     eceecp srevef\ntnnweoietlse ltd eshd;bo e u tshaaeesnd  d  ptriw(eno2 v) aA lSuep”nns dtye c(rihi.lneoy .l,i ionngignmi  actgaaeelssn se urdwamelipt ttehirpooiouonptrsu al tamiteooifnn ot nat;lhw e i lphl.

A \nrecent  meta-analysis  conducted  by  colleagues  and  me  (Morgan  et  al.,  2016)  provides  this \ninformation,  yet,  neither  Dr.  Kupers  nor Mr.  Pacholke  chose to  mention  or  discuss  the  findings  in \ntheir  reports. \nMeta-analysis  is  a  widely-accepted  method  for  “summarizing  the  results  of  empirical  studies \nwithin  the  behavioral,  social,  and  health  sciences”  (Lipsey  &  Wilson,  2001,  p.  1).  Specifically, \nmeta-analysis  is  the  combination  of  multiple  empirical  studies  into  one  comprehensive \nquantitative  database  to  allow  for  an  empirical  (and  theoretically  more  powerful)  examination  of \na  phenomena  of  interest,  such  as  the  effect  of  segregation  on  inmate  mental  health  functioning. \nMeta-analyses  produce  an  effect  size  for  each  outcome  variable  of interest.  The  effect  size  (4S) \nquantifies  the  difference  between  two  groups  (such  as  inmates  in  AS  compared  to  inmates  not  in \nAS)  and  is  a  measure  of the  size  of the  difference  between  two  groups. \nMeta-analytic  reviews  can  be  particularly  effective  when  a  number  of  individual  reports \ndisagree,  and  offers  many  advantages  over  a  qualitative  review  of  the  literature.  Specifically, \nmeta-analysis  provides  (Field  &  Gillett,  2010): \n(1)  the  mean  and  variance  of underlying  population  effects.  For  example,  we  can  study  the \neffects  of segregated  housing  compared  to  general  population housing; \n(2)  variability  in  effects  across  studies.  Meta-analysis  allows  researchers  to  “estimate,  the \nvatiability  between  effect  sizes  (ES)  across  studies”  (p.  666).  For  example,  we  can \n-  examine  the  magnitudeo’f   the  effect  (i.e.,  size  of the  effect)  of placement  in  segregated \nhousing  versus  placement  in  non-segregated  housing,  and  we  can  examine  how  much \nvariability  exists  in  effects  across  studies,  and \n(3)  moderator  variables.  Meta-analysis  allows  us  to  examine  variables  that  contribute  to  the \nobtained  effects.  For  example,  if  inmates  respond  unfavorably  to  segregated  housing \ncompared  to  their  peers  not  placed  in  segregated  housing  in  one study,  but  another  study \nsuggests  that  segregated  inmates  respond  similarly  to  peers  not  placed  in  segregated \nhousing,  we  can  examine  variables  that  may  explain  the  different  relations  across  the  two \nstudies.  In  other  words,  we  can  attempt  to  identify  aspects  of  segregation  or  inmate \n \ncharacteristics  that  modify  the  relation between  segregation  and  negative  outcomes. \nThus,  although  results  of  meta-analytic  reviews  are  not  conclusive,  meta-analyses  are  far \nsuperior  to  qualitative  (i.e.,  natrative)  reviews  of a literature  (Fagard,  Staessen,  &  Thijs,  1996). \nTo  better  understand the  effects,  including  the  magnitude  of effects,  resulting  from  the  use  of AS \nin  corrections,  two  research  groups  completed  independent  meta-analytic  reviews.

In fact,  it  is  my  opinion  that  when  placing  inmates \nin  AS,  some  inmates  will  experience  negative  effects,  some  will  improve  and  some  will  remain \nunchanged.  In  totality,  it  can  be  expected  that  the  use  of  restrictive  housing  (such  as  AS)  will \nproduce  mild  to  moderate  health  and  mental  health  effects  comparable  to  the  effects  of \nincarceration  generally.  . \n \nThe  opinion  that  AS  produces  mild  to  moderate  effects  for  some  but  not  all  inmates  frequently \nelicits  the  question  of how  can  it be  possible  to  place  someone  in  AS  for  a lengthy  period  of time \nand  it  not  have  a  harmful  effect  on  the  individual?  It  is  my  opinion  that  inmates,  like  most \npeople,  adapt  to  their  environment,  whether  it  be  a  general  prison  population  setting  or  AS.  This \nopinion  was  supported  and  clearly  articulated  by  an  inmate  (referred  to  here  as  Inmate  A)  I \nexamined  while  he  was  serving  a  long-term  period  of  confinement  in  AS  in  Pelican  Bay  State \nPrison,  California.  According  to  Inmate  A,  inmates  are  generally  adept  at  serving  time  in \ncorrectional  facilities  prior  to  their  AS  placement.  He  stated  to  me  that to  anyone  unaccustomed \nto  serving  time  in  prison  (i.e.,  lay  persons,  lawyers,  advocates,  etc.),  AS  would  seem  daunting \nand  completely  overwhelming;  however,  experienced  inmates  are  skilled  at  coping  with \nincarceration  such that  AS  is  simply  another  adjustment in  the process  of confinement. \nFurthermore;  Inmate  A  relayed  to  me  that  although  some  inmates  experience  an  initial  period  of \ndifficulty,  they  eventually  adjust  and  cope  adequately  in  the  structured  environment  of AS.  This \nperspective  is  also  supported  by  research.  Zinger,  Wichmann,  &  Andrews  (2001)  measured \nchange  in  the  mental  health  symptoms  of segregated  inmates  over  time  in  three  Canadian  federal \ninstitutions.  In  this  study,  they  compared  60  inmates  in  AS  to  60  inmates  in  general  population. \nThe  inmates  were  tested  using  a  battery  of  psychological  tests  (similar  to  those  reported  in \nobservational  studies)  at  the  time  of admission,  30  days  after  admission  to  AS,  and  60  days  after \nadmission  to  AS.  The  60  randomly-selected  volunteers  in  general  population  were  tested  along \nthe  same  timeframes.  After  30  days,  segregated  inmates  endorsed  more  symptoms  of  depressed \nmood  and  anxiety,  as  well  as  poorer  psychosocial  adjustment than their  general  population  peers. \nImportantly,  however,  both  segregated  and  non-segregated  inmates  improved  over  the  60  days \non  measures  of  depression,  psychosocial  adjustment,  hopelessness,  and  anxiety.  Zinger  et  al., \nconcluded  that  this  study  “did  not  reveal  any  deterioration”  (p.  75)  in  the  60  segregated  inmates \nover  the  60-day  period,  such  that,  consistent  with  Inmate  A’s  report,  the  segregated  inmates  may \nhave  “generally  adapted  and  coped  well  with  the  conditions  of  today’s  Canadian  federal \nadministrative  segregation”  (p.  75). \nB.

Response  Bias.  After  reviewing  Dr.  Kupers’  report  as  requested  by  defense  counsel,  his   RGRPET\nfailure  to  account  for  response  bias  raises  questions  as  to  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of his  E\nclinical  conclusions  and  opinions.  Response  bias  is  the  tendency  of  a  person  to  answer   RENIH\nqpauretsitciiopnasn ts untmrauyt hfufelelly  coorm peiln lead  mtios lgeiavdei ngs ocifaalslhyi ona.c ceFpotra blee xamrepslpeo,n seisn   tao   rqeuseesatricohn s. stuInd y,a    spiH PE\nforensic  examination,  a  plaintiff  or  defendant  may  provide  inaccurate  responses  in  an  effort \nto  obtain  a  desired  outcome.  In  fact,  malingering,  the  faking  of  an  illness,  is  a  common \nconcern  in  forensic  mental  health  assessments.  So  much  so  that  clinicians  are  encouraged  to \nexpect  malingering  or  exaggeration  when  conducting  forensic  evaluations  (Rogers,  Salekin, \nSewell,  Goldstein,  &  Leonard,  1998;  Rogers,  Sewell,  &  Goldstein,  1993). \nClinicians  have  estimated  that  approximately  15  to  19%  of  criminal  forensic  cases  and  30% \nof  civil  forensic  cases  involve  malingering  (Mittenberg,  Patton,  Canyock,  &  Condit,  2002; \nRogers,  Salekin,  Sewell,  Goldstein,  &  Leonard,  1998;  Rogers,  Sewell,  and  Goldstein,  1994). \nEven more  striking,  one  study  found  that  the  majority of persons  (67%)  assessed  in  a  forensic \ncontext  distorted  their  presentations  in  response  to  external  motivations  (e.g.,  financial  gain \nwould  be  an  external  motivation;  Heilbrun,  Bennett,  White,  and  Kelly,  1990).  Thus, \nassessing  response  style  is  a  “fundamental  element”  (p.  7,  Goldstein,  2007)  of  any  forensic \nassessment  (see  also  Rogers,  1997;  Rogers  &  Bender,  2003).  Simply  stated,  accepting  a \nplaintiff  report  without  critically  examining  the  accuracy  of  that  report  is  “naive  at \nbest...ignores  the  obvious  motivation  to  deceive  and  does  not  meet  acknowledged  practice \nstandards  in  the  field”  (p.  7,  Goldstein  2007).  Dr.  Kupers  is  clearly  aware  of this  standard  as \nhe  noted  on  p.  42  of his  report  “It  is  always  important  to  rule  out  malingering  in  the  course \nof a forensic  examination,”  citing his  own work to  this  effect.  | \nUnfortunately,  mental  health  professionals  are  notoriously  poor  at  identifying  symptom \nexaggeration  or  malingering  on  the  basis  of clinical  judgement  (see  for  example  Faust,  Hart, \n&  Guilmette,  1988;  Faust,  Hart,  Guilmette,  &  Arkes,  1988;  Heaton  et  al.,  1978;  Jackson  & \nVitacco,  2012).  In  fact,  it  is  increasingly  recognized  that  “interview-based  approaches  to \ndetecting  malingering  are  of  such  limited  utility”  (p.  59;  Melton,  Poythress,  Slobogin,  Otto, \nMossman,  &  Condie,  2018)  that  tests  specially  designed  to  detect  malingering  should  be  a \nroutine  part  of  forensic  practice.  Dr.  Kupers,  however,  appears  to  have  relied  solely  on  his  | \nclinical  interview  and judgement.  He  stated  on  p.  42,  “It  is  very  clear  to  me,  based  on  clinical \ntechniques  for  identifying  malingering,  that  Mr.  Vermillion  is  not  malingering.”  Dr.  Kupers \ndoes  not  specify  what  his  clinical  techniques  consisted  of,  but  it  appears  he  did  not  include \ninstruments  specifically  designed  to  detect  symptom  exaggeration  and/or  malingering,  which \nare  commonly  used  in  forensic  evaluations.  As  such  he  appears  to  have  relied  on  the  least \neffective  approach  for  determining  examinee  attempts  to  mislead  —  clinical  judgement.  As \npreviously  noted,  given  the  plaintiff's  incentive  to  deceive  (i.e.,  for  financial  gain)  and  his \nhistory  of  exhibiting  an  antisocial  personality  disorder  {i.e.,  a  condition  marked  by  a \npervasive  pattern  of disregard  for  and  violation  of the  rights  of others  occurring  since  age  15 \n12 \n  \n‘  least :  babes \nwy  ra  ram  ‘a  _ . ob co  Gerth  Li)  va a  i. ” wAo  eet CTAA PaN Lo AC EE Ph SD  oe r \nre \nder \neee \na dee \nyears,  as  indicated  by  at  least  three  symptoms,  including  breaking  the  law,  deceitfulness,  A PEEE \no\nimpulsivity,  disregard  for  others’  safety,  consistent  irresponsibility,  and  lack  of  remorse),  dee \nfthaaitl ureev atlou astyisotne muantrieclailalbyl e teasnt d fowri trhe sqpuoensstei onbiaabsl e revnadleirdsi ty.th e .  clinical  conclusions  obtained  from  AP PAE rrcetna te \nConfirmation  Bias.  Related  to  plaintiff response  bias,  Dr.  Kupers  does  not  identify  efforts  to  OEP \nminimize  confirmation  bias  (i.e.,  “the  seeking  or  interpreting  of  evidence  in  ways  that  are \npartial  to  existing  beliefs,  expectations,  or  a hypothesis  in hand”  p.  175,  Nickerson,  1998).  He   \nA\nprovided  deposition  testimony  in the  Ashker  case  (referenced  in  his  report)  that  every  inmate  RER\nE\nhe  has  ever  interviewed  who  has  spent  time  in  administrative  segregation  has  been  “harmed”  bel P\nby  this  experience  (Kupers  Dep.  95).  This  is  an  extreme  position  that  is  certainly  not  Stare \nsupported  by  the  most  recent  research  literature  (e.g.,  Chaddick  et  al.,  2018;  Morgan  et  al., \n2016:  Walters,  2018).  In  fact,  the  Colorado  study  found  that  approximately  20%  of inmates \nin  administrative  segregation  demonstrated  improvement  as  a  result  of  their  AS  placement \n(O’Keefe,  Klebe,  Stucker,  Sturm,  &  Leggett,  2010).  Dr.  Kupers  maintains  such  an  extreme \nposition  that  to  be  credible  he  would  need  to  demonstrate  efforts  to  minimize  bias  in  his \nexaminations  and  subsequent report,  yet he  did  not  do  so.  , \n.

Based  on  review  of  these  records,  although  the  plaintiff  made  a  number  of  complaints \nregarding  his  physical  health,  he  made  no  such  complaints  regarding  his  mental  health \nfunctioning.

For  example,  it  is \ncommon  practice  that  inmates  can  submit  a  written  request  for  mental  health  services  such \nthat  they  can  be  removed  from  the  cell  and  seen  by  a mental  health  professional  in  a  private \nconsultation  room.  It  was  my  experience  working  in  various  segregation  units  that  when \ninmates  did  not  feel  comfortable  verbally  disclosing  their  concerns  to  me  cell  side,  they \nwould  submit  such  requests  for  a  private  consultation.  The  plaintiff did  not  make  use  of this \nopportunity  calling  into  further  question  the  validity  of  the  problems  he  reported  to  Dr. \nKupers. \nFinally,  it  is  my  experience  that  inmates  experiencing  severe  distress,  such  as that reported by \nthe  plaintiff  to  Dr.  Kupers,  is  observable  even  in the absence  of  self-reported  concerns.  In \nother  words,  when  inmates  experience  “very  strong  anxiety  and  depression”  (p.  28)  as  noted \nin  Dr.  Kupers’  report,  such  concems  are  apparent  not  only to  mental health professionals,  but \nalso  medical  professionals  and  correctional  officers.  For  example,  it  is  common  for  anxious \nindividuals  to  appear  jittery  and  on-edge,  and  for  depressed  persons  to  appear  lethargic, \napathetic,  and  to  present  with  flattened  emotional  affect.  Mental  health  professionals  are \ntrained  and  uniquely  qualified  to  detect  such  behavioral  changes  in  the  absence  of  self- \nreported  distress,  and  no  such  observations  were  documented  regarding  the  plaintiff  during \n_  his  time  period  in  AS  (or  after).  Review  of records  indicate  no  such  concerns  were  noted \nduring  a  number  of  medical  consultations  or  that  any  such  concerns  were  reported  by \ncorrectional  staff.  In  other  words,  his  behavioral  presentation  (which  is  much  more  difficult \nfor  persons  with  mental  health  concerns  to  conceal)  during  his  time  in  AS  matched his  self- \nreport  of an  absence  of mental  health concerns.  As  such,  it  leaves  open  the  strong possibility \nthat  the  plaintiff is  exaggerating  his  retrospective  report  of problems  during  his  placement  in \nsegregation,  an  issue  that  cannot  be  ruled  out  given  the  absence  of  structured  malingering     \ntesting. \nSHU  Post-Release  Syndrome.  Dr.  Kupers  noted  that  the  plaintiff  exhibited  symptoms \nconsistent  with  the  SHU  Post-Release  Syndrome.  This  syndrome  is  not  a  formal  diagnosis, \nbut  allegedly  represents  a  constellation  of  symptoms  and  mental  health  deficits  that  result \n14 \n  \n ,oh na rra\n‘from  long-term  placement  in  restrictive  housing  (such  as  AS)  and  includes  many  of  the \nfollowing: \ne  Disorientation  immediately  following  release. \nAnxiety  in  unfamiliar places  and  with unfamiliar  people. \n \ne  Anxiety  with  daily  life  events  that  had  been  ordinary  prior  to  SHU  confinement  as  these  ye\n~  become  unfamiliar  events  following  release  from  SHU.   E\nE\n~  @  A  tendency to  retreat  into  a  circumscribed,  small  space,  often  a bedroom  or  cell.  RPS\ne  A  tendency  to  greatly  limit  the  number  of  people  one  interacts  with,  usually  limited  to  {eHERE \nclose  family  members  and  a few  friends. \ne.  Hyperawareness  of  surroundings,  for  example  a  need  to  sit  facing  the  door  to  a  room  or \nwith  one’s  back  to  a  wall. \ne  Heightened  suspicion  of everyone  who  comes  close,  especially  strangers. \ne  Difficulty  expressing  feelings. \ne  Difficulty trusting  others,  even  one’s  spouse  or  first  degree  relative. \n©  Problems  with  concentration  and  memory,  beginning  in  the  period  of  SHU  confinement \nand  continuing  after release,  making  it  difficult  to  accomplish tasks  and to  work, \ne  A  sense  of  one’s  personality  having  changed.  The  most  often  reported  form  of  this \nchange  is  a  change  from a  relatively  outgoing,  friendly  individual  with  a  sense  of humor \nprior  to  SHU  confinement,  to  a  more  serious,  guarded,  and  inward  individual  following \nrelease  from the  SHU. \ne  Substance  abuse  to  lessen  emotional  pain  and  make  feelings  of  confusion  and  anxiety \nmore  bearable. \nThis  syndrome  was  identified  by  Dr.  Kupers  but has  not been peer reviewed  or  published  in  a \npeer  reviewed  journal.  In  fact,  the  only  publications  referring  to  this  syndrome  are  those \nauthored  by  Dr.  Kupers  which  were  not  peer reviewed,  thus,  this  syndrome  is  not  accepted  in \nthe  professional  fields  of  criminal  justice,  correctional  mental  health,  psychology,  or \npsychiatry.  Furthermore,  the  constellation  of symptoms  reported  by  Dr.  Kupers  are  consistent \nwith  symptoms  inmates  report  when  released  from  prison,  and  Dr.  Kupers  makes  no \ndistinction  between  symptoms  experienced  by  inmates  leaving  prison  and  inmates  leaving \nrestrictive  housing. \nC.  Mr.  Pacholke. \nL  was  not  familiar  with  Mr.  Pacholke  or  his  work  prior  to  conducting  this  review.  We  have  never \nmet,  corresponded,  or  collaborated  in  a  formal  or  informal  manner. \nI  concur  with  Mr.  Pacholke  that  programming  that  addresses  underlying  criminogenic  needs  is \nimportant  in  offender  rehabilitation,  including  for  inmates  in  segregation.  I  further  agree  that \n“structured  and  progressive  levels  that  include  privileges  as  an  incentive  for  positive  behavior   \nand/or  program  participation”  (p.  31)  are  important  best  practices  in  the  use  of  segregation. \nFinally,  I  concur that  “step-down programming”  (p.  32)  is  also  an  aspect  of best practices. \nBest  practices  were  not  generally  identified  until  after  the  plaintiffs  time  in  AS.  For  example, \nMr.  Pacholke  references  “Reforming  restrictive  housing:  The  2018  ASCA-Liman  Nationwide \n15 \n  \nAgee a Tt~  Rfam Swowe    A8   EaP3   B y  OO POF - HOEKa  3 ix    ~  8od   wi\"  3 Tos an ery \nSurvey  of  time-in-cell”  report  as  evidence  of  the  benefits  of  step-down  programs.

The  first  instance  of   era\nbest  practices  in  AS  of  which  I]  am  aware  was  by  Dr.  Jeffrey  Metzner  (2015),  I  followed  Dr.   Ae\nMdeotwznn erp’rso graartmimclie ngw itihn   aand diatritiocnlael  pudbislciusshseido n in ofC orbersetc tiporancst icTeosd ayto   (inMcolrugdae n thete raalp.,e ut2i0c1 7).a nd To stetph-e    pad deke H\nR\npoint  of rehabilitation,  during the  time  period  in  which  the  plaintiff was  placed  in AS,  there  were  T\n \nno  commercially  or  publicly  available  segregation  programs  for  mental  health  professionals  AIE\nwiaswo arurknei rnegoa fs, ownaiantdbh  lebs oetghtro  ebghaeotcleaddm  e tihnea mvaatIielDsaO,b Cle  Toitdon  aytch ue rtrlheaensrtte   twsrote amnaydieaanrr dss.o  nlCoyof  nstcewaqorue  enrtwellheyev,na  ntit t hiops sreom gyr satomapsni dnairtohdnas t  thIw aeta rmei  t   1FHe2$ 5blest de  tag\npublished  after the  date  of the  matter  in question.  gle Atal \nCONCLUDING  OPINIONS  | \nI  was  asked  to  review the  reports  of two  experts  retained  by  the  plaintiff in  this  case,  given  that \nboth render  a variety  of opinions  regarding the  conditions  of confinement  in  AS  in  the  IDOC  and \nthe  effect those  conditions  had  on  the  plaintiff.  I  found  both  reviews  of the  scientific  literature  to \nbe  incomplete.  Results  of  my  study  of  the  scientific  literature  on  the  effects  of  segregated \nhousing  on  inmate  mental  health,  including  results  of meta-analytic  reviews,  indicated  small  to \nmoderate  adverse  effects  across  a  variety  of  physical,  psychological,  and  behavioral  (e.g., \ncriminal  recidivism)  outcomes.  Importantly,  the  magnitude  of  effects  resulting  from  AS \nplacement  -are-comparable  in  magnitude  to  the  effects  encountered  by  inmates  experiencing \nincarceration  as  a  general  matter.  In  other  words, just  like  in  the  greater  prison  landscape,  some \ninmates  exposed  to  AS  will  experience  negative  outcomes,  some  will  experience  no  change  in \noutcomes,  and some  will  experience  improved  outcomes. \nIn reviewing  expert reports  produced  by  Dr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke,  I  noted  several  concerns. \nMost  significantly,  with  regard  to  Dr.  Kupers  conclusions  and  opinions,  were  methodological \nerrors  in  his  assessment  procedures.  Specifically,  he  failed  to  account  for  response  and \nconfirmation  bias  which  potentially  render  the  data  upon  which  he  based  his  clinical \ninterpretations,  conclusions,  and  opinions  unreliable  and  thereby  meaningless.  It  is  also  not  clear \nthat  he  adequately  accounted  for  preexisting  functioning  in  his  clinical  considerations. \nAdditionally,  he  is  referencing  a  syndrome,  SHU  Post-Release  Syndrome,  that  has  not  been \ngust,  2004  lly  accepted.  Of concern  with  Mr.  Pacholke’s  report  is  that  he  appears  to  be  holding \nthe  IDOC  responsible  for  a  lack  of rehabilitation  programming  that  are  currently  identified  as \nbest practices,  although they  were not identified  as  such at the  time  of the  plaintiff's  placement  in   \nAS. \nBased  on  my  examination  of the  available  information  and  review  of plaintiffs  expert  reports,  I \noffer the  following  opinions:  . \n1.  The  literature  clearly  demonstrates  that  some  inmates  placed  in  AS  experience  the  harms \ndescribed  by  Dr.  Kupers  and  Mr.  Pacholke  in  their  expert  reports;  however,  these  harms \n16 \n  \nNe>   wk  taaae  iS  RP  ‘P SLEADai S  p©ie s,  aS EV y  OPPAgAhE LR h   LPTPa ases   e  y  Aa ‘¢ ~  3:  a4 f itdF eoeso    ™ru  ‘ caare is  % Lnoaa    Cnir  *  aO ~~   PYM aGranw:ee   \na \nare  not  universally  experienced.  At the  population  level,  it  can  be  expected  that the  use  of \nrestrictive  housing  (such  as  AS)  will,  on  average,  produce  mild  to  moderate  health  and \nmental  health  effects  comparable  to  the  effects  of incarceration  as  a  general  matter.  At the \nindividual  level,  some  inmates  placed  in  AS  will  experience  negative  effects,  some  will \nnot  experience negative  effects,  and  some  will  experience  improved  functioning. \n2.  Methodological  errors  in  Dr.  Kupers’  evaluation  of  the  plaintiff's  mental  health \nfunctioning,  and  the  effect  of  AS  placement  on  this  mental  health  functioning,  results  in \nconclusions  and  opinions  that  are  unreliable  and  potentially  invalid.  Furthermore,  the \nplaintiff's  mental  health  concerns  during  and  after  his  AS  placement,  as  reported  to  Dr. \nKupers,  are  inconsistent  with  medical  records,  which  are  void  of  any  such  reported \nconcerns  by  the  plaintiff both during  and  after the  period  of time  in which  he  was  in  AS. \n3.  Mr.  Pacholke  is  holding  the  IDOC  to  standards  of  practice  regarding  rehabilitation \nprogramming  that  were  not  commonly  recognized  during the  time  period  in  question  (i.e., \nduring the  time  period  of the  plaintiff's  AS  placement). \nRespectfully  Submitted, \nDated:  May  6,  2019 \n| \n Robert D.

It  was  in  regard  to  the  practice  of  the \n11  segregation  review  board  in  a  segregation  unit.  And  as \n12  the  mental  health  professional  assigned  to  that  unit,  I \n13  was  by  default  a  member  of  the  segregation  review  board. \n     \n14  So  it  named  the  segregation  review  board,  plus  the \n15  warden,  I  believe,  of  the  facility,  and  I  was  named  with \n16  everybody  else  on  the  review  board. \n17  Q.

Dr.  Morgan,  you  are  not  a  medical  doctor,  meaning \n10  you  didn't  go  through  medical  training,  right? \n11  A.  No,  I  did  not. \n12  Q.

Can  you  explain  for  me,  a  lay  person,  the \n17  difference  between  Counseling  Psychology  and  Clinical \n18  Psychology,  please? \n19  A.  Yes.  The  differences  are  really  theoretical  by \n20  way  of  approach  to  one's  work.  The  outcome  is  by  way  of \n21  what  somebody  will  do  with  a  clinical  and  counseling  PhD \n22  are  essentially  the  same.  I've  contributed  to  research \n23  on  that.

That  was  one  piece  --  component  of  it. \n18  Q.  What  were  the  other  components? \n19  A.  Following  up  on  an  article  by  Dr.  Metzer  to \n20  outline  best  practices  for  mental  health  services  in \n21  segregation. \n22  Q.

Were  the  longitudinal  studies  that  you  proposed \n17  doing  reliant  on  self-scoring  instruments? \n18  A.  That  would  have  been  part  of  it,  yes. \n19  Q.

FILLER:)  Dr.  Morgan,  right  before  the \n23  break,  we  were  talking  about  your  time  working  in  the \n24  federal  prison  in  Virginia  as  an  intern  during  your \n25  doctoral  studies,  right? \n  \n@  Mccorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  53 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052\nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG 2  T/T  DEAD MS? Ghd  Bagel? dig \n1975 \n  \nA.  Yes. \nQ.  And  you  described  as  part  of  one  of  your \nNN \nrotations  performing  some  mental  health  rounds  in  a \nWwW \n§  segregation  unit;  is  that  right? \n&\nA.  Yes. \nOo \nQ.  And  did  you  perform  rounds  on  everyone  in  the \nOO \nsegregation  unit  or  only  those  prisoners  who  were \nsu \noo  already  on  a  mental  health  caseload? \nA.  No,  when  I  did  rounds,  it  was  for  everybody  in \n10  the  segregation  unit. \n11  Q.  And  was  the  goal  of  those  rounds  to  identify \n12  prisoners  who  were  deteriorating  in  segregation \n13  conditions? \n    \n14  A.  It  was  to  identify  inmates  that  might  be \n15  deteriorating,  but  also  if  they  just  had  any  general \n16  mental  health  needs  that  were  going  unmet  or  unattended \n17  to. \n18  Q.  So  as  I  understand  it,  your  work  working  in \n19  segregation  units  in  prison  was  in  Kansas  between  1992 \n20  and  1993  and  in  a  federal  prison  in  Virginia  for  a \n21  rotation  between  1998  and  1999;  is  that  right? \n22  A.  That  --  yes,  that's  correct,  and  then  consulting \n23  with  Correct  Care  in  2013.  And  then  as  part  of  my \n24  practice  here  when  I  do  forensic  mental  health \n25  evaluations,  many  times  they're  at  the  jails  and  many \n  \nMcCorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  54 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052 \nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG 21/49  DEAD? Gh  MB agelD dig \n1976 \n  \nbe  evaluating  inmates  that  were  awaiting  trial  a  couple \nof  years,  and  a  significant  portion,  if  not  all  of  that, \nmight  have  been  in  segregation.  Segregation  in  jail  for \na  couple  of  years  would  be  longer  than  some  folks  in \nprisons.  It  would  be  comparable  to  some  inmates  in \nprisons,  and  it  would  be  shorter  than  many  inmates \nserving  segregation  time  in  prisons. \nYeah,  usually  in  my  forensic  mental  health \nwork,  if  an  inmate  was  in  segregation  they'd  been  there \n10  for  a  bit  of  time. \n11  Q.  And  did  that  forensic  mental  health  evaluation \n12  involve  assessing  the  effect  of  segregation  on  their \n13  mental  health? \n    \n14  A.  They  were  forensic  mental  health  evaluations  for \n15  purposes  of  a  legal  matter.  It  would  include  an \n16  assessment  of  mental  health  functioning,  but  not \n17  specific  to  the  issue  of  segregation. \n18  Q.  And  what  we've  just  covered  in  terms  of  your  work \n19  in  prison  facilities,  is  that  the  prison  experience  that \n20  you  are  relying  on  in  giving  opinions  in  this  case? \n21  A.  Actually  no,  I'm  missing  a  couple  of  key \n22  experiences.  My  work  on  matters  such  as  this.  So \n23  touring  and  meeting  with  inmates  in  Pelican  Bay  State \n24  Prison,  touring  facilities  in  Alabama,  touring \n25  facilities  in  Canada,  also  interviewing  inmates  in \n  \nMcCorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  57 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052 \nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG PLR  DERE aMs+ GA  [0599415 aig \n1977 \n  \nCanada.

If  you  turn  to  Attachment  B  of  your  CV,  I  see \nthat  you've  listed  cases  where  you've  testified  over  the \npast  four  years? \nA.  Yes. \nQ.  And  several  of  these  appear  to  pertain  to \ncompetency  evaluations,  such  as  we  were  discussing.  So \n10  State  of  Texas  versus  Rudolfo  Gill  and  State  of  Texas \n11  versus  Marcus  Gonzales;  is  that  right? \n12  A.  Correct. \n13  Q.  And  I  see  a  couple  of  cases  here  from  Canada,  the \n     \n14  first  matter  Christopher  Brazo? \n15  A.  Brazeau. \n16  Q.  Brazeau.  And  the  third  listing,  Corporation  of \n17  the  Canadian  Civil  Liberties  Association.  Were  those \n18  both  cases  from  Canada? \n19  A.  Yes,  that's  correct. \n20  Q.  So  looking  at  the  Brazeau  Case,  what  was  your \n21  involvement  in  that  matter? \n22  A.  Iwas  retained  to  give  expert  opinion  on  the \n23  issue  of  effects  of  segregation  in  a  class  action. \n24  Yeah. \n25  Q.

Correct. \nQ.  It  goes  onto  say  that,  nevertheless,  you  were \nextensively  cross-examined  on  this  work  and  heavily \ncritiqued  by  Drs.  Grassian  and  Haney  for  your  review \narticle.  Do  you  recall  being  questioned  about  the \nmeta-analysis  as  part  of  this  case? \nA.  Yes,  I  do. \nQ.  And  do  you  recall  the  critiques  from  Drs. \n10  Grassian  and  Haney? \n11  A.  Yes. \n12  Q.  And  then  in  the  next  paragraph,  182,  the  court \n13  says,  \"Essentially,  I  do  not  give  much  weight  to  Dr. \n     \n14  Morgan's  meta-analysis  conclusions.\"  Were  you  aware  of \n15  the  court's  view  of  your  meta-analysis? \n16  A.  I  was  aware  of  that. \n17  Q.  Do  you  know  why  the  court  decided  not  to  give \n18  much  weight  to  your  meta-analysis  in  this  Brazeau  Case? \n19  A.  I  do  not. \n20  Q.  And  if  you  could  flip  ahead  to  page  53,  which  is \n21  Bates  labeled  Vermillion  4422? \n22  A.  I'm  there. \n23  Q.  Okay.

Did  your  assignment  change  at  any  point? \nA.  No,  it  did  not. \nQ.  And  what  methodology  did  you  use  to  come  to  the \nconclusions  expressed  in  your  report? \nA.  Oh,  a  review  of  the  literature,  a  review  of  all \nof  the  documents  provided  to  me,  an  analysis  of  those \n10  documents,  and  that  was  pretty  much  it.  An  analysis  -- \n11  let  me,  I  guess  --  an  analysis  of  those  documents  in \n12  relation  to  my  experience  as  well. \n13  Q.  And  as  I  understand  it,  you  didn't  go  to  the \n    \n14  great  State  of  Indiana  in  connection  with  this  case? \n15  A.  No. \n16  Q.  You  did  not  go  to  any  Indiana  prisons? \n17  A.  I  did  not. \n18  Q.  Have  you  ever  been  inside  of  an  Indiana  prison? \n19  A.  I  have  not. \n20  Q.  And  you  did  not  interview  any  Indiana \n21  correctional  staff? \n22  A.  I  did  not. \n23  Q.  Did  not  interview  any  Indiana  mental  health \n24  staff? \n25  A.

And  you  also  did  not  interview  the  Plaintiff  in \nthis  case,  Jay  Vermillion? \nA.  That's  correct. \nQ.  In  looking  at  the  materials  that  you've  listed \nhere,  it  appears  that  you  didn't  review  any  literature \n10  specific  to  Indiana  segregation,  such  as  Dr.  Kupers' \n11  Cold  Storage  Report? \n12  A.  No. \n13  Q.  No  you  did  not  review  that  literature,  correct? \n    \n14  A.  Correct. \n15  Q.  Sometimes  there's  a  double  negative.  I  just  want \n16  to  check. \n17  And  so  as  I  understand  your  testimony  and \n18  your  report,  you  evaluated  Dr.  Kupers'  opinion  as  to  the \n19  effect  of  solitary  confinement  on  the  Plaintiff,  Jay \n20  Vermillion;  is  that  right? \n21  A.  Yes. \n22  Q.  You  did  not  reach  your  own  opinion  as  to  the \n23  effects  of  segregation  on  the  Plaintiff? \n24  A.  Oh,  that's  correct,  yes. \n25  Q.

I  take  it  that  part  of  your  critique  of  Dr. \n22  Kupers'  opinion  in  this  case  is  that  he  did  not  have  any \n23  psychological  testing  done  to  assess  the  possibility  of \n24  malingering;  is  that  fair? \n25  A.

Yeah,  I  mean,  generally  speaking. \nQ.  Can  you  describe  for  us  the  basic  approach  to  the \nstudy? \nA.  They  pulled  participants  from  general  population, \npsychiatric  care  unit  and  segregation  to  participate  in \nthe  study. \nQ.  But  are  you  aware  of  how  they  identified  those \ngroups?  In  other  words,  it  wasn't  random,  right? \n10  A.  Right.  Right.  I'm  --  I  think  I  need  to  look  at \n11  it  to  refresh  my  memory  on  the  actual  selection \n12  procedure.  But  yeah,  I  reviewed  it. \n13  Q.  So  as  I  understand  it,  they  looked  at  prisoners \n    \n14  who  were  in  the  disciplinary  process,  and  those \n15  prisoners  would  be  held  in  a  form  of  segregation,  either \n16  awaiting  the  disciplinary  hearing  or  after.  And  then \n17  some  prisoners  would  come  out  of  those  disciplinary \n18  hearings  and  go  to  general  population,  some  prisoners \n19  would  come  out  of  that  process  and  go  to  administrative \n20  segregation,  and  that's  how  they  identified  the  groups. \n21  Does  that  sound  right? \n22  A.  That  --  that  sounds  right. \n23  Q.  So  Dr.  Haney's  point  in  his  2018  article  is  that \n24  both  of  those  groups  would  have  been  in  segregation \n25  right  before  the  study  started  then? \n  \n@  McCorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  143 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052 \nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG  1/ RHE PO Mar Gan  [05994|5 aig \n1998 \n  \narticle,  do  you  see  that  in  this  section,  generally  he's \n  describing  this  issue  of  the  initial  contamination \nN\nproblem? \nWwW \nA.

Do  you \nwo \n10  agree  with  that? \n11  A.  I  don't  agree  with  the  basic  premise.  Do  I  agree \n12  that  --  that  Dr.  Haney  could  make  the  argument  that  that \n13  invalidates  the  study?  Sure.  But  I  don't  agree  that  it \n     \n14  does.

Is  one  of  them  that  the  Zinger  study  includes \npeople  who  are  in  segregation  voluntarily? \n10  A.  Yes. \n11  Q.  Do  you  agree  that  whether  a  prisoner  is  in \n12  solitary  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  could  effect  that \n13  prisoner's  experience  in  their  confinement? \n    \n14  A.  It  certainly  could. \n15  Q.  And  by  the  end  of  the  Zinger  study,  which  lasted \n16  60  days,  only  ten  people  were  involuntarily  in \n17  segregation,  correct? \n18  A.  That  sounds  right. \n19  Q.  And  so  approximately  80  percent  of  the  prisoners \n20  in  the  segregation  group  had  left  by  the  end  of  60  days? \n21  A.  Yes.  Again,  that  sounds  correct. \n22  Q.  Meaning  that  the  experience  of  the  prisoners  who \n23  had  left  segregation  were  not  included  in  the  Zinger \n24  analysis? \n25  A.

That  it  did  not  actually  compare  segregation \n    \n14  populations  with  general  population  prisoners? \n15  A.  Right. \n16  Q.  Is  Dr.  Haney  correct  about  that? \n17  A.  Can  I  pull  up  the  Cloyes? \n18  Q.  Yeah,  it  was  --  so  -- \n19  A  I  believe  it's  right  here. \n20  Q.  You've  got  a  tab  there.  Yeah,  it's  3651, \n21  Vermillion  3651.  And  if  you  look  at  the  page  describing \n22  the  method,  it's  Vermillion  3655.  And  it  says  that  the \n23  participants  included  inmates  housed  in  three  SMUs  at \n24  the  time  of  the  study.

That  does  sound  right,  but  let  me  just \ndoublecheck. \nQ.  I  can  point  you  to  --  it's  Vermillion  3888,  under \n10  \"Method,  40  long-term  prisoners  volunteered  for  a \n11  study.\" \n12  A.  Yes,  correct. \n13  Q.  And  we've  already  discussed  that  the  nature  of \n    \n14  participation  as  voluntary  could  have  an  effect  on \n15  prisoners'  experience  of  those  conditions? \n16  A.  It  could. \n17  Q.  And  this  study  also  only  studied  the  effects  of \n18  solitary  confinement  over  a  period  of  four  days, \n19  correct? \n20  A.  Correct. \n21  Q.  Would  you  agree  that  that's  very  different  than \n22  solitary  confinement  for  a  period  of  four  years? \n23  A.  I  would  agree. \n24  Q.  And  if  I  could  direct  your  attention  to  the \n25  Ecclestone  1974  study,  which  is  Vermillion  3955? \n  \nMcCorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  168 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052 \nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG 2  T/T  DEAD Eee Gh  Bagel? di \n2004 \n  \nA.

Potential  volunteers. \nQ.  Yeah. \nA.  Yes. \nQ.  \"Methods.\"  All  volunteers,  right? \n10  A.  Correct. \n11  Q.  And  the  maximum  stay  in  segregation  that  was \n12  looked  at  in  this  study  was  ten  days? \n13  A.  I  don't  doubt  that.  I  don't  recall  that,  but  I \n     \n14  don't  doubt  it. \n15  Q.  And  again,  we  would  expect  to  see  different \n16  effects  of  ten  days  of  solitary  confinement  versus  four \n17  years  of  solitary  confinement? \n18  A.  We  could. \n19  Q.  In  your  report,  you  opine  that  --  and  this  is \n20  your  words,  \"the  use  of  restrictive  housing,  such  as  AS, \n21  will,  on  average,  produce  mild  to  moderate  health  and \n22  mental  health  effects  comparable  to  the  effects  of \n23  incarceration  as  a  general  matter,\"  end  quote.

So  for  example,  mood  and  emotion  in  RS-2  had  an \neffect  size  of  .55? \nA.  Right. \nQ.  Which  is  a  moderate  effect? \nA.  Right. \n10  Q.  Which  would  indicate  that  people  in  segregation \n11  had  negative  effects  on  their  mood  or  emotion? \n12  A.  Correct. \n13  Q.  And  then  your  --  and  that  is  itself  derived  from \n    \n14  comparing  populations  in  segregation  to  populations  in \n15  general  population? \n16  A.  Correct. \n17  Q.  And  then  you're  comparing  that  to  a  study  from \n18  Bonta  and  Gendreau,  a  totally  different  study  that \n19  wasn't  included  in  your  meta-analyses? \n20  A.  Right. \n21  Q.  The  Bonta  and  Gendreau  study,  that  study  was  a \n22  study  of  the  effects  of  overcrowded  prisons  on \n23  prisoners'  psychological  well-being,  right? \n24  A.

Yes. \nQ.  And  the  variable  in  that  study  was  overcrowded \nprisons? \nA.  Correct. \nQ.  Which  some  prisons  are  overcrowded,  but  not  all \nprisons  are  overcrowded? \n10  A.  Right. \n11  Q.  So  we're  comparing  the  effect  sizes  of  the  harms \n12  of  segregation  to  the  effect  sizes  of  the  harms  of \n13  living  in  an  overcrowded  prison? \n    \n14  A.  That  would  be  fair. \n15  Q.  And  I  noticed  when  I  was  reviewing  your  report  in \n16  the  CCLA  Case  that  you  included  a  similar  bar  graph  in \n17  that  case  report? \n18  A.  Yes. \n19  Q.  Do  you  recall  submitting  that  report? \n20  A.  Yes. \n21  Q.  And  that  bar  graph  had  another  bar  froma \n22  different  study  for  physical  health? \n23  A.

And  so  here  you  have  your  RS-1  effect  sizes,  the \n20  Bonta  and  Gendreau  effect  size  regarding  overcrowding, \n21  and  then  you  had  the  Heigel  2010  study,  which  showed \n22  .18,  right? \n23  A.

Yes,  had  a  computational  error. \nQ.  Okay.  Can  you  describe  that  computational  error? \nA.  I  had  inverted  --  I  forget  the  exact  data  point \nor  what,  but  I  had  it  inverted. \nQ.  So  as  I  understand,  and  you  can  tell  me  if  this \nsounds  right,  but  in  this  case  you  had  looked  at  the \n10  Heigel  study,  which  measured  physical  health  and  given \n11  it  a  negative  effect  size  of  .18  --  or  negative  is  maybe \n12  not  the  correct  term,  but  negative  health  outcomes  were \n13  associated  with  general  incarceration  at  a  .18  effect \n    \n14  size? \n15  A.  Right.  Right. \n16  Q.  And  that  actually,  that  was  a  mistake  and  it \n17  should  have  been  negative  .18? \n18  A.  Yes,  they  improved  in  terms  of  their  physical \n19  health  functioning. \n20  Q.  And  so  when  we  compare  that  study's  effect  size \n21  to,  for  example,  your  chart  here  of  physical  health, \n22  which  is  .37  effect  size  from  your  study,  that  would \n23  tend  to  show  that  there  was  a  major  difference  in  the \n24  physical  health  of  prisoners  in  segregation  as  opposed \n25  to  the  physical  health  of  prisoners  in  general \n  \nMcCorkle  Litigation  Services,  Inc.  182 \nChicago,  Illinois  (312)  263-0052 \nCase  1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB  Document  312-4  Filed  OG 2  T/T  DEAGME?

I  think  it's  in  here. \n18  Q.  It's  okay.  That  would  be  the  only  one  that \n19  you  can  think  of? \n20  A.  That  would  be  the  only  one,  yes. \n21  Q.  Okay.  Your  2016  meta-analyses  study  posits  that \n22  \"It  could  be  that  prisoners  who  suffer  the  most  in \n23  segregation  do  so  because  of  a  culture  of  harm.\"  Do  you \n24  recall  that? \n25  A.

Introduction  and  Overview \n[1]  Through  the  Correctional  Service  of  Canada,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “CSC”,  the \nFederal  Government  operates  penitentiaries  and  related  penal  institutions  across  Canada. \nPursuant  to  the  Class  Proceedings  Act,  1 992,'  the  Plaintiffs  Christopher  Brazeau  and  David  Kift \nsue  the  Federal  Government  of Canada  about  the  operation  of those  penitentiaries. \n[2]  On  behalf of a  class  of inmates  who  are  seriously  mentally  tll,  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift \nallege  that  by  placing  mentally  ill  inmates  in  “administrative  segregation,”  the  Federal \nGovernment  has  breached  the  Class  Members’  rights  under  the  Canadian  Charter  of Rights  and \nFreedoms.’ \n[3]  By  administrative  segregation,  the  inmate  is  removed  from  his  or  her  cell  at  the \npenitentiary  within  the  ranges  of  cells  for  the  general  inmate  population  and  isolated  in  a \nsegregated  area  in  a  solitary  cell  with  very  limited  access  to  others.  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  say \nthat  administrative  segregation  is  a  euphemism  for  what  ts,  in  truth,  solitary  confinement,  which \n  \n\"§.0.  1992,  c.  6. \n? Part L of the  Constitution Act,  1982, being  Schedule B to the  Canada Act  1982 (UK),  1982, ¢  11. \n  \nVERMILLION  004370 \nis  a  type  of confinement  defined  by jurists  and  by  criminologists  and  penologists,  ie.,  by  social \nscientists  that  study  the  punishment  of crime  and  prison  management,  to  be  twenty-two  hours  or \nmore  a  day  of confinement  without  meaningful  human  contact. \n[4]  In  their  class  action,  on  behalf of the  seriously  mentally  ill  inmates,  Messrs.  Brazeau  and \nKift  seek  Charter  damages  and  also  punitive  damages.  They  seek  these  damages  in  the  aggregate \nto  be  awarded  to  the  Class.  After  an  aggregate  base  award  to  the  Class  Members,  Messrs.  l)\ni\nL\nBrazeau  and  Kift  propose  that  there  would  be  individual  damage  assessments  of compensatory  n\na\nC\ndamages  for  each  Class  Member  whose  Charter  rights  have  been  violated  and  who  have  suffered  (\n \npecuniary  and  non-pecuniary  personal  injuries.  88\n8\n1\n[5]  By  the  design  of Class  Counsel,  the  Class  Members  are  defined  as  inmates  who  have  very   \nC\nserious  mental  illnesses.  Appendix  A  of  the  Class  Definition,  set  out  below,  uses  the  Global  NS\nO\nAssessment  of  Functioning  scale  (GAF),  which  is  a  numeric  scale  (1  to  100)  used  by  mental \n \n9\nhealth  professionals  to  rate  the  social,  occupational,  and  psychological  functioning  of adults.  The  1\n0\n2\nlower  the  score,  the  worse  the  functioning.  As  defined,  the  Class  Members  have  serious  mental \ndiseases,  serious  impediments,  and  low  GAF  scores;  they  are  the  sickest  of the  inmates  suffering \nfrom  mental  illness. \n[6]  In  2016,  on  consent,  the  action was  certified  as  a  class  proceeding.” \n[7]  During  the  course  of  the  hearing  of  the  summary  judgment  motion,  because  they \ndiscontinued  certain  claims  that  did  not  involve  administrative  segregation  but  were  concerned \nabout  the  CSC’s  alleged  failures  in  providing  health  care  to  the  Class  Members,  Messrs.  Brazeau \nand  Kift  were  granted  leave  to  amend  the  Class  Definition.  After the  hearing,  there  was  a  further \namendment  on  consent  to  carve  out  from  the  Class  Definition  certain  inmates  in  Québec  penal \ninstitutions  because  they  are  Class  Members  tn a  parallel  class  action.”  As  a  result,  Messrs. \nBrazeau  and  Kift  are  the  Representative  Plaintiffs  for the  following  class: \nAll  offenders  in  federal  custody,  who  were  placed  in  administrative  segregation  in  a  federal \ninstitution  situated  outside  Québec  after  February  24,  2013,  or  who  placed  in  administrative \nsegregation  in  a  federal  institution  anywhere  in  Canada  before  February  24,  2013  were  diagnosed \nby  a  medical  doctor  with  an  Axis  I  Disorder  (excluding  substance  use  disorders)  or  Borderline \nPersonality Disorder,  who  suffered  from  their disorder,  in a manner described  in Appendix A,  and \nreported  such  during  their  incarceration,  where  the  diagnosis  by  a  medical  doctor  occurred  either \nbefore  or during  incarceration  in  a  federal  institution  and the  offenders  were  incarcerated  between \nNovember  1,  1992  and the present,  and were alive as of July  20, 2013. \n[8]  Appendix  \"A\"  of the  class  definition  lists  the  ways  in  which  inmates  diagnosed  with  an \nAxis  I  Disorder  (excluding  substance  use  disorders)  or  Borderline  Personality Disorder  (“BPD”), \nsuffered  from  their  disorder  and  can  be  identified  as  Class  Members.  Appendix A  states: \n(a)  significant  impairment  in  judgment  (including  inability  to  make  decisions;  confusion; \ndisorientation);  (b)  significant  impairment  in  thinking  (including  constant  preoccupation  with \nthoughts,  paranoia;  (c)  delusions  that  make the offender a  danger  to  self or  others);  (d)  significant \nimpairment  in  mood (including  constant  depressed  mood  plus  helplessness  and  hopelessness;  (e) \nagitation;  (f)  manic  mood  that  interferes  with  ability  to  effectively  interact  with  other  offenders, \nstaffs  or  follow  correctional  plan);  (g)  significant  impairment  in  communications  that  interferes \nwith  ability  to  effectively  interact  with  other  offenders,  staff  or  follow  correctional  plan;  (h) \nsignificant  impairment  due  to  anxiety  (panic  attacks;  overwhelming  anxiety)  that  interferes  with \n  \n* Brazeau v.

The  CCRA  prescribes  the  current  regime  of administrative  segregation.  There  is  a\nC\n(\nno  prescribed  end  date  for  the  Class  Period,  and  it  remains  a  running  Class  Period.  The  July  20,   \n8\n2013  date  by  which  a  Class  Member  must  have  been  alive  is  predicated  upon  the  applicable  88\n1\nprovisions  in  the  Trustee  Act®  to  maintain  actions  for  torts  by  executors  and  administrators.  The   \nC\nFederal  Government,  however,  submits  that  there  are  federal  or  provincial  limitation  periods  S\nN\nO\nfrom  two  to  six  years  that  apply  and  that  would  foreclose  many  claims  and  shorten  the  Class \n \n9\nPeriod.  10\n2\n[10]  Onconsent,  the  following  common  issues  were  certified: \n1.  By  its  operation  and  management  of the  Federal  Institutions  from November  1, \n1992  to  the  present,  did  the  Defendant  breach  the  Class  Members'  rights  under \nsection  7  of the  Charter? \n2.  If so,  were  its  actions  saved by  section  |  of the  Charter? \n3.  By  its  operation  and  management  of the  Federal  Institutions  from November  1, \n1992  to  the  present,  did  the  Defendant  breach  the  Class  Members'  rights  under \nsection 9  of the  Charter? \n4.  If so,  were  its  actions  saved by section  |  of the  Charter? \n5.  By  its  operation  and  management  of  the  Federa!  correctional  facilities  from \nNovember  1,  1992  to  the  present,  did  the  Defendant  breach  the  Class  Members' \nrights  under section  12  of the  Charter? \n6.  If so,  were  its  actions  saved by  section  |  of the  Charter? \n7.  If the  answer  to  any  of common  issues  (1),  (3),  or  (5)  is  \"yes\",  and  the  answer \nto  any of (2),  (4)  and (6)  is  no,  are  damages  available to the Class  under section 24 \nof the  Charter’? \n8.  If the  answer  to  common  issue  (7)  is  \"yes\",  can  the  Court  make  an  aggregate \nassessment  of  the  damages  suffered  by  all  Class  Members  as  a  part  of  the \ncommon  issues  trial  [summary judgment motion]? \n[11]  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  bring  a  summary  judgment  motion  for  answers  to  all  of  the \ncommon  issues.  With  the  discontinuance  of the  claims  involving  health  care  but  not  involving \nadministrative  segregation,  the  summary  judgment  motion  ts  designed  to  be  dispositive  of  the \naction  save  for  the  individual  issues  trials.  If Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  succeed  on  their  summary \njudgment  motion,  then  the  class  proceeding  would  proceed  with  individual  damages  assessments \n  \n2  §.C.  1992,  c.  20. \n°R.S.0.  1990, c.  T.23,  ss.  38  (1) and (3). \nVERMILLION  004372 \nfor the  Class  Members  for  compensation  for their  personal  injuries. \n[12]  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  submit  that  there  are  no  genuine  issues  requiring a  trial  because \nthe  evidence  establishes  that  every  Class  Member,  all  of whom  suffer  from  a  diagnosed  severe \nmental  illness,  are  too  sick  for  any  time  in  solitary  confinement.  They  submit  that  it  follows  that \nthere  no  genuine  issues  for  trial  that  the  Class  Members’  rights  have  been  contravened:  (a)  under \nsection  7  of the  Charter  to  not  be  deprived  of the  right  to  life,  liberty  and  security  of the  person  )l\ni\nexcept  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  fundamental  justice,  (b)  under  section  9  of  the  Ln\na\nC\nCharter  not  to  be  arbitrarily  detained  or  imprisoned;  and  (c)  under  section  12  of the  Charter  not  (\n \nto  be  subjected  to  any  cruel  and  unusual  treatment  or  punishment.  8\n8\n8\n1\n[13]  Further,  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  submit  that  there  are  no  genuine  issues  requiring  a  trial   \nC\nthat  all  the  Class  Members  are  entitled  to  both  Charter  damages  and  also  punitive  damages,  S\nN\nO\nwhich,  damages  they  submit,  the  evidence  establishes  are  capable  of  being  calculated  and  of \n \n9\nbeing  awarded  in  the  aggregate  pursuant  to  s.  24  of the  Class Proceedings Act,  1992.  1\n0\n2\n[14]  The  Federal  Government  submits  that  the  case  is  not  appropriate  for  a  summary \njudgment. \n[15]  In  the  alternative,  the  Federal  Government  submits  that  administrative  segregation  is  not \nthe  equivalent  of  solitary  confinement.  It  submits  that  while  in  individual  cases,  administrative \nsegregation  may  have  been  used  in  a  way  that  contravenes  an  individual  Class  Member’s \nCharter  rights,  administrative  segregation  for  Class  Members  was  (there  is  pending  legislation \nthat  will  stop  the  practice  for  some  seriously  mentally  ill  inmates)  never  a  class-wide  Charter \nbreach.  The  Federal  Government  submits  that  administrative  segregation  is  a  legislatively \nauthorized  and  appropriate  and  necessary  last  resort  for  managing  a  difficult  and  dangerous \nprison  population  and  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  fundamental  justice.  The  Federal \nGovernment  submits  that  individual  cases  of  maladministration  where  the  Correctional  Service \nviolates  an  inmate’s  Charter  rights  does  not  prove  that  there  has  been  a  class-wide  or  systemic \nCharter  breach.  Further,  the  Federal  Government  denies  that  the  Class  Members  have  any \nentitlement  to  Charter  damages  or that  damages  can  be  awarded  in the  aggregate. \n[16]  For  the  reasons  that  follow,  I  grant  the  summary  judgment  motion  -  in  part  -  and  [ \ndismiss  it  -  in part. \n[17]  The  answers  to  the  common  issues  are  as  follows: \na.  By  its  operation  and  management  of  the  Federal  Institutions  from  November  1, \n1992  to  the  present,  the  Federal  Government  breached  the  Class  Members’  rights \nunder  section  7  of the  Charter  by  the  absence  of an  adequate  review  process  for \nplacements  in  administrative  segregation.  In  other  words,  there  is  a  class-wide \nbreach  of section  7  (misdescribed  by  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  as  a  breach  of s.  9) \nof  the  Charter  because  the  review  process  for  administrative  segregation \ncontravened  the  Charter. \nWithout  prejudice  to  any  individual  Class  Member’s  claim  at  an  individual  issues \ntrial  to  assert  that  his  or  her  treatment  was  contrary  to  section  7  of the  Charter  in \nhis  or  her  particular  circumstances,  by  its  operation  and  management  of  the \nFederal  Institutions  from  November  1,  1992  to  the  present,  the  Federal \nGovernment  breached  the  rights  under  section  7  of  the  Charter  of  those  Class \nMembers:  (a)  who  were  involuntarily  placed  in  administrative  segregation  for \nVERMILLION  004373 \nmore  than  thirty  days;  and  (b)  who  were  voluntarily  placed  in  administrative \nsegregation  for  more  than  sixty  days. \ni.  In  other  words,  while  individual  Class  Members  may  have  suffered  a \nviolation  of  section  7  of  the  Charter  by  his  or  her  placement  in \nadministrative  segregation  for  less  than  thirty  days,  there  was  only  a \ncommon  or  systemic  breach  suffered  by  two  subclasses  comprised  of  !)\nl\nL\nClass  Members:  (a)  who  were  involuntarily  placed  in  administrative  n\na\nC\nsegregation  for  more  than  thirty  days;  or,  (b)  who  were  voluntarily  placed  (\n \nin  administrative  segregation  for  more  than  sixty  days.  88\n8\n1\nii.  As  the  discussion  below  will  explain,  involuntary  placements  include  both   \nC\nplacements  made  at  the  request  of  the  inmate  (genuine  voluntary  NS\nO\nplacements)  and  also  placements  in  which  the  inmate  contrives  or \n \n9\nengineers  an  involuntary  placement  into  administrative  segregation.  01\n2\nFor  the  subclasses  (which  may  also  be  represented  by  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  as \nrepresentative  plaintiffs),  the  breach  of  section  7  of  the  Charter  is  not saved  by \nsection  |  of the  Charter. \nBy  its  operation  and  management  of  the  Federal  Institutions  from  November  1, \n1992  to  the  present,  the  Federal  Government  did  not  breach  the  Class  Members’ \nrights  under  section  9  of the  Charter. \nThere  being  no  breach,  the  question  of  whether  the  breach  of  section  9  of  the \nCharter  is  saved  by  section  |  of the  Charter  need  not  be  answered. \nWithout  prejudice  to  any  individual  Class  Member’s  claim  at  an  individual  issues \ntrial  to  assert  that  his  or  her  treatment  was  cruel  and  unusual,  by  its  operation  and \nmanagement  of the  Federal  Institutions  from  November  1,  1992  to  the  present,  the \nFederal  Government  breached  the  rights  under  section  12  of the  Charter  of those \nClass  Members  (a)  who  were  involuntarily  placed  in  administrative  segregation \nfor  more  than  thirty  days;  and  (b)  who  were  voluntarily  placed  in  administrative \nsegregation  for  more  than  sixty  days. \ni.  In  other  words,  while  individual  Class  Members  may  have  suffered  a  cruel \nand  unusual  treatment  by  his  or  her  placement  in  administrative \nsegregation  for  less  than  thirty  days,  there  was  only  a  common  or  systemic \nbreach  suffered  by  the  two  subclasses  comprised  of  Class  Members:  (a) \nwho  were  involuntarily  placed  in  administrative  segregation  for  more  than \nthirty  days;  or,  (b)  who  were  voluntarily  placed  in  administrative \nsegregation  for  more  than  sixty days.  : \nFor  the  subclasses,  the  breach  of section  12  of the  Charter  breach  is  not  saved  by \nsection  Ll  of the  Charter. \n“Notwithstanding  the  principles  from  Mackin  v.  New  Brunswick  (Minister  of \nFinance),’  vindication  and  deterrence  damages  are  available  to  the  whole  class \nunder  section  24  (1)  of  the  Charter  for  the  breach  of  section  7  of  the  Charter \nregarding  the  inadequate  review  procedure  for  placements  in  administrative \n  \n72002  SCC  13. \nVERMILLION  004374 \nsegregation  (misdescribed  by Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  as  a  breach  of s.  9).  In  any \nevent,  vindication  and  deterrence  damages  are  available  to  the  subclasses  that \nsuffered  a  breach  of sections  7  and  12  of the  Charter. \nh.  The  court  can  make  an  aggregate  assessment  of the  Charter  damages  suffered  by \nthe  whole  class  for  the  breach  of  section  7  of  the  Charter  and  of  the  Charter \ndamages  of  the  subclasses  that  suffered  a  breach  of  sections  7  and  12  of  the  )|\nI\nCharter.  The  court  assesses  those  damages  as  $20  million,  which  is  to  be  Ln\na\nC\ndistributed,  less  Class  Counsel’s  approved  legal  fees  and  disbursements,  in  the  (\n \nform  of additional  mental  health  or  program  resources  for  structural  changes  to  penal  8\n8\n8\ninstitutions  as  the  court on  further motion  may  direct.  1\n \nC\ni.  The  Federal  Government  is  not  liable  for  punitive  damages  on  a  class-  S\nN\nO\nwide  basis  but  may  be  liable  for  punitive  damages  after  the  Charter \n \n9\ndamages  are  determined  at  the  individual  issues  trials.  1\n0\n2\niii  How  the  $20  million,  less  Class  Counsel’s  approved  fees  and \ndisbursements,  shall  be  distributed  for  the  benefit  of  the  class  and  the \nsubclasses  shall  be  determined  by  a  distribution  motion  brought  by  Class \nCounsel. \n[18]  in  addition  to  answering  the  common  issues,  as  set  out  above,  [  conclude  that  subject  to \nindividual  Class  Members  rebutting  the  statute-bar,  there  is  a  six-year  limitation  period  that \napplies  to  all  claims,  and,  thus,  the  start  date  for  the  Class  Period  is  July  20,  2009  for  all  but  the \nEstate  claimants,  for  which  the  start  date  is  July  20,  2013.  This  means  that  without  prejudice  to \nthe  claims  of  Class  Members  that  have  an  individual  rebuttal  to  the  tolling  of  the  limitation \nperiod,  Class  Members’  claims  as  a  class  from  a  placement  in  administrative  segregation  before \nJuly  20,  2009  are  statute-barred. \n[19]  Having  regard  to  these  answers,  as  I  shall  explain  later  in  these  Reasons  for  Decision,  I \nrecommend  that  the  Representative  Plaintiffs  consider  bringing  a  motion  to  amend  the  class \ndefinition.  I  shall  recommend  that  the  words:  “All  offenders  in  federal  custody  who  were \ndiagnosed  by  a  medical  doctor  with  an  Axis  [  Disorder  ...”  in  the  class  definition  be  replaced \nwith  the  words:  “All  offenders  in  federal  custody  who  had  an  Axis  I  Disorder  ...”.  And  I \nrecommend  that  the  words:  “where  the  diagnosis  by  a  medical  doctor  occurred”  be  replaced  with \nthe  words:  “where  the  diagnosis  occurred  or  could  have  occurred.” \n[20]  As I  shall  explain,  in  my  opinion,  the  current  Class  Definition  is  under-inclusive.  If the \nClass  Member  can  prove  that  he  or  she  had  an  undiagnosed  Axis  I  Disorder  or  that  a  medical \ndoctor  ought  to  have  diagnosed  them  as  suffering  from  an  Axis  I  Disorder,  he  or  she  should  be \nincluded  in  the  class  unless  they  opt  out  of the  class  action.  (While  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  a \nnew  Class  Member  would  opt-out,  since  the  class  definition  is  being  amended,  the  new  Class \nMembers  have  a  right to  opt  out.) \n[21]  There:  are  Class  Members  that  have  claims  that  require  individual  issues  trials  for \ncompletion.  The  findings  of fact  made  on  this  summary judgment  motion  carry  forward  as  issue \nestoppels  into  any  individual  issues  trials.  While  [  shall  make  some  observations  in  these \nReasons  for  Decision,  the  procedural  nature  of  those  individual  issues  trials  remains  to  be \ndetermined  under  s.  25  of the  Class  Proceedings  Act,  1992.  Depending  on  the  quantum  of each \nindividual  inmate’s  claim,  the  principles  of  proportionality  in  procedure  may  require  dispute \nVERMILLION  004375 \nresolution  procedures  ranging  from  a  simple  claims-qualification  procedure  to  conventional  trials \npursuant  to  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  [  direct  a  motion  to  settle  the  procedures  for  the \nindividual  issues  trials. \n[22]  It  further  follows  from  the  above  answers  that  a  distribution  scheme  is  required  for  the \n$20  million,  less  Class  Counsel’s  approved  fees  and  disbursements,  awarded  as  vindication  and  _\n \ndeterrence  Charter  damages  for  the  class  and  for  the  subclasses  of Class  Members.  While  I  shall  )\nI\nI\nmake  some  observations  in  these  Reasons  for  Decision  about  the  distribution  plan,  the  nature  of  nL\na\nC\nthe  distribution  plan  remains  to  be  determined  under  s.  26  of the  Class  Proceedings Act,  1992.  1  (\n \ndirect  a  motion to  settle  the  distribution  plan.  8\n8\n8\n1\n \nB.

The  Correctional  Service  of Canada,  Prison  Demographics  and  Culture,  the  Placement \nof Inmates,  Mental  Health  Care,  and  Administrative  Segregation \n[32]  Canada  is  a  confederation  of  the  federal  and  provincial  governments,  and  under  the \nConstitutional  Act,  1867,°  (formerly  the  British  North  America  Act)  legislative  authority  is \ndistributed  between  the  governments.  Pursuant  to  s.  92,  paragraph  6,  provincial  governments \nhave  the  legislative  authority  with  respect to  “The  Establishment,  Maintenance,  and  Management \nof  Public  and  Reformatory  Prisons  in  and  for  the  Province.”  Pursuant  to  s.  91  paragraph  28,  the \nFederal  Government  has  legislative  authority  for  “The  Establishment,  Maintenance,  and \nManagement  of Penitentiaries.” \n[33]  Federal  Government  penitentiaries  are  currently  regulated  by  the  Corrections  and \nConditional  Release  Act  (“CCRA’’)  and  SOR/92-620  (Corrections  and  Conditional  Release \nRegulations).” \n[34]  Under  the  CCRA,  a  Commissioner  of  Corrections  is  appointed  by  the  Governor  in \nCouncil  (CCRA  s.6).

MY \n40 \nlegal  issue,  [  shall  come  to  my  own  conclusion  about the  matter. \nK.  The  Battle  of the  Experts \n[177]  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  supported  their  summary  judgment  motion  with  expert \nevidence  from  Drs.  Austin,  Chaimowitz,  Grassian,  Haney,  Rivera,  and  from  Professors  Jackson \n)\nl\nand  Mendez.  The  Federal  Government  supported  their  defence  of the  summary judgment  motion  i\nl\nL\nn\nwith  expert  evidence  from  Drs.  Glancy,  Livingston,  and  Morgan.  a\nC\n(\n \n[178]  I  find  as  a  fact  that  all  of the  experts  are  qualified  to  provide  expert  evidence  and  they  all  8\n8\n8\nprovided  some  relevant  and  informative  evidence.  I  am  not  persuaded  by  the  arguments  1\n \nrespectively  made  that  Dr.  Glancy,  Dr.  Haney,  and  Professor  Jackson  should  be  disqualified  C\nS\nbecause  of partisanship.  NO\n \n9\n[179]  However,  I  place  very  little  weight  on  Dr.  Glancy’s  review  and  analysis  of the  academic  1\n0\n2\nliterature  or  on  his  opinion  about  the  psychiatric  effects  of  solitary  confinement.  His  review  of \nthe  literature  was  unreliable  and  methodologically  unsound,  and  the  evidence  of Messrs.  Brazeau \nand  Kifts’  experts  persuaded  me  that  Dr.  Glancy’s  opinion  about  the  effects  of  administrative \nsegregation  was  not  sound, \n[180]  Among  other  problems,  Dr.  Glancy  relied  heavily  on  a  research  assistant  who  was  not \ntrained  in  scientific  research,  and  he  relied  on  research  studies  that  were  not  pertinent  or  that  had \nvery  serious  methodological  problems  with  ultimately  unintelligible  data  and  findings.  In  his \nreview,  Dr.  Glancy  relied  on  scientists  who  might  be  taken  to  be  supporters  of  the  use  of \nadministrative  segregation  as  a  therapy  for  some  mental  illness,  which  is  absurd.  Administrative \nsegregation  exacerbates  and  causes  mental  illness  and  is  not  a  cure  for  anything.  Dr.  Glancy’s \nanalysis  of the  academic  literature  was  flawed,  and  he  failed  to  note  the  problems  in  the  studies \nhe  relied  on,  and  in  other respects,  he  misread  the  literature. \n_  [181]  Dr.  Morgan  was  retained  to  give  evidence  about  the  quality  of  psychiatric  care  for \ninmates  in  administrative  segregation,  and  he  was  not  actually  called  to  give  evidence  about  his \nown  research  on  the  effects  of administrative  segregation  or  about  his  own  meta-analysis  of the \nacademic  literature  made  in  a  review  article  entitled  Quantitative  Synthesis  of  the  Effects  of \nAdministrative  Segregation  on  Inmates’  Well Being.“  Nevertheless,  Dr.  Morgan  was  extensively \ncross-examined  on  this  work  and  heavily  critiqued  by  Drs.  Grassian  and  Haney  for  his  review \narticle. \n[182]  The  heavy  criticism  followed,  in  part,  because  Dr.  Glancy  had  relied  on  Dr.  Morgan’s \nstudies  and  so  the  rebuttal  to  Dr.  Glancy  also  involved  a  substantial  refutation  of Dr.  Morgan’s \nmeta-analysis.  Once  again,  for  the  same  reasons  that  I  give  very  little  weight  on  Dr.  Glancy’s \nreview  of  the  academic  literature  or  to  his  opinion  about  the  psychiatric  effects  of  solitary \nconfinement,  I  do  not  give  much  weight  to  Dr.  Morgan’s  meta-analysis  conclusions.  In  cross- \nexamination,  while  Dr.  Morgan  defended  his  research,  he  also  conceded  that  Dr.  Glancy’s \nopinions  derived  from  the  meta-analysis  were  incorrect. \n[183]  Dr.  Haney’s  and  Dr.  Grassian’s  reviews  of  the  academic  literature  were  far  more \npersuasive  as  were  their  opinion  about  the  effects  of  administrative  segregation  on  inmates \ngenerally  and  mentally  ill  inmates  in  particular.  Their  reports  and  conclusions  were  based  on \n  \n*? (2016),  22  Psychology,  Public Policy and Law 439-461. \nVERMILLION  004409 \n  \nM~ ace  T«a  Tae .  fOOPoR OS-RiOPS   oY \nKR  A  A We  PS \n4] \npersonal  extensive  research.  Their  opinions  were  consistent  with  the  academic  literature  and  with \nthe  overwhelming  consensus  positions  of the  professional  organizations  that  have  taken  positions \nabout  the  effects  of  solitary  confinement.  Their  opinions  were  also  consistent  with  the \nexperiential  evidence  of  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kifts’  affiants  who  had  personally  experienced \nadministrative  segregation. \n[184]  However,  even  with  respect  to  Dr.  Glancy  or  Dr.  Morgan,  on  many  issues,  the  opinions  )I\nI\nL\nof  the  rival  experts  were  in  accord  or  not  that  far  apart.  During  the  argument  and  in  the  n\na\nC\ncompeting  factums,  it  was ironic  that  an  opponent’s  experts’  evidence  was  frequently  relied  on  at  (\n \nthe  same  time  as  submissions  were  made  that  the  expert’s  evidence  should  be  rejected.  88\n8\n1\n[185]  As  the  discussion  below  will  reveal,  I  do  not  reject  the  totality  of the  evidence  of any  of   \nC\nS\nthe  witnesses.  However,  some  of the  opinions  expressed  or  parts  of the  opinions  expressed  were  N\nO\nnot  persuasive  and  I  accorded  them  less  weight  or  no  weight. \n \n9\n1\n0\n{186]  It  will  become  apparent  from  the  discussion  below,  what  opinions  I  found  persuasive.  I  2\nforeshadow  to  say  that  it  was  the  opinions  of Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kifts’  expert  witnesses  that \npersuaded  me  about  the  adverse  effects  of  administrative  segregation  on  mentally  ill  inmates \nwho  are  placed  in  administrative  segregation.  For  present  purposes,  I  need  only  add  that  while \nthe  battle  of the  experts  raised  genuine  issues,  none  of them  required  a trial  to  resolve. \nL.  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kifts’  Expert  Evidence. \n1.  Overview \n{187]  As  already  noted  above,  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  supported  their  summary  judgment \nmotion  with  expert  evidence  from  Drs.  Austin,  Chaimowitz,  Grassian,  Haney,  Rivera,  and  from \nProfessors  Jackson  and  Mendez. \n[188]  Messrs.  Brazeau  and  Kift  submitted  that  their  expert  evidence  established  that: \na.  It  is  widely  accepted  by  experts  and  by  reputable  professional  organizations  in  the \nmedical  community  that  mentally  ill  prisoners  should  not  spend  any  time  in \nsolitary  confinement  because  it  is  not  a  therapeutic  setting  and  is  harmful  to  the \ninmates’  mental  health  and  to  their  treatment  for  their  mental  health  problems. \nb.  Mentally  ill  prisoners  are  psychologically  harmed  by  any  time  spent  detained  in \nsolitary  confinement.  Solitary  confinement  denies  the  seriously  mentally  ill  the \ntreatment  they  require,  and  solitary  confinement poses  a particularly  acute  harm  to \nthe  seriously  mentally  ill,  who  comprise  the  class  in  the  immediate  case. \nc.  The  Federal  Government's  policies  and  practices,  including  the  recent  changes  to \nCD  709,  regarding  administrative  segregation  fall  below  the  accepted  standard  for \nthis  type  of  confinement  because  the  Federal  Government  does  not  exclude \nserious  mentally  ill  inmates  from  solitary  confinement. \nd.  The  Federal  Government's  policies  and  practices  regarding  solitary  confinement \nfall  below  the  accepted  standard  because  the  Federal  Government  has  never \nplaced  a  limit  on  the  time  an  individual  can  spend  in  solitary  confinement \ne.

It  aimed  to  supplant  practices  such  as  the  death  penalty \nand  limb  amputations.  The  practice  began  in  the  1820s  in  the  United  States  where  it  was \nbelieved  that  the  isolation  of prisoners  would  aid  in  their  rehabilitation.  The  idea  was  that \nthe  prisoners  would  spend  their  entire  day  alone,  mostly  within  the  confines  of their  cells \nand  reflect  on their transgressions. \n[2]  I  take  judicial  notice  of  the  fact  that  Canada’s  history  of  isolating  prisoners \noriginates  with the  Penitentiary Act  of  1834. \n[3]  The  applicant  seeks  a  declaration  that  sections  31-37  of  the  Corrections  and \n  \nConditional  Release  Act,  which  permit  the  Correctional  Service  of Canada  to  remove  an \nVERMILLION  004137 \nPPC©C yRS  eogs   USLT Eb RA baSsaUTL,  RsbPO RPStSb a  eA dOPeTe y  PnPASSP L  GWye E RPA EGAA  DRb eS   OO  ?PL»L  ~  OPAN UETCED T U“ EASRS PE gm R  sSCoHSEbP eOh  LE wov kd \nPage: :  2 \ninmate  from  the  general  population  of  inmates  in  a  penitentiary  for  a  non-disciplinary \nreason  (i.e.  administratively  segregate  an  inmate),  are  invalid  because  they  infringe \nsections  7,  11  (h)  and  12  of the  Charter  of Rights  and Freedoms. \n[4]  The  respondent  presents  isolating  inmates  in  administrative  segregation  as  an \nappropriate  last  resort  for  managing  a  difficult  and  dangerous  prison  population.  The \n)\nl\nrespondent  maintains  that  instances  where  administrative  segregation  may  have  been  i\nL\nn\napplied  in  a  manner  that  violated  an  individual’s  rights  are  cases  of  maladministration  a\nC\n(\nand  do  not  demonstrate  that  the  current  legislative  regime  cannot  be  administered \n \n1\nconstitutionally.  94\n7\n \nC\n[5]  This  application  concerns  only  administrative  segregation.  Administrative  S\nN\nsegregation  is  distinct  from  segregation  for  a  disciplinary  infraction  (i.e.  disciplinary  O\n \n7\nsegregation).  Disciplinary  segregation  is  a  sanction  imposed  at  the  end  of  a  disciplinary  1\n0\n2\nproceeding  for  a  serious  offence.  It  results  from  a  decision  made  by  an  Independent \nChairperson.  It  is  time  limited  and  may  not  exceed  30  days  for  a  single  offence  or  45  days \nfor multiple  offences.

Specifically,  section  31  (2)  provides  that  an  inmate  is  to  2\nbe  released  from  administrative  segregation  at  the  earliest  appropriate  time.  Section  31 \n(3)  provides  that  the  Institutional  Head  can  only  order  an  inmate  into  administrative \nsegregation  if there  is  no  reasonable  alternative.  Section  36  (1)  directs  that  an  inmate  in \nadministrative  segregation  shall  be  visited  at  least  once  every  day  by  a  registered \nhealthcare  professional.  Section  36  (2)  mandates  that  the  Institutional  Head  visit  the \nadministrative  segregation  area  at  least  once  every  day  and  meet  with  inmates  housed \nthere  upon  request.  Finally,  after  an  inmate  is  placed  in  administrative  segregation  a \nSuicide  Risk  must  be  completed. \n[91]  The  evidence  adduced  by  the  respondent  also  recognizes  this  fact.  Specifically, \nthe  respondent  tendered  the  affidavit  evidence  of  Dr.  Robert  Morgan.  Dr.  Morgan  is  a \npsychologist.  He  was  retained  to  provide  expert  evidence  concerning  “the  impact  of \nadministrative  segregation  on  inmates  as  practised  in  Canadian  federal  penitentiaries, \ngenerally  and particularly  those  suffering  from  mental  illness.”  On  cross-examination,  the \napplicant  challenged  Dr.  Morgan’s  evidence  of  the  extent  of  harm  from  administrative \nsegregation,  both  in  terms  of the  extent  of the  harm  compared  to  other  inmate  populations \nand  how  common  it  was  for  inmates  not to  suffer  harm. \n[92]  Dr.  Morgan  accepted  that  the  literature  demonstrated  that  some  inmates  placed  in \nadministrative  segregation  experienced  the  negative  effects  on  their  mental  health \ndescribed  by  the  applicant’s  experts,  which  included  sensory  deprivation,  isolation, \nsleeplessness,  anger,  elevated  levels  of  hopelessness,  the  development  of  previously \nundetected psychiatric  symptoms,  including  depression  and  suicidal  ideation. \n[93]  While  I  do  not  accept  all  of Dr.  Morgan’s  evidence,  I  find  this  part  of his  evidence \nconfirmatory  of the  adverse  effects  of administrative  segregation. \n[94]  Ido  not  accept  Dr.  Morgan’s  evidence  that  some  will  be  harmed,  and  a  significant \nnumber  will  not. \nVERMILLION  004150 \nVV  OLABmOaa e beie UspOuC   hPhgeA PP R L eWGryPToe   E TR  AwAL hDeR~S     OO »PL~ NAO yCenaH e  reya o y PEL Ts~ROO S  Aa  ODNi s P S  x.

I  do  not  rely  on  Dr.  Morgan’s  evidence  further  in  this  regard  and  I \nspecifically  do  not  accept  his  evidence  for  concluding  that  some  inmates  will  experience \nno  serious  permanent  negative  mental  health  effects  from  prolonged  administrative \nsegregation.  Specifically,  his  report  that  administrative  segregation  was  no  more  harmful \nf\nI\nthan  incarceration  in  the  general  prison  population  was  based  on  an  erroneous  conclusion  L\nn\na\nthat  there  was  a  negative  association  between  incarceration  in  the  general  population  and  C\n(\nhealth  outcomes  when  the  opposite  was  correct.   \n1\n9\n4\n7\n[96]  The  harm  is  recognized  not  only  in  the  Corrections  and  Conditional  Release  Act   \nC\nbut  in  International  Standards  and  by  reputable  Canadian  medical  organizations  like  the  S\nN\nO\nCMA  and  the  Registered  Nurses  Association  of  Ontario.  No  nurse  or  doctor  currently \n \n7\nworking  with  segregated  prisoners  in  Canadian  Penitentiaries  testified  that  practice  was  1\n0\n2\nbenign  in  some  or  most  cases. \n[97]  lam  satisfied that there  is  no  serious  question  the  practice  is  harmful. \n[98]  Serious  state  imposed  psychological  stress  constitutes  a  breach  of  security  of the \nperson.  See  Blencoe  v  B.C.  (Human  Rights  Commission)  [2000]  2  8.C.R.  307  at para. 56. \n[99]  Obviously,  the  imposition  of  administrative  segregation  is  state  imposed  and  the \npsychological  harm  that  can  result  from  administrative  segregation  is  serious  which  leads \nto  the  conclusion that  the  induced  stress  is  serious. \n[100]  The  stress  capable  of producing  the  documented  negative  effects  described  in  the  | \nevidence,  therefore,  exceeds  the  “ordinary  stresses  and  anxieties  that  a  person  of \nreasonable  sensibility  would  suffer  as  a  result  of government  action”.  See  Lamer  C.J,  in \nNew Brunswick  (Minister  of Health  and  Community Services)  v  G.  (J)  [1999]  3  S.C.R.  46 \nat para.59.  . \n[101]  Accordingly,  suffering  this  level of psychological  stress  infringes  the  security  of \nthe  person  of  the  inmate  and  the  issue  again  becomes  whether  this  infringement  is  in \naccordance  with  the  principles  of fundamental justice. \nThe  principles  of  fundamental  justice  require  an  independent  review  of  the  decision  to \nsegregate \n[102]  The  principles  of  fundamental  justice  are  the  basic  principles  of  our  judicial \nsystem  and  legal  process.  They  are  found  in  the  basic  tenets  of  our  legal  system.  See \nReference  Re  Section  94  (2)  of the  Motor  Vehicle Act,  [1985]  2  S.C.R.  486.  paras.  28-40. \n[103]  The  principles  of fundamental justice  are  not  defined  in  the  abstract.  They  must  be \ninterpreted  in  the  context  of the  alleged  infringement.  See  Chiarelli  v  Canada  (M.  E.

These  changes,  if they  occur,  will  affect  the  maximum  time  that \na  person  should  spend  in  segregated  confinement  and  would  reflect  a  genuine  attempt  to \napply  section  87  (a)  in  a  way  that  leads  to  a  balancing  of the  security  needs  of employees \nand  inmates  in  a  penitentiary  with  the  psychological  harm  to  the  administratively \nsegregated  inmates. \n)\nl\n[235]  ‘The  respondent  relied  on  a  study  by  Dr.  Ivan  Zinger  in  2001  which  concluded  that  i\nL\nn\n-  there  was  no  evidence  that  over  a  period  of 60  days  the  mental  health and  psychological  a\nC\n(\nfunctioning  of segregated  offenders  significantly  deteriorated.  I  am  not  prepared  to  accept \n \n1\nthis  conclusion  because  many  of the  inmates  studied  had  been  segregated  on  more  than  49\n7\none  occasion  prior  to  being  examined  and  it  is  impossible  to  say  that  the  damage  had  not   \nC\nalready  been  done.  If  those  inmates  are  removed,  the  sample  size  is  small.  Also,  Dr.  NS\nO\nZinger  states  at  page  64  in  the  conclusion:  “...  the  findings  of this  study  should  not  be \n \n7\nused  to  legitimize  the  practice  of administrative  segregation”.  01\n2\n-  [236]  The  respondent  also  relied  on  the  O’Keefe  study  completed  in  Colorado  in  2010.  I \ndo  not  accept  that  this  study  is  valid  in  Canada  because  the  system  of  administrative | \nsegregation  is  different  in  Canada.  Specifically,  at  page  11  of  the  study  the  authors \ndescribe  the  incentive-based  Colorado  program.  This  program  has  three  quality-of-life \nlevels.  Each  level  brings  with  it  more  privileges  which  must  be  earned  through \nappropriate  behaviour.  At  quality-of-life  level  3,  inmates  in  administrative  segregation \nare  allowed  four  three-hour  visits  per  month,  four  20-minute  phone  sessions,  $25  worth \nof canteen  per  week  and  the  opportunity  to  work  as a  porter  or  barber  in  the  institution. \n[237]  This  is  not  comparable  to  the  Canadian  system. \n[238]  Dr.  Kelly  Hannah-Moffatt  described  the  following  effects  of  prolonged \nsegregation  in  the  literature: \ne  Prisoners  experience  the  isolated  conditions  of  solitary  confinement,  sensory \ndeprivation,  and  constant  'lock  down’  status  very  negatively  and  stressfully  (Toch, \n1992); \ne  Prisoners  leave  supermax  ‘deeply  traumatized'  and  ‘socially  disabled’  (Lowen  and \nIsaccs,  2012);  _  | \ne  Segregated  prisoners  who  are  already  experiencing  mental  health  problems,  have  a \nhistory  of  suicide  attempts,  and  have  high  levels  of  hopelessness,  are  more  likely  to \nreport  suicidal  ideation  (Bonner,  2006;  Kuper,  2006);  . \ne  Long-term  segregation  may  lead  to  the  development  of  previously  undetected \npsychiatric  symptoms  (Kupers,  2006); \ne  Segregation  appears  to  be  a  significant  risk  factor  for  the  development  of psychiatric \nsymptoms  including  depressioann:d   suicidal  ideation  (Bonner,  2006),  as  well  as \nVERMILLION  004169 \nCITATION:  Corporation  of the  Canadian  Civil  Liberties  Association  v.

It  is  called  “administrative  segregation”  and  is  permitted  to \nmaintain  safety  and  security  or  to  conduct  investigations.  The  appellant,  the \nCanadian  Civil  Liberties  Association  (“CCLA’,  submits  that  ss.  31-37  of  the \nCorrections  and  Conditional  Release  Act,  S.C,  1992,  c.  20  (the  “Act’),  the \nlegislative  provisions  authorizing  administrative  segregation,  are  unconstitutional. \n‘{2]  The  CCLA  was  partially  successful  in  the  Superior  Court.  The  application \njudge  found  that  the  legislation  authorizing  administrative  segregation  violates  s.  7 \nof  the  Canadian  Charter  of Rights  and  Freedoms  because  it  does  not  provide  for \nan  independent  review  of  the  decision  to  place  an  inmate  in  administrative \nsegregation.  The  respondent,  the  Attorney  General  of  Canada  (\"AGC\"),  does  not \n \nchallenge  this  finding  on  appeal. \n[3]  «  On  appeal,  the  CCLA  argues  that  ss.  31-37  of  the  Act  violate  s.  12  and  s. \n11(h)  of the  Charter.  The  CCLA  also  raises  a  new  s.  7  argument.  The  CCLA seeks \n‘a  broader  declaration  from  this  court  banning  the  practice  entirely  for  certain \ninmates  (those  aged  18-21,  those  with  mental  illness,  and  those  placed  in \nsegregation  for their  own  protection)  and  otherwise  placing  a  cap  of  15  consecutive \ndays  on  administrative  segregation  for  all  inmates. \n[4]  As  |  will  explain,  |  accept  the  conclusions  of  the  application  judge  with \nrespect  to  inmates  aged  18-21,  those  with  mental  illness,  and  those  placed  in \nVERMILLION  004074 \nfAf rsaaGecSea ts So  tt ATfT.

However,  prolonged  administrative \nsegregation  of  any  inmate,  which  is  segregation  for  more  than  15  consecutive \ndays,  does  not  survive  constitutional  scrutiny  under  s.  12. \n[5]  1  reach  this  conclusion  because  prolonged  administrative  segregation \ncauses  foreseeable  and  expected  harm  which  may  be  permanent  and  which \n  \ncannot  be  detected  through  monitoring  until  it  has  already  occurred.  Legislative \nsafeguards  are  inadequate  to  avoid  the  risk  of  harm.  In  my  view,  this  outrages \nstandards  of decency  and  amounts  to  cruel  and  unusual  treatment.  |  conclude  that \nthe  provisions  in  the  Act  authorizing  prolonged  administrative  segregation  infringe \ns.  12  and  the  infringement  cannot  be  justified  under  s.  1.  It  follows  that  a  remedy \nunder  s.  52(1)  of  the  Constitution  Act,  1982  is  appropriate. \n[6].  To  demonstrate  my  conclusions,  |  describe  administrative  segregation, \noutline  the  evidence  concerning  the  harm  caused  and  the  inability  of  monitoring  or \nother  legislative  safeguards  to  prevent  the  risk  of  harm.  |  explain  why  ss.  31-37  of \nthe  Act  infringe  s.  12  of  the  Charter,  and  why the  infringement  cannot  be  justified \nunder  s.  1.  |  also  briefly  address  the  CCLA’s  s.11(h)  ands.  7  arguments. \nBACKGROUND \nThe  legislative  scheme \n \n“> \n. \n[7]  The  Corrections  and  Conditional  Release  Act  permits  the  Correctiona \nService  of  Canada  (“CSC”)  to  place  an  inmate  in  administrative  segregation.

In  other  words,  the  person  is  not  removed  or \nsupported  until  it  is  obvious  that  they  have  been  harmed. \n[Emphasis  added.] \n[80]  This  is  consistent  with  the  evidence  of  Dr.  Robert  Morgan,  a  psychologist \nand  academic  from  Texas  whose  testimony  was  relied  on  by  the  AGC.  He \nindicated  that  monitoring  detects  harm  that  has  already  occurred.  He  said  that \n“conducting  daily  health  care  visits,  that  include  verbal  interaction  with \ninmates...provides  a  high  likelihood  of  detecting  inmates  that  are  suffering \nimpaired  or  decompensated  mental  health  functioning’. \n[81]  In  conclusion,  the  application  judge’s  error  in  relying  on  the  effectiveness  of \nmonitoring  undermines  his  conclusion  that  ss.  31-37  do  not  breach  s.  12  insofar   \nas  they  permit  prolonged  segregation. \n(iii)  Proper comparator \n[82]  Section  12,  which  prohibits  cruel  and  unusual  treatment  and  punishment, \ninvolves  a  comparative  approach.  In  my  view,  the  application  judge  also  erred  in \nhis  s.  12  analysis  in  applying  the  wrong  comparative  approach. \n[83]  In  this  case,  the  application  judge  did  not  determine  whether  administrative \nsegregation  should  be  considered  treatment  or  punishment.  Nor did  he  need  to. \nAs  set  out  below,  little  in  this  case  turns  on  the  distinction. \n  \nVERMILLION  004103 \nPage:  51 \nthe  application  judge’s  vetting  of  issues  and  reasoned  analysis,  which  are \nfundamental  premises  of the  appeal  process:  see  Roach,  at  para.  8. \nCONCLUSION \n[150]  |  would  allow  the  appeal  in  part  and  declare  that  administrative  segregation \nlonger  than  15  consecutive  days  as  provided  for  in  ss.  31-37  of  the  Corrections \nand  Conditional Release  Act violates  s.  12  of the  Charter,  cannot  be justified  under \ns.  1,  and  are  of  no  force  and  effect  to  the  extent  of  the  violation.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES \nA.  All grievance procedures, tort claim notices, and administrative remedies have been \ntimely filed and properly exhausted. \nSECTION III. CLAIMS AND SUPPORTING FACTS \nA.  FACTS: \n1.  On Sunday, July 12,2009, three (3) men with whom Vermillion was circumstantially \n2 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 3 of 44 PageID #: 475\nassociated escaped from the Indiana State Prison, (hereinafter ISP), which is located in \nMichigan City, Indiana. And, because said escape was from the same housing unit in \nwhich all Indiana Death Row Inmates are housed, authorities from numerous \ninvestigative agency converged upon the ISP, including those from the Internal Affairs \nDivision of the IDOC Central Office, which is located in Indianapolis, Indiana. \n2.  By July 22, 2009, all three men were apprehended without incident. However, because \nof their continuing investigation of the matter, at approximately 8:40AM on \nWednesday, July 29,2009, Vermillion was taken to the ISP's office of Internal Affairs, \nwhere he then sat in the outer-office for approximately a half an hour waiting his turn \nto be questioned. \n3.  Thereafter, at approximately 9:15AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Internal \nAffairs Investigators Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan introduced \nthemselves; advised that all three were digitally-recording the conversation; and \ninformed Vermillion that they believed he was involved in said escape, and some \ntrafficking related thereto. \n4.  At approximately 9:22AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Willard Plank, \nDawn Buss, and Charles Whelan informed Vermillion that for his alleged involvement \nin said offense(s), they were going to have criminal charges filed against him. \n5.  As such, at approximately 9:25AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Vermillion \nthen exercised his constitutionally protected right to terminate their questioning of \nhim so that hls answers to their questions could not thereafter be used to incriminate \nhim in the criminal action they said they were going to file. \n3 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 4 of 44 PageID #: 476\n6.  Immediately subsequent to his having engaged in the constitutionally protected \nactivity of terminating the defendants' questioning of him, Vermillion was then \npunished -retaliated against- which said punishment/ retaliation, from start to finish, \nspanned the course of the next fifty (50) months, (1,513 days), as follows: \n7.  At 9:33AM on the same Wednesday, July 29, 2009, Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, and \nCharles Whelan had Vermillion escorted from their office and placed in IDU, which is \nthe facility's punitive segregation unit. \n8.  On July 31, 2009, despite there being absolutely no possibility of it being true, Internal \nAffairs Investigator Ralph Carrasco prepared a Conduct Report, thereby charging that \nVermillion had engaged in the offense of \"trafficking\" with ISP Counselor \"Don \nBates\" in \"ICH\"1 at \"9:30AM\" on \"July 29, 2009.\" \n9.  On August 4, 2009, while \"screening\" him for said trafficking offense, ISP Screening \nOfficer Dawn Walker advised Vermillion that statements from Willard Plank, Dawn \nBuss, Charles Whelan, Karen Sabinski and Kevin Springfield would enable him to \nsubstantiate his whereabouts at the time of the alleged misconduct, and further \nadvised that she would assist him with the acquisition of the same. \n10.  On or about August 6, 2009, however, Ms. Walker sent Vermillion's proposed \nwitnesses \"blank\" witness statement forms, and provided them with absolutely no \nindication of the testimony he expected of them. \n11.  On or about the same August 6, 2009, ISP DHB Chairman Bessie Leonard advised \nICH is the abbreviation for I-Cellhouse, which was the Honor Housing Unit in which Vermillion \nresided until 8:40AM on Wednesday, July 29, 2009. \n4 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 5 of 44 PageID #: 477\nVermillion that his hearing for said trafficking charge would not occur until \napproximately seven (7) days after the facility was no longer on lockdown. \n12.  On August 12, 2009, however, (with the facility still on lockdown), in proceedings in \nwhich he was denied sufficient written notice of the charge; denied the opportunity to \ncall witnesses and present evidence; denied consideration of exculpatory evidence; \ndenied the requisite indicia of reliability for the utilization of confidential sources; \ndenied a decision properly supported by \"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that \nhe clearly could not have been trafficking with Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the \nsame time he was being interrogated by Internal Affairs, ISP DHB Chairman Bessie· \nLeonard found Vermillion guilty as charged. \n13.  On the same August 12, 2009, despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the maximum \nallowable sanction, Ms. Leonard sentenced Vermillion to one (1) year in disciplinary \nsegregation; took thirty (30) days of his earned good time credit; and demoted him \nfrom Credit Earning Class I to Credit Earning Class II. \n14.  On the same August 12, 2009, within approximately one (1) hour of the above-stated \npretextual guilty adjudication and sanctioning, and without any notice, reason, or \nopportunity for rebuttal, Vermillion was escorted to the ISP's North Gate, where the \ngood majority of his personal effects and a running dark-blue Chrysler minivan were \nwaiting to whisk him away to the WCU Super Max facility. \n15.  On or about the same August 12, 2009, WCU Case Counselor Sally Nowatzke and \nWCU Director of Operations Gary Brennan then falsified information and \ndocumentation to increase Vermillion's Security Classification Designation so that he \n5 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 6 of 44 PageID #: 478\ncould be housed at said Super Max facility. \n16.  On the same August 12,2009, Vermillion was then committed to the WCU Housing \nUnit, (i.e. C Pod, a.k.a. \"The Loony Bin\"), wherein all of the psychotic, out-of-control, \nand unmanageable worst-of-the-worst are kept in\" cold-storage\" to induce dormancy. \n17.  And, for the next three and a half (31/z) years, Vermillion was then subjected to \ncomplete isolation in a solid concrete tomb with a solid steel door for 23-24 hours a \nday; no direct contact or interaction with others; extreme cold; constant strobe \nlighting; cell-flooding; Mace fumes; people threatening to, and in fact actually \ncommitting suicide; no actual \"recreation;\" no telephone use (for 21/z years); no work, \nincome, or educational opportunities; no religious services; no hot water; cold meals; \nregular cell ransacking; and humiliating strip-searches. \n18.  In the meantime, on September 15, 2009, despite his knowledge that the above \ndescribed \"trafficking offense\" of July 29, 2009, could not have occurred and that the \ndisciplinary proceedings of August 12, 2009, were a sham and constitutionally infirm, \nSuperintendent Mark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively \napproved, condoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n19.  On September 16, 2009, despite having been called upon to remedy Vermillion's illegal \nretaliatory segregation, WCU Classification Director Larry Warg instead approved, \ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n20.  On October 8, 2009, despite his knowledge that the above-described disciplinary \nproceedings of August 12, 2009, were constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing \nAuthority Charles Penfold affirmed the same on appeal, thereby effectively \n6 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 7 of 44 PageID #: 479\napproving, condoning, and turning a blind eye to it. \n21.  On October 16, 2009, ISP Administrative Assistant Howard Morton intercepted \nVermillion's \"Certified Mail\" containing proposed Affidavits for his witnesses, and \nthereafter advised: \" ... staff will not be signing any affidavits for you.\" \n22.  On October 22,2009, without any notice, reason, or opportunity for rebuttal, IDOC \nDeputy Director of Operations Brett Mize relegated Vermillion to Department-Wide \nAdministrative Segregation. \n23.  On the same October 22,2009, WCU Property Officer Craig Travis confiscated all of \nVermillion's \"PersonalProperty Inventory Lists/' and WCF Property Officers \nErnestine Cole and Celia Bobson then \"lost\" approximately 99.9% of his personal \nbelongings. (See Tort Notice WCC 2009-101, attached hereto, here incorporated by \nreference, and made a part hereof.) \n24.  On November 10,2009, despite his knowledge of, and participation in Vermillion's \nretaliatory and constitutionally infirm classification and segregation, Superintendent \nMark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n25.  On four (4) different occasions between November 10, and December 17,2009, despite \nhis knowledge of, and participation in Vermillion's retaliatory segregation, IDOC \nDeputy Director of Operations Brett Mize refused to acknowledge and/ or act on \nVermillion's repeated requests for relief. \n26.  On January 20, 2010, in furtherance of their retaliatory aggression, WCU Director of \nOperations Gary Brennan ordered the confiscation and destruction of Vermillion's \n7 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 8 of 44 PageID #: 480\ntelevision. (See Tort Notice WCC 16-2010, attached hereto, here incorporated by \nreference, and made a part hereof.) \n27.  On January 30, 2010, in furtherance of their retaliatory aggression, WCU Director of \nOperations Gary Brennan ordered the ransacking of Vermillion's cell and destruction \nof his personal effects. (See Tort Notice WCC 18-2010, attached hereto, here \nincorporated by reference, and made a part hereof.) \n28.  On April7, 2010, in an effort to obtain relief from Mr. Penfold's deliberately flawed \nfinal review decision of October 8, 2009, Vermillion filed his Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:10-CV-119-PPS. \n29.  On August 31, 2010, however, despite his prior conclusion that there were no \nprocedural defects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings of August 12, \n2009, that would entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with attorney \nLinda Leonard, Mr. Penfold issued an unsolicited\" second opinion\" thereby vacating \nthe disciplinary conviction of August 12, 2009, and remanded the matter to the WCU \nDHB with instructions to conduct a re-hearing. \n30.  On September 3, 2010, acting on Mr. Penfold's re-hearing instructions, WCU Screening \nOfficer David Dombrowsky refused to document the names and proposed testimony \nof Vermillion's witnesses, and thereafter failed to apprise them of the testimony \nVermillion expected of them. \n31.  On September 7, 2010, despite his knowledge of the above-stated acts of Mr. \nDombrowsky and others, and despite Vermillion's repeated requests for his \nintervention, WCU Case Manager Doug Barnes instead effectively approved, \n8 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 9 of 44 PageID #: 481\ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n32.  On the same September 7, 2010, in proceedings in which Vermillion was denied \nsufficient written notice of the charge; denied the opportunity to call witnesses and \npresent evidence; denied consideration of exculpatory evidence; denied the requisite \nindicia of reliability for the utilization of confidential sources; denied a decision \nproperly supported by \"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that he clearly could not \nhave been trafficking with Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the same time he was \nbeing interrogated by Internal Affairs, WCU DHB Chairman Robert Johnson again \nfound Vermillion guilty as charged. \n33.  On the same September 7, 2010, despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the maximum \nallowable sanction, and despite the fact that he had already been segregated for \nfourteen (14) months, Mr. Johnson once again sentenced Vermillion to one (1) year of \ndisciplinary segregation; took thirty (30) days of his earned good time credit; and \ndemoted him from Credit Earning Class I to Credit Earning Class II. \n34.  On September 29, 2010, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Penfold, attorney Linda \nLeonard filed a Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas corpus action under \nCause No. 3:10-CV-119-PPS to be dismissed. \n35.  On October 11, 2010, despite his knowledge of the above-stated acts of Mr. Johnson \nand others, and despite Vermillion's request for his intervention, WCU Assistant \nDirector of Operations David Leonard instead effectively approved, condoned, and \nturned a blind eye to it. \n36.  On February 4, 2011 despite his knowledge that the alleged trafficking offense of July \n9 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 10 of 44 PageID #: 482\n29,2009, could not have occurred and that the \"second round\" of disciplinary \nproceedings were also a sham and constitutionally infirm, Superintendent Mark \nLevenhagen, by again affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n37.  On February 23, 2011, despite his knowledge that the disciplinary proceedings of \nSeptember 7, 2010, were also constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing Authority \nCharles Penfold, by again affirming the same on appeal, again approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n38.  On March 23,2011, in an effort to obtain relief from Mr. Penfold's deliberately flawed \nfinal review decision of February 23, 2011, Vermillion filed his Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:11-CV-123-TLS. \n39.  On June 27, 2011, however, despite his prior conclusion that there were no procedural \ndefects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings of September 7, 2010, that \nwould entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with attorney Stephanie \nRothenberg, Mr. Penfold issued another unsolicited\" second opinion\" thereby \nvacating the disciplinary conviction of September 7, 2010, and remanded the matter to \nthe WCU DHB with instructions to conduct another re-hearing. \n40.  On July 5, 2011, acting on Mr. Penfold's re-hearing instructions, WCU Screening \nOfficer Ms. C. Reis failed to apprise Vermillion's witnesses of what he expected of \nthem, and thereafter failed to secure statements from them. \n41.  On July 12, 2011, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Penfold, attorney Stephanie \nRothenberg filed another Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas corpus action \n10 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 11 of 44 PageID #: 483\nunder Cause No. 3:11-CV-123-TLS to be dismissed. \n42.  On July 27, 2011, in proceedings in which Vermillion was denied sufficient written \nnotice of the charge; denied the opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence; \ndenied consideration of exculpatory evidence; denied the requisite indicia of reliability \nfor the utilization of confidential sources; denied a decision properly supported by \n\"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that he clearly could not have been trafficking \nwith Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the same time he was being interrogated by \nInternal Affairs, WCU DHB Chairpersons B. Spencer and Pamela Antisdel again found \nVermillion guilty as charged. \n43.  On the same July 27, 2011, despite the fact that Vermillion had already been \nsegregated for two (2) years, and despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the \nmaximum amount of\" good time\" that could be taken, Pamela Antisdel took sixty (60) \ndays of his earned good time credit and again demoted Vermillion from Credit \nEarning Class I to Credit Earning Class II .. \n44.  On September 28, 2011, despite his knowledge that the alleged trafficking offense of \nJuly 29,2009, did not, and could not have occurred, and that the \"third round\" of \ndisciplinary proceedings were also a sham and constitutionally infirm, Superintendent \nMark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, again effectively approved, \ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n45.  On January 12, 2012, despite his knowledge that the disciplinary proceedings of July \n27, 2011, were constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing Authority Michael \nBarnes, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, and turned \n11 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 12 of 44 PageID #: 484\na blind eye to it. \n46.  On March 29, 2012, in an effort to obtain relief from Michael Barnes' deliberately \nflawed final review decision of January 12, 2012, Vermillion filed his Petition for a \nWrit of Habeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:12-CV-150-PPS. \n47.  On November 14,2013, however, despite Michael Barnes' previous conclusion that \nthere were no procedural defects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings \nof July 27, 2011, that would entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with \nattorney Stephanie Rothenberg, Executive Director of IDOC Legal Services Robert \nBugher issued another unsolicited \"second opinion\" thereby vacating the disciplinary \nconviction of July 27, 2011, and remanded the matter to the ISR DHB with instructions \nto conduct yet another re-hearing. \n48.  On the same November 14, 2013, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Bugher, attorney \nStephanie Rothenberg filed yet another Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas \ncorpus action under Cause No. 3:12-CV-150-PPS to be dismissed. \n49.  On February 13, 2014, however, instead of conducting the instructed third rehearing of \nthis same, at the time, four and a half (41/z) year old charge, IDOC authorities, with the \nassistance of Indiana State Reformatory officials, dismissed said pretextual trafficking \ncharge of July 29,2009, altogether, and ordered the entire matter expunged from \nVermillion's record. \n50.  And finally, because most of the above-stated 1,513 days of retaliatory segregation \nwere spent lying on an ergonomically incorrect mat, painfully cold, and without \naccess to a chair, Vermillion now suffers potentially permanent spinal problems. \n12 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 13 of 44 PageID #: 485\nB.

VERMILLION,  )\n  )\nPlaintiff,  )\n  )\nv.  ) No. 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB\n  )\nMARK E. LEVENHAGEN,  )\nSALLY NOWATZKE,  )\nBRETT MIZE,  )\nGARY BRENNAN,  )\n  )\nDefendants. )\n \n \nEntry Denying Motion for Leave to File Fourth Amended Complaint \n \nNow before the court is Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. \nDkt [273]. The proposed Amended Complaint seeks to do two things: 1) add claims against \nDouglas Barnes; and 2) amend or clarify the scope of the due process claims.  Defendants’ motion \nfor leave to file a surreply, dkt [291], is granted. The motion to amend is now fully briefed. \nThe motion to amend is necessarily brought under Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). “It instructs courts to ‘freely give leave when justice so \nrequires,’ and thus district courts should not deny leave absent a ‘good reason’—such as futility, \nundue delay, prejudice, or bad faith.” Kreg Therapeutics, Inc. v. VitalGo, Inc., 919 F.3d 405, 417 \n(7th Cir. 2019).  \nThe motion to amend is denied because it is untimely and unduly prejudicial to Defendants. \nThe deadline to file the Third Amended Complaint in this action was May 15, 2015. See dkt. 92. \nOn June 1, 2016, the parties were instructed that further amendments to the complaint were not \nanticipated. Dkt. 146. Plaintiff argues, however, that the amendments are timely because counsel \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 294   Filed 04/26/19   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 1795\nwas recently appointed to assist the otherwise indigent, pro se, prisoner plaintiff. This court agrees \nthat court-recruited counsel has acted with diligence and that it is difficult to litigate pro se. \nHowever, the appointment of counsel does not negate the fact that this action was originally filed \non July 12, 2011, and that the Defendants have actively litigated the claims raised in the Third \nAmended complaint. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment was granted in part and denied \nin part on May 22, 2018. Following summary judgment there are only two claims remaining for \nresolution in this nearly 8-year-old case: \nWhether Mark Levenhagen, Sally Nowatzke, Brett Mize and Gary Brennan violated \nVermillion’s Eighth Amendment rights through his placement in the Westville Control \nUnit for 1,513 days. \n \nWhether  Mark  Levenhagen  and  Brett  Mize  transferred  Vermillion  from  the  ISP  to \ndepartment-wide administrative segregation at the Westville Control Unit in violation of \nVermillion’s due process rights. \n \nDkt. 214 at 27. \nI.   Proposed Addition of Defendant Barnes \nPlaintiff seeks to add claims against Douglas Barnes. These claims would necessarily be \nbrought against him in his individual capacity. This action was transferred to this Court following \nthe Seventh Circuit’s Mandate entered on April 6, 2016. That Mandate specifically vacated the \nNorthern District of Indiana’s Judgment insofar as it dismisses any claim against defendants \nLevenhagen, Morton, Brennan, Mize, Nowatzke, Plank, Buss, Whelan, and Carrasco. Mr. Barnes \nwas not named in the Mandate and to attempt to bring him into this case more than three years \nafter the Mandate would be prejudicial and cause undue delay. \nII.  Proposed Addition of Due Process Claims  \nThe Motion to Amend the Complaint to include a claim against Defendants Brennan and \nNowatzke for their ongoing failure to afford Plaintiff the periodic reviews of his placement in \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 294   Filed 04/26/19   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 1796\ndepartment-wide administrative segregation is denied. The addition of due process claims against \nBrennan and Nowatzke shall not be permitted because it is unduly prejudicial to these Defendants. \nThe  court’s  screening  order  reflects  that  the  court  did  not  understand  the  Third  Amended \nComplaint, dkts [96] and [97], to include an independent claim based on the failure to provide \nperiodic reviews of Plaintiff’s placement against Defendants Nowatzke and Brennan. Nor were \nthese claims developed prior to the resolution of summary judgment. That said, this ruling should \nnot be read to suggest that the purported denial of periodic reviews by Brennan and Nowatzke is \nirrelevant to the Eighth Amendment claim proceeding against them. Evidence of the denial of \nmeaningful reviews could support the claim that these Defendants were deliberately indifferent to \nPlaintiff’s conditions or confinement.  \nThe Court understands the due process claim proceeding in this case against Defendants \nLevenhagen and Mize to encompass the claim that Plaintiff was denied meaningful, periodic review \nof his prolonged isolation. Accordingly, no amendment as to these two Defendants is necessary.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe motion to amend, dkt [273], is denied. This ruling reflects the court’s need to continue \nto narrow the issues first raised in the Northern District of Indiana on July 12, 2011, and \nstreamlined in the Seventh Circuit’s Mandate. Given the substantial passage of time, Plaintiff must \nlive with the litigation decisions he made years ago prior to the recruitment of counsel. The due \nprocess claims proceeding in this case against Defendants Levenhagen and Mize are understood to \nencompass the claim that Plaintiff was denied meaningful, periodic review of his prolonged isolation \nfollowing his transfer to department-wide administrative segregation.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \nDate:     4/26/2019\n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 294   Filed 04/26/19   Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 1797\nDistribution: \n \nJAY F.

Pursuant to this statute, “[a] complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a \nclaim if the allegations, taken as true, show that plaintiff is not entitled to relief.” Jones v. Bock, \n549 U.S. 199, 215 (2007). In determining whether the complaint states a claim, the Court applies \nthe same standard as when addressing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6). See Lagerstrom v. Kingston, 463 F.3d 621, 624 (7th Cir. 2006). To survive dismissal \nunder federal pleading standards, \n[the] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the \nplaintiff  pleads  factual  content  that  allows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. \n \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Thus, a “plaintiff must do better than putting a few \nwords on paper that, in the hands of an imaginative reader, might suggest that something has \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 97   Filed 05/22/15   Page 2 of 5 PageID #: 518\nhappened to [him] that might be redressed by the law.” Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., 614 F.3d 400, \n403 (7th Cir. 2010) (emphasis in original).  \n  The third amended complaint names defendants Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles \nWhelan, Ralph Carrasco, Mark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Howard Morton, Sally Nowatzke, Gary \nBrennan and the Indiana Department of Correction as defendants. The clerk is directed to add \nWillard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, and Ralph Carrasco as defendants on the docket. The \nother defendants have already appeared by counsel in this action.1 \nI.  Claims Which Shall Proceed \n  The following claims shall proceed as submitted: \n  1.  Vermillion  claims  that  Willard  Plank,  Dawn  Buss,  Charles  Whelan,  Ralph \nCarrasco, Mark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Howard Morton, Sally Nowatzke, and Gary Brennan \nretaliated against him for refusing to answer questions about escaped prisoners. Specifically, Mr. \nVermillion claims that his placement in punitive segregation at Indiana State Prison (“ISP”), his \ntransfer to the Maximum Control Segregation Unit at Westville Correctional Facility, and his \nconfinement in segregation were punishments aimed at retaliating against him because he asserted \nhis right to silence. \n2.  Vermillion  claims  that  Willard  Plank,  Dawn  Buss,  Charles  Whelan,  Ralph \nCarrasco, Mark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Howard Morton, Sally Nowatzke, and Gary Brennan \nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment by placing him \n                                                 \n1 The plaintiff’s motion to amend the title of this case is granted to the extent that Willard Plank will be \nadded as a defendant on the docket. The motion is denied to the extent that the plaintiff requests that this \naction always be referred to as Jay F. Vermillion v. Willard Plank, et al. The reason for this ruling is that \nwhen this case was transferred Mark E. Levenhagen was listed as the first named defendant.  The plaintiff’s \nsuggestion that Willard Plank’s name should be first listed because he is the “ringleader” is not persuasive. \nThe order in which the defendants are listed in the caption does not reflect culpability or level or \nresponsibility.  \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 97   Filed 05/22/15   Page 3 of 5 PageID #: 519\nat the Westville Control Unit Super Max Facility and leaving him in solitary confinement for 1,513 \ndays. \n  3.  Vermillion  claims  that  Willard  Plank,  Dawn  Buss,  Charles  Whelan,  Ralph \nCarrasco, Mark Levenhagen, and Brett Mize transferred him from the Indiana State Prison (“ISP”) \nto department-wide administrative segregation at the Westville Correctional Facility (“Westville”) \nin violation of his due process rights. \n  4.   Vermillion claims that Howard Morton confiscated Vermillion’s certified legal \ncorrespondence in violation of his due process and First Amendment rights. \nII.  Dismissal of Certain Claims \n  The following claims shall be dismissed.   \n  1.   The plaintiff lists as a separate claim that these same defendants conspired to \nretaliate against him.  This claim, however, adds nothing and is dismissed because all of the \ndefendants “are state actors, and thus amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, by virtue of their \noffices.” Logan v. Wilkins, 644 F.3d 577, 583 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Hoskins v. Poelstra, 320 F.3d \n761, 764 (7th Cir. 2003). The Seventh Circuit has explained: \nWe need not conduct a separate analysis of the conspiracy claim outside of our \ntreatment  of  Turley’s  Eighth  Amendment  claims.  As  we  noted  in  Fairley  v. \nAndrews, 578 F.3d 518, 526 (7th Cir. 2009), the function of a conspiracy claim \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) is to “permit recovery from a private actor who has \nconspired with state actors.” When, as here, the defendants are all state actors, “a § \n1985(3) claim does not add anything except needless complexity.” Id. \n \nTurley v. Rednour, 2013 WL 3336713, 7 at fn. 2 (7th Cir. 2013).  \n2.  Vermillion’s claim that Sally Nowatzke, and Gary Brennan falsified information \nand documentation to increase Vermillion’s security classification designation in violation of his \ndue process rights is dismissed. The reason for this ruling is that Vermillion’s classification does \nnot in and of itself implicate either a liberty or property interest. See Lucien v. DeTella, 141 F.3d \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 97   Filed 05/22/15   Page 4 of 5 PageID #: 520\n773, 774 (7th Cir. 1998) (“Classifications of inmates implicate neither liberty nor property \ninterests. . . .”) (citing Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995)). As a practical matter, the \nclaims  that  Nowatzke  and  Brennan  retaliated  against  Vermillion  and  subjected  him  to \nunconstitutional  conditions  of  confinement  based  on  their  actions  (including  their  alleged \nfalsification of information) are proceeding such that nothing could be gained by including this \ndue process claim against them.  \n  3.  The Indiana Department of Corrections has been sued under the Indiana Tort \nClaims Act. These state law claims are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for the following \nreasons. First, there are no federal claims alleged against the IDOC which could be the basis for \nthis court’s supplemental jurisdiction. Second, Eleventh Amendment immunity bars suits  in \nfederal court against states and their agencies regardless of the relief sought, whether damages or \ninjunctive relief. Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 58 (1996); Pennhurst State \nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102 (1984). \nIII.  Further Proceedings \nThe clerk is designated, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(3), to issue and serve process on \nthe defendants Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, and Ralph Carrasco in the manner \nspecified by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Process shall consist of the third amended complaint, \napplicable forms and this Entry.  \nCounsel for defendants who have appeared in this action shall have through June 17, \n2015, in which to answer or otherwise respond to the third amended complaint. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n05/19/2015 \nDate:  ___5_/_2_2_/2__0_1_5_______ \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 97   Filed 05/22/15   Page 5 of 5 PageID #: 521\nDistribution: \n \nWillard Plank \nIndiana Department of Correction \nE-334, 302 West Washington Street \nIndianapolis, IN 46204 \n \nDawn Buss \nIndiana Department of Correction \nE-334, 302 West Washington Street \nIndianapolis, IN 46204 \n \nCharles Whelan \nISP IA Investigator \n5501 S. 1100 W. \nWestville, IN  46391 \n \nRalph Carrasco \nISP IA Investigator \nOne Park Row \nMichigan City, IN  46360 \n \nJAY F.

The Court struck his previous two attempts but gave\nleave “to file an amended complaint containing only a single claim or related claims.” (E.g., DE\n8 at 3.) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, this Court must review the merits of a prisoner complaint\nagainst governmental entities or officials and dismiss it if the action is frivolous or malicious,\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 2 of 8 PageID #: 109\nGeorge v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) requires a district court to “question”\nand “reject” any complaint that contains unrelated claims against separate defendants: \nA buckshot complaint that would be rejected if filed by a free person—say, a suit\ncomplaining that A defrauded the plaintiff, B defamed him, C punched him, D failed\nto pay a debt, and E infringed his copyright, all in different transactions—should be\nrejected if filed by a prisoner. George did not make any effort to show that the 24\ndefendants  he  named  had  participated  in  the  same  transaction  or  series  of\ntransactions or that a question of fact is “common to all defendants”.\nGeorge v. Smith, 507 F.3d at 607. \nThe district court did not question George’s decision to join 24 defendants, and\napproximately 50 distinct claims, in a single suit. It should have done so. The\ncontrolling principle appears in Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a): “A party asserting a claim to\nrelief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, may join,\neither as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal, equitable, or\nmaritime, as the party has against an opposing party.” Thus multiple claims against\na single party are fine, but Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with\nunrelated Claim B against Defendant 2. Unrelated claims against different defendants\nbelong in different suits, not only to prevent the sort of morass that this 50-claim,\n24-defendant suit produced but also to ensure that prisoners pay the required filing\nfees . . . .\nId. at 607. \nMore recently, the Seventh Circuit criticized a district court for disregarding George and\nreemphasized its concerns regarding “multi-claim, multi-defendants suits” and their potential as\nan end-run around filing fees under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Owens v. Hinsley, 635\nF.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court held that\n“[c]omplaints like this one . . . should be rejected, George, 507 F.3d at 607, either by severing\nthe action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants.” Id.  \nThe Second Amended Complaint, like its predecessors, would create a multi-claim,\nmulti-defendant suit involving events that occurred at two different facilities over a period of\nyears. Plaintiff seeks to justify its scope by stating that “as a result of [his] having engaged in the\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 3 of 8 PageID #: 110\nconstitutionally protected activity of terminating . . . questioning . . . , the herein-named\ndefendants retaliated against [him], and conspired with one another to retaliate against [him], by\nimplementing the continuous and ongoing chronological series of inextricably related\ntransactions and occurrences . . . .” (DE 14 at 3.)\nRhetorical paragraph A of the Second Amended Complaint asserts that when Willard\nPlank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan questioned Plaintiff on July 29, 2009, about an escape\nby other inmates at the ISP, Plaintiff “exercised [his] constitutionally protected right to terminate\ntheir questioning.” (DE 14 at 3.) He contends that all of the Defendants conspired to retaliate\nagainst from him from July 29, 2009, to the present, for exercising his right to remain silent on\nthis occasion. (DE 14.)\nPlaintiff asserts his conspiracy claim under Section 1985(3), which deals with racially\nmotivated conspiracies to interfere with civil rights. To prevail on this claim, he needs “(1) an\nexpress or implied agreement among defendants to deprive [him] of his . . . constitutional rights\nand (2) actual deprivations of those rights in the form of overt acts in furtherance of the\nagreement.” Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 442 (7th Cir. 1988).(“To state a cause of action\nunder § 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege (1) a conspiracy (2) for the purpose of depriving a person\nor class of persons of the equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under\nthe law; (3) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to the plaintiff’s\nperson or property, or a deprivation of a right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.”\nTraggis v. St. Barbara’s Greek Orthodox Church, 851 F.2d 584, 586-87 (2d Cir. 1988).)\nIn § 1985 cases, vague and conclusory allegations of a conspiracy cannot survive.\nAmundsen v. Chi. Park Dist., 218 F.3d 712, 718 (7th Cir. 2000); Sampson v. Yellow Cab Co., 55\nF. Supp. 2d 867, 869 (N.D.Ill. 1999). Where a complaint asserts that the defendants conspired to\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 4 of 8 PageID #: 111\ndeny the plaintiff his constitutional rights, that claim must be “supported by some factual\nallegations suggesting a ‘meeting of the minds.’” Amundsen, 218 F.3d at 718 (quoting Kunick v.\nRacine County, Wisc., 946 F.2d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir. 1991)). Thus, a § 1985 plaintiff:\nmust satisfy the following: (1) allege the existence of an agreement; (2) if the\nagreement is not overt, “the alleged acts must be sufficient to raise the inference of\nmutual understanding” (i.e., the acts performed by the members of a conspiracy “are\nunlikely to have been undertaken without an agreement”); and (3) “a whiff of the\nalleged conspirators’ assent . . .  must be apparent in the complaint.”\nId. (quoting Kunick, 946 F.2d 1574, 1580 ).\n Plaintiff does not allege a class-based purpose on the part of the defendants, which is an\nelement of a § 1985 claim. See Traggis, 851 F.2d at 586. Moreover, his conspiracy allegations\nare, at best, conclusory. Plaintiff alleges that two deputy attorneys general and more than twenty\nIDOC officials at two separate facilities and the central office conspired to  retaliate against him\nover a period of three years for exercising his right to remain silent on one occasion in an ISP\ninternal investigation that apparently never resulted in a criminal prosecution.\nThe alleged acts in furtherance of the conspiracy “must be sufficient to raise the inference\nof mutual understanding” (i.e., the acts performed by the members of a conspiracy “are unlikely\nto have been undertaken without an agreement”). Amundsen, 218 F.3d at 718. Nothing in the\nSecond Amended Complaint suggests a plausible “whiff of the alleged conspirators’ assent,” and\nnothing in Plaintiff’s submissions suggest that Defendants’ actions were unlikely to have been\nundertaken in the absence of an agreement. The few facts stated in the Second Amended\nComplaint also do not show a class-based animus. Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of the\ninferences to which he is entitled at the pleadings stage, he has not met the pleading\nrequirements for a § 1985(3) complaint. \nMoreover, Plaintiff’s conspiracy and retaliation claims are simply not plausible. The\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 5 of 8 PageID #: 112\n“plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels\nand conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The factual allegations in the complaint “must\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Id. “[W]here the well-pleaded\nfacts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint\nhas alleged – but it has not shown – that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU.S. 662, 679 (2009) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).\nThis Court concludes that it is not plausible that two deputy attorneys general and\ntwenty-one officials at the IDOC central office and two separate facilities conspired to retaliate\nagainst Plaintiff over a period of years for invoking his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to\nanswer questions on a single occasion that did not even result in a criminal prosecution.\nAccordingly, Plaintiff may not use this alleged conspiracy to justify avoiding George’s\nprescription against bringing multiple unrelated claims against separate defendants.\nA prisoner’s multi-claim, multi-defendant complaint “should be rejected, either by\nsevering the action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants.”\nOwens v. Hinsley, 635 F.3d at 952 (citation omitted). Severing Vermillion’s multiple claims into\nseveral separate lawsuits, some of which would state no claim upon which relief could granted,\nwould obligate him to pay many filing fees. Instead, the Court will allow Vermillion to proceed\non one claim in this action, and will dismiss the improperly joined defendants and claims, giving\nhim the option to file additional complaints if he wishes. \nThe centerpiece of the Second Amended Complaint appears to be the claim, found in\nrhetorical paragraph E, where he alleges that on August 12, 2009, “without providing [him] with\nany notice, reason, or opportunity for rebuttal, the defendants transferred [Plaintiff] to the\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 6 of 8 PageID #: 113\nW.C.U. Super Max facility” in violation of Plaintiff’s rights to due process. (DE 14 at 4–5.)  In\nrhetorical paragraph F, Plaintiff alleges that at about the same time, Defendants Brennan and\nNowatzke improperly increased Plaintiff’s security classification so that he could be sent to the\nWCU. (Id. at 5.)\nVermillion alleges that the WCU is a “supermax” facility with harsh and restrictive\nconditions of confinement. “Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly\nrestrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general\nprison population.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 213 (2005). “The Constitution itself does\nnot give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.”\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. at 221–22 (citing Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976)).\nBut where the conditions of special confinement are restrictive enough in relation to those of\nordinary prison life, the circumstances may constitute a state policy or regulation that gives rise\nto a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding transfer. Id. at 223–24.\nIn Wilkinson, the Supreme Court considered whether placement in an Ohio supermax\nfacility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (“OSP”), with many of the same harsh conditions as\nVermillion alleges exist at the WCU, implicated the due-process clause. The Supreme Court\nconcluded that the conditions at the OSP constituted an atypical or significant hardship on\ninmates in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, requiring that prisoners be afforded\ndue process before being transferred there. Id. at 224. On the other hand, in some instances, the\nprocess afforded to inmates before placement in a supermax facility need not be adversarial and\nmay be informal. Id. at 228–29.\nIf placement in the WCU constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship,” then\nVermillion possesses a liberty interest in not being placed in the WCU without due process. With\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 7 of 8 PageID #: 114\nthe benefit of the inferences to which Plaintiff is entitled at the pleadings stage, his allegations\nthat Defendants transferred him to the WCU without providing due process are a plausible\nFourteenth Amendment due-process claim under the standards set forth in Wilkinson v. Austin.\nOn April 24, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related Action. (DE 16.) In it, Plaintiff\nargues the Local Rules mandate transfer of this case to Chief Judge Philip Simon because this\ncase, Plaintiff says, is related to a habeas petition that was before Judge Simon in cause number\n3:10-CV-119. Regardless of whether the two cases “grow[] out of the same transaction or\noccurrence,” so as to qualify as related under Local Rule 40.1(d), subparagraph (e) calls for\ntransfer only where the earlier case remains pending. Judge Simon’s case is no longer pending.\nOn March 16, 2011, Judge Simon dismissed the habeas petition and the Clerk entered judgment\nthe following day. Therefore, this case will not be transferred to Judge Simon at this time.\n  For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b), the Court:\n(1) DENIES Plaintiff leave to proceed against multiple defendants on unrelated claims in\nhis Second Amended Complaint;\n(2) GRANTS Plaintiff leave to proceed against Defendants Mark Levenhagen, Howard\nMorton, Gary Brennan, Bret Mize, and Sally Nowatzke in their individual capacities for\ndamages on his Fourteenth Amendment claim in paragraphs E and F of his Second Amended\nComplaint that they transferred him from the ISP to the WCU without affording him due\nprocess; and \n(3) DISMISSES all other claims and DISMISSES Defendants Willard Plank, Charles\nWhalen, Dawn Buss, Ralph Carrasco, Dawn Walker, Bessie Leonard, Larry Warg, Charles\nPenfold, Craig Travis, Ernestine Cole, Celia Bobson, Linda Leonard, David Dombrowsky, Doug\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 8 of 8 PageID #: 115\nBarnes, Robert Johnson, David Leonard, Stephanie Rothenberg, and the IDOC, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1915A. This dismissal is without prejudice to Plaintiff’s right to bring those claims in\nother actions.\n(4) The Court further ORDERS, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g)(2), that Defendants\nLevenhagen, Morton,  Brennan, Mize and Nowatzke respond to the Second Amended\nComplaint, as provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n(5) DIRECTS the Marshals Service to effect service of process on Defendants\nLevenhagen,  Morton, Brennan, Mize, and Nowatzke on Plaintiff’s behalf, and DIRECTS the\nClerk’s Office to ensure that a copy of this Order is served on them along with the summons and\nSecond Amended Complaint.\nSO ORDERED on May 8, 2012. \n  s/ Joseph S.

Bennett, M.A., \nAdam J. White, M.A. and Jennifer Kelly, Ph.D. \nThe empirically-basedm  odel of malingering and deception \ndescribed by Rogers (1984b) was operationalized using \nMMPI and clinical interview data. Subjects (N=  159) were \npatients committed to an inpatient forensic hospital as \n‘Incompetent to Stand Trial’ or ‘Not Guilty by Reason of \nInsanity’. Inter-rater reliability was acceptable for the 11 \ncriteria used to define response styles. Each subject was \ncategorized into one of five response style groups: ‘Re- \nliable’, ‘Malingering’, ‘Defensive’, ‘Irrelevant’, or ‘Un- \nclassifiable’. Factor analysis of the rating criteria yielded \nfour factors, three of which are comparable to the assigned \ngroups,  providing some validation for  the  constructs \nunderlying these groups. \nThe assessment of patients’ response style is important whenever there may be \nmotivation to respond in a deceptive fashion. Rogers (1984b; 1988) has described \nfour patterns of responding to clinical evaluation. These include: (1) malingering, \na conscious fabrication or gross exaggeration of physical and/or psychological symp- \ntoms, distinguished from factitious disorder in that the motivation for malingering \ngoes beyond the desire to assume the patient role and is understandable in light \nof the individual’s circumstances; (2) defensiveness, a conscious denial or gross mini- \nmization  of  physical  and/or  psychological  symptoms,  distinguished from  ego \ndefenses, which involve intrapsychic processes that distort perception; (3)i rrelevance, \nwhen one does not become engaged in the evaluation process; responses are not \nnecessarily relevant to question content and may be random; and (4)  reliability/ \nhonesty, when a sincere attempt is made to be accurate in responding, with factual \ninaccuracies attributable to poor understanding or misperception. A fifth pattern, \nhybrid responding, has also been noted (Rogers,. 1984a; 1988) as refemng to a \ncombination of these response styles. \nOne of the most frequently employed instruments for assessing response style \nis the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Ziskin, 1981 ).

Heilbrun er al. \nsiveness have been described by  Greene (1988). For malingering, these indices \ninclude the Wiener and Harmon Obvious and Subtle Scales (Wiener, 1948), the \nDissimulation Scale (Gough, 1954), the Lachar and Wrobel critical items (Lachar \n& Wrobel, 1979), the F scale (Dahlstrom et al., 1972), and the Gough F-K Dissi- \nmulation Index (Gough, 1950). Approaches to assessing defensiveness include the \nObvious and Subtle scales, the Positive Malingering (Mp) Scale (Cofer et al., 1949), \nthe critical items, the L and K scales, and the F-K index. \nThe MMPI contains three specific approaches to detecting irrelevant responding. \nThe F scale is one of the most reliable indicators of a random profile (Dahlstrom \net al., 1972; Rogers et al., 1983). When a profile is random, a clinician should \nexpect approximately half of the 64 F scale items to be endorsed. The other two \nindicators are the TR index (Buechley and Ball,  1952; Dahlstrom et al.,  1972; \nGreene, 1979) and the Carelessness (CLS)s cale (Greene, 1978). The TR index \nis a measure of the number of the 16 repeated items that have been endorsed inconsis- \ntently. It has been shown to be a sensitive measure of irrelevant responding, since \n(in contrast to the F scale) it is relatively unaffected by psychopathology (Greene, \n1988). The CLS consists of 12 pairs of items judged to be ‘psychologicallyo pposite’ \nin content, and is a measure of the number of these pairs endorsed in the same \ndirection. Like TRYC  LS appears sensitive to irrelevant responding independent \nof psychopathology. Specific cut-off scores (such as greater than four for marginal, \ngreater than five for clearly irrelevant) have been employed for both TR and CLS, \n+ \nand a combined cut-off (TR  CLS greater than eight for marginal, greater than \nnine for clearly irrelevant) has also been used (Greene, 1988). \nThe MMPI offers a variety of measures of malingering, defensiveness, and irrele- \nvance in responding. It is also one of the most heavily researched instruments with \nrespect to malingering and defensiveness (Ziskin, 1981 ). It therefore seems appropri- \nate to include the MMPI in any empirical approach to measuring response style. \nHowever, there are certain methodological problems with the previously-described \nMMPI studies which make it difficult to apply this research in a straightforward \nfashion. Much of the MMPI response style research has involved comparing the \nperformance of individuals instructed to take the MMPI under ‘fake good’ or ‘fake \nbad’ conditions with that of individuals taking it under standard conditions. The \nproblem with this approach is that there are likely to be significant differences between \nnormal populations responding under deviant set instructions, and real defendants \nTfor example) facing criminal charges. Some studies have compared experimental \nsamples to clinical ones (for example Gough 1954; Grow et al.,  1980; Heaton et \nal.,  1978), but only a few have specifically examined MMPI validity scale patterns \nin forensic populations (for example Audubon & Kirwin, 1982; Lanyon & Lutz, \n1984). Most previous MMPI research has also failed to control for such demographic \ndifferences as age, race, and sex (Butcher & Tellegen, 1978; Carlson, 197 1). \nSome MMPI research has used inmates or patients responding under circum- \nstances that would suggest motivation to distort their presentation in a particular \ndirection. In one study, three groups of maximum security federal inmates thought \nto be motivated to exaggerate psychopathology, deny it, or report it accurately, \nwere administered the MMPI (Walters, 1988). The ‘Exaggerating’ group (N = \n35, requesting single cell placement on the basis of psychopathology) scored signifi- \ncantly higher on F, F-K, D-0, Hy-0, Pd-0, Pa-0, Ma-0, the Dissimulation Scale, \nthe total number of Obvious Items, and the Obvious to Subtle ratio, and significantly \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 10 PageID #:\n 2139\nMMPI-Based Empirical Model  47 \nlower on scales K, Hy-S, Ma-S, and the total number of Subtle items, when com- \npared with inmates in ‘Neutral’ condition (N = 30, entering group therapy) and \n‘Denial’ condition (N = 32, undergoing parole evaluation). Differences between \nNeutral and Denial groups were relatively small, with only D-0, Hy-0, and DS \nproducing statistically significant results. These results support the use of the MMPI \nin this population in assessing response style, particularly exaggeration. \nIn another study (Wasyliw et al.,  1988), the MMPI was administered to two \ngroups of forensic patients: those being evaluated for competency to stand trial \nandor sanity at the time of the offense (N = 35), and those who had already been \nacquitted by reason of insanity (N =39). The investigators reasoned that the first \ngroup would stand to gain from the exaggeration of psychopathology, and thus \npredicted a higher incidence of malingering in this group. Their findings were consis- \ntent with this prediction. On four MMPI measures sensitive to malingering (F scale, \nDs scale, Obvious and Subtle subscales, and F-K index), the ‘evaluated’ group \nwas significantlyh igher on malingering than the ‘acquitted’ group. \nThe methodological difficulty with this approach, as Wasyliw et al. (1988) point \nout, is that such subject groups are by no means homogeneous with respect to \nresponse style. Some patients being evaluated for competency to stand trial may \nmalinger, others may be defensive, others irrelevant, and yet others may respond \nreliably. A finding of a higher incidence of malingering in a sample with externally- \ninduced motivation to exaggerate or fake psychopathology can provide one form \nof validation for the malingering measure, yet the sensitivity of the measure is adver- \nsely affected by the mixture of response styles in the group. An alternative method- \nology might involve obtaining more homogeneous groups of subjects using each \nresponse style and examining the differences between groups on a number of other \nvariables relevant to response style. \nWhat would be most useful in the classification of response style is a model com- \nposed of a number of empirical correlates rather than one (or several) scale(s) or \nindex(es). Such a model has been proposed. Rogers (1984b), in a comprehensive \nreview of the literature on response styles, described two models: (a) an ‘heuristic’ \nmodel, composed of clinical indicators of deception, and (b) an ‘empirical’ model, \ncomposed of factors obtained from a review of the research findings from psychologi- \ncal testing, case studies, and social psychology. The two share a number of elements, \nincluding severity of symptoms, consistency of self-report, rare symptoms, sequence \nof symptoms, obvious versus subtle symptoms, appearance of symptoms, and random \npattern of responses. One other element is very similar: self-report inconsistent with \nclinical observation (heuristic model) versus symptoms inconsistent with clinical \nobservation (empirical model). Each model also has some unique elements. The \nheuristic model includes the following elements that are not in the empirical model: \nendorsement of contradictory symptoms; memory of past psychological problems; \npotentially ‘self-damaging’ statements; and endorsement of highly specified symp- \ntoms. Elements in the empirical model not contained in the heuristic model include \nadmission of common foibles; endorsement of idealistic self-attributes; improbable \nfailure rate; latency of response; responses that are nearly correct; vagueness of \nresponses; fidgetiness; willingness to discuss symptoms; and endorsement of ‘stereo- \ntypes of neurosis’. \nWe have attempted to operationalize this empirical model of response style, using \nthe MMPI and clinical interview data. To the extent that this can be accomplished, \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 10 PageID #:\n 2140\n48  K. Heilbrun et al. \nthe results will have clear implications for practice: both the clinical interview and \nthe MMPI are routinely performed in psychological assessments. \nIn developing an MMPI-based classification approach, it is useful to consider \nthe question posed by Megargee and Bohn  (1979) regarding any MMPI-based \nmodel. Relevant questions include: \n(1) Do the MMPI profiles fall into distinct groups or clusters? \n(2)  Is it possible for a clinician to sort individual MMPI profiles into such groups \nreliably? \n(3) Is it possible to define such groups operationally so that other clinicians, \nor even a computer, can sort individual MMPI profiles validly? \nThese questions will be addressed in the course of this study. In addition, the \nfactor structure of the rating criteria will be examined to determine whether it suggests \ninternally consistent constructs underlying the respective response styles. \nMETHOD \nSubjects \nThe records of 159 patients were examined as part of this research. These patients \nhad been randomly selected upon admission as a part of a larger project designed \nto collect clinical data for newly-admitted forensic patients at the Forensic Service, \nFlorida State Hospital. The Forensic Service is a 460-bed forensic hospital located \nin Chattahoochee, which is a small town in northwest Florida. Patients are committed \nby the criminal courts as either ‘Incompetent to Stand Trial’ or ‘Not Guilty by \nReason of Insanity’. Also located on the hospital grounds are units for civilly-commit- \nred patients, a specialized treatment facility for mentally ill correctional inmates, \nand a minimum-security prison. \nThe sample consisted of male patients with a mean age of 30.8 years (SD = \n9.3), with a range from 17 to 71. Racial composition was 57.2% White and 42.8% \nBlack. Diagnosis was assessed through structured interviews: (a) the Schedule for \nAffective Disorders and Schizophrenia (Endicott and Spitzer, 1978) from September \n1984 to October 1985; and (b) the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-I11 (Spitzer \nand Williams, 1985) from October 1985 to June 1988. A total of 53% of patients \nwere diagnosed as schizophrenic, with another 18.5% diagnosed as having affective \ndisorder with psychotic features. Non-psychotic primary diagnoses were assigned \nto 23.9% of the sample. Secondary diagnoses of substance abuse (83.3%) were \nfrequent. \nMost subjects were committed as Incompetent to Stand Trial (78.6%) or Not \nGuilty by Reason of Insanity (18.2%). Arrest charges ranged from homicide to \nmisdemeanor property offenses. Patients had a mean of 4.5 (SD = 4.9) prior hospital- \nizations in state psychiatric facilities. \nProcedure \nTwo sources of information were used in rating response style. The MMPI, adminis- \ntered within three to five weeks of admission, was examined. Psychiatric evaluations \nconducted within 48 hours of admission were also reviewed. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 10 PageID #:\n 2141\nMMPI-Based Empirical Model  49 \nThe MMPI-Based Empirical Model of Response Style (MERS) was developed \nby using 11 of the 17 criteria described in Rogers’s (1984b) empirical model of \ndissimulation. The criteria employed were severity of symptoms, consistency of self- \nreport, rare symptoms, sequence of symptoms, obvious versus subtle symptoms, \nappearance of symptoms, admission of common foibles, endorsement of idealistic \nself-attributes, random responding, reported symptoms inconsistent with clinical \nobservation, and willingness to discuss symptoms. These criteria were selected \nbecause seven of them were also included in Rogers’s (1984b) heuristic model, \nand because these 11 factors appeared most likely to discriminate between reliable, \nmalingering, defensive, and irrelevant responders. \nEach criterion was operationalized by using information from the MMPI or the \npsychiatric evaluation. The MMPI was used to define consistency of self-report \n(TRYC LS Scales); obvious versus subtle symptoms (Obvious and Subtle Scales); \nadmission of common foibles (L scale); endorsement of idealistic self-attributes (L \nscale, K scale, and the 0-H Scale developed by Megargee et d. [ 1967]), and random \nresponding (TR and CLS Scales and F scale). The psychiatric evaluation was used \nto rate symptom severity, rare symptoms, sequence of symptoms consistent with \ndiagnosis, sudden onset of symptoms, reported symptoms inconsistent with clinical \nobservation, and willing to discuss symptoms. Decision rules were established for \neach criterion to help determine whether the criterion should be rated as definitely \npresent, possible, or definitely absent (see Appendix A). \nTwo of us (A.W and S.B.) served as raters. Using the 11 criteria, the raters scored \neach profile by adding the number of criteria which were met for each response \nstyle. Each subject thus received four scores, one each for Reliable, Malingering, \nDefensive, and Irrelevant. Raters then classified each subject into one of these four \ncategories of response style, or as Unclassifiable.’ \nRESULTS \nThe first question concerned the inter-rater reliability in classifying subjects. Agree- \nment between raters appeared good (I = 0.76) in their scoring of each of the 11 \ncriteria. Raters were also in substantial agreement (r = 0.82) with respect to the \nReliable, Malingering, Defensive, and Irrelevant scores computed for each subject. \nThe next step was to examine &e factor structure of the 1 1 criteria to see whether \nconstructs similar to our response style categories would  emerge. A principle- \ncomponents analysis to oblique rotation (see Table 1) yielded four factors, which \nmight be best described as Reliable, Malingering, General Deception, and Severity \nof Psychopathology. A total of 64.8% of variance was accounted for by these factors. \nThe Reliable factor included two criteria seen in reliable responding: ‘consistency \nof self report’, and (negative to) ‘random responding’. The second factor, Malinger- \ning, included a negative loading for the ‘endorsement of idealistic self-attributes’ \nand also included the tendency to respond to far more obvious than subtle items \nand to admit to common foibles. The third factor, General Deception, contained \ntwo items usually associated with malingering: ‘rare symptoms’ and ‘sudden onset \nI A full description of the MERS classification process, including cut-off scores, is available from the \nfirst author. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 10 PageID #:\n 2142\n50  K.

It also included one criterion that could be applied to either Malinger- \ning or Defensive responding - ‘inconsistency of reported symptoms with clinical \nobservation’, and another specific to Defensiveness - (negative on) ‘willingness \nto discuss symptoms’. This factor was thus labelled ‘general deception’, as it con- \ntained aspects of deceptive responding in both directions. The final factor appeared \nto reflect severity of disturbance, relatively independent of response style. \nDISCUSSION \nThe MERS procedure is a different approach to the assessment of response style \nin a forensic population. We have attempted, with some success, to operationalize \nthe empirical model for the assessment of malingering and deception described by \nRogers (1 984b). Inter-rater reliability in rating the operational criteria is good, and \nthe underlying factor structure is consistent with the existence of constructs underly- \ning two of the response styles, and partially supportive of a third. Employing only \nMMPI and clinical interview data, the MERS may yield a more efficient use of \nsuch routinely collected clinical information. \nIt is noteworthy that the ‘hybrid’ groups described by Rogers (1984b, 1988), \nas observed clinically but not investigated empirically, are clearly part of the response \nstyles seen in this study. The Reliable, Malingering, Defensive, and Irrelevant groups \ndefined in this article are by no means ‘pure’. There appear to be several reasons \nfor this. A number of the criteria used in rating response style could be scored \nin the same direction for different groups, reflecting the clinical and empirical realities \nthat these groups are similar in some ways. Also, response style is probably a dynamic \nvariable, fluctuating according to situation (for example a male patient who exagger- \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 10 PageID #:\n 2143\nMMPI-Based Empirical Model  5 1 \nates psychopathology when he is Incompetent to Stand Trial but under-reports it \nfollowing his acquittal by reason of insanity) and even between topics within the \nsame evaluation (reliably reporting thoughts and feelings in most areas, for example, \nbut defensively minimizing sexual impulses toward children). The Malingering and \nDefensive groups in this study both had prominent elements of Reliable responding. \nThis raises an interesting question: on what dimensions will these four groups differ? \nOne eventual goal of research categorizing response style in this fashion is to provide \n‘templates’ for each response style, allowing the evaluator to make a ‘best fit’ judg- \nment between the empirically derived templates and the immediate pattern of clinical \ndata. \nThe overall distribution of the groups is enlightening. The MERS procedure could \nnot classify 52 (33%)  of  159 subjects, and another 35 (22O/0)  were classified as \nReliable. That means that 46% of the sample were assigned to categories that should \ncarry a warning label: ‘Caution. What you see is not what you get!’. The consequent \nneed for third-party information to help balance distortions created by inaccurate \nresponding is particularly compelling. While third-party information has always been \na recommended part of forensic assessment (Heilbrun, 1988; Melton et ul., 1987), \nthe present results should serve to strongly underscore this need; as Greene (19 88) \npoints out, inaccurate responding means that little can be inferred about the nature \nof the psychopathology present. It is also worth noting that Defensive (21%) and \nIrrelevant (16%) response styles occurred more frequently than Malingering (9%), \nwhich has received far more attention in both the professional literature and popular \npress. \nResearch on the MERS process is just beginning. The next major step is external \nvalidation: do the response style groups differ significantly on non-MMPI variables, \nsuch as life-style, social history, behavior, and patterns of thinking?T  he classification \nprocedure itself will need to be further investigated and refined. Nearly one-third \nof our present sample could not be classified. Further MERS research should reduce \nthis percentage to a more acceptable level (such as 1% - the figure reported by \nMegargee and Bohn, 1979), and possibly lead to differential weighting of criteria. \nThe procedures must be cross-validated as well. The question of generalizability \nto other populations should be addressed in samples of different age and sex, in \nout-patient settings as well as inpatient, and in jail and prison settings where the \nbase rate of psychotic disorders is much lower. Finally, the interview might be more \nrelevant to response style if it were designed specifically for that purpose. The use \nof such an interview, either structured (Rogers, 1986) or unstructured (Resnick, \n1987), as a supplement to the standard clinical interview used in this study, might \nyield even more promising results. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to express their appreciation to Richard Rogers for a thorough \ncritique of an earlier version of this manuscript, and to Stewart Parsons and the \nstaff of the Forensic Service, Florida State Hospital, for the support they have pro- \nvided throughout the course of the larger project of which these data are a part. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-14   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 10 PageID #:\n 2144\n52  K.

Canada (Attorney General)  Page 6 \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n[1]  Segregation has been described as “the most onerous and depriving \nexperience that the state can legally administer in Canada”: Annual Report of the \nOffice of the Correctional Investigator 2014-2015 at p. 31 [2014-2015 Annual \nReport]. The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and the John Howard \nSociety of Canada ask the Court to end administrative segregation as it is presently \npractised in federal penitentiaries in Canada. \n[2]  The plaintiffs contend that ss. 31-33 and 37 of the Corrections and \nConditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the “CCRA”), authorizing administrative \nsegregation are contrary to ss. 7, 9, 10, 12 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights \nand Freedoms. They say that the impugned provisions permit indeterminate and \nprolonged solitary confinement, as that term is understood in international law and \naccepted worldwide by virtually every organization or professional group conversant \nwith the issue. Segregation, especially when endured for extended periods, has \nsignificant adverse effects on the physical, psychological, and social health of \ninmates; there is no independent oversight of placements in what has been \ndescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada as a “prison within a prison”: Martineau \nv. Matsqui Disciplinary Bd., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602 at 622. The plaintiffs further allege \nthat the impugned provisions have a disproportionate impact on Aboriginal inmates \nand those with mental illness. \n[3]  The Attorney General of Canada (the “Government”) responds that \nadministrative segregation as it is practised in federal correctional facilities is not \nsolitary confinement since inmates have daily opportunity for meaningful human \ncontact. Moreover, the psychological effects of segregation on inmates remain the \nsubject of ongoing and vigorous scientific debate. The Government submits that \nmaintaining institutional security and inmate and staff safety is a complicated task, \nand that administrative segregation is a necessary tool when no other reasonable \nalternatives exist. The length of placements is not indeterminate as alleged but, \nrather, determined by the time required to eliminate the safety or security issue that \ntriggered its use. Accordingly, the Government contends that the plaintiffs have \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-16   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 11 PageID #:\n 2160\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney General)  Page 7 \nfailed to establish that the impugned provisions are unconstitutional on their face or \nin their application, and that their claims must therefore be dismissed. \nA.  The Parties \n[4]  The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association is a non-profit advocacy \ngroup whose objects include the promotion and defence of civil liberties in British \nColumbia and Canada. The Association has had long-standing interest in inmates’ \nrights and policy. \n[5]  The John Howard Society of Canada is a non-profit organization with a strong \nhistory of commitment to and involvement in matters of criminal justice, especially as \nthey pertain to penal policy and corrections. \n[6]  The Government does not dispute that the plaintiffs are entitled to public \ninterest standing in this case. However, it contends that the lack of an individual \nplaintiff has implications for the available remedies. \n[7]  Two intervenors also participated in these proceedings. West Coast LEAF’s \nsubmissions focussed on what it says is the disproportionate impact of \nadministrative segregation on individuals with intersecting characteristics of \ndisadvantage, namely, Aboriginal women with mental illness. The Criminal Defence \nAdvocacy Society (“CDAS”) primarily challenged the lack of access to counsel \nduring the segregation review process. \nB.  Nature Of The Evidence \n[8]  Although the parties were required to operate under very tight timelines, they \nnevertheless assembled a substantial evidentiary record. \n[9]  Twenty-eight witnesses were cross-examined on their affidavits before the \nCourt. The plaintiffs’ witnesses comprised 10 experts on a range of subject matters \nrelating to the practice and effects of administrative segregation, and eight lay \nwitnesses. These latter individuals were primarily former Correctional Service of \nCanada (“CSC”) employees and inmates who had experienced placements in \nadministrative segregation. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-16   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 11 PageID #:\n 2161\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney General)  Page 8 \n[10]  The Government tendered the evidence of two experts with respect to the \npsychological effects of administrative segregation, and 10 lay witnesses who were \nall current or former CSC employees. \n[11]  Because of the volume of evidence, I will not refer to every affidavit or witness \nin these Reasons. However, I have reviewed the entire record, and my conclusions \nare based on all of the evidence before me. \nC.  The Office of the Correctional Investigator’s Reports \n[12]  The Office of the Correctional Investigator (“OCI”) serves as ombudsman for \nfederally sentenced inmates. Among its statutory responsibilities are the \ninvestigation of individual or systemic concerns relating to corrections, and the \npreparation of annual and special reports. To enable performance of these duties, \nthe OCI has full access to all of CSC’s facilities, records and staff. \n[13]  The plaintiffs seek the admissibility of numerous OCI reports pursuant to \neither the public records exception to the rule against hearsay or the principled \napproach. The Government objects to their admissibility on both grounds. \n[14]  I refer to OCI reports throughout these Reasons. For the most part, the \nparticular facts or statistics I cite were put to the Government’s witnesses in cross-\nexamination and accepted by them as accurate. Where this was not the case, I am \nsatisfied the reports are nonetheless admissible pursuant to the principled approach \nto hearsay. They are necessary because the Correctional Investigator is not a \ncompetent or compellable witness pursuant to s. 189 of the CCRA. They are also \nreliable because they are compiled by the OCI in the discharge of a public duty on \nthe basis of data maintained by CSC. \nII.  HISTORY OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT \nA.  History \n[15]  The following history derives primarily from the expert reports of Dr. Stuart \nGrassian, whose qualifications are discussed later, and Michael Jackson, Q.C. \nProfessor Jackson is Emeritus Professor of Law at the University of British \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-16   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 11 PageID #:\n 2162\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney General)  Page 76 \n[252]  I accept that the early history of solitary confinement in the United States and \nmore particularly in Germany, demonstrates that these harmful effects have been \nrecognized since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \n[253]  Dr. Mills and Dr. Gendreau base their opinions to a significant extent on the \nMorgan et al. Study which, in turn, relies for its results on the Colorado Study and \nthe Zinger Study of Canadian inmates. I agree with Dr. Grassian and Dr. Haney’s \ncriticisms of the Colorado Study and Dr. Haney’s criticisms of the Zinger Study. In \nparticular, the distinction that Dr. Haney draws between voluntary and involuntary \nconfinement in administrative segregation will be discussed later in these Reasons. \n[254]  None of my above findings should be read as a criticism of meta-analysis as \na method of scientific research. I agree with Dr. Gendreau that it can be a valuable \ntool for understanding complex problems. The Morgan et al. Study is unhelpful in \nunderstanding solitary confinement because of flaws in the Colorado and Zinger \nstudies. \n[255]  I now turn to the legal significance of the facts that I have found. \nIV.  SECTION 7 \n[256]  Section 7 of the Charter guarantees everyone “the right to life, liberty and \nsecurity of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance \nwith the principles of fundamental justice”. \n[257]  To establish a breach of s. 7, the plaintiffs must show that (a) the impugned \nlaws interfere with, or deprive them of, their life, liberty or security of the person; and \n(b) that the deprivation in question is not in accordance with the principles of \nfundamental justice. \n[258]  The inquiry under s. 7 is not a quantitative one – for instance, how many \npeople are negatively impacted – but qualitative. Accordingly, an arbitrary, \noverbroad or grossly disproportionate impact on one person suffices to establish a \nbreach of s. 7: Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72 at para. 127. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-16   Filed 06/21/19   Page 11 of 11 PageID #:\n 2163\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney General)  Page 162 \n2.  The impugned laws are invalid pursuant to s. 15 of the Charter: \na)  to the extent that the impugned laws authorize and effect any \nperiod of administrative segregation for the mentally ill and/or \ndisabled; and \nb)  also to the extent that the impugned laws authorize and effect a \nprocedure that results in discrimination against Aboriginal inmates. \n[610]  I am prepared to grant a 12 month suspension of my declaration of invalidity \non the basis of the first two reasons enumerated in Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 \nS.C.R. 679, that is that an immediate declaration would pose a potential danger to \nthe public or threaten the rule of law. \nXI.  COSTS \n[611]  I am satisfied that this is a proper case to award the plaintiffs’ special costs \nand am pleased that counsel have worked out a mechanism to accomplish this. \nXII.  END NOTE \n[612]  I want to express my appreciation for the hard work and legal abilities of all \ncounsel who have been involved in this matter. The issues were complex, the time \npressures formidable, yet the professionalism of counsel substantially lightened the \nburden on the Court. \n“Leask J.” \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document

Psychological Effects of \nAdministrative Segregation \nBy Peter Scharff Smith \n \nAbstract \nSolitary confinement is a common practice in many prisons, but it has sparked debates and \nresearch on its effects on prisoners. This article examines a recent study on administrative \nsegregation in Colorado in the context of relevant European research on the effects of solitary \nconfinement \nKey words: administrative segregation, solitary confinement \n \nThe use of large scale solitary confinement became common with the rise of the modern penitentiary \nduring the first half of the 19th century and has remained a feature of Western prison systems.  A debate \nabout the effects of solitary confinement was largely settled early in the 20th century, when both experts \nand practitioners tended to agree that solitary confinement was harmful.  Discussions on the effects of \nsolitary confinement resurfaced in the 1950s and the following two decades when sensory deprivation \nstudies were carried out in reaction to, among other things, stories of the brainwashing of U.S. prisoners \nof war during the Korean War. During the 1980s, solitary confinement regained topicality in the wake of \nthe creation of supermax prisons in the United States. But solitary confinement has also been used, \ndebated, and researched extensively elsewhere, As one example, solitary confinement has been an \nintegral part of Scandinavian pre-trial prison practice for many years (Smith 2006). In 2010, the Colorado \nDepartment of Corrections and the Department of Psychology at the University of Colorado issued a new \nstudy on solitary confinement.  In this article, I will discuss research on the effects of solitary confinement \nand make some comments on the Colorado study. (Editor’s note: All references to, or quotes from, the \nColorado study are from O’Keefe et al., 2010.) \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 3 of 12 PageID #:\n 2328\nColorado Study \nThe Colorado study is longitudinal and mainly based on self-reported data. The battery of tests used in \nthis study looks impressive and covers the various symptoms and health issues described in the earlier \nsolitary confinement literature, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal thinking. However, it is clearly \nimportant that all these tests were used without in-depth interviews being conducted, and that the self-\nreported data was not collected by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or an experienced prison researcher. \nThe main conclusion in the Colorado study was that the results “were largely inconsistent with (…) the \nbulk of literature that indicates AS is extremely detrimental to inmates.” and that “there was initial \nimprovement in psychological well-being across all study groups, with the bulk of the improvements \noccurring between the first and second testing periods.” However “all of the study groups, with the \nexception of the GP NMI (general population, non-mentally ill) group, showed symptoms that were \nassociated with the SHU (special housing unit) syndrome” (i.e. high degrees of psychological \ndisturbance). In this article, I will discuss a number of issues that will help explain the apparent \ndiscrepancy between the Colorado study conclusions and the results gathered in other available \nresearch. \nWhy not use the available research? \nThe Colorado report begins with the claims that the debate on the use of long-term administrative \nsegregation “has suffered from a lack of empirical research” and that “the scant empirical research \nconducted to date suffers from research bias and serious methodological flaws.” This is a seriously \nmisleading statement. The problem is not that relevant and rigorous empirical research does not exist, but \nthat the authors of the Colorado report haven’t used it. Much of this research is European, but it has been \npresented and reviewed in international journals, including U.S.-based journals (Smith, 2006 and Haney, \n2009). \nEuropean studies on the effects of solitary confinement \nA growing body of American research is clearly relevant to a discussion of solitary confinement and \nsegregation regimes (see, for example, Lovell, 2008; Cloyes, Lovell, Allen, and Rhodes, 2006; Rhodes, \n2004; and Haney, 2008). In the following, I will briefly review some of the European research, which \nseems to be less known to American readers. This research has not been carried out in supermax \nprisons in the U.S. (for European supermax research, see King, 2005 and Shalev, 2009) but it is, in fact, \nresearch on how prisoners react to being subjected to 22-23 hours of solitary confinement in their cell \neach day, so it is most certainly relevant. According to the Colorado study, the “defining feature” of \nadministrative segregation in Colorado is single-cell confinement for 23 hours per day. \nFor various reasons, the use of pre-trial solitary confinement has historically been extensive in Sweden, \nNorway, and Denmark and has sparked intense debates and also research on the effects of solitary \nconfinement, especially in Denmark and Norway (Smith 2006). In Norway, a 1993 longitudinal study of 63 \nisolated remand prisoners found widespread health problems after four weeks of solitary confinement, \nincluding depression, anxiety, stomach and muscle pains, and an inability to concentrate. The study \nexcluded inmates with obvious withdrawal symptoms and those deemed at risk of suffering from a \npsychosis (Gamman 2001). A longitudinal follow-up in 1995 with a sample of 54 remand prisoners \n2     Corrections & Mental Health \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 12 PageID #:\n 2329\nincluded a control group and reported significantly more physical and psychological suffering, including \nsleeplessness, concentration problems, anxiety, and depression, among the prisoners in solitary \nconfinement, who were also given much more medication than the control group (Gamman, 1995, 2001). \nThe author of this study found that several of the isolated prisoners developed symptoms of a \nhallucinatory nature, that there were “important differences” between the health of those isolated and \nthose not, and concluded that “the isolated had more symptoms of both psychological and somatic \nnature” (Gamman, 1995, p. 2245). \nIn terms of the prevalence of symptoms, 94 percent of those in pre-trial solitary confinement suffered from \nadverse symptoms after four weeks. More than half suffered from serious symptoms like depression and \nanxiety, and 13 percent had mutilated themselves (Gamman, 2001). In a third Norwegian study on \ndisciplinary segregation, more than 43 percent of the isolated prisoners suffered adverse symptoms after \nonly an average of 39.7 hours in solitary confinement (Stang et al., 2003). \nIn Denmark during the 1980’s and 90’s, extensive research on the effects of solitary confinement was \ncarried out in the form of a number of interview-based studies as well as a so-called “isolation-study,” \nwhich was a large-scale longitudinal study consisting of a comprehensive psychiatric and psychological \nstudy (1994) and a follow-up study (1997), both with control groups. The Colorado report authors are not \naware of some of the most important articles and results from these studies (Sestoft et al., 1998; \nAndersen, 2004; see also Smith, 2006), and furthermore do not fully incorporate the findings of the two \nrelated studies they actually list in their references. The Danish 1994 study involved 367 remand \nprisoners and reported a significantly higher rate of psychiatric problems among prisoners in isolation. A \nhigher incidence of psychiatric morbidity – mainly adjustment disorders - was found among those in \nsolitary confinement (28 percent) compared to those not in isolation (15 percent). The rate of psychiatric \nmorbidity was highest (43 percent) among a third group of remand prisoners who had been in solitary \nconfinement for more than two months (Andersen et al., 1994). A number of standardized instruments \nwere used to measure health quantitatively.  The scores for those in solitary (as a group) were \nunchanged throughout the isolation period, while those not in isolation “had a gradual improvement on \nmost quantitative mental health scores during this early phase of imprisonment (Andersen, 2004, p. 39)” \nThose in solitary confinement experienced an improvement in health scores when the solitary \nconfinement conditions were relieved (Andersen 2004). The researchers concluded that the differences \nbetween the isolated remand prisoners and the control group were caused “mainly by different conditions \nof SC and non-SC” (Andersen 2004, p. 39), and that pre-trial detention in isolation compared with pre-trial \ndetention without isolation involved strain and risk of damaging the mental health of the imprisoned \nindividuals (Andersen et al. 1994, 2000). \nThe 1994 study was longitudinal, incorporated both quantitative and qualitative elements, used \nstandardized instruments to measure health, incorporated in-depth interviews, used highly-skilled \nresearchers, included control groups and a very large number of prisoners in solitary confinement, \nproduced statistically significant results, and verified their results through other objective data regarding \nthe hospitalization of remand prisoners.   \nStill, the thoroughness of the study caused the research itself to constitute a significant intrusion into the \nlives of the study’s participants (Andersen, 2004). During the first three weeks of imprisonment those in \nsolitary confinement were typically subjected to four or five days of intense interviews and testing (2–4 \n Effects of Solitary Confinement 3 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 12 PageID #:\n 2330\nhours each day, not counting filling out questionnaires, having blood samples taken etc.). These remand \nprisoners were, in other words, effectively not in solitary confinement during those four or five days.  This \nconstituted around 20 to 25 percent of the period between the first test and the end of the second test \nround after approximately three weeks.  This must have downgraded the measured differences between \nthe isolated prisoners and the control group significantly, especially since the interviews constituted \nmeaningful social contact in which the well-being and innermost thoughts of the imprisoned individual was \nin focus (Smith, 2006).  \nGiven this issue, it is not surprising that the second part of the 1994 study - a survey of hospitalization \namong remand prisoners – gave even more clear-cut results.  A sample of 124 remand prisoners who \nhad been transferred to prison hospital revealed that, if “a person remained in SC [solitary confinement] \nfor four weeks the likelihood of being admitted to the prison hospital for a psychiatric reason was about \ntwenty times as high as for a person remanded in NSC [non-solitary confinement] for the same period of \ntime” (Sestoft et al., 1998, p. 103).  \nA 1997 follow-up study was based on reports (questionnaires) from former participants in the original \nstudy, and illustrated how former remand prisoners in solitary confinement found their incarceration \nsignificantly more straining than did remand prisoners not in isolation. Thirty-eight percent of those in \nsolitary confinement and 36 percent of those in long-term solitary found their remand imprisonment \nextraordinarily straining, as opposed to 12 percent of those not in solitary (Andersen et al., 1997). \nFurthermore, 23 percent of those in solitary confinement and 27 percent of those in long-term solitary \nreported that they experienced severe psychological reactions after their remand imprisonment, as \nopposed to nine percent of those not in solitary (Andersen et al.,1997). The authors concluded that from a \nmedical and psychological perspective the practice of pre-trial solitary confinement should be abandoned \n(Andersen et al., 1997). \nA Swiss study on the effects of solitary confinement documented a similar problem surrounding \nhospitalization of inmates in solitary confinement. The study sample consisted of 203 male patients in a \npsychiatric clinic in Zurich, of whom 102 were committed from a prison (76 percent of these came directly \nfrom solitary confinement). The study concluded that remand prisoners in solitary confinement were much \nmore often hospitalized for psychiatric reasons than were prisoners who came from communal prison \nconditions (Volkart, Rothenfluth, et al., 1983). \nVolkart and colleges also compared 30 prisoners in solitary confinement with a control group of 28 \nprisoners in communal imprisonment.  The study was cross-sectional and incorporated no longitudinal \ndata.  Isolated inmates had spent an average of ninety-one days in solitary confinement while the control \ngroup had spent on average 326 days imprisoned. All participants had normal intelligence and their \nhealth and personalities were assessed through psychiatric questionnaires. The group of isolated inmates \n“showed considerably more psychopathological symptoms than the control group [and these] effects were \nmainly caused by solitary confinement; age, schooling, duration of detention and personality turned out to \nbe of subordinate importance.” (Volkart, Dittrich, et al. 1983, p. 44) \n \n \n4     Corrections & Mental Health \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 12 PageID #:\n 2331\nSocial contact and contamination across groups \nThe available research, including the above-mentioned studies, demonstrates that solitary confinement \n“causes serious health problems for a significant number of inmates. The central harmful feature is that it \nreduces meaningful social contact to an absolute minimum: a level of social and psychological stimulus \nthat many individuals will experience as insufficient to remain reasonably healthy and relatively well-\nfunctioning.” (Smith, 2006, p.503) \nThis should be a starting point for further research on solitary confinement. Previous research does not \nshow, for example, that the availability of television, radio, or newspapers, or even good material \nconditions of confinement, will offset the negative impact of solitary confinement on many prisoners, \nalthough access to such items and conditions can ameliorate any prison experience to a certain extent. \nBut as the Colorado report concludes, the availability of modern technology, such as videoconferencing, \nis not always positive for the prisoners since “it also increases the degree of isolation experienced by \ninmates.”  \n \nTherefore, it is unfortunate that the Colorado study does not explore this issue convincingly, i.e., \nmeasuring the relative level of psychologically meaningful social contact in administrative segregation \n(AS), punitive segregation, and general population (GP). If we look closer at the Colorado study it \ndescribes basic AS conditions as single-cell confinement for around 23 hours per day. In AS, prisoners \nare given five 1-hour recreation spells each week, as well as three 15-minute showers (although \napparently inmates use less time for showers).  Prisoners are escorted to recreation in “full-restraints.” \nDepending on custody level, inmates are allowed either two 2-hour noncontact visits per month (Level 2) \nor four 3-hour visits per month (Level 3). Phone calls for those in the Colorado State Penitentiary \napparently amounted to only a few minutes daily. If we look at both recreation, visits, and showers, an \ninmate on level 2 will apparently (assuming he receives visitors) stay at least around 23 hours in his cell \non a daily basis, while those on level 3 get two more hours out of their cell on a weekly basis (once again \nassuming that they receive visits) – i.e. less than 20 minutes less cell time on a daily basis. \nIn addition to the above, there is some contact with mental health clinicians who do monthly rounds and \noccasional “mental health sessions” for one to two hours per week. Furthermore inmates in AS go \nthrough a “Quality of Life Program,” which includes cognitive classes, but as far as I can see this does not \nresult in increased social contact since these classes, along with some recreational activities, take place \nover the television. \nPunitive segregation, where many inmates stayed prior to AS, is single-cell confinement for 23-24 hours \nper day, during which inmates only come out for recreation and showers in the living unit. So most \ninmates stay inside the segregation unit during their entire stay and are “placed in full-restraints” if \nescorted out of the cell. Inmates in punitive segregation are not allowed to work or participate in any \nprograms or education, and do not have a television.  \nDescriptions of these conditions indicate that the amount of psychologically meaningful social contact is \nextremely scarce in both AS and punitive segregation, with the latter regime apparently allowing even \nless out-of-cell time and social contact. There is, however, one unclear factor. According to the Colorado \n Effects of Solitary Confinement 5 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 12 PageID #:\n 2332\nreport, the inmates in AS can communicate with sign language and they can also yell to each other. \nExactly how much and what kind of contact this results in is not described. Furthermore, GP conditions \nare not described along with the amount of social contact allowed under that regime. \nBasically, it is somewhat unclear in the Colorado study how much meaningful social contact inmates in \nAS had access to during the study. AS conditions suggest that they had very limited access to such \ncontact, although it is not entirely clear what level of communication was allowed through yelling and sign \nlanguage, where especially the former might potentially yield some level of meaningful contact. \nFurthermore, it is unclear how much staff contact inmates have, although it is seemingly not a lot. \nTo confuse matters even more, there was “contamination across groups” meaning that “all offenders in \nAS were not confined in segregation for their entire period of participation in the study” and inmates in GP \nmay “at some time during their study participation [have] been placed in punitive segregation or even AS.”  \nIn fact, when looking at “pure cases” of continuous AS, there were only 26 among the mentally ill and 39 \namong the non mentally ill, and even more alarming, there were only 13 “pure cases” of continuous GP \nprison time among the mentally ill GP control group (GP-MI) and 11 “pure cases” of continuous GP prison \ntime among the non mentally ill GP control group (GP-NMI). This means that out of the 33 GP-MI and 43 \nGP-NMI who participated in the study (some of which later dropped out) only 13 GP-MI and 11 GP-NMI \nspent their entire study time in GP conditions. So the GP control group was not really a GP control group \nat all since the majority of these experienced either AS or punitive segregation during their participation in \nthe study, and in addition most – perhaps all – experienced AS immediately prior to their AS hearing, after \nwhich they went into GP. \n The Colorado researchers looked at their “pure cases” and found no major differences between these \nand other GP inmates. Then, they disregarded the problem, although such a finding questions the validity \nof their self-reported data and the setup of the entire study. Under all circumstances, the Colorado study \nis in fact not a study comparing segregation/solitary confinement with non-segregation/solitary \nconfinement, since most of the GP inmates experienced solitary confinement during the study. \nEqually important are uncertainties surrounding the levels of meaningful contact the study participants \nhad prior to the start of the study.  It is unclear how many participants came from solitary confinement \nwhen they entered AS or how much time they spent under such conditions before their initial tests. If \nsome came directly from GP conditions to AS, then it is a problem that we do not know what that means \nin terms of a change in the level of available, meaningful social contact. We do know that some inmates – \nalthough not how many - came directly from punitive segregation and given the way these conditions are \ndescribed in the Colorado study it seems likely that these inmates experienced better conditions with \nmore meaningful contact when they entered AS. In that case, it is hardly surprising that the study found \npositive developments between the first and second testing of the inmates.  \nWere the study participants harmed by solitary confinement prior to the study? \nThe mental health of the Colorado inmates when they entered AS is very important, as are the conditions \nthey arrived from prior to the start of the study. Needless to say, it puts the Colorado study in different \nlight if many participants were actually in segregation prior to the start of the study. Unfortunately, the \nColorado study is somewhat unclear about this. \n6     Corrections & Mental Health \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 12 PageID #:\n 2333\nThe Colorado report states that “all study participants classified to AS were waitlisted for and placed in \nCSP,” which as far as I understand means that they were living in AS conditions when waiting for their AS \nhearing. The introduction to the report says something slightly different, however, when it states that “in \nthe time leading up to and during their AS hearing, inmates have typically been in segregation.” So some \nprisoners were apparently not in segregation? The Colorado authors “recognized that significant changes \ncould occur while inmates were held in segregation at their originating facility.” Therefore, they collected a \npre-baseline measure “as close to the AS hearing as possible.”   \nIn order to use the study to discuss the effects of solitary confinement, we need to know exactly how \nmany were in segregation prior to the study and, even more importantly, we need to know for how long \nthose subjected to a pre-baseline measure had been in segregation before they were subjected to the \npre-baseline measure. This information is crucial and seems lacking in the report. All we are told is that \npre-baseline measures were collected “as close to the AS hearing as possible.” But what does this mean \nin practice? The question, of course, involves the extent to which participants were possibly affected by \nsolitary confinement prior to the start of the study. This is important since we know from other research \nthat reactions to solitary confinement vary from one individual to another, but they “often set in very \nquickly.” (Thelle & Traeholt, 2003, p.769)  \nThe Colorado report concludes that “all of the study groups, with the exception of the GP-NMI group, \nshowed symptoms that were associated with the SHU syndrome. These elevations were present from the \nstart and were more serious for the mentally ill than non-mentally ill.”  So if many study participants had \nbeen subjected to segregation prior to the study that would likely explain their symptoms. In other words, \nthe study participants were already damaged by solitary confinement when the study began, and the \nColorado study shows us  that these prisoners continued to show “symptoms that were associated with \nthe SHU syndrome” during their time in AS.  \nFurthermore, positive developments between the first and second test could be explained by the transfer \nfrom punitive segregation conditions to apparently better AS conditions, which include a more meaningful \nform of social contact (visits). Seen in this light, the results of the Colorado study are in line with previous \nresearch. The AS inmates in Colorado got slightly better when they had access to slightly more \nmeaningful social contact, but they remained in a very bad condition, and continued to show symptoms, \nas they stayed in solitary confinement. \nHow was the self-reported data obtained? \nAccording to the Colorado study, all the self-reported data were collected by one field researcher who \nwas a female university employee with CDOC training and badge that allowed her unescorted access to \nthe prison facilities. The field researcher had an undergraduate degree and is not the responsible author. \nThis is a very big difference in contrast to Danish and Norwegian studies, where the actual researchers \nwho designed the studies and wrote the reports were trained psychiatrists and psychologists and also \noperated as field researchers. They accessed the health of the study participants themselves and did the \nin-depth interviews. In my opinion, this is the only serious and professional way to design and conduct a \nstudy about health in prison, which includes obtaining data directly from prisoners. Sending a “researcher” \nwho is neither a health practitioner nor a PhD-level researcher with experience doing prison research, into \na prison in order to access the health of prisoners by collecting self-reported data simply means that the \n Effects of Solitary Confinement 7 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 12 PageID #:\n 2334\ndata are likely to be unreliable. That the field researcher had to report to an employee of the prison \nsystem studied (the leading author of the report) is also problematic. \n \nThe Colorado report itself describes instances in which the self-reported data appeared questionable. \nWhen this occurred, the field researcher apparently asked prisoners to retake the test if they admitted to \n“not being truthful.” If study participants said they were being honest and the researcher still did not \nbelieve them, she “marked the test as questionable.” This validation process seems outright naive. On \nwhat grounds did the university’s inexperienced field researcher assess whether or not the prisoners were \n“being truthful” about their psychological problems and mental health? This obviously requires education, \nexperience, and psychological or medical knowledge. Seen in this light, it is interesting to note that when \nthe Colorado study authors removed persons “with questionable or inconsistent responses” it “did not \nchange the overall effects and results” so they used all the responses in their analysis. This raises serious \nquestions about the field researcher's capacity to assess whether or not the prisoners were 'truthful' \nand, once again, raises questions about the reliability of all of the self-reported data. \n \nProfessional researchers report that it can be difficult to learn about symptoms suffered by isolated \ninmates since many (male prisoners in particular) try to hide their condition (Smith, 2006).  Researchers \nalso explain that it is often extremely difficult, traumatic, and painful for formerly isolated individuals to talk \nabout their experience of solitary confinement: “A few studies seem to explain the fact that some inmates \ndo not complain and seem to adapt more or less peacefully to solitary confinement as a sign of a healthy \ncoping strategy, while others explain this as an unhealthy sign of social withdrawal typically accompanied \nby severe psychological problems. Such problems often will be discovered only by personal in-depth \ninterviews in a positive (therapeutic) atmosphere.” (Smith, 2006, p. 474; see also Koch, 1982; Toch, \n1992; Jackson, 1983) \nKing, who has interviewed many supermax prisoners, observes that a significant number of these \nprisoners “found it extremely difficult to bring themselves to talk about their experience” and only after \n“considerable persistence some prisoners came to regard a researcher from another culture, who treated \nthem with respect and clearly wanted to learn, as an acceptable proxy and began to open up.” (King, \n2005, p.130) \nFurthermore, the study authors made a mistake by advising inmates that “the purpose of the study was to \nlearn about their adjustment to prison.”  It is well known that within a prison community it is important for \nprisoners to seem capable of adjusting to prison, and those who do not manage to do this are typically \nplaced at the bottom of the prison hierarchy. Approaching study participants with an overall question \nregarding “their adjustment to prison” in other words makes it likely that they will try to hide possible \nweaknesses and try to convey the impression that they cope and adjust relatively well. In a prison \ncontext, it is not an “open” but a “leading” question. \n \n \n \n8     Corrections & Mental Health \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 12 PageID #:\n 2335\nCrisis events, hospitalization, and objective data \nThe Colorado researchers describe initial attempts to include “crisis events” such as self-mutilation or \nsuicide attempts recorded by prison clinicians in their study, but they decided not to, because the number \nof participants who experienced these events allegedly was too small and because crisis events could \noccur without staff’s knowledge. The authors conclude that the available data “raise more questions than \nthey provide answers.” If we look carefully at these data, however, they certainly raise some questions. \nIf we compare the number of crisis events among the mentally ill in GP and in AS, we find that throughout \nthe study two persons had two crisis events in the former group, while 10 persons had 26 crisis events in \nthe latter group (one suicide attempt, 14 cases of suicidal/self harm ideation, and 11 cases of self \nharming behavior). This seems a significant difference with respect to important behaviors that have been \nidentified in past research as among the adverse effects of solitary confinement. The numbers are small, \nbut, still, five times as many prisoners in the AS-MI group had crisis events compared to the GP-MI group, \nand 13 times as many crisis events occurred in the AS-MI group compared to the GP-MI group. \nFurthermore, 11 crisis events in the AS-MI group were associated with psychotic symptoms compared to \none such crisis event in the GP-MI group. \nThese data are important in two ways. They suggest that solitary confinement had a negative impact on \nthe health of the mentally ill, but also, even more importantly, they seriously question the reliability of the \nstudy’s   self-reported data. These crisis event data raise questions about why the difference among the \nAS-MI and GP-MI groups was not found through the self-reported data. After all, a significant number of \nparticipants in the AS-MI group had crisis events and the prevalence of these events were much higher \nthan in the GP-MI group. Furthermore, such crisis events would normally be considered “the tip of the \niceberg.” A likely hypothesis would be that a prison environment producing significantly more self-harm \nand suicidal thoughts than other prison regimes would also reveal many more “lesser” psychological \nproblems. One cannot help asking how and why the Colorado researchers chose to ignore this data, \nwhich in fact questions the entire setup of their study? \n \nConclusion \nThe Colorado study suffers from several major problems. First, some of the most relevant research \navailable was not used and it was wrongfully claimed that previous research was biased and flawed. \nSecondly, the way the self-reported data was collected very likely made these data unreliable. Thirdly, the \nstudy authors ignored that their crisis data seriously questioned the validity of their self-reported data and \nin fact suggested that AS might have serious ill effects. Fourth, the majority of the study participants \napparently came directly from segregation, and were thus likely to be harmed from solitary confinement \nbefore the study started. Finally, the Colorado study in fact did not compare segregation/solitary \nconfinement with non-segregation/solitary confinement since most of the GP participants also went into \nsolitary confinement during the study. Imagine a similar situation with, for example, medical research on \nthe effects of a new type of medicine where it turns out that most of the control group participants also \nreceived the new medicine being tested both during the study and prior to study start. It does not make \nsense. It is therefore extremely difficult to gain any valuable information about the effects of AS and \nsolitary confinement from the Colorado Study. \n Effects of Solitary Confinement 9 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-18   Filed 06/21/19   Page 11 of 12 PageID #:\n 2336\nAuthor note: Peter Scharff Smith, Ph.D., has studied the history, practice, and effects of solitary \nconfinement for more than a decade, Currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Danish Institute of \nHuman Rights, his published articles on solitary confinement have appeared in, for example, Crime and \nJustice, Criminal Justice & Behavior, Torture, and Punishment & Society.

The same\nprocedure was undertaken 30 days later, and again 60 days later.\nSegregatedp  risoners had similar education levels, offence histories and\ncriminogenic needs than non-segregatedp risoners. Segregatedp risoners\nhad distinctp ersonalities,h owever,a  nd were higher risk cases than non-\nsegregated prisoners. Overall, segregatedp risoners had poorer mental\nhealth and psychologicalf unctioning. There was no evidence, however,\nthat, over a  period of 60 days, the mental health and psychological\nfunctioning of segregatedp risoners significantly deteriorated.\nIn  Canada, the percentage of segregated prisoners has more\nthan  doubled  in  the  last  ten  years,  now  representing\napproximately  5.5%  of federally  sentenced  prisoners  (Pierson\n1988; Kane 1997).  However, little research has been conducted\non these prisoners.  Moreover, many scholars have assessed the\nliterature  on penal  segregation  as sparse, conflicting,  rife with\nspeculations,  and  based upon  far-fetched  extrapolations  and\ngeneralizations  (Barak-Glantz 1983; Brodsky and Scogin  1988;\nSuedfeld,  Ramirez,  Deaton,  and Baker-Brown  1982; Wormith,\nTellier, and Gendreau  1988).\nNotwithstanding the inadequacy of the existing research, two\nconflicting perspectives on the effects of segregation on prisoners\nhave emerged.  Some researchers describe segregation as \"cruel\nand  unusual  punishment\" and  psychologically  damaging\n(Benjamin  and  Lux  1975;  1977;  Grassian  1983;  Immarigeon\n1992;  Jackson  1983;  Korn  1988;  Luise  1989;  Martel  1999),\nwhereas  others provide  evidence  that segregation  has little,  if\nany,  negative  psychological  effect  on prisoners  (Bonta and\nGendreau  1995;  Ecclestone,  Gendreau,  and  Knox  1974;\nGendreau,  Freedman,  Wilde,  and  Scott  1972;  Gendreau  and\nBonta  1984; Suedfeld  et al. 1982).\nResolving  the question of the impact of segregation  carries\nimportant policy implications for areas such as: (a)  the level and\nfrequency of monitoring and assessment required for prisoners\nin  segregation  (mandatory vs. upon request);  (b)  programming\nto reduce  mental  health  deterioration  (need for,  and type  of,\nintervention  programs);  and  (c)  the  adequacy  of  current\nassessment strategies (what aspects of psychosocial functioning\nare  important  to  assess,  and  which  are  less  affected  by\nsegregation).\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 39 PageID #:\n 2356\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nThis  article  contains  two  sections.  First,  a  review  of\nmethodological issues highlights the current unsatisfactory state\nof the literature on the effects of segregation.  This review shows\nthat supporters of one view often fail to appreciate the findings\nof the opposing view, as well as to recognize  the limitations of\ntheir own findings when drawing their conclusions.  The ability\nto generalize  the results of these studies is  affected to varying\ndegrees by improper attention to methodological  shortcomings\nof the research conducted.  Second,  the findings of a  research\nproject  which  addressed  the  shortcomings  of the  existing\nliterature is presented.\nPart  I: Evaluation  of existing  research  on\nsegregation:  A  review  of  methodological\nshortcomings\n1.  Reliance  on  qualitative data  (casual  observations,\ninterviews  and  anecdotes)\nMany authors use anecdotal evidence to support their claims\n(Benjamin  and Lux  1975,  1977;  Brodsky  and  Scogin  1988;\nGrassian 1983; Jackson 1983; Korn  1988; Martel 1999).  These\nauthors often take selected but powerful excerpts from interviews\nof segregated  prisoners  or  mental  health  professionals  with\nexperience with segregated prisoners to provide general evidence\nof the  harmful  effects  of segregation.  Some  authors  rely on\ntestimony on the use of isolation in  the 19th century to produce\ncorroborative  evidence  of the harmful effects  of segregation  in\ntoday's correctional context  (Grassian 1983; Immarigeon  1992;\nLuise  1989).  Others  cite  human  rights  violation litigation  to\ndepict the general conditions  of confinement  and treatment  of\nsegregated prisoners,  as well as the psychological  and physical\nharm that ensues (Benjamin and Lux  1977; Birkinshaw  1981;\nJackson  1983; Luise 1989).\nThe  evidence  of the  damaging  effects  of  segregation  on\nprisoners  adduced  by  these  authors  is  very  disturbing,  and\ncannot be ignored.  Because of the nature of the methodology, it\nis  often  unclear whether  the  pathologies  displayed  by some\nsegregated prisoners were directly attributable to the conditions\nof  confinement  in  segregation  or whether  these  prisoners\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 39 PageID #:\n 2357\nCanadian Journal of Criminology January2 001\ndisplayed similar pathologies in the general prisoner population\nor in  the community, prior to being segregated  (Gendreau and\nBonta  1984).\nIn addition, Suedfeld et al. (1982) found that some authors\ninappropriately use findings from case studies of persons who\nexperienced  severe abuse and sensory  deprivation to illustrate\nthe  damaging  effects  of segregation.  Testimony  of tortured\npolitical  and  war  prisoners  who  were  denied  food,  clothing,\nmedical assistance  and procedural  fairness are at times relied\nupon  to  establish  the  damaging  effects  of segregation  in\ncontemporary  North American  correctional  settings  (Benjamin\nand Lux 1975; Korn 1988).  The generalization of the findings of\nthese case  studies has been questioned  (Gendreau and Bonta\n1984; Suedfeld et al. 1982).  Isolation in a political or war camp\nis  not  comparable  to  the  highly  regulated  and  formalized\nprocedures  for  imposing  segregation  on prisoners  in  North\nAmerican penitentiaries.  Conditions of confinement, procedural\nsafeguards, and the level of safety and security provided to the\nprisoners differ to such an extent that a comparison may well be\ninappropriate  (Gendreau and Bonta  1984; Suedfeld et al. 1982).\n2.  Conditions of confinement\nOne of the problems  with segregation research  stems  from\ndifficulties  in defining  the constructs  being  evaluated.  Many\nterms, such as administrative segregation, dissociation, isolation,\nseclusion, protective custody, and solitary confinement are used,\noften  interchangeably,  to  describe various  restrictive  environ-\nments.  These terms encompass  a  wide range  of conditions of\nconfinement in which the number of restrictions on freedom of\nassociation  and freedom  of movement may vary, and in  which\nlevels of perceptual deprivation, sensory deprivation, and social\nisolation may also vary.  There is such a diversity in  the nature\nof conditions of confinement used in  segregation  research that\naggregating  all studies under the  same \"solitary  confinement\"\nlabel has been described by some as inappropriate  (Suedfeld et\nal. 1982).\nMany authors recognize the importance of the environment\nwith respect to its impact upon the segregation  experience and\nthe difficulty associated with generalizing results (Grassian 1983).\nConditions  of confinement  and  daily  routine  vary so  greatly\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 39 PageID #:\n 2358\nThe effects of administrative segregation\namong correctional institutions (Kane 1997; Vantour 1975) that\nresults  derived  from  one  institutional  setting  may  not  be\napplicable to others.  For example,  the frequency and quality of\ninteractions with staff or other prisoners, the physical layout of\nsegregation cells (e.g., solid doors, cell size, etc.),  the size of the\nexercise  yard,  the  availability  of recreational  equipment and\nhobby items, and the access to personal effects, programs, and\nservices, may all affect the segregation experience.  As a result,\nthe majority of studies describe, at great length, the conditions\nof confinement and the daily routine of segregated prisoners being\nstudied.\nMany authors have reviewed the proliferation of control units\nin the United States and abroad in an attempt to determine their\neffects  on prisoners'  mental  and  physical health  (Birkinshaw\n1981;  Coyle  1987;  Dowker  and  Good  1993;  Korn  1988:\nImmarigeon  1992).  The  establishment of control  units in  the\nUnited States originated in 1963 when a penitentiary in  Marion\n(Illinois) was built to replace Alcatraz (Coyle  1987).  Since then,\nmore  than  33  States  have  comparable  Marion-like  facilities\n(Immarigeon 1992).  Control units provide a good illustration of\nthe difficulty in defining the constructs being evaluated. Although\ncontrol  units  are  not formally  recognized  by  correctional\nauthorities as segregation units, and although they sometimes\nimpose  fewer  restrictions  on  prisoners  than  in  traditional\nsegregation units, they often impose many similar conditions of\nconfinement (Coyle 1987;  Dowker and Good  1993; Immarigeon\n1992;  Korn  1988).  For  example,  Dowker  and  Good  (1993)\ndescribe  some  of the defining  features  of these  institutions.\nPrisoners are confined in  small cells for 22 or 23 hours per day.\nThe cells are often equipped with solid steel doors, which prevent\nany communication  between  prisoners.  Further,  these\ninstitutions  are  often equipped  with  remote  electronic  sliding\ndoors,  which  minimize,  if not eliminate,  most contact  with\ncorrectional  staff.  There are no communal dining, exercise,  or\nreligious services,  and few, if any, work opportunities.\n3.  Relevance  of field and  laboratory  experiments  on\nsensory  deprivation\nMost of the experimental studies on the effects of segregation\ncome from the field of sensory  deprivation.  Gendreau  and his\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 39 PageID #:\n 2359\nRevue canadienned e criminologie janvier 2001\ncolleagues have generated and evaluated many theories and hy-\npotheses  on  sensory  deprivation  in  the  correctional  context.\nFor  example,  Gendreau  and  colleagues  examined  whether:\nisolated  prisoners show higher arousal potential because  of a\nlower arousal level induced by solitary confinement  (Gendreau\net at. 1972); segregation enhances learning (Gendreau, McLean,\nParsons, Drake,  and Ecclestone  1970); isolated subjects desire\na  lower level of stimulation (visual and auditory sensory input)\nafter a deprivation experience (Gendreau, Freedman, Wilde,  and\nScott  1968);  and  stress levels,  as  indicated  by adrenocortical\nactivity,  can  detect  whether  solitary  confinement  is  harmful\n(Ecclestone et al. 1974).\nOthers  have  commented  upon  or  tested  theories  and\nhypotheses  of sensory  deprivation  in  the correctional  context\nas well.  For  example,  Benjamin  and  Lux  (1977)  argue  that\nsegregation is harmful because it dramatically reduces levels of\nneeded  stimulation.  Dowker  and  Good  (1993)  believe  that\nprisoners who are  segregated  for long periods  of time may be\ndeprived  of necessary  meaningful  human  contacts,  and,  as  a\nresult, these prisoners  have difficulties  in  coping with normal\nsocial situations again.\nSuedfeld et al. (1982) argue that the comparison between field\nor laboratory experiments  on isolation  and stimulus reduction\nand today's typical North American segregation environment is\ninappropriate.  They  contend  that  it  is  highly questionable\nwhether  the  typical  segregation  unit in  fact  imposes  much\nreduction  in  stimulus input.  They state that most segregated\nprisoners can communicate with guards and other prisoners and\nhave  access  to reading  material,  mail, lawyers,  other visitors,\nand  frequently  possess  radios  and television  sets.  Gendreau\nand  Bonta (1984) argue that the conditions  of confinement in\nmany of the sensory deprivation and isolation experiments  are\nmore severe than those found in today's segregation units.  They\nargue  that, since these field  and laboratory  experiments show\nlittle  support  for  the  position  that  sensory  deprivation  and\nisolation are psychologically  damaging, the conclusions drawn\nfrom these studies are especially informative and relevant.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 39 PageID #:\n 2360\nThe effects of administrative segregation\n4.  Selection  of subjects\n4.1  Use  of Volunteers.  Experimental  studies  on segregation\nrely primarily  on volunteers who  agree to be segregated  for a\nfixed period of time.  Some authors have been reluctant to accept\nresults of studies which have relied on volunteers (Arbour 1996;\nJackson 1983; Vantour 1975).  Walters, Callagan, and Newman\n(1963) believe  that the problem  with using volunteers  is  that\nthey are apparently not too frightened by the prospect of facing\na  few  days  of isolation,  and  they  may have  personality\ncharacteristics and past experiences which enable them to cope\nwith, and remain unaffected by, segregation.\nIn  Canada,  approximately  half of all  prisoners  placed  in\nsegregation  are  confined  against their will  (Kane  1997).  In\naddition, it  is  questionable  whether \"voluntary\" segregation  is\ntruly voluntary.  Arguably, most prisoners would prefer to remain\nin  the general prisoner population if the threat to their personal\nsafety was to be removed.  Nonetheless, some authors claim that,\nbased  on  their \"clinical  experience\",  prisoners  who  initially\nstrongly object to being placed in  segregation appear to adapt as\nwell as prisoners  who voluntarily request isolation  (Ecclestone\net at. 1974; Gendreau  et al. 1972).\nIn  addition  to  the  issue  of using  volunteers,  the  use  of\nalternative populations  may also lead to limited generalization\nof findings.  For example, the use of university students who, in\ngeneral, exhibit good adjustment, stable personality, and higher\nlevels of intelligence,  education,  and socioeconomic status may\nnot lead to accurate  comparisons with the segregated  prisoner\npopulation.  Suedfeld et al. (1982) argue that attempting to use\nfindings from these  sources  as an indication  of what one  can\nexpect from prisoners in  segregation is inappropriate  because it\nis  not relevant to  the phenomenon  being evaluated.  The high\nprevalence of severe mental disorders among segregated prisoners\n(Hodgins and Cote 1991) makes any comparison with university\nstudent samples somewhat questionable.\n4.2  Use  of  prisoners  involved  in  human rights violation\nlitigation.  Some studies on the negative  effects of segregation\nhave relied on segregated prisoners who were involved in  lawsuits\nalleging  violations  of their constitutional  rights  (Brodsky and\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 39 PageID #:\n 2361\nCanadianJ ournalo f Criminology January 2001\nScogin 1988; Grassian 1983).  Subjects involved in human rights\nviolation litigation may have a special interest in demonstrating\nthat their conditions of confinement have negative psychological\nand physiological effects.  Therefore, the results of studies which\nrely on such prisoners will always remain questionable.  Further,\nSuedfeld et al. (1982) suggest that prisoners engaged  in  litiga-\ntion are perhaps  not representative  of average  prisoners;  their\nreactions  to  segregation  may  not be  the  norm.  Similarly,\nGendreau and Bonta (1984) question the reliability of information\nof case studies performed by Jackson (1983).  They suggest that\nmany of Jackson's interviewed prisoners were notorious, far from\nrepresentative,  and had filed  an inordinately large  number  of\ngrievances, legitimate or otherwise, against the prison system.\n4.3  Screening  out  subjects  with  psychiatric  history.  A\nsignificant proportion of segregated prisoners have a psychiatric\nhistory (Hodgins and Cote  1991;  Motiuk and Blanchette  1997).\nSome  studies purporting to  examine the impact of segregation\nhave  screened-out  such  subjects  (Ecclestone  et al.  1974;\nGendreau  et al. 1972).  As a  result, findings from these studies\nmay be difficult to apply to the population of segregated prisoners.\nHodgins  and Cote  (1991)  report that, in  their sample  of 32\nlong term segregated prisoners, 31% suffered from some kind of\nsevere lifetime mental disorder (25% schizophrenia, 3. 1% major\ndepression, and 3.1% bipolar disorder).  The rate of schizophrenia\namong this sample  was more  than three times  the rate of the\ndisorder  among  non-segregated  prisoners.  The  rate  of major\ndepression in their sample was lower than the rate in the general\nprisoner population. This suggests that non-disruptive mentally-\nill prisoners  may  remain  in  the general  prisoner population,\nwhereas prisoners who are \"disturbed and disruptive\" are isolated\nfrom the general  prisoner population.\nWormith et al. (1988) evaluated the attributes of prisoners in\nprotective custody (PC) in a provincial institution.  PC prisoners\ntypically can associate among themselves but do not have access\nto the same level of programs, services, and privileges offered to\nthe general prisoner population.  They found that PC prisoners\nwere more likely to have a history of psychiatric problems. They\nsuggest  that  PC  prisoners'  psychological  weaknesses  and\nidiosyncratic behaviours may not be well tolerated by the general\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 39 PageID #:\n 2362\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nprisoner population, and it appears that inappropriate behaviours\nare  often punished  regardless  of the underlying  basis for the\nconduct (Carriere 1989;  Gendreau, Tellier, and Wormith  1985;\nRold  1992).  Consequently,  numerous  prisoners  with  mental\ndisorders are segregated (Gendreau et at. 1985; Rold  1992).\nLittle research has focused  on the effects of segregation  on\nprisoners with psychiatric conditions.  Many authors argue that\nsegregation can exacerbate some existing psychiatric conditions\n(Haney 1993; Hodgins  and Cote  1991; Wadeson and Carpenter\n1976).  For example,  Wadeson and Carpenter (1976) concluded\nthat segregation stimulates hallucinatory activity and provokes\nparanoia among some mental health patients.\nThe  existence  of psychiatric  problems  may very  well be  a\ndefining characteristic of the population of segregated prisoners.\nMoreover,  findings  from the studies  reviewed  above  underline\nthe  importance  of not restricting  research  samples  to those\nwithout a history of psychiatric disorders.\n5.  Reasons  for segregation\nPrisoners  may  voluntarily  request  segregation  or  be\ninvoluntarily segregated for a multitude of reasons (Kane 1997;\nGendreau  et al. 1985; Wormith et al. 1988).  The most common\nreasons given by prisoners for seeking various forms of PC and\nsegregation  include:  conflicts  in the  general  population  (e.g.,\ngambling and drug debts); the nature of the prisoner's offense;\nwhether the prisoner  is suspected  of being an informant;  the\nexistence  of personality  problems;  the  presence  of phobias\n(including fear of gays); being  the target of sexual aggression;\nand  escaping  the  crowded  and  often violent  atmosphere  of\nmaximum security (Gendreau et al. 1985).\nAs noted above, approximately 50% of segregation placements\nare involuntary in nature (Kane 1997).  Research on segregation\nthus far has failed to assess the effects of long term segregation\non these prisoners.  Such an omission has rendered generaliza-\ntion of findings even more difficult.  For example, the underlying\nreasons for segregating prisoners may influence their abilities to\ncope with the experience  (Weinberg  1967).  Whether  they view\ntheir placement in segregation as a result of their own behaviour\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 11 of 39 PageID #:\n 2363\nRevue canadienned e criminologie janvier 2001\nor as the  result of being an innocent victim of circumstances\nbeyond their control may influence their ability to cope with the\nmore restrictive regime of segregation.\n6.  Attrition\nSome segregation studies reported attrition among subjects\nparticipating in the experimental condition (i.e., segregation), and\nprovided  little,  if  any,  explanations  (Ecclestone  et  al. 1974;\nWalters et al. 1963; Weinberg  1967; Zubek, Bayer, and Shephard\n1969).  For example,  Ecclestone  et al. (1974) reported  a  32%\nattrition rate, and Weinberg (1967) reported a 68% attrition rate.\nEven when more than adequate monetary incentives are provided,\nattrition has  been  reported  (Bexton, Heron,  and  Scott  1954;\nZubek et al. 1969).\nAttrition  is  a  major  drawback  to  psychological  research  in\ngeneral.  The problem with attrition is especially relevant to the\nevaluation of the psychological  effects of segregation.  Subjects\nwho decide  no longer to  participate  in  the  experiment may be\nthe same individuals who would not cope well with the conditions\nof segregation and would be negatively affected by them.\n7.  Reliance  on  cross-sectional research\nCross-sectional  research  is  inadequate  for  evaluating  the\neffects of segregation.  The results of cross-sectional segregation\nresearch are limited to the identification of differences between\ngroups (segregated and non-segregated).  The results of this type\nof research  do not permit inferences  concerning the causes of\nthese  differences  (Suedfeld  et al.  1982).  Nevertheless,  after\nconducting a cross-sectional study and observing poorer mental\nand physical health among segregated prisoners than among non-\nsegregated prisoners, some authors have attributed the cause of\nsuch poorer  health to  segregation  (Brodsky and Scogin  1988;\nMiller and Young 1997).  The possibility that segregated prisoners\nalready were of poorer mental and physical health prior to their\nsegregation  must  at  least  be  considered  as an  alternative\nexplanation  in cross-sectional  studies.\n8.  Duration  and  indeterminate  nature  of stay\nAnother  problem  with  current  experimental  studies  on\nsegregation surrounds the issue of the length and indeterminate\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 12 of 39 PageID #:\n 2364\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nnature of the stay (Jackson 1983; Suedfeld et al. 1982).  In pre-\nvious experimental  research, the length of stay is limited to ten\ndays or less (e.g., 2 days: Gendreau  et al. 1970; 4 days: Walters\net al. 1963; 5 days: Weinberg 1967; 7 days: Gendreau et al. 1972;\nGendreau et al. 1968; Gendreau, Horton, Hooper, Freedman, and\nScott 1968; Zubek et al. 1969;  10 days: Ecclestone  et al. 1974).\nMoreover,  volunteers  for these studies know exactly  when the\nexperiment will end, and that they can end their participation at\nwill.\nThe reality of segregation is that the length of stay is always\nunknown,  and more than 80% of prisoners spend more than 10\ndays in segregation at any one time (Kane 1997).  Suedfeld et al.\n(1982) argue that making general  statements on the effects  of\nsegregation without qualifying the length of stay is inappropriate.\nBonta  and  Gendreau  (1995)  specifically  state that  their con-\nclusion that segregation is not detrimental only applies to periods\nof segregation  of  10 days  or  less.  As  these  studies  confirm,\ngeneralizing the results of experimental studies beyond  10 days\nis questionable.\n9.  Lack  of comparison  group\nSome  studies  utilizing  structured  and  non-structured\ninterviews  with segregated  prisoners  have  failed  to  include  a\ncomparison  group  of non-segregated  prisoners  (Brodsky and\nScogin 1988; Grassian 1983; Martel 1999).  Brodsky and Scogin\n(1988)  interviewed  45  segregated  prisoners  about  their\nconfinement in solitary confinement but did not include a control\ngroup.  Although they reported disturbing negative psychological\nand  physiological  effects,  since  no comparison  group  was\nincluded,  the  results  are  of little  value  because  it  remains\nundetermined  whether  prisoners  in  the  general  prisoner\npopulation  would  have  reported  similar  effects  about  their\nconfinement in the general prisoner population.\n10.  Prisoner/staff  interaction  and  the  punitive reality of\nsegregation\nSeveral authors have suggested that the relationship between\nstaff and prisoners is an important factor which may affect how\nprisoners cope with segregation (Benjamin and Lux 1977: Bonta\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 13 of 39 PageID #:\n 2365\nCanadianJ ournalo f Criminology January2 001\nand Gendreau  1995;  Carriere 1989; Gendreau and Bonta 1984;\nKorn  1988; Suedfeld et at. 1982; Vantour  1975; Wormith  et al.\n1988).  Prisoners may be more affected by the way they are treated\nby correctional  staff than  by the  conditions  of confinement\ntypically found in  North American segregation units (Bonta and\nGendreau  1995; Gendreau and Bonta  1984; Vantour  1975).\nBonta and Gendreau (1995) argue that there is some evidence\nthat, when prisoners are treated capriciously by management or\ncorrectional  staff, psychological  stress  can result even  in  the\nmost humane  of prison  environments.  Harassment,  physical\nviolence,  enforcement  and  non-enforcement  of  rules,  and\nunpredictable withholding of privileges may play a greater role\nthan complaints about physical conditions, the social isolation\nand the sensory deprivation associated with segregation (Suedfeld\net al. 1982).\nMany  authors  have  found  that contrary  to legislative  and\npolicy provisions, the management of administrative segregation\nis based on a punitive philosophy, and that segregated prisoners\nhave fewer rights, privileges, and access to programs and services\nthan prisoners in the general prisoner population (Arbour 1996;\nCarriere 1989; Gendreau et al. 1985; Kane 1997; Tellier, Wormith,\nand Gendreau 1989; Vantour 1975).  For example, Arbour (1996:\nxiii)  concluded  that the  Correctional  Service  of  Canada's\nmanagement of administrative segregation was not in accordance\nwith the law and its policies, and demonstrated a systemic \"prison\nculture which did not value individual rights\".\nWormith,  Tellier,  and  Gendreau  (1988)  reported  that\ncorrectional employees  often have negative views  towards, and\ndiscriminate against, segregated prisoners.  They found that PC\nprisoners complained  about the  attitudes  of correctional  staff\ntowards them and the adverse psychological  effects of being in\nPC, whereas prisoners in the general population were more likely\nto complain  about  institutional  living  conditions,  rules  and\nregulations.  Similarly, Carriere (1989) states that PC prisoners\nare often treated in a demeaning manner by correctional  staff.\nFurther, he contends  that segregated  prisoners  are  treated as\nmaximum security prisoners regardless of the security risk they\npose.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 14 of 39 PageID #:\n 2366\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nFor generalization purposes, the evaluation of the effects of\nsegregation  must include  real  interactions  between  staff and\nprisoners, and should not be limited to courteous interactions\ntypically found in  laboratory experiments.\n11.  Personality\nThe prisoners' personality  or temperament  may play a  role\nin how they will be  affected  by segregation.  Some personality\ncharacteristics may reduce tolerance for segregation, while other\ncharacteristics may enhance it (Suedfeld et al.  1982; Walters et\nal. 1963).  Little, if any, research on the effects of segregation\nhas focused on personality.  Assessment of personality must be\nincluded in segregation research in  order to identify prisoners'\nabilities and predispositions  to cope with segregation.\n12.  Other  factors\nSegregation  may  have  a  detrimental  impact on  prisoners'\nchances  of parole, reduce their chances of being admitted to a\nhalf-way house, and affect their security classification  (Carriere\n1989;  Gendreau  et al. 1985;  Tellier, Wormith,  and  Gendreau\n1989).  Knowledge  of these consequences may negatively affect\nhow prisoners  adapt  to  segregation.  Further, a  prisoner who\nwas housed in a single cell prior to segregation may be reassigned\nto a \"double-bunked\" cell after a placement in  segregation.  This\nfuture loss of privacy  may also affect how prisoners cope with\nthe experience of segregation.\nComplaints about other issues such as cold food and delayed\nresponse to requests for assistance  (e.g., medication, telephone\ncalls, counselors, reading material, etc.) may also influence the\nsegregation experience (Suedfeld et al. 1982).  In the segregation\nenvironment,  these  complaints  cannot  be  viewed  as  trivial\nbecause they are often the only distractions available  to break\nthe monotony of the segregation experience.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 15 of 39 PageID #:\n 2367\nRevue canadienne de criminologie janver 2001\nPart  I1:  Longitudinal study on  the\npsychological effects  of 60  days\nin  administrative  segregation\nMethod\nDesign  and  procedures\nParticipants\nParticipants included prisoners from Kingston, Collins Bay,\nand Millhaven Penitentiaries  who had either been (a) placed in\nadministrative  segregation and remained  in segregation for 60\ndays (quasi-experimental group),  or (b) randomly selected from\nthe  general  prisoner population  and  remained  in the  general\nprisoner population for 60 days (comparison group).  Data were\ncollected over an eight month period beginning in October  1997.\nTesting  and  procedures\nSenior psychologists at the selected institutions supervised\nthe  data  collection.  The  psychologists  selected  and  trained/\noriented three research assistants (RA's) concerning institutional\nsecurity  protocols  and  the  use  of the  psychological  testing\ninstruments.  The RA's were graduates or students of psychology\n(one 4th year student, one M.A. candidate, and one M.A.).\nPrisoners who were just placed (voluntarily and involuntarily)\nin administrative segregation and provided their informed consent\nwere asked to complete written psychological tests and take part\nin a structured interview.  After each session, participants were\ndebriefed.  The same procedure was  undertaken 30 days later\nand again  60 days later if the  prisoners remained  segregated.\nNon-segregated prisoners were selected at random and underwent\nthe same testing procedures at the same intervals.\nMeasures\nThe initial testing session (session one) lasted approximately\ntwo hours.  In addition to the battery of tests which were utilized\nat each session, the initial session included a general measure\nof intelligence  and  a  short  personality  inventory.  Because\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 16 of 39 PageID #:\n 2368\nThe effects of administratives egregation\nperformance on these additional instruments was not expected\nto  fluctuate  over  60 days,  these measures  were  administered\nonly once.  The  follow-up  assessments  conducted  at 30 days\n(session two) and 60 days (session three) were therefore shorter,\neach lasting  approximately  one  hour.  The  comparison  group\nunderwent the same testing procedure as the segregated group.\nThe measures which were selected for use in this study were\nchosen based on several criteria.  Measures were selected which\npossessed  acceptable  psychometric  properties,  had a  short\nadministration time, and had been previously used with prisoner\nsamples.  Consideration was also given to measures which had\nbeen used in previous segregation research.  Table  1 illustrates\nthe list of measures which were selected  for use in  this study\nand their respective alphas (reliability estimates which measure\ninternal consistency).\nAdditional data  collection.\nPhysical  conditions.  Research  assistants  gathered\ninformation on the physical layout of the segregation units.\nPrisoner intake  assessment.  All  prisoners  sentenced  to\npenitentiaries (i.e.,  for prison terms exceeding  two years) must\ncomplete  the  Offender  Intake  Assessment  (OIA)  prior  to  their\npenitentiary placement.  In most instances,  the OIA lasts eight\nweeks, and allows  Correctional Service Canada (CSC) to render\ninformed decisions with respect to placement, classification, and\nprogramming.  During  the  OIA,  information  on prisoners  is\ncollected and stored on the computerized Offender Management\nSystem (OMS).\nOIA information was retrieved on prisoners' current and past\ncriminal  history  and  the  seven  need  domains  (Employment,\nMarital/Family,  Associates,  Substance  Abuse,  Community\nFunctioning,  Personal /Emotional,  and  Attitude).  Prisoners'\nscores  on  the  Statistical Information  on  Recidivism  (Nuffield\n1982; SIR Scale) were also retrieved.  The SIR score provides an\nestimate of the probability that an individual will re-offend within\nthree years after release.  Each prisoner's total score on the SIR\nScale can range from -30 (very poor risk) to + 27 (very good risk).\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 17 of 39 PageID #:\n 2369\nCanadianJ ournalo f Criminology January2 001\nTable I\nMeasures used and respective Alphas\nMeasures  (initial assessment only)  Alpha*\nInterview assessment  n/a\nNEO Personality Inventory (short form)\nNeuroticism  .84\nExtraversion  .70\nOpenness  .61\nAgreeableness  .71\nConscientiousness  .80\nShipley  n/a\nMeasures (all three sessions)  Alpha*\nAggression questionnaire  .89\nBalanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (short form)  .69**\nBeck Depression (abbreviated)  .89\nBrief Symptom Inventory\nSomatization  .86\nObsessive-compulsive  .83\nInterpersonal  .79\nDepression  .84\nAnxiety  .83\nHostility  .85\nPhobic anxiety  .80\nParanoid ideation  .80\nPsychoticism  .66\nHolden Psychological Screening Inventory  .84\nHopelessness scale  .89\nInterview assessment  n/a\nState-trait Anxiety Inventory (State-short form)  .83\nWAIS Sub-test: Digit Span  n/a\nWAIS Sub-test: Digit Symbol  n/a\nNote:  * Reliability estimates which measure internal consistency;  ** Items 4, 7 and 9\nwere removed to improve psychometric properties.\nResults\nDescriptive findings\nConditions  of confinement\nInformation on the conditions  of confinement of segregation\nunits at Collins Bay, Kingston, and Millhaven penitentiaries was\ncollected.

Table  3\nillustrates  the number  of completed  sessions  broken  down by\nGroup (i.e., segregated  vs. non-segregated) and institutions.  It\nshows  that  83  segregated  prisoners  and  53  non-segregated\nprisoners participated in  this study.  Complete data for all three\nsessions (60 days) were only available  for 23 segregated and 37\nnon-segregated prisoners.\nThe  loss  of participants  from  the  segregated  group  was\nprimarily due to releases to the general  prisoner population or\ntransitional units (i.e., protective  custody), or transfers to other\ninstitutions.  True  attrition,  the  refusal  to  participate  in  a\nsubsequent session, occurred in  nine cases (10.8%).  It  should\nbe noted that true attrition  included cases  in  which prisoners\nexpressed their intent to participate in the study but their conduct\njeopardized  the personal  safety  of the  RA's  (e.g.,  threats,  and\none incident in  which a prisoner attempted to grab an RA).  The\naverage elapsed time after placement in  segregation for session\none, two and three was 3.6, 29.8 and 57.8 days respectively.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 19 of 39 PageID #:\n 2371\nRevue canadienned e criminologie janvier 2001\nFor non-segregated  prisoners,  the loss of participants was\nmainly due to transfers to other institutions and placement in\nsegregation.

Moreover, voluntary cases were all seeking\nprotection, whereas the majority of involuntary cases (71%, n =\n36) were  legally  placed  in  administrative  segregation  for\njeopardizing the safety  of other prisoners,  staff, or the security\nof the institution.  After  60  days  the percentage  of voluntary\ncases increased to 57% (n = 13) and the percentage of involuntary\ncases decreased  to 43% (n =  10).\nDemographics\nAge.  Using t-tests, segregated prisoners were found to be younger\n(M = 28.9) than non-segregated  prisoners (M =  32.20,  t (134) =\n2.66,  p  <  .01).  The  age  of segregated  and  non-segregated\nprisoners ranged from 20 to 54 years old. Bivariate correlation\nanalyses showed  that Age was not significantly correlated  with\nany measure (i.e., dependent variable).\nRace.  The Offender Intake Assessment (OIA) was used to provide\nbackground information  on the prisoners.  OIA information on\nrace  was available  on  119  prisoners:  66% of prisoners  were\nCaucasian, 25% black, 7% aboriginal, and 3% from other visible\nminority  groups.  Among  segregated  prisoners  (n =  73),  the\npercentage  of Caucasians,  blacks, aboriginal, and other visible\nminority groups was 64%, 27%, 7%,  and  1% respectively.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 20 of 39 PageID #:\n 2372\nThe effects of administratives egregation\nEducation.  OIA information was used to assess the educational\nbackground of prisoners.  Using chi-square analyses, segregated\nand  non-segregated  offenders  did not  significantly  differ  in\neducational background.\nCriminal  history.  OIA  data also  provided  criminal  history\ninformation for 131 prisoners.  No significant difference between\nsegregated  and non-segregated  prisoners  on past and current\noffence history was found.  Similar non-significant findings were\nobtained on history of disciplinary infractions  (X2 (1,  N = 84) =\n1.93, p = 0.17), escape/UAL (X2 (1, N= 91) = 0.95, p = 0.33), and\nfailure on conditional releases (X2 (1, N = 91) = 0.95, p = 0.39).\nWith respect  to  session one segregated  prisoners  (n =  83),\nnine were  serving life sentences  (11%).  The  average  sentence\nlength (excluding life sentences;  n = 74) imposed by the courts\nfor their index offence was 6.97 years.\nOf the 53 session one non-segregated prisoners,  13 prisoners\nwere serving life sentences (25%).  The average sentence length\n(excluding life sentences;  n = 40) imposed by the courts for their\nindex offence was 5.98 years.\nCase needs.  Segregated and non-segregated  prisoners did not\nsignificantly differ on any of the OIA need domains (Employment,\nMarital/Family,  Associates,  Substance  Abuse,  Community\nFunctioning, Personal/Emotional,  and Attitude).\nSIR Scale.  Using t-tests, segregated prisoners were found to be\nhigher  risk  of recidivism  (M =  -8.26)  than  non-segregated\nprisoners  (M = -1.07,  t (110) = 4.70, p < .00 1).\nI.Q.  Estimates of I.Q. from the Shipley Institute of Living Scale-\nRevised  (Shipley 1940) were compared for segregated  and non-\nsegregated  prisoners.  Non-segregated  prisoners  (M = 97.25)\npossessed higher estimates of I.Q. than segregated prisoners (M\n= 89.70, t (131)  = 2.93, p < .01).\nPersonality.  Table 4 shows the differences between segregated\nand  non-segregated  prisoners  on the  \"big five\"  personality\nconstructs as assessed by the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-\nFFI; Costa and McCrae  1992).

True attrition cases (n = 9) were removed from the\nanalyses  because  they  could  have  been  part of the  group  of\nprisoners who stayed in segregation for all three sessions.\nNo significant  difference  was found between prisoners  who\nstayed in segregation for all three sessions (n = 23) and segregated\nprisoners who were released or transferred after session one or\ntwo (n  = 51).\nVoluntary versus involuntary cases.  Using the eight measures\nas DV's, t-tests were completed to evaluate whether voluntary (n\n=  32) and involuntary (n =  51)  cases differed in  mental health\nand psychological functioning.  Again, no significant difference\nwas found between voluntary and involuntary cases.\nInterview  assessment\nSuicide  ideation.  Prisoners were  asked questions on  suicide\nideation.  Prisoners who  completed  all three sessions (n =  60)\nwere asked if they ever thought of committing suicide.  At session\none, 40% (n = 9) of segregated and 33% (n = 12) of non-segregated\nprisoners responded \"yes\". When asked if they had ever attempted\nsuicide,  22%  (n =  5) of segregated  and  29% (n =  11)  of non-\nsegregated prisoners said \"yes\".\nAt each session, prisoners were asked if they had thought of\ncommitting suicide within the last week:  17% (n = 4) of segregated\nprisoners answered  \"yes\" at session one,  4% (n =  1) at session\ntwo,  and 4%  (n =  1) at session  three.  As  for non-segregated\nprisoners,  14%  (n  =  5),  11%  (n  =  4)  and  3% (n  =  1)  answered\n\"yes\" respectively.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 25 of 39 PageID #:\n 2377\nCanadianJ ournal of Criminology January 2001\nSegregation  experience.  Prisoners  who  completed  all  three\nsessions  (n  =  60) were  asked if they have ever been placed  in\nsegregation in the past. The vast majority of segregated (96%, n\n= 22) and non-segregated prisoners (87%, n = 32) reported having\nbeing in  segregation before.  When asked how many times they\nhave been placed in segregation, segregated prisoners (M = 11.5)\nreported  almost  twice  as many  times  than  non-segregated\nprisoners (M = 6.3).\nDiscussion\nGeneralization  issues\nThis  study represents  the  most  comprehensive  empirical\nreview of the psychological effects of administrative segregation\nin today's Canadian federal correctional context.  To begin with,\nthis study applied  the rigour  of an experimental  longitudinal\ndesign to  a  \"real\" segregation  environment.  Participants were\nactual inmates and not volunteers who agreed to be segregated\nfor a  fixed period of time.  As such, the sample included actual\ninmates  (some with existing psychiatric  conditions and others\nwho feared  for  their personal  safety) who  were  voluntarily  or\ninvoluntarily placed for periods up to 60 days in  administrative\nsegregation  pursuant  to  the  current  Canadian  federal\nadministrative segregation process.  They were segregated under\n\"real\" conditions of confinement, which included partial isolation\nand  sensory  deprivation.  In  addition,  the  participants  were\nconfronted  with  all  of the  uncertainties  surrounding  their\nsegregation,  such as (a) when the segregation period would end,\n(b) whether they would be transferred to another institution or\nreturned to the general inmate population, and (c) whether their\nstay in  segregation  would  affect  their security classification,\nchances for parole, or cell assignment.  As well, some prisoners\nmay have been confronted with correctional employees who may\nhave had a punitive approach to managing segregated inmates.\nAll these factors potentially affect the experience  of segregation\nand were  not considered by studies using students or inmates\nwho voluntarily agreed to be segregated for a fixed period of time.\nThis  study,  therefore,  examined  the  psychological  effects  of\ntoday's  administrative  segregation  in  Canadian  federal\ncorrections,  and its results cannot be construed as unrealistic\nextrapolations of scenarios which are too remote from the \"real\"\nexperience.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 26 of 39 PageID #:\n 2378\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nSurprisingly, although various forms  of administrative seg-\nregation have been used for decades (if not centuries),  there has\nbeen only one longitudinal study previously conducted using an\napproximation  of the empirical  approach  used  in  this  study.\nWeinberg (1967) assessed the effects of segregation on 20 inmates\nwho were involuntary placed in administrative segregation.  The\nstudy was, however, limited to a  segregation period of only five\ndays, and reported a 68% attrition rate among the experimental\ngroup.  Again, no other longitudinal study has been completed\nusing prisoners in a  \"real\" segregation context.\nThe fact that the current longitudinal study was conducted\nwith prisoners who were subjected to \"real\" segregation conditions\nof confinement clearly enhance its ability to be generalized.  Other\nfactors should also be considered  when assessing the issue of\ngeneralization of findings.  First, this study was conducted  at\nseveral sites, thereby enhancing the degree of external validity.\nSecond,  the penitentiaries  selected  have  historically  been\nperceived as some of the toughest in Canada.  These institutions\nhave some  of the largest  segregation  units and heavily rely on\nadministrative segregation to manage their inmate populations.\nIt  was  therefore  expected  that segregated  prisoners  in  those\npenitentiaries would be more likely to be affected by the harsher\nrealities of some of Canada's toughest penitentiaries.\nThird, the participation rate in this study was comparable to\nstudies that employed  inmates for subjects  and which  do not\noffer  any incentive  for  participation  (e.g.,  money).  The  true\nattrition rate among the segregated group was also relatively low\n(10.8%)  for a  longitudinal  study.  It is important  to  note that\nnone of the attrition was attributable to prisoners being incapable\nof participating in the study because of episodes of delusion or\nhallucination  or suicide attempts.  Although always a concern,\nthe  rate  and  nature  of the  attrition  in  this  study does  not\nsignificantly undermine its ability to be generalized.\nFourth, this study relied on multiple assessments of mental\nhealth  and  psychological  functioning  of prisoners  (i.e.,\nexternalizing/ aggression,  internalizing/ interpersonal  distress,\npsychiatric symtomatology, and cognitive ability).  This approach\nprovided  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of potential\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 27 of 39 PageID #:\n 2379\nRevue canadienned e criminologie janvier 2001\npsychological  effects  of administrative  segregation,  and  is\nconsistent  with  preferred  contemporary  psychological  and\npsychiatric  assessment practices (DSM-IV 1994).\nFinally, non-segregated prisoners scored significantly higher\non  a  measure  of impression  management  than segregated\nprisoners.  Arguably,  since  segregated  prisoners  did not show\nsignificant signs of mental health and psychological deterioration\nand were more accurate in their responses than non-segregated\nprisoners,  the results of this study are more convincing.\nThe  above  factors  enhance  the  level of confidence  in the\nresults of this research.  There are, however, clear limitations to\nthis study which may reduce the generalizability of the findings.\nFirst, a large number of prisoners in both segregated (96%) and\nnon-segregated  (87%)  groups  had  previously  experienced\nsegregation.  Arguably, a previous stay in segregation may have\nalready negatively affected the mental health and psychological\nfunctioning of the prisoners in the comparison group.  General\ninmate  population prisoners  who  have  never  been  segregated\nbefore in the three selected  penitentiaries  are rare.  Moreover,\nthese  prisoners may arguably  possess  special  coping  abilities\nand attributes and be atypical of the general inmate population,\nmaking them a poor choice for comparison purposes.  Second,\nthe findings are limited to 60 days in administrative segregation,\nand any extrapolation to lengthier stays would be inappropriate.\nIt is important  to note,  however, that statistical data collected\nby the Correctional Service of Canada (Laplante  1998) indicate\nthat  during  the  period  of June  1997  to  May  1998,  93%  of\ninvoluntary cases and 69% of voluntary cases were released prior\nto the 60 day regional review.  This fact suggests that a majority\nof prisoners  are segregated  for periods  of less  than 60  days;\ntherefore,  the  findings  of this study are  very  relevant  to  the\nCanadian federal context.\nThird,  as stated above,  the three  penitentiaries  selected in\nthis  study  are  among  the  toughest  medium  and  maximum-\nsecurity institutions in the country.  These  penitentiaries  rely\nheavily  on  administrative  segregation  to  control their inmate\npopulations,  which  are  composed  of high-risk and  high-need\nfederally  sentenced  prisoners.  The  applicability of the results\nfrom  this study should be limited to such inmate populations.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 28 of 39 PageID #:\n 2380\nThe effects of administrative segregation\nFurther, the findings of this study may be less applicable to other\njurisdictions,  such  as the  United States,  in  which  segregated\nprisoners  typically  remain  in  administrative  or  disciplinary\nsegregation  for much longer  periods  of time,  and often  under\nharsher conditions of confinement (Coyle 1987; Dowker and Good\n1993; Immarigeon  1992; Korn  1988).  Finally, it would also be\ninappropriate  to extend the findings  of this study to aboriginal\n(Bertrand 1996) and women prisoners (Korn 1988; Martel 1999).\nThe realities and experiences of women and aboriginal prisoners\nmay affect their ability to adapt and cope with segregation.\nPersonality\nIt was expected that certain personality types would react to\nthe segregation experience differently.  Although no deterioration\nwas found,  differences  in  personality between  segregated  and\nnon-segregated  prisoners were  found.  These  differences  have\nbeen suggested  in the PC and segregation literature, but have\nseldom  been assessed  using  standardized  measures,  such as\nthe NEO  Personality Inventory  (Gendreau et al. 1985;  Hodgins\nand Cote 1991;  Rold 1992).\nThe NEO was developed to operationalize the five-factor model\nof personality, a representation of the structure of traits developed\nover the last forty years (Digman 1990).  Costa and McRae (1990)\nfound that since 1985, research using the NEO has demonstrated\nthat the five factors  can account for the major dimensions  in\npersonality questionnaires  designed to measure,  inter alia, the\nDSM-III-R  personality  disorders.  Segregated  prisoners  were\nfound to  score higher on Neuroticism  (N) than non-segregated\nprisoners.  Costa  and  McCrae  (1992:  14)  explained  that  \"the\ngeneral  tendency  to  experience  negative  affects  such as  fear,\nsadness, embarrassment, anger, guilt, and disgust is the core of\nthe N domain\".  They also suggest that neurotic individuals tend\nto cope more poorly with stress than others.  Although segregated\nprisoners were found to score higher on Neuroticism and may,\ntherefore, be ill equipped to cope with the stress associated with\nsegregation,  the  findings  of this  study  suggest  that they\nnonetheless  adapted  and  coped  well  with the  segregation\nexperience.\nSegregated  prisoners  scored  significantly  lower  on\nExtraversion  (i.e.,  less  sociable,  likely to  prefer large  groups,\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 29 of 39 PageID #:\n 2381\nCanadianJ ournal of Criminology January2 001\nassertive,  active, and less talkative),  Openness  (i.e., less active\nimagination,  sensitivity,  attentiveness  to inner  feelings,\nintellectual  curiosity,  and  independence  of judgment),\nAgreeableness (i.e., less altruistic and sympathetic to others and\neager  to  help  them,  and more  egocentric,  skeptical  of others'\nintentions,  and  competitive  rather  than  cooperative),  and\nConscientiousness (i.e., less strong-willed and determined) than\nnon-segregated prisoners.  Arguably, these trait patterns depict\nindividuals which have personalities that may bring them at odds\nwith non-segregated prisoners as well as correctional staff. The\ngeneral inmate population may not tolerate prisoners with such\npersonality patterns.  Due to their lack of assertiveness, general\ntendency to experience negative affects, and overall poorer mental\nhealth and psychological functioning, segregated prisoners may\nbe more easily victimized or less apt at adapting and coping with\nprison life.\nPsychological effects\nOverall,  both segregated  and  non-segregated  prisoners\nreported better mental health and psychological functioning over\ntime.  This finding is common in studies which rely on repeated-\nmeasures designs and has been primarily attributed to practice\neffects (Pedhazur 1982).  Participants lose interest in answering\nrepeatedly to identical questions and tend to report less problems\novertime.\nIt was hypothesized  that as a  group,  segregated  prisoners\noverall  would report  greater mental  health  and  psychological\nfunctioning  problems  than  non-segregated  prisoners.  This\nhypothesis was supported by the fact that segregated prisoners\nindicated significantly more internalized problems, interpersonal\ndistress  and  psychiatric  symptoms  than  non-segregated\nprisoners.  Segregated prisoners also displayed significantly more\ndepressive symptoms, problems in psychosocial adjustment, and\ntransient anxiety than non-segregated prisoners.  These results\nare consistent with many cross-sectional and qualitative studies\n(Brodsky and Scogin  1988;  Grassian  1983;  Hodgins  and Cote\n1991; Wormith et al. 1988; Rold 1992).  It is important to reaffirm\nthat these between  group differences  may not be attributed  to\nplacement in  administrative segregation.\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 30 of 39 PageID #:\n 2382\nThe effects of administratives egregation\nThe  most important  questions  raised in  this  study were\nwhether the poor mental heath of segregated prisoners was at-\ntributable to segregation or whether segregated inmates already\nwere  of poorer  mental  heath prior to  their segregation.  The\nhypothesis that the mental health and psychological functioning\nof segregated inmates would deteriorate over a period of 60 days\nin segregation was not supported.  The ANOVA's  performed on\neach of the eight measures did not reveal any deterioration.  These\nresults can be interpreted in two ways:  (a) segregated prisoners\ngenerally adapted and coped well with the conditions of today's\nCanadian federal administrative segregation; or (b) the segregated\ninmates did not perceive the conditions of their confinement as\nthreatening or stressful and therefore were not affected by them.\nOn one hand, there is no shortage of researchers,  ourselves\nincluded, who have observed or reacted strongly to the difficult\nconditions of confinement placed upon segregated prisoners (e.g.,\n23 out of 24 hours of cell confinement, small yard size, lack of\nprograms and services, constant state of idleness, etc.).  On the\nother  hand,  other  researchers  have  commented  on  all  the\ndistractions,  programs,  and  services  that  are  available  in\nsegregation  units in  Canadian  penitentiaries  (e.g., TV, radios,\nbooks, computers, exercise period often with the company of other\nprisoners;  Suedfeld  et al. 1982).  Moreover,  the  Task  Force\nReviewing Administrative Segregation (Kane 1997) was confronted\nwith many correctional staff who thought segregation units were\n\"too comfortable\" for prisoners.  They often suggested, contrary\nto  current  legal  and policy provisions,  that  the  conditions  of\nconfinement should be made more harsh in order to discourage\nprisoners  from  requesting  segregation  and  to  provide  an\n\"incentive\" for segregated inmates to reintegrate into the general\ninmate population.\nAnother explanation  to  account for these results  could  be\nthat the environment that prisoners were in before segregation\nwas such that it was viewed more negatively than the conditions\nof confinement in  segregation.  If that is  the case,  it suggests\nthat the correctional authorities must take further steps to ensure\nthat the general inmate population is safe and secure.\nNonetheless,  regardless  of the  possible  explanations  to\naccount  for the  lack of deterioration,  this study is  somewhat\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 31 of 39 PageID #:\n 2383\nRevue canadienned e criminologie janvier 2001\nencouraging  because it  provides  evidence  that segregation  for\n60 days as currently administered  in  Canadian  penitentiaries\ndoes  not  negatively  affect  prisoners'  mental  health  and\npsychological functioning.\nPolicy issues\nIt was anticipated that this research would have important\npolicy implications in  areas such as: (a) the level and frequency\nof monitoring and assessment required for inmates in segregation\n(mandatory vs. upon request); (b) programming to reduce mental\nhealth  deterioration  (the need  for,  and  type  of, intervention\nprograms); and (c) the adequacy of current assessment strategies\n(what aspects of psychosocial functioning are important to assess,\nand which are less affected by segregation).  Since detrimental\neffects were not found, the policy implications are somewhat less\nsignificant than anticipated.\nFirst, with regard to monitoring and assessment of Canadian\nfederally  sentenced  segregated  prisoners,  psychologists  are\nrequired by policy to assess segregated prisoners every 30 days,\nand  health  care workers  and wardens  are required  by law to\nmake  daily visits  to  segregation  units.  Although  this  study\nrevealed  no  evidence  of  detrimental  effects,  the  30-day\nrequirement  should be preserved,  as well as the daily visits by\nhealth care workers and wardens.  Arguably,  reducing the few\ncontacts segregated prisoners currently enjoy could have negative\nconsequences.  It  could be  that regular  contact  itself is  an\nimportant  factor  reducing  the  likelihood  of  deterioration.\nMoreover,  this research  only  suggests  that the  possibility  of\nnegative effects is likely to be an exception rather than the norm.\nSince the findings of this study do not preclude in  any way the\npossibility that some prisoners may in fact be negatively affected\nby segregation, close monitoring should continue.\nDue to their overall poorer mental health and psychological\nfunctioning,  it  may  be  appropriate  as  a  \"best practice\" for\npsychologists to meet with all prisoners upon their placement in\nsegregation.  This  could  serve  to  establish  a  baseline  for\nsubsequent  evaluations  of mental  health  and  psychological\ndeterioration  and to provide support for segregated inmates at\ntimes of crisis.  In addition, since segregated prisoners were found\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 32 of 39 PageID #:\n 2384\nThe effects of administratives egregation\nto have  poorer  mental  health and psychological  functioning,\nemployees working with segregated prisoners may benefit from\nspecial training on mental health issues.\nSecond,  it  was  expected  that this research  would  provide\nspecific  areas of mental health and  psychological  functioning\nwhich needed particular attention when conducting assessment\nand monitoring of segregated  prisoners.  But again,  since this\nstudy did not detect detrimental effects, little can be said in  the\nway of policy on what aspects of mental health and psychological\nfunctioning  should  be  carefully  scrutinized.  Some  general\ncomments  can be made regarding psychological  assessments,\nhowever.\nCurrently,  psychologists  utilize  a  standard  form  which\nhighlights general mental health issues (e.g., risk of suicide or\nself-injury,  depression,  anxiety,  aggression,  psychosis,  mania)\nwhen completing their 30-day assessments.  How to assess each\ncomponent  is  left to  the  psychologist's  discretion.  Typically,\npsychologists conduct a brief semi-structured interview with the\nsegregated prisoner.  It may be appropriate as a \"best practice\"\nto conduct more elaborate assessment procedures to ensure that\nminor or perhaps less obvious deterioration can be detected and\ndocumented.\nFinally,  the  findings  of this  study have  programming\nimplications for segregated prisoners.  Since segregated prisoners\nwere found to be higher risk cases than non-segregated prisoners,\nprograms delivered to segregated prisoners should be intensive\nto maximize success (Andrews, Zinger, Hoge,  Bonta, Gendreau,\nand Cullen 1990).  Although the primary concern with providing\nprograms to segregated prisoners is to facilitate their reintegration\ninto the general inmate population, if such reintegration cannot\noccur quickly, intensive treatment programs that target variables\nthat  are  known  to be  linked  to  criminal  conduct  should  be\nintroduced (Andrews and Bonta 1994).  The distinct personality\npatterns of segregated prisoners may be  important to consider\nand assess when delivering treatment programs to them (Andrews\net al. 1990).\nIt is obvious that research evaluating the effects of segregation\nbeyond 60 days is needed.

Although  many\nhave  suggested  that  segregated  prisoners'  psychological\nweaknesses and idiosyncratic behaviours were not well tolerated\nby the general inmate population  (Carriere 1989;  Gendreau  et\nal. 1985;  Rold  1992; Wormith  et al. 1988),  the personality  of\nsegregated  prisoners  had seldom  been  assessed.  Whether  a\ndistinct personality profile may increase a prisoner's risk of being\nplaced in administrative segregation should be further examined\nusing more comprehensive  measures of personality.\nAlthough  this  research  revealed  no  evidence  that\nadministrative  segregation  for  periods  of up  to  60 days  was\ndamaging,  the  findings  of this study  should  not be  used to\nlegitimize the practice of administrative segregation.  Administra-\ntive  segregation  remains  a  management  tool which is  grossly\noverused  in  Canadian  penitentiaries.  Regardless  of whether\nprisoners adapt and cope well with the segregation experience,\nit is not healthy for anyone to idle aimlessly in a cell for 23 out of\n24 hours a  day; it simply is not a  constructive way of serving a\nsentence: and, it is likely to impede attempts to rehabilitate and\nsafely reintegrate prisoners into society.\nAlthough it will always remain a legitimate management tool\nto deal effectively with problematic  situations  and individuals,\nits current use is perhaps symptomatic of correctional authorities'\ninability to reduce tensions and resolve conflicts  in  the prison\ncontext.  Administrative  segregation  has  clearly  become  the\nnumber one way of managing inmates and \"doing business\".  For\nexample, the Correctional Service of Canada (1999) reported that\nduring  fiscal year  1998/99,  out of an inmate population  that\naveraged  13,131 federally sentenced prisoners, 7,942 placements\nin administrative segregation took place.  Such high reliance on\nthe use of segregation needs to be carefully examined.  Moreover,\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-20   Filed 06/21/19   Page 34 of 39 PageID #:\n 2386\nThe effects of administratives egregation\nthe  costs  associated  with  processing  these  prisoners  in\naccordance with due process requirement are extraordinary (i.e.,\npaperwork,  enhanced  security and  staffing,  and  reviews  by\nwardens, Segregation Review Boards and Regional Headquarters,\netc.).  Clearly, it is time to rethink conflict resolution in Canada's\npenitentiaries.\nImplementing  alternative/appropriate  dispute  resolution\nprocesses  on  a  large  scale  is the most promising  initiative  to\nreduce the disproportionate number of segregation cells and units\nin  Canada's federal correctional  system.  Providing the tools to\nresolve  conflicts  and  fostering  a  correctional  environment\nrespectful  of human rights is  the only way to break down  this\nover-reliance  on  administrative  segregation  for  managing\nprisoners.\nReferences\nAndrews, D.A.,  and J.

However, while the solitary confinement of inmates does in some \nrespects resemble sensory deprivation  (Gendreau, Freedman, Wilde, & \nScott, 1972), the literature (Zubck, 1969) is equivocal as to how \"punish· \ninf( sensory deprivation is.

In fact. Walters et al. ( 1963) suggest that some iumates \nmay flnd solitary confinement a relatively pleasant experience. \nBecause ~anti-confinement\" proponents tend to argue from  a  pheno \nmenological perspective, the Repertory Grid Technique ( RGT) appears to \nbe one of the most appropriate tests for exploring the effects of isolation on \ninmates' self-identity. The RGT purports to examine how events are per \nceived by the individual (Anastasi, 1968) as defined in terms of a set of \ncore constructs relating to that person's self-identity (Kelly, 1955; Slater, \n1969). Secondly, if solitary confinement produces harsh physical effects, \nthese should be manifest in altered stress levels as indicated by adreno \ncortical activity. \nThus, the present study investigated the effect on prisoners of 10 days of \nsolitary confinement, this being the longest time inmates usually remain \nin solitary. \nMETHOD \nSubjects . \nThe Ss were inmates of Millbrook Correctional Centre, an Ontario maximum security \ninstitution. Two of the authors interviewed potential volunteers.  Of the first 44 Ss \ninterviewed, 43 agreed to volunteer. The Es stopped asking for volunteers when the \npool seemed to be large enough. A note was placed on each volunteer's flle regarding \nhis willingness to participate, whether or not he completed the experimental require \nments. Eight volunteers. changed their mind and withdrew and five were transferred \nto other :institutions. Of the remaining 30, 16 Ss agreed to be randomly assigned to \neither treatment condition. Thill was done by IottCI)', with all Ss present; in this way \nthe inmates were assured that they were not being manipulated by Es and the Es \nwere able to prevent the inmates from coercing each other. The Ss were all in good \nhealth,  none  were  diagnosed  as mentally  defective,  and  none had  any  extensive \npsychiatric histm:y. All had jobs in the institution that allowed them to participate in \nthe experiment and all would remain in Millbrook for the duration of testing. Four \nSs quit the experiment after two days of solitary confinement. They were replaced \nfrom the remaining volunteers, all of whom met the same classification criteria as the \nother Ss. Of the 16 Ss who completed the experiment, seven were incarcerated for \ntheft, three for narcotics violations, two for fraud,  and one each for arson,  aiding \nprostitution, gross indecency, and vagrancy. The age range of the control Ss was 19-\n39 years, with a mean age of 25.1 years. For the solitarily confined Ss, the age range \nwas 19-25 years, with a mean age of 21.7 years. None of the Ss had higher than \nGrade 12 education.· The final 16 volunteers did not differ from the other inmates \nusually sent to Millbrook in either their type of convictions or in their institutional \nhistories. \nThis sample of inmates, like most non-lirst oHender inmates in any adult correc \n. tional institution, bad previous experience with non-volitional loclc-up in their past \ninstitutional histories (true of 40 of the original 43 volunteers). However, this implied \nVERMILLION 003956\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 15 PageID #:\n 2399\n180 \nEOCLESTONE, GENDREAU, &: KNOX \nsimilarity is deceptive since  the quality  of enforced confinement  varies  markedly \nfrom institution to institution. \nApparatm \nThe isolation cells  at Millbrook were wry similar to those described in a previous \nstudy (Gendreau et al., 1972). Cells were 8 feet by 4 feet and 12 feet in height, each \ncontaining a toilet, bed, and window, A double door led into the cell and the walls \nwere of concrete, 2 feet thick. The isolation cells were located in a special wing in \nthe institution set apart from the main living quarters. Illumination was set at 35 ML \nbut it was higher during daylight hours when outside light reached the cells through \na small window, Subjects were allowed to talco nothing into the cell except blankets \nand clothing. \nProcedure \nBannister and Mair  ( 1968)  have described  the  basic  theory and rationale  of tho \nRGT, and only a brief outline of the method used in the present study need be pre \nsented here. The ltCT matrix has rows representing constructs, which may be elicited \nfrom the S or supplied to him. The columns contain elements which are the stimuli \nto be sorted, the usual elements being photographs of individuals. Thus, for any given \nconstruct  (e.g., \"insecure''), the S rates these persons from most to least insecure. \nOne important feature of the RGT  is  that what is  actually being measured is not \nnecessarily what is ostensibly being measured. 'l1tis is a desirable feature in any test \nthat is  being used with a  prison population, since inmates  can easily give biased \nresponses  (Gendreau, Irvine, &  Knight,  1973 ), particularly on questionnaires.  An \nother advantage of the RGT is that the personal meanings of verbal labels, and/ or \ntheir interrelationships, are explicitly examined by such a test (Bannister, 1965). \nThe procedures used in the present study for eliciting constructs were taken from \nKelly (1955). The elements (8 in number), which constituted the stimuli in terms of \nwhich Ss  rated their personal constructs, were blaclc-and-white, head-and-shoulders \nphotographs of \"ordinary\" people, selected from magazines and mounted on 3\" X 5n \nwhite cards. The same elements were used for each S throughout. Because most Ss \nhad less than Grade 9 education, the constructs rated had to be words easily under \nstood by all inmates. Instead of choosing constructs uniqn\" to each S, constructs were \nelicited from some of the Ss and, from those obtained, nine con5tructs common to all \nor nearly all the Ss were selected, The tenth construct, '1ike me' was supplied by the \nEs. A uniform set of constructs was chosen to avoid the difficulties involved in making \nstatistical comparisons between diHerent construct dimensions  (Watson, 1970), liGn \nwere obtained on seven occasions;  for Pre- and Post-treatment Days 1 and 3 .and \nTreatment Days 1, 5, and 10. Each test administration took approl<imately 10 to 15 \nminutes per S. \nRGT Scoring \nThe repeated measures design is in effect an \"in series\" approach to the RGT. An \"in \nseries\" analysis has considerable potential for use with the liCT, but there are few, if \nany, methodological guidelines for such use of the RGT (Slater, 1969). For this reason, \njust as others (e.g., Crisp, 19M) have adapted RGT scoring procedures for their own \nspeeilio aims, the Es developed the Self-Stability and Disparity indices for the p= \npose of the present study. \nThe Self-stability score was obtained in the following manner, Each S was required \nto rank all of the elements in terms of each construct. A rank order correlation (Spear-\nVERMILLION 003957\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 15 PageID #:\n 2400\n181 \nSOLITARY ClON:FlNEMEN'l' \n.men rho) was then calculated for each construct from the rankings of elements on \nthat construct for Pre-treatment Days 3 and l. The resulting 10 rank order correlations \nwere then summed and an average rank order correlation score for all constructs was \nobtained for Pre-treatment Days 3 and 1. This score, obtained separately for each S, \nis the Self-Stability score. A high score  (i.e., approaching unity) indicates that the \nelements were ranked in much the same way each time (i.e., on Pre-treatment Days \n3 and 1) for any given construct. A low score, conversely, means that the elements \nwere ranked differently on the same constructs from one occasion to the other. The \nSelf-Stability score corresponds closely to a test-re-test reliability score. In this study \n6 Self-Stability scores would be obtained for each S since the procedure used to gen \nerate the Self-Stability score for Pre-treatment Days 3 and 1 was then repeated for \nsuccessive overlapping pairs of trials  (i.e., for Pre-treatment Day 1 and Treatment \nDay 1, then for Treatment Day 1 and Treatment Day 5, and so on). The resulting \ndata matrix of Self-Stability scores was then analysed in a repeated measures design. \nOf the 10 constructs employed, five intuitively appeared to have \"good\" connota \ntions  (understanding, honest, successful, easy going, like me) and five  appeared to \nhave \"badN connotations  (stubborn, violent, unstable, pessimi~tic, insecure). This ar \nbitrary distinction was developed for two reasons. First, the Self-Stability of \"good\" \nconstructs may be aHected differently by solitary confinement than the Self-Stability \nof \"bad\" constructs.  This would be determined by analysing the Self-Stability of \n\"good\" and \"bad\" constructs separately. \nSecond, if \"good\" and \"bad\" constructs  are perceived as psychologically distinct \nconstruct classes, they should be ranked differently from each otherl (i.e., the element \nsets should be sorted similarly within a construct class but differently between con· \nstruct classes). It was of experimental interest to note whether the assumed difference \nin rankings between \"good\" and \"bad\" constructs may itself change as a function of \ntreatment. Thus, a Disparity score was developed and calculated in the following way. \nEach S had ranked all of the elements in tenns of each construct. The \"good\" con \nstructs were separated from  the \"bad\" constructs  and the average ranking of the \nelement sets across both the 5 \"good\" constn•cts and the 5 \"bad\" con•tructs was ob \ntained for each S. Then a rank order correlation between these two separate sets of \naverage rankings was calculated. This association would have been expected to be at \nleast zero and probably negative if different classes of construct were indeed repre \nsented. If, on the other hand, the product moment correlation between the sets of \n\"good\" and. \"bad\" average rankings was positive, this would indicate that there was \nlittle difference between the psychological implications of these terms for the raters \n(Watson, 1970). Alternatively the Ss may not have been paying sufficient attention to \nthe task. In any case the Es' distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" constructs would \nbe meaningless and the Disparity score, attempting to measure a non-existent disparity, \nwould be worthless. It should be noted that the Disparity score is a within-test-period \nmeasure since it indicates how disparate Ss' rankings of \"good\" vs \"bad\" constructs \nwere for any given test period. In contra.•t, the Self-Stability score is a between-suc \ncessive-test-periods m.ea•ure summed across all 10 COn•-tructs and reflecting the con \nsistency of any given construct from one test-period to the next. Hence, across n test \nperiods, n Disparity scores and  ( n - 1 ) Self-Stability scores can be calculated for \neach S. In this study Disparity scores were obtained for each S for all 7 test days and \nthe resulting data matrix was then analysed in a repeated measure design. \n1  The applicability of these constructs was further conllrmed on a sample of 82 \ninmates in a subsequent study. Inmates had little difficulty employing these constructs \n= \nand individual Disparity scores were in nearly all cases r  -0.50. \nVERMILLION 003958\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 15 PageID #:\n 2401\n182  ECCLESToNE, GENDREAU, lc KNOX \nPlasma Cortisols \nThe operational dellnition of stress was derived from adrenocortical activity as meas \nured by plasma cortisol levels found in the peripheral blood, 'There are a number of \nmethods for assessing the activity of the adrenal cortex and the one chosen for the \npresent study was  Huorometric  assay of adrenal-steroids  in peripheral blood. This \nmethod has been shown to be precise, sensitive, and clinically applicable for the de \ntermination of adrenal cortex function  (Thiessen, Batsakis, Stiles, & Shilling, 1968 ). \n'The exact method for the Huorometric assay used in the present experiment has been \ndescribed by Silber, Busch, and Oslapas (1958) and was used as modified by Guiller \nmin, Clayton, Lipscomb, and Smith  ( 1959). Pla'illla samples were taken from  each \nS between 6:30AM and 7:00AM and 4:15PM and 4:45PM on Pre-treatment Days 3 \nand 1, Treatment Days 1,  2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10 and Post-treatment Days 1 and 3. \nPlasma cortisol values were recorded in micrograms per 100 millilitre, Four deter \nminations were made for each pla.•ma cortisol reading and the average of these was \ntaken as the Ss score to be used in the between groups repeated measures analysis. \nInmates ate after the morning blood samples were taken and also again at noon hour: \nthe P:U: samples were taken before the evening meal. All Ss, including thooe in mon \notonous confinement, remained on their rcgnlar diets. \nOther Measures \nIn addition to plasma samples, each S's heart rate, respiration rate, and oral tempera \nture were recorded. These measures were taken just before the blood samples and the \ninmates were seated throughout. Readings were taken of oral tempernture, heart rate \n(pulse rate at wrist), and respiration (hand on chest wall) over a 60-second period. \nEs took these measures largely to monitor the health of the Ss, but also to detect \npossible changes in these indices as a result of prolonged monotonous confinement. \nPrl$on  Routine \nConfined Ss had neither reading material nor any task to occupy their time. 'They \nwere not let out of their cells, or allowed contacts other than those resulting from the \nusual custodial checks,  meals,  and experimenter intrusions.  Canteen privileges for \nthese Ss were allowed to accumulate and none of the Ss was displaced from his job \nor his cell by other inmates. Non-confined Ss rose at 6:.00 AU, ate breakfast, returned \nbriefly to their cells, then worked (e.g., as cleaners, in the marker plant or tailor shop, \netc. )  until noon. At 1:00 PM, following lunch in their cells, they returned to their \ntasks until about 4:30PM. After their evening meal they could either remain in their \ncells O\"C participate in recreational activities (e.g. movie, card games, sports). Not all \nof the  recreational facilities  were  available  every  evening.  Non-confined  Ss  could \nreceive visitors in compliance with normal regulations and in general were treated as \nordinary inmates except for Es testing. \nlndivlduol Difference~~ \nTwo experienced psychometrists who had lmown each S intimately for at least two \nmonths ranked the inmates in terms of their judgment of the prisoner's conceptual \nability.

Since there were eight Ss in each group, the \nfour Ss ranked lowest on conceptual complexity within each group made up the \nsimple group and the four ranked highest dellned the comple>t group. The rank order \ncorrelation between judges' ratings for such simple-complex differentiation was 0.93. \nRFSULTS \nRGT Validity \nRepeated testing using the  may result in a situation that might produce \nRGT \nincreasing Self-Stability scores, not because the subjects are inHuenced by \na particular treatment, but simply because they remember more and more \nfrom one trial to the next. This potential confounding was checked out in \nthe control Ss' performance only, since any changes in the conllned Ss' \nSelf-Stability scores could presumably be due to treatment effects. A re \npeated measures analysis\" of variance with one standard condition  (Ed \nwards, 1968) was used to examine the control Ss' construct rankings. The \nmean SeH-Stabllity scores for all control Ss across overlapping days in order \nof testing were, 0.62, 0.70, 0.61, 0.57, 0.63, 0.62. Confounding effects due to \nin-series testing would be shown by rho's increasing over days, but this \ntrials effect was not, in fact, significant, F(5/35) = 1.5, p > 0.05. Indeed, \nS' s mean rankings ( 0.62) were identical at the beginning and end of testing. \nThe range and magnitude of SeH-Stability scores in this study were com \nparable to those obtained in other studies using different subject samples \n( Gathercole, Bromley, & Ashcroft, 1970). \nAs  noted  above,  constructs  were subdivided into \"goodn  and \"bad• \ncategories and Di~parity scores were calculated for all Ss. Potential con \nfoundings in the Disparity scores, assuming the two categories are regarded \ninitially as distinct, should increase or decrease disparity. This was tested \nby analysing the control Ss' data in a repeated measures design similar to \nthat used on the Self-Stability scores. The mean Disparity scores over days \nin order of testing were, -0.64, -0.75, -0.63, -0.71, -0.46, -0.62, and \n-0.68. The trials effect was not significant, F(6/42) = 1.9, p > 0.05. The \nhighly negative Disparity scores obtained on all trials suggested that the \nSs  attached markedly different sets of rankings to \"good\" constructs as \nopposed to \"bad• constructs. \nSelf-Stability Scores of Constructs \nThe  following  statistical  comparisons  were  between  groups  repeated \nmeasure analyses of variance (Edwards, 1968).

Nonnal cortisol levels arc reported to be within the 12 \nto 40 p.g/ml range with a mean between 20 and 30 p.g/ml (Soffer, Dorf \nman, & Gabrilove, 1961; Thiessen et al., 1968). Diurnal rhythm usually \nresults in higher AM than PM readings and the data in the present study \nconform to this expected pattern. All con£ned Ss maintained their diurnal \nvariation over days, but two of the eight control Ss had, on the average, \nslightly higher PM and AM readings. These two Ss showed a great deal of \nday to day variation. Clinically such a pattern may have a variety of mean \nings (e.g., change in sleep cycle or the effect of stressful events). It was, in \nfact, noted that both of these Ss were upset by their imminent parole and \ntransfer prospects during the testing period. \nExtremely  low  ( <10)  or very  bigh  ( >80)  plasma cortisol readings \nwould indicate adrenalcortical malfunction (e.g., Cushing·s syndrome for \nhigh readings). No such values were obtained in the present study. \nPre-Treatment and Post-Treatment days were initially included in the \ntrend analysis since it has been suggested that imnates may be upset by \nVERMILLION 003962\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 15 PageID #:\n 2405\n186 \nECCLESTONE, GENDREAU, &: KNOX \nPlasma Cortisols \n(.ug/100 ml) \nr\\ \nAM  PM \n35 \n.  : \n\\ \nII   ' I  ·-·  ,., . \nII   ' I  . \n•  I  I  . \n30 - ,  •  1:  \"\\,  .

In effect, the confined Ss showed more test-re-test reliability \nin sorting photographs in the same order over days. \nSince the nGT is basically a fairly simple sorting task, a vigilance-arousal \nhypothesis might provide a tenable explanation for this result. Johnson, \nSmith, and Myers ( 1968) have found performance on simple perceptual \ntasks to be enhanced by sensory deprivation.  Gendreau et al.  ( 1912) \nreported increased arousal to sensory input for confined inmates. Granting \nthe fact that each inmate's rationale for ranking constructs may be com \nplex, nevertheless future research based on vigilance theory may prove to \nbe a useful beginning in the further analysis of changes in inmates' thought \nprocesses in confinement. \nIt should also be noted that the increase in consistency was both con \nstruct specific and related to individual differences.  It was the \"good» \nconstructs that increased in consistency and this effect was greatest in those \nSs judged to be \"simple\" conceptual types. \nAn increase in the consistency of the sorting of \"good\" constmcts does \nnot necessarily mean that there is a positive or beneficial change in an S's \npersonal  constructs  as  a  result of  solitary  confinement.  While sensory \ndeprivation has  been claimed by some  to be of therapeutic value in \nfacilitating positive changes in the self-concepts of psychiatric patients \n(e.g., Schultz, 1965), the  does not easily lend itself to this kind of \nRGT \ninterpretation. The \"good-bad\" construct dimension was defined by the \ne:q>erimenters. It can only be asserted that for Ss described as simple con \nceptual types, constructs which were expressed to the S in terms of the \npositive pole (i.e., \"'good\" constmcts) increased in consistency during the \nS's time in·monotonous confinement. \nSecondly, the meaning which inmates attach to \"good\" construc.-ts such \nas \"honest,\" \"successful,\" or \"easy-going,\" may be quite different from the \nview taken of them by law-abiding persons. In future, the authors suggest \nthat along with the RGT, other self-concept tests (e.g., the Adjective Check \nList) be used. These should lend themselves to a relatively clear-cut inter \npretation as to whether self-experienced changes which occur under speci \nfied conditions are beneficial or detrimental. \nIndividual differences (e.g., low IQ, simple conceptual types) have been \nfound to be significant determinants of the degree of \"ideational\" change \nfound in laboratory isolation studies ( Suedfcld, 1969). In the present study, \nunlike many of the laboratory isolation studies, there was no deliberate \nattempt to influence the inmates' cognitive processes. We do not know why \nthe simple conceptual types' constructs may be more open to  change. \nVERMILLION 003964\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 12 of 15 PageID #:\n 2407\n188 \nECCLESTONE, GENDREAU, &: :KNOX \nSuedfeld  ( 1969)  had tentatively suggested that dissonance factors may \naccount for the reaction of simple conceptual Ss. Given the operational \ndefinition of these Ss (Schroder et al., 1967) it might be expected that their \nconstructs would be easily shifted as they do not have a complex, well \ndifferentiated base. \nThere exists a considerable gap between clinical opinion in the correc \ntional field concerning the effects of stress in solitary confinement and the \nextensive body of knowledge gained in laboratory mvestigation of sensory \ndeprivation. H laboratory studies have relevance for the correctional area, \nit is not too surprising that the plasma cortisol results in this study failed \nto confirm the clinical expectation that solitary confinement would be more \nstressful than routine prison life. Indeed, if there was any trend (see Fig. \n2), it was toward lowered cortisol levels for conllned inmates. Consistent \nwith the cortisol results was the fact that heart rate, body temperature, and \nrespiration of confined Ss were not significantly higher than those of the \ncontrol Ss. Similarly, laboratory studies of sensory deprivation have often \nfailed to show changes in these latter variables (Zubek, 1969). Walters et \nal.  ( 1963) expressed the view that the likelihood that solitary conllnement \nin prison has deleterious consequences has been· much overemphasized. \nAlso o£ note is that Gendreau ( 1969) and Gendreau, Horton, Hooper, \nFreedman, Wilde, and Scott ( 1968) reported virtually no change in either \nthe affect or the perceptual abilities of inmates just after they were released \nfrom seven days solitary conllncment. Furthermore, Zubek (1969) noted \nthat higher stress levels have not been found for Ss subjected to prolonged \nperiods of sensory deprivation whether these were assessed in terms of the \nactivity of the sympathetic-adrenomedullary system via adrenaline and \nnoradrenaline output,  or in terms of the activity of the adrenocortical \nsystem via 17 xes and 17 KS steroid output. Only in the extreme case of the \ncombination of perceptual deprivation with immobilization for 7 days \nwere such stress effects reported (Zubek, Bayer, Milstein, and Shephard, \n1969). In this latter case only adrenaline was raised (noradrenaline was \nnot} and only for Days 6 and 7 of confinement. Zuckerman, Persky, Link, \nand Basu ( 1968) and Zubek ( 1969) have stated that isolation may, at most, \nbe stressful in its earliest stages. It is not surprising then, to find that \"con \n:finement wise\" inmates adapt well to solitary confinement, showing no \nreliable  stress  effects.  Even college  student Ss  who  initially may rate \nsensory deprivation as a very negative experience (Zuckerman et al., 1968} \nreadily adapt to such confinement. \nAltman and Haythorn ( 1967) have reported that groups in confinement \nseem to develop a need for privacy and increased territoriality in order to \ncope with the situation. Whether inmates develop such a strategy as a \nVERMILLION 003965\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 13 of 15 PageID #:\n 2408\n189 \nSOLITARY CONFINEMENI \nresult o£ years of institutionalization is not known. The authors have seen \nprisons where solitary conditions would be ideal for a prisoner seeking \nprivacy. In some instances, on the other hand (given the type of prison \nand its routine), \"normal\" prison cells can also offer a good deal of privacy. \nThe \"privacy\" theory certainly merits more attention because some clini \ncians  feel  that certain inmates  (those who  have some schizo-affective \nsymptoms) seek solitary confinement only in order to reinforce their psy \nchopathology (Scott & Gendreau, 1968). \nZubek and Schutte ( 1966) and Zubek et al. ( 1969) have reported that \nthose who quit isolation have significantly lower baseline adrenaline levels \nthan Ss who successfully completed sensory deprivation. Haythom ( 1967) \nreported that quitters had lower adrenaline and higher uric acid levels \nthan Ss who were able to endure isolation. The three quitters in the present \nexperiment asserted that they quit deliberately after the second day of \nconfinement, but these Ss' AM and PM cortisol levels were high and all had \ndifficulty in maintaining a diurnal pattem. The authors believe it likely \nthat these Ss advanced their claim in an attempt to save face with their \npeers. Zubek ( 1969) has found that most of his college Ss who quit sensory \ndeprivation have done so on the second or third day. Zubek and Schutte \n(1966)  inferred that quitters may be biochemically or \"constitutionally\" \ndifferent. From a medical and psychiatric viewpoint, this suggestion merits \nfurther study with those inmates who cannot cope with confinement. \nAs in all of the prison studies volunteer Ss were employed. These volun \nteers may have reacted differently from inmates sent into isolation against \ntheir will. From our clinical experience, however (Gendreau et al., 1972; \nScott & Gendreau, 1968), we have noted that inmates who initially ob \njected strongly to being sent to solitary appeared to adapt as well as in \nmates who actually requested solitary. Furthermore, these inmates stated \nin post-test\" interviews that they approached the experimental confinement \nperiod in the same way as  they did their  non-volitional  confinement \nepisodes. \nFinally, attention should be drawn to the fact that there have been no \nattempts to examine an \"outside world» control group of matched delin \nquents. There may be marked differences in both psychometric and physio \nlogical variables between this type of control and either routine prison \nincarceration or solitary confinement. To date the authors have not found \nsuch a study methodologically feasible. It does seem to us, however, that \nsuch a study would be a valuable contribution to applied penology and to \nsensory deprivation theory, and would ultimately increase the generaliz \nability of theories which try to account for human behaviour under condi \ntions of monotonous confinement. \nVERMILLION 003966\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-22   Filed 06/21/19   Page 14 of 15 PageID #:\n 2409\n190 \nEOCLESTONE, GENDREAU, 6: XNOX \nn:Es'DME \nEtude des effets produits par 10 jours de reclusion cellulaire sur les construits per \nsonnels et l'act:ivit6 adrermcorticale de prisonnieJ:S.

I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  761 \nThe  present  controversy  surrounding  supermaximum  security \nunits  (SMUs)1  involves  a host of issues,  from  administrative \nchallenges and questions of best practice to the opposition of human \nrights organizations that deplore their very existence. One perennial \nproblem  concerns  the  relationship  between  mental  illness  and \nSMUs. At present, more than 40,000 people are confined in SMUs \nin the United States (Camp & Camp, 2000). Of these, up to 30%, or \ntwice the rate of the general prison population, meet clinical criteria \nfor serious mental illness (SMI), and a larger number demonstrate \ndocumented psychosocial impairment (Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n2002; Hodgins &  Cote, 1991; Human Rights Watch, 2003; Lovell, \nCloyes, Allen, & Rhodes, 2000; Rold, 1992). In addition, SMUs are \nthe fastest growing form of incarceration in the United States. The \nincreasing practice of using SMUs as a proactive strategy for popu \nlation  management,  combined  with  the  challenge  that  irrational \nbehavior presents to a correctional system, means that inmates with \nmental illness continue to  be housed in  these settings,  sometimes \nlong term (Human Rights Watch, 2003; King, 1999). \nThe Madrid v.  Gomez (1995) and Jones'El v.  Berge (2001) cases \nhave applied legal pressure at the state level by restricting or pro \nhibiting the use of SMUs to house mentally ill offenders. These deci \nsions reflect growing concern among correctional, clinical, and legal \ncommunities regarding the inappropriateness of SMU conditions for \nseriously mentally ill offenders (Haney & Zimbardo, 1998; Human \nRights Watch,  1997, 2003). Although SMUs vary in structure and \noperation,  in  general  they  are characterized by  a combination  of \nsocial isolation, lack of positive stimuli, and environmental factors \nsuch as constant light and noise. A number of studies suggest that \nthese conditions may trigger grave cognitive and behavioral decom \npensation for those inmates already at risk (Grassian & Friedman, \n1986; Haney,  1993,  1998; Haney  &  Lynch,  1997; Human Rights \nWatch, 2003; Porter, 1998). Without intervention, these inmates may \nreact to an increasingly confusing and threatening environment with \nescalating decompensation. \nWhen the  need for mental health treatment is  recognized, it is \ngreatly complicated by the demands of unit management and by ide \nological  differences  between  standards  of custody  and  treatment \n(Cloyes, 2004; Rhodes, 2004; Toch & Adams, 2002). SMU practice \nVERMILLION 003653\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 23 PageID #:\n 2414\n762  CRIMINAL WSTICE AND BEHAVIOR· \nis often marked by interpretive disagreement or even confusion as to \nwhat constitutes evidence of psychosocial impairment and mental ill \nness.  Doubts about the authenticity of symptoms  and concerns of \nmanipulation and malingering are a central focus for SMU staff, who \nmay interpret decompensation as a strategic manipulation for softer \nconditions.2 In addition, the sometimes bizarre and incomprehensible \nactions of mentally ill inmates tax limited resources and are seen as a \nthreat to the central mandates of safety and security (Cloyes, 2004). \nMentally ill offenders may be housed in SMUs for indeterminate \nperiods  of time,  a practice justified by perceptions  that mentally ill \ninmates are inherently dangerous, unpredictable, and explosive (Cloyes, \n2004; Lovell & Jemelka, 1998; Tardiff, 1992). The high degree of secu \nrity required in this setting makes implementing any treatment inter \nvention  extremely  difficult.  Pharmacotherapy  is  often  the  only \ntherapeutic avenue practically achievable in such a restrictive set \nting, and mentally ill inmates who receive no adjunctive treatment \ntend to refuse medication (Lovell & Jemelka, 1998; Metzner, Cohen, \nGrossman, & Wettstein, 1998). Furthermore, many inmates cite an \nundesirable degree of social risk in identifying oneself as being in \nneed of mental health intervention or taking psychotropic medica \ntion. They report that inmates and staff see such behaviors as evi \ndence of a weak or broken status, which is closely associated with \nincreased potential for victimization (Cloyes, 2004). Together, these \nfactors  make the assessment and treatment of mental illness in an \nSMU an extremely complex proposition. \nThe  Prison  Mental  Health  Project  is  a  collaboration  of  the \nWashington State Department of Corrections (DOC) and University \nof Washington researchers. The goal of the Project is to investigate \nissues related to mental health and incarceration in Washington's con \ntrol units, including ongoing efforts to describe this population; to \ntrack how time in SMU relates to inmate histories and institutional \npractices; and to develop plans for successful and timely transitions \nout of SMU to residential mental health treatment, general popula \ntion, or the community. In an earlier study (Lovell et al., 2000), we \nreviewed records of all inmates in SMU confinement in the state at a \nsingle point in time (N = 232) to establish a baseline characterization \nof the population. These inmates had more convictions for violent \noffenses, more serious infractions, were younger, and were serving \nVERMILLION 003654\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 23 PageID #:\n 2415\nCloyes eta!. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  763 \nlonger sentences than the general population. Records also tracked \ndifferent patterns of movement through the SMU based on a number \nof factors:  protection issues, immaturity,  infractions, progressively \npoor adjustment, and stalemate from being at war with the system. \nData were also collected on SMU inmates' clinical status and the \nprevalence of symptoms, according to a set of situation-specific oper \national indicators:  confirmed diagnosis by  a mental health profes \nsional, multiple admissions to psychiatric acute care units, extended \nresidency on a mental health unit, and case management notes describ \ning psychotic behavior or use of psychotropic medications. Records \nfor 29% of Washington State SMU residents show strong evidence of \nmental illness, a rate substantially higher than the 10% to 15% often \ncited for  general inmate populations  (Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n2002; Lamb & Weinberger, 1998; Lovell et al., 2000). These findings \nalso underline problems with viewing these units as having a homo \ngeneous  population  or in  applying  a one-size-fits-all  approach  to \nmanaging them. \nThe next phase of the study, the data for which are reported here, \nwas a 2-year multimethod study of three Washington State SMUs. \nThe study was  designed to  further explore this variability and its \nimplications, including questions about the mental health status of \nSMU inmates. \nMETHOD \nPARTICIPANTS \nThe sample comprises 90 scores achieved by assessing 87 male \nSMU residents  in  three  institutions,  totaling  32%  of Washington \nState  SMU  residents.  Potential  participants  included  all  inmates \nhoused in three SMUs at the time of the study.3 When prospective \nparticipants declined to participate, we approached alternate partici \npants from a randomly ordered list of inmates until at least 30% of \nthe unit population was enrolled .. Of the 131 participants solicited, \n87  interviewed  (1  inmate  interviewed  two  separate  times,  and \n1 interviewed  three  separate  times  at  different  institutions,  thus, \nyielding  90  Brief Psychiatric  Rating  Scale  [BPRS]  assessments). \nVERMILLION 003655\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 23 PageID #:\n 2416\n764  CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \nForty-four declined or were unavailable at the time of interviews. \nCharts of those who  declined were reviewed as  well as  charts  of \nthose who accepted to ensure that findings would be representative. \nNo  systematic differences  were noted.  Participants resembled the \ntotal inmate population in ethnic distribution: 69% Caucasian, 23% \nAfrican American, 5% Native American, 2% Asian/Pacific Islander, \nand  1%  Other;  in  addition,  there  were  17%  in  the  crosscutting \nHispanic origin category. Although individual histories were highly \nvariable, participants were, on average,  substantially younger than \nother prison inmates (29 vs. 34.5 years old) and had long prison sen \ntences (199 months), extensive SMU time (1 year), and many major \ninfractions (25). As the total sample represents almost half the pop \nulation of SMU inmates at the time of the study, this sample ade \nquately represents Washington SMU residents. \nMEASURES \nThe BPRS. Symptoms were measured using the 18-item BPRS, \nbased on previous use in Project studies and its extensive history in \nclinical practice and research (Faustman & Overall, 1999; Hedlund \n&  Vieweg,  1980).  The BPRS  measures  18  of the most common \npsychiatric  symptoms:  anxiety,  somatic  concern,  guilt  feelings, \ntension, mannerisms, depressive mood, motor retardation, uncooper \nativeness, unusual thought content, blunted affect, excitement, dis \norientation,  hallucinations,  suspiciousness,  hostility,  grandiosity, \nconceptual disorganization, and emotional withdrawal. Each of these \n18 items is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (absence of symptom) to \n6 (symptom present to extremely severe degree). Ratings are assigned \nby trained assessors and are based on interview data and observed \nbehavior.  Item  scores  are  then  summed,  with  higher total  scores \nmarking more severe global impairment. Previous research with the \nBPRS  (Lovell & Jemelka,  1998) suggests the following classifica \ntion of BPRS total scores based on level of impairment: 0 to  13 = \nmild  impairment;  14  to  23  =  moderate  impairment;  24  to  36  = \nmarked impairment; 37+ =severe impairment.4 \nThe BPRS has been widely studied and consistently demonstrates \nadequate  reliability  and  validity  (Bengtsson  &  Hansson,  2001; \nBurger, Calsyn, Morse, Klinkenberg, & Trusty, 1997; Hafkenscheid, \nVERMILLION 003656\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 23 PageID #:\n 2417\nCloyes et al. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  765 \n1993; Lachar et al.,  2001; Morlan &  Tan,  1998; Overall &  Beller, \n1984; Ownby & Seibel, 1994; Ventura, Green, Shaner, & Liberman, \n1993; Zuardi, Loureiro, & Rodrigues, 1995). Furthermore, researchers \nhave analyzed the factor structure of the BPRS in a variety of popu \nlations (Burger et al.,  1997; Larcher et al., 2001; Overall &  Beller, \n1984; Ownby & Seibel, 1994). These studies repeatedly identify five \nsubscales and related items that consistently correlate with clinical \ndiagnoses such as mood disorder, organic brain syndrome, or thought \ndisorder: \n•  Thinking Disturbance (items: conceptual disorganization, hallucina \ntory behavior, unusual thought content) \n•  Anxious Depression (anxiety, guilt feelings, depressive mood) \n•  Withdrawal Retardation (emotional  withdrawal, motor retardation, \nblunted affect) \n•  Hostile Suspiciousness (hostility, suspiciousness, uncooperativeness) \n•  Agitation Excitement (tension, excitement) \nIt is interesting that although numerous factor analyses confirm \nthis model, individual items function differently in various studies, \nsometimes associating with different subscales and sometimes drop \nping from analysis. This indicates variability in the factor structuring \nof BPRS scores among populations with different demographic and \nclinical profiles and points toward the possibility that the instrument \nis sensitive to underlying dimensions of differing groups. \nOperational  indicators  of mental  illness.  Both conceptual  and \noperational definitions were used to triangulate data on psychosocial \nimpairment.  Serious mental illness (SMI) was defined as  a major \nthought disorder,  mood disorder,  or organic brain  syndrome that \nfits  well-established Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders  (4th ed; American Psychiatric Association,  1994) cate \ngories, substantially impairs functioning, and requires treatment. To \nmeasure this, we developed a set of proxy indicators of psychosocial \nimpairment based on an algorithm of generally and practically rec \nognized DOC decision points regarding intervention and manage \nment for mentally ill inmates. Throughout the past decade, Project \nresearchers have been closely involved with DOC administrators, \nstaff, and clinicians in identifying criteria used in daily practice to \nVERMILLION 003657\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 23 PageID #:\n 2418\n766  CRIMINAL WSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \ndetermine which behavioral patterns indicate SMI and,  therefore, \nwarrant  assessment  and  intervention.  This  approach  combines \nevidence from the electronic database, medical chart reviews, staff \nlogs and unit records, and clinical interviews to estimate the number \nof participants with SMI. Medical diagnosis alone was insufficient \nbecause  in  DOC  practice,  diagnosis  is  neither  determined  nor \nrecorded  in  a  reliable  manner.  Thus,  an  inmate  was  counted  as \nseriously mentally ill (Evidence of SMI Documented or EVSMI \nDOC) if records review showed evidence of any one of the indica \ntors described below: \n•  Confirmed SMI: The inmate has been evaluated by a mental health \nprofessional and an assessment of SMI has been recorded electroni \ncally (SMIYes). \n•  Mental health residency+ significant use of medications: 30 or more \ndays in one of the DOC's residential mental health units, together \nwith  a significant record  of medications-either steadily  or  with \ninterruptions (Res+Meds). \n•  Diagnosis + significant use of medications: a psychiatric evaluation \nwith  a qualifying diagnosis,  together with  a significant or  steady \nrecord of medications (Diag+Meds). \n•  Steady use of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, not just antidepres \nsants, with no interruptions (SteadyMeds). \nCombining these data provides practical evidence of mental distur \nbance that is more robust, more situation specific, and therefore more \nnuanced than that available through electronic files or diagnosis alone. \nFurthermore,  it allows  the analysis  of convergent validity between \nBPRS data and practical indicators of SMI. This approach also helps \nsituate our findings relative to the larger questions and issues that char \nacterize and complicate the study of SMUs. Table 1 summarizes the \noperational indicators and corresponding data sources. \nPROCEDURES \nThis research was  funded by contract with the Washington State \nDOC, carried out with the active collaboration and support of adminis \ntrators and staff, and governed by strict university and DOC institutional \nreview  board rules  concerning  protection  of human  participants. \nProspective participants had the right to refuse interviews.

It is important that participants were not specif \nically aware that an assessment tool was being used to evaluate their \nclinical presentation. \nData were gathered on convergent measures  through review of \nmedical  charts  and the electronic institutional database, including \ninmate records,  unit records,  and  the  narrative  notes  of frontline \nstaff. To mitigate effects of bias, interviewers did not review either \ninmate charts or institutional data prior to meeting with participants \nand completing BPRS ratings. \nAnalysis. SPSS software and sample scores on all measures were \nused to  explore data structure and patterns, reliability, correlation, \nand construct validity. We applied factor analysis to  BPRS  scores \nto  examine  sample  factors  and  compare  with  previous  analyses \nand  computed reliability for  BPRS  total  and  subscale  scores  and \noperational  indicators  of SMI  (SMIYes,  Res+Meds,  Diag+Meds, \nSteadyMeds, EVSMIDOC). Total BPRS scores, subscale scores, and \noperational indicators of mental illness were tested for  significant \ncorrelations. Finally, three methods were used to compare the sam \nple  for  significant  differences  in  means  among  groups:  (a)  total \nBPRS  scores, (b) whether inmates demonstrated marked or severe \nimpairment (BPRS > 24, BPRSY), and (c) whether inmates met all \noperational criteria for SMI (EVSMIDOC). \nRESULTS \nANALYSIS OF BPRS SCORES \nThe mean of total BPRS scores in this sample is 17.01 (SD 8.99; \nrange= 1 to 57), indicating a moderate level of psychosocial impair \nment.

I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  769 \neffect on this alpha value, which would be .7629 if the item were \ndeleted from scores. This finding has sample-specific considerations \nthat reinforce face as well as construct validity, discussed below. \nFactor  analysis  of sample BPRS  scores  generated a five-factor \nmodel similar to previous studies but with important differences to be \nhighlighted in the discussion section of this article. These five factors, \nor subscales, correspond to diagnostic categories identified in earlier \nresearch and are named after the clinical picture they evoke: Thought \nDisturbance, Withdrawal Retardation, Anxious Depression, Agitated \nExcitement,  and  Hostile  Suspiciousness.  To  further  explore  these \nsubscales, we obtained bivariate correlations between each subscale \nscore from the sample and scores computed for each participant using \nanother  widely replicated five-factor model  (Overall,  1987).  Each \ncorrelation was significant at the .01level. Internal consistency coef \nficients  (alphas) for each of the five  subscales were moderate yet \nsatisfactory, ranging from .57 to .77. Intercorrelations between sam \nple subscale scores, indicating reasonably distinguishable subscales \n(Surwillo, 1980), are reported in Table 2. Thus, despite the constraints \nof having a small sample-to-item ratio in this study, the BPRS per \nformed reliably, discriminantly, and distinctively. \nANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL INDICATORS \nCorrelations among the operational indicators used in this study \nalso mark a significant and unique clinical profile and confirm our \nassumptions  about  the  importance  of combining  operational  and \ncontextual indicators with other measures. All  correlations  among \nthese  variables  (outlined  in  Table  1)  were  significant  (p  $  .01; \nRes+Meds p $  .05). The variable SMIYes, recorded by a psychiatric \nprovider on inmates' DOC admission,  was most highly correlated \nwith the variable Diag+Meds (r = .5107). When interpreted in terms \nof the purpose of mental health screening, this finding suggests that \nwhen  such  screening  is  in  fact  carried  out,  it  is  functioning  as \nintended:  namely,  to  identify those inmates most at risk for  SMI \nbecause of clinical presentation and most in need of pharmacological \nintervention. However, as noted earlier, the nature of clinical practice \nin the DOC setting makes this procedure, at best, something of a hap \nhazard prospect. The highest correlation was between Diag+Meds \nVERMILLION 003661\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 12 of 23 PageID #:\n 2422\n770  CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \nTABLE 2:  Correlations Among Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Subscale \nand Total Scores (N = 90) \nBPRS \nTO  WR  AD  AE  HS  Total \nTD  1.000  .177  .130  .199  .343**  .559** \nWR  .177  1.000  .209*  -.057  .311 **  .499** \nAD  .130  .209*  1.000  .233*  .166  .665** \nAE  .199  -.057  .233*  1.000  .282**  .548** \nHS  .343**  .311 **  .166  .282**  1.000  .702** \nBPRSTotal  .559**  .499**  .665**  .548**  .702**  1.000 \nNote.

To \nexclude any of these four operational indicators from the analysis \nwould  negatively  affect  validity  and reliability,  with Diag+Meds \nhaving the most impact. This is not an unexpected result, given the \nextent of overlap  among  the operational indicators  (for example, \nthree of four indicators involve tracking patterns of medication use). \nIn a similar manner, the fact that these indicators were intended to \nrepresent  practical  and  widely  used  decision-making  criteria \nstrengthens the conclusion that they are describing the underlying \nconstruct of SMI in a situation-specific way. Moreover, it suggests \nthat the categorical variable EVSMIDOC, constructed to summa \nrize the other four operational measures, can be used to categorize \nthis sample in terms of whether a participant meets DOC criteria for \nSMI.  Indeed,  correlations between the EVSMIDOC variable and \neach of the other four operational indicators were highly significant \n(p:::; .01). \nVERMILLION 003662\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 13 of 23 PageID #:\n 2423\nCloyes eta!. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  771 \nANALYSIS OF CONVERGENT VALIDITY AMONG BPRS \nAND OPERATIONAL INDICATORS \nConvergent validity  was  further analyzed in three ways.  First, \nwe tested correlations  among BPRS  scores,  the BPRSY variable \n(BPRS > 24 and in the marked/severe impairment range), and the \noperational indicators. The results are reported in Table 3, with a few \npoints noted here. Again, this pattern of correlations suggests that \nformal diagnostic and clinical constructs correspond with the deci \nsional criteria used  in  everyday practice  and,  therefore,  with  the \noperational variables. A brief examination of both significant and \nnegative association underscores this convergence. For instance, cor \nrelations  among  BPRS  total  scores,  BPRSY,  and  scores  on  the \nThought Disorder and Withdrawal Retardation subscales (clinically \nassociated with serious psychotic and depressive symptoms, respec \ntively) yielded significant association with the operational indicators \nRes+Meds, Diag+Meds, and EVSMIDOC. This pattern elucidates a \ndistinctive clinical picture for a number of reasons. These variables \ndescribe major patterns of medication prescription and use, repeated \nand/or lengthy admission to mental health units, and clinical evalu \nation and diagnosis positive for SMI. In these cases, presentation \nis  more  likely to  be dramatic  and  to  fit  established frameworks. \nMoreover, the behaviors and symptoms captured by these variables \nare those most likely to be recognized as SMI in a correctional set \nting (as opposed to merely anxious or hostile behavior) and, there \nfore, most likely to elicit intervention. \nThe two slightly negative correlations also highlight connections \namong  BPRS  scores,  operational indicators,  and practical issues. \nHostile Suspiciousness subscale scores were negatively associated \nwith Diag+Meds (-.016). This reflects a tendency, in an SMU set \nting, to regard hostile presentation and guarded, mistrustful behavior \nas evidence of personality disorder, antisocial motivation, or a reac \ntion to prison pressures rather than as a symptom of psychiatric ill \nness. Those who present a primarily hostile or suspicious demeanor \nare, therefore, less likely to be diagnosed as mentally ill and in need \nof treatment.  In a similar manner,  there is  a negative  correlation \nbetween scores on the Withdrawal Retardation scale and the SMIYes \nindicator.

The group with positive records \nfor SMI had a mean BPRS score of 25.29, and the group with nega~ \ntive records for SMI had a mean score of 15.39, resulting in a sig \nnificant difference between these two groups, t(17) = 2.556, p = .02. \nGiven the relatively small sample size, this finding constitutes sta \ntistically strong evidence that this difference is systematic. In other \nwords, it is highly unlikely that such a difference in mean scores is \nbecause of either random chance or sampling error. Given relevant \nconcerns of representativeness, sampling error resulting from small \nsample  size  would  tend  to  underestimate  such  a difference  and, \ntherefore, decrease the power of the t test to detect any differences. \nTherefore,  it appears  that higher BPRS  scores  actually do  reflect \nmore severe symptoms and are positively associated with patterns of \nbehavior and intervention that mark SMI in this setting. \nThird, convergent validity was analyzed via a chi-square test to \nmeasure  the  association  of  the  EVSMIDOC  variable  with  the \nVERMILLION 003664\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 15 of 23 PageID #:\n 2425\nCloyes et al. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  773 \nBPRSY variable indicating marked/severe impairment, X2  = 5.509 \n(1, N = 90) = 5.509, p = .019. Again, given the relatively small sam \nple size as well as the number of values being analyzed, this suggests \nthat these variables are strongly and systematically related-those \ninmates who have psychiatric symptoms in the marked to extremely \nsevere range are the same inmates who meet DOC-based criteria for \nSMI and who are most likely to need and receive intervention. This \nfinding further points to the convergence of these data on the con \nstruct of psychosocial impairment and underscores the effectiveness \nof combining measurement variables for more robust results. \nTaken together, the analyses support three primary findings: (a) The \nBPRS is a reliable and effective measure of psychosocial function in \nSMU residents, (b) comparison between factor-based BPRS scores in \nthis sample and scores and factor solutions achieved in other popula \ntions points to considerations specific to this population that require \nfurther study, and (c) assessment of SMU residents using the BPRS \nand convergent operational measures of psychosocial function indi \ncates that a significant number of participants meet criteria for serious \npsychosocial impairment. \nDISCUSSION \nBPRS ASSESSMENT IN SMU SAMPLE: EFFECTIVENESS, \nLIMITATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nIn  addition  to  reliability  and  effectiveness,  the  BPRS  demon \nstrated a satisfactory degree of construct validity to conclude that \nwhat is being measured is in fact psychosocial impairment, inflected \nby distinct patterns of disturbance that are meaningful in this partic \nular context.  This  holds true despite  several issues  that constrain \ninterpretation of these results. Sample scores represent point-in-time \nmeasures  and,  thus,  do  not permit claims  of correlation or cause \nregarding the damaging effects of SMU conditions, incidence of ill \nness, or change with time. Despite this limitation, the data do offer a \nmeasure of prevalence and show a significant degree of impairment \nin  this  group  of inmates.  Specifically,  22%  of Washington  State \nSMU residents had total BPRS scores greater than 24, indicating a \nVERMILLION 003665\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 16 of 23 PageID #:\n 2426\n774  CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \nmarked or severe degree of distress.  Generalizability of results is \nlimited by the relatively small, although statistically adequate, sam \nple size. However, as demonstrated, this sample is representative of \nWashington State SMU residents. Notwithstanding these limitations, \nthe analysis demonstrates the reliability, validity, and rationality of \nthe BPRS scores for this sample and setting. \nIt is also important to highlight conceptual and operational distinc \ntions between psychosocial impairment and mental illness. We use the \nrubric of psychosocial function for several reasons that relate to the \nuse of BPRS measurement with operational indicators and ultimately \nto the potential for developing a framework that triangulates individ \nual and institutional variables. A question of function is  especially \nclear in the definition of SMI adopted by many correctional systems, \nwhere it is used to delimit the class of inmates for whom treatment is \nmedically necessary as required by federal court precedents and con \nsent decrees. In these cases, SMI is defined as \"a substantial disorder \nof thought or mood which significantly impairs judgment, behavior, \ncapacity to recognize reality or cope with the ordinary demands of life \nwithin the prison environment and is manifested by substantial pain or \ndisability\" (Ohio Bureau of Mental Health Services, 2000, § 319-03, \np.  1). The range of symptomology that may be produced or exacer \nbated by SMU confinement, with negative consequences for inmates \nand staff, is broader than that captured by conventional DSM-IV algo \nrithms (two examples commonly described by inmates are rage and \ndespair). Furthermore, by using the language of psychosocial impair \nment, we deliberately avoid interpretive and practical limitations of a \ndisease model. For example, hallucinations or extreme suspiciousness \ncan have negative consequences for inmates and staff regardless of \nwhether these occur in patterns that meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria \nor respond to treatments that target organic disease. \nIn addition, the emphasis on functionality has important legal and \nethical  implications.  For  example,  can  an  inmate understand  and \nparticipate in his or her own legal representation and pursue his or her \nown best interests, both within an institutional disciplinary system \nand in court? \nFinally, our research during the past decade reveals missing data, \ncontradictory diagnoses, and inconsistent screening in many inmate \nVERMILLION 003666\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 17 of 23 PageID #:\n 2427\nCloyes et al. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  775 \nrecords. In light of these findings, as well as broader concerns about \nSMU confinement, viewing resource-intensive diagnostic interviews \nas the only legitimate indicator of impairment is limiting. The BPRS \nprovides a flexible and reliable framework without the interpretive \nor analytic rigidity of a diagnostic model. \nCOMPARISON OF SMU SUBSCALE SCORES WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES \nA comparison of SMU BPRS  subscale  scores  and  factor  data \nfrom other studies highlights the fact that there is both enough com \npelling similarity and difference to call for further study. Subscales \nin this sample were strikingly comparable to those subscales repeat \nedly found in studies of populations with known psychopathology, \nsuch as chronic schizophrenic patients, and this parallel has several \nimplications. Considering widely held views on SMU inmates, one \nmight expect that the Hostility Suspiciousness subscale would have \nthe most influence on scores for this sample. Yet Thought Disturbance, \nthe subscale most closely associated with serious psychotic illness \nand thought  disorder,  accounted  for  the  most variance.  Hostility \nSuspiciousness actually had the smallest effect among all five sub \nscales. In terms of overall profile, then, the sample actually looked \nmuch  more  akin  to  traditional inpatient psychiatric  samples  than \nexpected. This further supports the supposition that what is  being \nmeasured are those underlying constructs that correspond with psy \nchiatric symptoms and not some other construct such as psychopa \nthy, personality disorder, or character problems. \nThere are also notable differences in how particular BPRS items \ncontribute to this  SMU sample profile and patterns found in other \nresearch.  Studies  in  other populations  tend  to  drop  the  variables \nrating  disorientation,  somatic  concerns,  and  grandiosity  because \nof their small contribution to  the  clinical  profile.  However,  these \nitems had a much bigger effect for inmates in SMU. Disorientation \nhas been extensively cited as an effect of solitary confinement and \nextreme social isolation (Grassian & Friedman, 1986; Haney, 1993). \nInmates frequently describe somatic distress and preoccupation with \nphysical  symptoms  as  negative  effects  of solitary  incarceration. \nHere,  somatic  distress  was  strongly  associated  with  the Anxious \nVERMILLION 003667\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 18 of 23 PageID #:\n 2428\n776  CRIMINAL WSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \nDepression subscale, which is consistent with the plausible hypothesis \nthat the interaction of negative stimuli and isolation in SMU can lead \nto preoccupation and rumination concerning the effects of confine \nment on one's body. \nIn summary, it is important to note that the present findings are sim \nilar enough to those of previous analyses to suggest that they are not \nidiosyncratic but also different enough to indicate the influence of the \nuniqueness of this sample and their situation. These differences could \nbe methodically analyzed and operationally developed to explore sys \ntematic correlations among symptoms of psychiatric impairment and \nthe kind of environmental variables that characterize SMUs. \nCONVERGENT VALIDITY: ASSESSMENT AND \nINTERPRETATION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT \nThe convergence ofBPRS scores and data gathered using operational \nindicators of psychosocial function points toward two conclusions. First, \na significant number of SMU participants meet robust criteria for seri \nous psychosocial impairment. Second, this study achieves a reasonable \ndegree of validity in assessing psychosocial impairment in this sample. \nOf the sample, 20% met DOC-based criteria for serious impair \nment; these inmates also had an average BPRS score of 25, in the \nmarked to severe range. Furthermore, there was significant, system \natic correlation among data for these variables.  However,  overlap \nbetween BPRS and DOC criteria was not complete. Of 78 inmates \nwith both interview and chart review data,  11  showed marked or \nsevere symptoms according to BPRS scores but did not satisfy oper \national criteria. Six met operational criteria but had BPRS scores in \nthe mild or moderate range. There are several possible explanations \nfor this  disparity. First,  some study participants have refused any \nmental health assessment or intervention since they arrived in prison. \nThese men may or may not meet either diagnostic or operational \ncriteria for mental illness, but this cannot be tracked. Second, follow \nthrough in assessing, treating, and documenting mental illness among \nprisoners has not been consistent, as noted earlier. Again, this makes \ntracking and measuring criteria difficult or impossible in some cases. \nThird, participation in study interviews was voluntary and depended \nVERMILLION 003668\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 19 of 23 PageID #:\n 2429\nCloyes et al. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  777 \non ability to understand the description of the study. Severely dis \nturbed or paranoid inmates may be underrepresented in BPRS data \nif they refused participation by virtue of an inability to engage in the \nprocess. Of 44 potential participants who refused or were unavail \nable for interview, there were 10 whose electronic database or chart \nrecords  showed clear evidence of mental  illness.  Fourth, inmates \n. with  SMI who  are  successfully treated may  show only moderate \nsymptom levels in clinical interviews-indeed, this underscores the \nsnapshot quality of a one-time BPRS assessment. \nAny attempt to  assess  SMU inmates will  raise concerns about \nvalidity. These can be managed through study design and statistical \nanalysis (as has been done here), yet they also tend to linger in ques \ntions of how best to interpret results-especially in prison research. \nThese questions are not merely peripheral or confounding factors; \nnearly  all  arguments  about SMUs  center on the  status  of real  or \nserious impairment and how best to operationalize and act on a def \ninition. Therefore, we address questions of interpretive validity here. \nFirst, the question of malingering will surely arise in relation to \nthese data and conclusions. There are several important things to \nconsider  about malingering for  an  SMU  study.  As  noted  earlier, \nmental  illness  and  manipulation  are  not mutually  exclusive cate \ngories. This is a widely recognized truism among SMU staff, who \ncontend  that  psychiatric  symptoms  and  manipulative  behavior \nco-occur more often thim not (Cloyes, 2004). In addition, interviews \nwith  inmates  did  not  solely,  or even  primarily,  focus  on  clinical \nsymptoms (see Note 5). Study information given to participants did \nnot emphasize symptoms or illness, researchers were not presented \nas  clinicians,  and participants were not specifically aware that an \nassessment tool was being used to evaluate their clinical presenta \ntion. Thus, the perceived prospects for secondary gain were mini \nmized. Furthermore, BPRS ratings are based on interview data and \nentail a number of factors including speech, behavior, overall pre \nsentation, and interviewer assessment. In this way, as compared with \nmany self-report measures or schedules, the BPRS functions more \nlike  a mental  status  exam.  Finally,  the  clinical  profile  described \nby our data is closely connected with the extraordinary situation of \nliving in an SMU. Features such as hostility or manipulation, which \nVERMILLION 003669\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 20 of 23 PageID #:\n 2430\n778  CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR \nmight be seen as confounding factors in other settings, are an integral \npart of the SMU context. It is therefore more plausible (and practi \ncal) to think of impairment and manipulation as cohesive elements \nof this clinical profile rather than· as divergent diagnoses. \nA second question related to interpretive validity involves how to \nsituate study results in a larger SMU context that integrates individ \nual, social, and environmental factors. The concept of psychosocial \nimpairment focuses on an individual level of analysis, and the BPRS \nis  constructed to  measure  symptoms  as  largely  endogenous  vari \nables. In other words, the BPRS may be useful for assessing symp \ntom levels; when used in a longitudinal design, it may show changes \nwith the passage of time, but used alone, it cannot address the inter \nactions between people and  environment that epitomize concerns \nabout SMUs. Our sample scored highest on the following items, in \norder:  suspiciousness,  hostility,  anxiety,  tension,  depression,  and \ngrandiosity. This finding will hardly surprise readers familiar with \nconditions of SMUs and the reasons for assigning inmates to them. \nConditions of confinement, surveillance, and social and physical iso \nlation might reasonably be  expected to  coincide with  suspicious, \nhostile, anxious, tense, or depressed behavior. \nFinally, it is important to recognize that symptoms are not only \ninfluenced by but also  interpreted within this  larger context.  For \nexample, the BPRS item grandiosity is meant to measure a symptom \nof impairment. Yet a degree of grandiosity about personal power, \nbravery,  and influence is  part of common discourse among SMU \nprisoners (Cloyes, 2004; Tach, 1992). This pattern is a response to \nsocial challenges endemic to this setting and reflects role expecta \ntions within this particular context. In short, grandiosity may be an \nadaptive response,  and not necessarily  a pathological one,  to  the \nsocial  and politi~al features  of the SMU environment.  Therefore, \nfuture research should continue to develop a model that incorporates \nthe BPRS as one measure among others aimed at situating individ \nual factors within the context of an extreme environment. This strat \negy of triangulation provides data that are at once more meaningful \nand  more useful  and highlights  the  necessity for  future  studies  to \ndevelop data sets that integrate individual symptoms, situation-specific \npractices, and institutional policies. \nVERMILLION 003670\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-23   Filed 06/21/19   Page 21 of 23 PageID #:\n 2431\nCloyes et al. I PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT  779 \nNOTES \nI.  Nationally, these supennaximum security units are generally referred to as SMUs or \ncontrol units. The Washington State Department of Corrections calls its comparable units \nintensive management units or IMUs. In the interest of consistency, we use the tenn SMU \nwhen referring to our study of Washington State IMU residents. \n2.  It is interesting that this is often described as an either/or proposition, meaning that \ninmates are either sick or manipulative. This assertion seems to run counter to the opinion of \nthose actually working in SMU settings, who are quick to point out that a diagnosis of mental \nillness does not preclude engaging in manipulative or antisocial behaviors and vice versa \n(Cloyes, 2004). A subtler and more plausible description would account for a significant \ndegree of overlap in this matter and is in fact what most SMU staff recognize and accept as a \nfeature of everyday practice. \n3.  Although some women live in segregation conditions in Washington State, according to \nDepartment of Corrections policy, these settings are neither defined nor managed like SMUs. \n4.  Lovell, Allen, Johnson, and Jemelka (2001) have taken this approach in constructing \nanchor points for interpreting overall scores. \n5.  The schedule for these semistructured interviews included the following domains of \nquestions: the physical environment in SMU; the social environment in SMU; description \nof everyday life, practices, and activities in SMU; relations between staff and inmates; impact \nof unit and institutional policies and procedures on quality of life in SMU (positive and nega \ntive); and subjective experiences and accounts related to doing SMU time. \nREFERENCES \nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

However, this assumption has rarely been critically examined. The present report \nevaluated the evidence pertaining to the effects of imprisonment. Studies on the effects of prison \ncrowding, long-term imprisonment and short-term detention, solitary confinement, death row, and the \nhealth risks associated with imprisonment provide inconclusive evidence regarding the \"pains of \nimprisonment.\" Rather, the evidence points to the importance of individual differences in adapting to \nincarceration. As the use of incarceration is unlikely to decrease in the near future, research on its \neffects is urgently needed and a situation-by-person approach may be the most fruitful research \nstrategy. \nHistorically, prisons have been described as barren landscapes devoid of even the \nmost basic elements of humanity (cf. Sykes, 1958) and detrimental to the human \nity of the offender (Rector, 1982). Perhaps one of the best known descriptions of \nthe inhumanity of prison is Cohen and Taylor's (1972) description of long-term \ninmates in a British maximum security prison. Such notions about prison life have \nbeen pervasive whether from the perspective of investigative journalists (Mitford, \n1973) or academics writing for basic criminology texts (see Fox, 1985). \nMitford (1973), in her very effective polemical style, painted a scathing in-\n* Authorship is alphabetical and the opinions expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent \nMinistry policy.

Not only does imprisonment strip offenders of civil liberties, \nbut also prison reforms are nothing but rhetoric and rehabilitation initiatives are \ndespotic. Goffman (1961) also has been equally harsh in his assessment of the \nprison as a \"total institution.\" \nCareful empirical evaluations, however, have failed to uncover these perva \nsive negative effects of incarceration that so many have assumed. Mitford (1973) \nand Cohen and Taylor (1972) did not provide empirical evidence for psychological \nor behavioral deterioration. We need to be reminded that even Goffman (1961) did \nnot collect data directly from prisons. His conclusions were based upon a review \nof the prison literature combined with data gathered from \"asylums.\" Further \nmore, earlier reviews of empirical studies also failed to uncover the widespread \nharm that is presumed inherent to prisons (Kilmann, 1980; Walker, 1983). \nFor some, the quantitative data, gathered as much as possible under condi \ntions of objectivity, must not be believed. The failure of such data to confirm \npopular expectations has  led  to a number of responses.  One is  an increased \ndependence Upon a phenomenological approach (e.g., Flanagan, 1982), or, at the \nvery least, a shift from quantitative psychology to a process that examines prison \nexistence in a qualitative and interpretative manner (see Sapsford, 1983). \nAnother expression of disbelief in the data comes from critics (Mohr, 1985) \nwho have argued that the failure to find damaging effects of incarceration has been \ndue to the  \"false reality\" of the researchers concerned. This false reality has \napparently been ascribed to the fact that government researchers have vested \ninterests in reporting results uncritical of the penal establishment. \nA final concern, in this case emanating from researchers who have not yet \nembraced phenomenology, has been that much of the research has  reached a \n\"dead end.\" Historically, incarceration research examined informal social orga \nnizations within prisons and did not speak persuasively to the actual effects of \nimprisonment itself. In addition, the methodological problems in much of the early \nwork were considerable and a number of researchers have been rather critical of \nthe early simplistic approaches to imprisonment research (Porporino & Zamble, \n1984; Wormith, 1984). That is, much of the early research was guided by the \"all \nor none\" views of the deprivation (Clemmer, 1940; Sykes, 1958) and the early \nimportation theorists (Irwin &  Cressey, 1962). Thus, the complex nature of in \ncarceration was not addressed. \nIn the past, most prisons were maximum security, and psychoeducational \nprogramming was minimal. Daily prison life featured 20-hour lock-up for a few \nand highly regimentized and monotonous work duties for the rest. Until recently, \napproaching the examination of prison life from a uniform perspective made em \ninently good sense. Now, however, the realities of prison life are far different. It \nis now appropriate to reexamine the effects of incarceration with special attention \nto the specific conditions of confinement. Although prisons may appear similar on \nthe surface, closer examination finds them varying widely in security, living con \nditions, and the degree of programming. \nPrison overcrowding, almost unknown in the early 1970s, is now very evi \ndent. Today, both very long-term and short-term periods of incarceration have \ndramatically increased. The number of offenders incarcerated is over 700,000 \nVERMILLION 003545\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 27 PageID #:\n 2437\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  349 \n(U.S. Department of Justice, 1988). Current government crime control strategies, \nin the United States at least, will likely ensure that imprisonment will be the \npreferred option for the time being (Currie, 1989). In addition, one of the most \nextreme forms of prison life, solitary confinement, is still frequently employed. \nThus,  research examining the effects of prison life is critically important. \nMore knowledge must be generated and analyses of prison life must take into \naccount the deprivation and importation literature, while also recognizing the \ngreat variety of structures and experiences that incarceration currently includes. \nSELECTION AND ORGANIZATION OF STUDIES \nThis review focuses on quantitative studies about effects of imprisonment. \nQualitative or phenomenological studies were not included. To be included in the \nreview, a study was required to employ objective measures of the variables of \ninterest and to evaluate the relationship between them by means of statistical \ntests. \nThus, the majority of studies were of a correlational or quasiexperimental \nnature. The only truly experimental studies (i.e., random assignment) were found \nin the solitary confinement literature. Some studies appeared to straddle both the \nquantitative and qualitative camps. In these instances, we made a judgment call \nand only included them for discussion where appropriate. \nThe studies were identified with the aid of a computer search of the prison \nadjustment and penal literature. Other reviews (e.g., Bukstel & Kilmann, 1980; \nGendreau &  Bonta, 1984; Wormith, 1986) and a review of recent criminological \njournals identified additional studies. \nWe viewed imprisonment as an independent variable and the behavioral and \npsychological observations of inmates as dependent variables. This organization \nappeared to work well with the studies dealing with specific conditions of con \nfinement (e.g., solitary confinement). There is, on the other hand, a voluminous \nand frequently reviewed literature that has the independent variable, imprison \nment, less clearly defined and investigates dependent variables such as attitude \nand self-esteem changes. These later studies were not included in the present \nreview. \nFinally, a further comment on the dependent variables in the review is in \norder. Our interest was on the evaluation of assumed negative effects  due to \nincarceration, and, therefore, we reviewed topics that were most likely to evi \ndence such effects. We did not review the literature on rehabilitation and educa \ntional programs in prisons (see Gendreau &  Ross,  1987) because their stated \npurpose is to actively promote positive behaviors. In general, negative effects \nwere behaviors that threatened the physical welfare of the offender (e.g., aggres \nsive behavior, suicide) and indicators of physiological stress levels (e.g., elevated \nblood pressure) and psychological distress (e.g., depression). \nWe examined specific aspects of confinement, namely, crowding, long-term \nimprisonment, solitary confinement, short-term detention, and death row.  We \nVERMILLION 003546\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 27 PageID #:\n 2438\n350  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nmake one departure from this format and provide a commentary on the health \nrisks associated with imprisonment, which follows from our discussion of prison \ncrowding. In our review of the prison crowding literature, we were able to use \nmeta-analytic techniques because there were both an identifiable theoretical per \nspective and sufficient studies that could be subjected to analysis. With respect to \nthe other aspects of confinement, either there were too few studies (e.g., death \nrow) or they consistently failed  to show negative consequences (e.g., solitary \nconfinement), or,  as in the case of long-term confinement, the cross-sectional \nmethodology with multiple groups  did  not make the data amenable to  meta \nanalytic techniques. \nCrowding \nCrowding is invariably perceived negatively. It is seen by many correctional \nmanagers as the major barrier to humane housing of offenders despite an esti \nmated 170,000 additional new beds since 1980 (Corrections Digest,  1986). This \npopulation explosion has prompted court interventions (Angelos & Jacobs, 1985; \nCall,  1983),  sentencing reforms (Kennedy,  1985), and innovative classification \nsystems intended to reduce prison populations (Clements, 1982). \nResearchers view crowding as a complex phenomenon. Stokols (1972) dis \ntinguished density, a physical condition, from crowding, a psychological condition \ninvolving the individual's perception of constraints imposed by limited space. Loo \n(1973) further differentiated physical density into spatial density (number of peo \nple constant but the available space varies) and social density (space is constant \nbut the number of people vary). For example, prison renovations might reduce the \namount of space available to a number of inmates (spatial density), but the effects \nof this  spatial rearrangement on the inmates may differ from  the effects  of a \nsudden influx of new inmates into the institution (social density). \nDespite these distinctions, corrections research has been inconsistent in the \nuse of the concepts of crowding and spatial and social density.  Studies have \ndescribed crowding as both an independent and dependent variable, and the dis \ntinction between social and spatial density has infrequently been noted. \nMost researchers agree that crowding describes a psychological response to \nhigh population density which is often viewed as stressful (Altman, 1978; Paulus, \n1988). Although high population density is a necessary condition for crowding, it \nis not a sufficient condition, and other variables may be required to produce the \nperception of crowding.  Sundstrom (1978) described crowding as  a sequential \nprocess resulting from an interaction of person variables, high population density, \ncorrelates of high density (e.g., increased noise levels), and situational variables \n(e.g., duration of exposure). \nFollowing Sundstrom's (1978) model, we would expect that the behaviors \nobserved under high population densities would vary in intensity and variety with \nlength of exposure. For example, under brief exposure we may see elevated blood \npressure, followed by reports of anxiety as exposure increases, and ending with \nviolent behavioral outbursts under prolonged exposures. To test this hypothesis, \na longitudinal design is required, and, to the best of our knowledge, there is only \nVERMILLION 003547\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 27 PageID #:\n 2439\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  351 \none study that has approximated this goal (Ostfeld, Kasl, D' Atri, & Fitzgerald, \n1987). Indirect support of the model may be gathered from comparisons of the \nrelative strength of the relationships between population density and a variety of \noutcomes. That is, we would expect that reports of physiological and psycholog \nical stress would be relatively easy to come by and that the findings would be \nrobust, whereas observations of violent behavior would be more infrequent and \nequivocal. \nTo explore this model,  we undertook both a qualitative and  quantitative \nreview of the prison crowding literature. Studies that provided sufficient statisti \ncal information on the relationship between population density and the dependent \nvariable were subject to a meta-analysis. The dependent variable was arranged \ninto three categories: physiological, psychological, and behavioral. Some studies \nreported more than one measure within a category. In these situations, we gave \npriority to  systolic blood pressure for the physiological category,  a paper \nand-pencil measure of perceived crowding described by Paulus (1988) for the \npsychological category, and misconduct for the behavioral category. These mea \nsures were  the most frequently used. We would have liked to categorize the \nmeasures of crowding into aggregate, social, and spatial density, but to have done \nso would have drastically reduced our samples in each cell. \nThe strength of the relationship, or effect size, was measured by Cohen's d \n(1977) and calculated using the statistical conversion formulas de.s crib\"e d by Glass, \nMcGaw, and Smith (1981). In our analysis, d in. dicated the size of the-difference \nin standard units between crowded and noncrowded conditions. Standardizing the \nmeasures (d) allowed us to compare results from different studies. For studies that \nreported nonsignificant results, d was set at zero. The results of this meta-analysis \nare shown in Table 1. \nAs  can be seen from Table  1,  physiological and psychological stress re \nsponses (Outcomes A and B) were very likely under crowded prison conditions. \nThe majority of studies employing such measures found significant results. The \none inconsistent finding was the inverse relationship between crowding and blood \npressure (d =  - .70) reported by McCain, Cox, and Paulus (1980). This may have \nbeen a spurious result because there was no relationship between blood pressure \nand crowding for the institution in question for the previous year (1978). If this \nsize effect is removed from the calculation of the mean, then we obtain a mean of \nd =  .51 for Outcome A, which is quite consistent with the model. In the case of \nbehavioral acting-out, the strength of the relationship diminished to the point of \nbeing relatively insignificant as the studies ranged in effect. size from  - .90 to \n+.87. \nWhile the results outlined under Outcomes A and B seem straightforward, \nsome clarification is required. That is, although physiological stress in response to \npopulation density was the rule, reports of psychological stress concomitant with \nphysiological stress were not always observed and, for the most part, rarely \nstudied. When the two were observed together, the relationship was usually de \npendent upon other variables. In 1973, Paulus, McCain, and Cox reported (no \ndata were presented) that social density was related to a physiological measure of \nstress (palmer sweat) but not to a subjective appraisal of feeling crowded.

Sometimes the composition of the sample was unclear(?). \never, in a subsequent study (Paulus, Cox, McCain,  & Chandler,  1975),  which \nconsidered length of exposure,  there was an increased perception of feeling \ncrowded for inmates in dormitories (high social density) but not for inmates in \ncells (low social density). Other studies have noted the moderating effect of length \nof exposure on physiological and psychological measures of stress (D' Atri, 1975; \nD'Atri, Fitzgerald, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1981; Paulus, McCain, & Cox, 1978, 1981; \nMcCain, Cox, & Paulus, 1976). \nIn the one longitudinal study reported in the literature, Ostfeld and his col \nleagues (1987) followed  128 inmates through their incarceration to release and \npostrelease. Physiological and psychological measures were taken at regular in \ntervals  and controls were introduced for other confounding variables  such as \nweight and criminal history. They found changes in blood pressure associated \nwith population density but no statistically significant changes for anxiety, hos \ntility, and depression. \nThese studies, nevertheless, suggested a positive relationship between social \ndensity and physiological indicators of stress and subjective reports of discomfort. \nVERMILLION 003549\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 8 of 27 PageID #:\n 2441\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  353 \nIndications  of physiological stress appear as  immediate consequences  to  high \nsocial density, and it is possible that with increased exposure to such a situation \nother cumulative consequences such as psychological distress may follow (Paulus \net al., 1975). \nIt is most important, however, from a policy perspective, to evaluate whether \nor not population density is related to severe, disruptive behavior that may jeop \nardize the physical safety of the inmates. The findings as shown in Table I do not \nsupport an overall relationship between crowding and disruptive inmate behavior. \nMegargee (1977) was the first to empirically study the relationship between \ncrowding and reported disciplinary infractions. He collected data over a 3-year \nspan at a medium security prison for youthful offenders (aged 18 to 25). Spatial \ndensity was more highly correlated with institutional misconduct than was social \ndensity, but social interaction factors (e.g., friendship ties) may have played an \nimportant role. Density, without distinction to spatial or social density, and dis \nciplinary infractions are, according to some investigators, positively related (Cox, \nPaulus, & McCain, 1984; Jan, 1980; Nacci, Teitelbaum, & Prather, 1977; Paulus \net al., 1981; Ruback & Carr, 1984), but no such association was found by others \n(Bonta & Kiem, 1978; Bonta & Nanckivell, 1980; Clayton & Carr, 1984; Ekland \nOlson, Barrick, & Cohen, 1983; Porporino & Dudley, 1984). \nFrom our appraisal of the empirical literature we cannot conclude that high \npopulation density is always associated with aggressive behavior. Most research \ners agree that other variables play important moderating roles (Bonta, 1986; Cox \net al., 1984; Ellis, 1984). One important moderator variable is age of the inmates. \nThe relationship between misconduct and population density has been more pro \nnounced in institutions housing young offenders (Ekland-Olsen et al., 1983; Jan, \n1980; Megargee, 1977; Nacci et al., 1977). Even in studies that failed to uncover \na general positive relationship, the introduction of age as a moderator showed a \ncorrelation between population density and misconduct (Bonta &  Kiem,  1978; \nBonta & Nanckivell, 1980; Clayton & Carr, 1984; Ekland-Olson et al., 1983). In \nthe Ekland-Olson et al.  study (1983), when institutions with a relatively young \npopulation (median age  of 27)  were selected for analysis,  a highly  significant \ncorrelation was found (r = .58 or ad = 1.43). The authors concluded that age is \na much better predictor of disciplinary infractions than prison size. \nOnly one study (Gaes & McGuire, 1985) discounts the importance of age. \nGaes and McGuire (1985)  assessed a variety of predictors along with age and \nunder these conditions age became relatively less important.  The authors ob \nserved that most studies of overcrowding and misconduct typically assess few \nvariables and may overestimate the importance of any one variable. \nInterpreting the behavioral consequences of prison overcrowding is further \nconfounded by the use of aggregate level data. As Table 1 clearly shows, almost \nall the studies under Outcome C are aggregate level data. The problem with this \nlevel of analysis is that many other factors (e.g., age, release policies) may play \nmore important roles than population density.  Clayton and Carr (1987)  have \nshown that aggregate data analysis overestimates the relationship between crowd \ning and behavior (a point already made in the preceding paragraph). In their study \ninvestigating the relationship between prison overcrowding and  recidivism (2 \nVERMILLION 003550\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 27 PageID #:\n 2442\n354  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nyears postrelease), age was the critical variable. The only other study that used \nrecidivism as an outcome ineasure was by Farrington and Nuttall (1980), and they \nfound a significant relationship between crowding and postrelease recidivism. \nHowever, Gaes (1983) has suggested that other extraneous variables (e.g., age, \nstaff-inmate ratios) could better account for the results. \nAlthough age has consistently been identified as  an important moderating \nvariable, explanations of why this is so have not been carefully researched. Are \nthe young simply impulsive, lack coping skills, and more easily susceptible to \nstress? MacKenzie (1987) found oppositional or \"assertive\" attitudes and fear of \nvictimization rather than coping ability as most relevant to misconducts. Clearly \nfurther research on this issue is desirable. \nThe identification of person variables as  moderators in  the experience of \nprison crowding raises the enduring issue of importation versus deprivation. That \nis, are the behaviors observed in prison reflective of behavioral patterns that were \npresent prior to incarceration or a response to the deprivation of liberties imposed \nby confinement? As Freedman (1975) wrote, \"crowding has neither good nor bad \neffects  but rather serves to  intensify the individual's  typical  reactions  to  a \nsituation\" (p. 89). Thus, the disciplinary infractions observed in crowded prisons \nmay be the result of either high population densities or a continuation of behaviors \nthat existed before incarceration,  or both.  As  Ruback and Innes (1988)  have \nremarked, there are no studies that have partitioned inmates with violent histories \nfrom nonviolent inmates. This is very important because it is usually the maxi \nmum security settings that are crowded, and they are also the settings most likely \nto house violent inmates. The possibility of an interaction can be seen in Smith's \n(1982) account of how assertive inmates became more aggressive and the passive \ninmates more submissive under crowded conditions. \nThere are other factors, besides person variables, that may influence aggres \nsive behavior in crowded prisons. For instance, crowded prisons may be poorly \nmanaged (Gaes, 1985). Although prison populations may fluctuate widely, cor \nresponding changes in the number of supervisory staff, counselors, and programs \nrarely occur. When the population is large, there are fewer correctional staff to \nmonitor behavior and provide inmates with the opportunities to learn adaptive \ncoping skills. The management of prisons and prison systems may account for \nsome inmate disturbances. A case in point is the occurrence of sudden changes in \nthe population membership (Ellis, 1984). Porporino and Dudley (1984), in review \ning evidence from 24 Canadian penitentiaries, found high inmate turnover more \nimportant than population density in the prediction of inmate disruptions. The \nauthors speculated that inmates are required to deal with newly arrived inmates \nmore frequently and this may be extremely stressful. For example, in the 1980 \nNew Mexico prison riot, the inmate population was not at its peak but there was \na sudden influx of new inmates in the months preceding the riot (Colvin, 1982). \nAnother factor appears to be the chronicity of the situation (Megargee, 1977). \nThat is, as sentence length or exposure to crowded situations increase so does the \nrisk for misconduct (Bonta &  Nanckivell,  1980; Nacci et a!.,  1977). This is  a \ntentative conclusion because of other confounding factors such as age and type of \ninstitution (Jan, 1980; Paulus, 1988). \nVERMILLION 003551\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 27 PageID #:\n 2443\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  355 \nIn summary, crowded prisons may produce physiological and psychological \nstress among many inmates. More disruptive effects however, depend upon mod \nerating person variables such as age, institutional parameters (e.g., sudden shifts \nin the inmate membership), and the chronicity of the situation. In addition, ag \ngressive behavior may be a cumulative effect of high population densities. More \nresearch into the parameters that govern this effect is required. \nTwo theoretical models have been advanced in an effort to explain the in \nmate's response to prison overcrowding. The social-interaction demand model \nfavored by Paulus and his colleagues (Cox eta!., 1984; Paulus, 1988) assumes that \nsocial interactions interfere with goal attainment and increase uncertainty and \ncognitive load. That is, it is the nature of the social interactions that may produce \nnegative effects and high population densities are important only to the degree \nthat they affect social interactions. The second model is based on a cognitive \nsocial-learning model (Bonta, 1986; Ellis, 1984; see also Cox, Paulus, & McCain \nfor a critique of this model.) \nThis latter model places greater emphasis on individual differences (person \nvariables) and stresses two processes: attribution and learned coping behavior. \nIncreases in population density produce changes not only in social interactions \nbut also changes in noise level, temperature, etc., and these in turn produce \nphysiological arousal. When inmates attribute this arousal to violation of their \npersonal space rather than some other factor they then report feeling crowded. \nOnce the attribution is made, existing coping behaviors are activated with the goal \nto reduce arousal and feelings of crowding. \nExcept for MacKenzie's (1987) findings, penal researchers have found that \ncoping behavior plays a significant role in the inmates' response to incarceration \nand that inmates vary in the effectiveness of their coping behaviors (cf. Zamble & \nPorporino,  1990). Clements (1979) has suggested that coping behavior may be \ninfluential in the inmates' adaptation to prison overcrowding, although some of \nthese behaviors, such as assault and suicide (Cox et a!., 1984; Megargee, 1977), \nare clearly not adaptive. Unfortunately, poor coping skills are all too prevalent \namong inmate populations and this is reflected in their disruptive behavioral re \nsponses  to  high population densities.  However,  other behaviors can alleviate \ncrowding-induced arousal and at the same time be adaptive. For example, class \nroom attendance (Jan,  1980; Lawrence,  1985)  and psychological interventions \n(Karlin, Katz, Epstein, & Woodfolk, 1979) have been shown to decrease feelings \nof being crowded. Besides searching for ways to control the prison population \ngrowth we can also develop programs to teach individual inmates more effective \nskills to cope with high prison populations. \nHealth Risks \nAs we have seen with the prison crowding literature, it is not uncommon to \nobserve physiological and psychological distress associated with high population \ndensities. Such outcomes are also commonly associated with stress and physical \ndisorders. In fact, many studies of prison overcrowding will use illness complaints \nas a dependent measure. Thus, we now turn our attention to a related topic and \nask ourselves if imprisonment threatens the health of the confined. \nVERMILLION 003552\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 11 of 27 PageID #:\n 2444\n356  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nMost of the research has  dealt with the identification and description of \nillnesses reported by prisoners (cf., Novick & AI-Ibrahim, 1977). Available data \nfail to clearly indicate whether inmates display more or less health risks than the \ngeneral population. When threats to health come from suicide and self-mutilation, \nthen inmates are clearly at risk.  Though it is  widely believed that the risk of \nhomicide is greater within prison than in the community, the evidence is mixed. \nIn Canadian penitentiaries, the homicide rates are close to 20 times that of similar \naged males in Canadian society (Porporino & Martin, 1983). In the United States, \ndeaths due to homicide are actually less likely within prison (Ruback & Innes, \n1988).  With respect to self-injurious behavior, the results are more consistent. \nInmate suicides for a 20-year period in the United States were at a rate of 17.5 per \n100,000 inmates in contrast to 11  per 100,000 people in the general population \n(Austin &  Unkovic,  1977). Self-mutilations are at an even higher rate (Ross & \nMcKay, 1979). \nWhen one examines the incidence of physical illnesses, the findings are less \nconclusive. One of the classic studies comes from Jones (1976) who surveyed the \nhealth risks of Tennessee prisoners and compared them where possible to proba \ntioners and data existing on the general adult male U.S. population. The patterns \nof results are rather complex but, by and large, a variety of health problems, \ninjuries, and selected symptoms of psychological distress were higher for certain \nclasses of inmates than probationers, parolees, and, where data existed, for the \ngeneral population. \nIn contrast to Jones (1976), a number of other researchers have failed to find \ndeleterious effects on health.  Goldsmith (1972) followed  50  inmates over a 2-\nmonth period and found no major health problems as assessed by physical exam \ninations. On a larger inmate sample (N =  491), Derro (1978) found that only 12% \nof the symptoms reported on admission related to a significant illness. This is an \nimportant point because many studies \"count\" health care contacts without dif \nferentiating the nature of the contact. Inmates may seek the aid of health care \nprofessionals for reasons other than a physical illness. \nTwo studies also reported a significantly lower incidence of hypertension \namong inmates compared to the general population. Culpepper and Froom (1980) \nfound the incidence of hypertension among a prison population at 6%. In another \nstudy (Novick, Della-Penna, Schwartz, Remlinger, & Lowenstein, 1977), the in \ncidence of hypertension among 1,300 inmates was 4.5%. We remind the reader, \nhowever, that this finding relates to the effects of incarceration in general and not \nto specific conditions such as  prison crowding where the results are different \n(Gaes, 1985). \nOne of the problems with the interpretation of the above data has been that \nthere is so little use of adequate control groups especially with respect to age and \nrace (see Ruback & Innes, 1988 for a notable exception). Also, Baird (1977) found \nthat many prisoners with physical complaints were displaying a variety of health \nrisks well before incarceration. As a case in point, Bentz and Noel (1983) found \nthat upon entering prison, inmates were reporting a higher incidence of psychi \natric disorder than a sample of a rural population in North Carolina. This finding \nis also of interest in light of Gibbs'  (1987)  claim that incarceration aggravates \nVERMILLION 003553\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 12 of 27 PageID #:\n 2445\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  357 \npsychological symptomatology (we will say more about this in the discussion on \nshort-term detention). \nA final consideration is that many prisons may actually be conducive to good \nhealth. In a number of cases, illness complaints have either decreased with time \nserved (MacKenzie & Goodstein, 1985) or remained unchanged (Wormith, 1986). \nIn most prisons, inmates have regular and nutritious diets, access to recreational \nexercise, and opportunity to sleep. Furthermore, offenders can obtain fairly im \nmediate health care. Because of this last possibility, health risks could easily be \noverreported in prisons with extensive health services and thus bias some of the \nresearch findings. \nIn summary, the current findings recall Glueck and Glueck's (1950) compar \nison of 500 delinquents with 500 nondelinquents: In training school, the boys were \ngenerally healthy and physically fit, whereas in the community, as a result of their \nadventurous lifestyles, they were prone to more serious accidents. More than 35 \nyears later, Ruback and Innes (1988)  make this same observation based upon \ninformation from adult inmates. Thus, as far as  physical health is  concerned, \nimprisonment may have the fortuitous benefit of isolating the offender from a \nhighly risky lifestyle in the community. \nLong-Term Incarceration \nIn 1984 there were approximately 1,500 offenders serving life sentences in \nCanadian prisons (Wormith, 1984) and with recent legislation defining minimum \nsentences (25  years) without parole for first and second degree murder, those \nnumbers are expected to increase significantly.  Similar trends have also been \nnoted in the United States, where mandatory and lengthy prison terms have been \nwidely implemented (cf., Cullen & Gilbert, 1982). What happens to these people \nas a result of such lengthy sentences? Most of the research has focused upon time \nspans not longer than 2 or 3 years, and our knowledge regarding offenders serving \nsentences of 5,  10, or more years is less adequate. \nUsing cross-sectional designs, Heskin and his colleagues measured inmates' \nperformances on cognitive tests (Banister, Smith, Heskin, & Bolton, 1973), per \nsonality measures  (Heskin,  Smith,  Banister,  &  Bolton,  1973),  and attitudinal \nscales (Heskin, Bolton, Smith, & Banister, 1974). Four groups of prisoners, all \nsentenced to at least 10 years, were studied. The average time served was 2.5 \nyears for the first group of inmates, 4.9 years for the second group, 6.9 years for \nthe third, and 11.3 for the last group. No differences were found among the groups \nin intellectual performance, although there was a decline in perceptual motor \nspeed on the cognitive tasks (Banister et a!., 1973). On the personality and atti \ntudinal tests, there were increases in hostility and social introversion (Heskin et \na!., 1973) and decreases in self-evaluations and evaluations of work and father \n(Heskin eta!., 1974). \nSubsequently, Bolton, Smith, Heskin, and Banister (1976) retested 154 of the \noriginal175 inmates in the Heskin research (average retest interval was 2 years). \nTheir findings showed no evidence of psychological deterioration. In fact, verbal \nintelligence improved over time and hostility decreased. The findings with respect \nVERMILLION 003554\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 13 of 27 PageID #:\n 2446\n358  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nto hostility are in contrast to the cross-sectional studies, but, as the authors noted, \nthere was a significant drop-out rate. Furthermore, the initial testing occurred \nduring a period of institutional tensions, which may have produced artificially high \nhostility scores. \nSapsford (1978)  administered a psychometric test battery to 60  prisoners \nsentenced to life imprisonment. The prisoners formed three groups: (1) reception \n(newly received), (2) middle (6th year of sentence), and (3) hard core (average \nsentence served was 14 years). Some matching was attempted but it is not clear \nthe extent to which the procedure was successful. From the results, only three \ninmates could be described as having failed to cope with their sentence. The only \ndeteriorating effects observed were increases in dependency upon staff for direc \ntion and social introversion. In fact, depression and anxiety were lower for in \nmates serving longer sentences. \nReed's (1978) geriatric prisoner research also has relevance to the issue. His \naged prisoners (mean age of 60 years), with an average sentence served of 23 \nyears, reported fewer life problems than their peers in the outside community. \nFurthermore, they reported active interests and feeling younger than their age. \nSimilarly, Richards (1978) also failed to note negative differences between \nBritish prisoners who had served at least 8 years of their sentence and inmates \nwho had served more than 10 years. The two groups were matched on age at \nsentencing and type of offense. The inmates were asked to rate the frequency and \nseverity of 20  different problems that may be initiated by incarceration (e.g., \nmissing social life, sexual frustration). The results showed no differences in the \nperception of problems by the two groups, and there was agreement by the in \nmates that coping could be best accomplished by relying on \"myself.\" \nUtilizing Richard's (1978) problem-ranking task, Flanagan (1980a) assessed \nAmerican inmates who had served at least 5 years and compared his results to \nthose reported by Richards (1978). He found that the American inmates perceived \nsimilar problems to those reported by the British prisoners in that they also did not \nperceive the problems as particularly threatening to their mental health. Further \nmore, they preferred to cope with their sentences on their own rather than seek \nthe aid of others. In another study, Flanagan (1980b) compared misconduct rates \nof 701 short-term prisoners (less than 5 years) and 765 long-term inmates. Even \nafter controlling for age, the misconduct rate among the long-term inmates was \napproximately half that of the short-term offenders. \nRasch (1981) assessed lifers who had served 3, 8.5, and 13.5 years and found \nno  deterioration in  health,  psychiatric symptoms,  or intellect.  The results  of \nMMPI testing documented decreased pathology over time, replicating Sapsford's \n(1980) findings.  Another German study,  cited by Wormith (1984a),  apparently \nfound similar results. Moreover, when long-term inmates (20  years) displayed \npathology, such behaviors were apparent long before incarceration. \nA series of studies conducted by Wormith (1984, 1986) observed a differential \nimpact from long-term incarceration. In the first study (Wormith, 1984), 269 in \nmates who had served from 1 month to 10 years were administered a psychomet \nric test battery. Once again those inmates who had served the most time displayed \nsignificantly less deviance. This relationship remained even after the introduction \nVERMILLION 003555\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 14 of 27 PageID #:\n 2447\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  359 \nof controls for sentence length, age upon admission, and race. Improvement over \ntime was also noted on attitudinal measures and nonpathological personality char \nacteristics. Finally, changes in intelligence did not vary with length of incarcera \ntion. \nThe second study by Wormith (1986) consisted of a random sample of 634 \nmale prisoners stratified according to sentence length and time served. Long-term \ninmates (8 years to life), compared to short-term inmates, demonstrated better \nadjustment on measures of self-reports of emotions and attitudes (e.g., anger) and \ninstitution discipline.  On measures of criminal sentiments, long-term offenders \ndisplayed a U-shaped function while short-term offenders became more antiso \ncial. As expected, long-term inmates had deteriorating community relationships \nover time but made more use of institutional programs (e.g., education), which \nwas likely important for a successful adaptation to prison life. \nMacKenzie and Goodstein (1985) reported findings similar to those described \nby Wormith (1984; 1986). Long-term inmates (more than 6 years served) found the \nearlier portion of their sentences more stressful, but with time they learned to \ncope effectively. Of particular interest was their differentiation of two subgroups \nof long-term offenders. Using prison experience as a discriminating factor, they \nidentified two groups, inmates with minimal prison experience (lifers) and inmates \nwith extensive prison experience (habituals). Both groups showed the same ad \njustment patterns, contrary to the expectation that habituals would evidence dis \nruptive behaviors.  Similar findings with respect to female offenders have also \nbeen reported by MacKenzie, Robinson, and Campbell (1989). In fact, long-term \ninmates were more bothered by boredom and lack of activities than by anxiety. \nMost of the above studies have been cross-sectional. A publication by Zam \nble and Porporino (1990) on how inmates cope with prison assumes importance for \ntwo reasons. First, it is longitudinal. Oftheir sample (N =  133), 30% were serving \nsentences of more than 10 years. They were assessed within 1 month of admission \nand 1112 years later. Zamble and Porporino found no overall indication of deteri \noration of coping skills over time, even for inmates serving their first incarcera \ntion. As well, there was no increase in identification with \"criminal others\" and \ntheir \"view of the world\" did not change. The authors surmise that as prisons, by \nand large, constrain behavior and do little to encourage changes in behavior one \nway or the other, inmates typically undergo a \"behavioral deep freeze.\"  The \noutside-world behaviors that led the offender into trouble prior to imprisonment \nremain until release. \nSecondly, it is important to emphasize that Zamble and Proporino do not in \nthe least deny the fact that individual differences are meaningful. They reported \nthat how some inmates coped with incarceration correlated with postprison re \ncidivism. For example, some of the significant factors were changes in percep \ntions of prison life,  degree and type of socialization with incarcerated peers, \nplanning for the future, and motivation regarding work and educational goals. We \nwill return to this point later. \nIn summary, from the available evidence and on the dimensions measured, \nthere is little to support the conclusion that long-term imprisonment necessarily \nhas detrimental effects. As a caution, however, Flanagan (1982) claims that lifers \nVERMILLION 003556\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 15 of 27 PageID #:\n 2448\n360  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nmay change upon other dimensions that have yet to be objectively measured. For \nexample, family  separation issues  and vocational  skill training needs present \nunique difficulties for long-term inmates (Wilson & Vito, 1988). Unfortunately, \ncross-sectional designs and, until recently, small subject populations have been \ncharacteristic of these studies. \nSolitary Confmement \nSolitary confinement is \"the most individually destructive, psychologically \ncrippling and socially alienating experience that could conceivably exist within the \nborders of the country\" (p.  243).  So wrote Jackson (1983)  in  his  scathing de \nnouncement of the use of solitary confinement for  prisoners.  The  commonly \naccepted definition of prison solitary confinement is maximum security lock-up, \nusually for punitive reasons. Sensory stimulation is very limited. The inmate may \nhave a book to read and access to a half hour of \"recreation\" (alone). Conditions \nof prison solitary should not be confused with other forms of protective segrega \ntion (cf., Gendreau, Wormith, & Tellier, 1985) where admission is usually volun \ntary, and the inmate has access to programming, TV, and so forth. No doubt, if \nany prison experience is evidence of cruel and unusual punishment, then surely \nthat experience is prison solitary. \nIn contrast to the popular notions of solitary's negative effects, there exists \nan extensive experimental literature on the effects  of placing people (usually \nvolunteer college  students) in  solitary,  or conditions of sensory  deprivation, \nwhich has been ignored in the penology literature. It should be noted that the \nconditions in some of the sensory deprivation experiments are more severe than \nthat found in prison solitary (cf., Gendreau & Bonta, 1984). In fact, this literature \n(cf., Suedfeld, 1980; Zubek, 1969) has much relevance to prison solitary confine \nment. Considerable research has also been undertaken with prisoners themselves \n(Gendreau & Bonta, 1984), and many of these studies are, methodologically, the \nmost rigorous of all the prison studies. Therefore, conclusions drawn from this \nsource are especially informative. \nExperimental studies (Ecclestone,  Gendreau,  &  Knox,  1974;  Gendreau, \nFreedman, Wilde, & Scott, 1968,  1972; Gendreau, Horton, Hooper, Freedman, \nWilde, & Scott, 1968; Gendreau, McClean, Parsons, Drake, & Ecclestone, 1970; \nWalters, Callaghan, &  Newman,  1963) have found few detrimental effects for \nsubjects placed in solitary confinement for periods up to 10 days. All but one of \nthese studies employed random assignment and most employed a double blind \nassessment of dependent variables. Perceptual and motor abilities were not im \npaired, physiological levels of stress were lower than for the control groups, and \nvarious attitudes toward the environment and the self did not worsen. Individual \ndifferences have also been observed.  Experience with prison life,  conceptual \nability, anxiety, diurnal adrenal levels, and EEG patterns were related to some of \nthe results reported, although it should be noted that results are based upon very \nsmall sample sizes. Some of the experimental studies even reported beneficial \nresults (cf., Suedfeld, 1980). In certain respects, the prison literature (Gendreau et \na!., 1972) is quite consistent with the experimental sensory deprivation laboratory \ndata (e.g., Suedfeld, 1980; Zubek, Shepard, & Milstein, 1970). \nVERMILLION 003557\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 16 of 27 PageID #:\n 2449\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  361 \nIn contrast to the studies that used volunteer subjects,  Weinberg (1967) \nlooked at 20 inmates who were involuntarily placed for 5 days in solitary confine \nment. Using measures such as cognitive and personality tests, language usage, \nand time estimation, he, too, found no deleterious effects. Suedfeld, Ramirez, and \nBaker-Brown (1982), also studying inmates involuntarily in solitary confinement, \nalso failed to find detrimental effects. Their data were collected from five prisons \nin Canada and the United States, and they found that, in general, inmates found \nthe first 72 hours the most difficult but after that they adjusted quite well. The \nauthors reached this conclusion:  \"Our data lend no support to the claim that \nsolitary confinement ... is overwhelmingly aversive, stressful, or damaging to \nthe inmates\" (p. 335). \nIn contrast, Cormier and Williams (1966) and Grassian (1983) recorded signs \nof pathology for inmates incarcerated in solitary for periods up to a year. No \nobjective measures or control groups were used. In the former study, most of the \ninmates exhibited substantial pathology prior to solitary. In the second study, all \nsubjects were involved in a class action suit against their keepers at the time of the \ninterview, and the author actively enc.ouraged more disclosure when the inmates \nwere not forthcoming with reports of distress. Similarly, the experimental litera \nture on sensory deprivation demonstrates that once controls for set and expec \ntancies are introduced, bizarre experiences, under even the most severe condi \ntions (immobilization and sensory deprivation for 14 days), were minimal for the \nmajority of subjects (e.g., Zubek, Bayer, & Shepard, 1969). \nThe real culprit may not necessarily be the condition of solitary per se but the \nmanner in which inmates have been treated. There is evidence suggesting that this \nis the basis for most inmate complaints (Suedfeld, 1980; Vantour, 1975). Jackson \n(1983) himself acceded to this fact. When inmates are dealt with capriciously by \nmanagement or individual custodial officers, psychological stress can be created \neven in the most humane of prison environments. Therefore, solitary confinement \nmay not be cruel and unusual punishment under the humane and time-limited \nconditions investigated in experimental studies or in correctionaljurisdictions that \nhave well-defined and effectively administered ethical guidelines for its use. \nWe must emphasize that this is not an argument for employing solitary and \ncertainly not for the absurdly lengthy periods as documented by Jackson (1983). \nGendreau and Bonta (1984) have outlined several research issues that urgently \nneed to be addressed. Some of these are studies investigating individual tolerance \nof solitary confinement, its possible deterrent effect, and a compelling need to find \nalternatives to humanely restrain those who are a danger to themselves and others \nwhile incarcerated. With rare exceptions (Barak-Glantz, 1983), the necessary re \nsearch has not been conducted. \nShort-Term Detention \nIn 1972, nearly 4,000 jails in the United States processed 1 million male and \nfemale offenders per year (Miller, 1978). The offenders were charged with a va \nriety of crimes and approximately 75% of them were awaiting trial. Despite the \nextensive use of jails, little is known about the effects of short-term detention. \nVERMILLION 003558\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 17 of 27 PageID #:\n 2450\n362  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nPerhaps this is the area that requires most attention, as it is the initial adjustment \nphases that are important in assessing the impact of incarceration. For example, \n50% of suicides occur in the first 24 hours of imprisonment (Hayes, 1983). \nA common belief is that waiting for trial and sentencing produces a consid \nerable amount of anxiety (Cholst, 1979; Dy, 1974; Gibbs, 1982; Schneider, 1979). \nMore specifically, anxiety increases as the trial and sentencing dates approach \nand then decreases after sentencing when the uncertainty surrounding trial has \npassed. \nA study by Dyer (reported in Krug, Sacheier, & Cattell, 1976) is difficult to \nevaluate because of the lack of information provided. Dyer administered an anx \niety scale to adolescent females  and found a decrease in anxiety over time in \ndetention. However, no information regarding the number of subjects, the setting, \nand the interval between tests was provided. Oleski (1977) administered the same \nscale to 60 male inmates (ages 18 to 26) in a Boston city jail. All were awaiting trial · \nand all had limited prior prison experience. The tests were administered 1 week \nafter admission and again 8 weeks later. Anxiety levels were found to be higher at \nposttest. \nBonta and N anckivell (1980) administered the same anxiety scale used in the \nprevious studies to four groups of inmates selected without age and court status \nlimitations. Group 1 inmates were remanded into custody and sentenced by the \ntime they were retested. Group 2 were still awaiting sentencing. Group 3 inmates \nentered the jail already sentenced, and Group 4 was a control group for the effects \nof testing. The test was administered within 1 week of reception and again 3 to 4 \nweeks later. No changes in anxiety over time or after sentencing were observed. \nGibbs (1987) assessed psychopathology among 339 jail inmates. The inmates \nwere asked to rate symptoms prior to incarceration, 72 hours into confinement, \nand again 5 days later. He found symptoms to increase between preincarceration \nand 72 hours of imprisonment and interpreted this finding as showing that deten \ntion per se affects symptoms. However, the interpretation is not entirely convinc \ning. First of all, symptomatology prior to incarceration was based upon the in \nmates' recollections of their difficulties before detention and thus subject to mem \nory  and reporting biases.  Second,  at the 5-day  retest,  symptoms  actually \ndiminished, and third, the finding that those without prior hospitalizations did \nworse was a puzzling finding and not consistent with the prison as stress model. \nThere is another intriguing, albeit tangential, aspect to the short-term deten \ntion literature, and that is the use of short-term detention as a deterrent. Three \ncommon strategies are \"Scared Straight,\" \"boot camp,\" and shock probation \nprograms. The assumption is that prison life is aversive in some form or other and \nthat exposure to it will decrease the probability of future criminal behavior, par \nticularly for impressionable young offenders. \nThe classic evaluation of \"Scared Straight\" by Finckenauer and Storti (1978) \nfound only one of nine attitudinal measures significantly changed for juveniles as \na result of brief exposure to hardened prisoners and no reduction in recidivism \n(Finckenauer, 1979). Other variations on the original program have also found no \noverall deterrent effect (Buckner & Chesney-Lind, 1983; Lewis, 1983), although \nsome individual differences were noted. Similarly, there is now general consensus \nVERMILLION 003559\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 18 of 27 PageID #:\n 2451\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  363 \nthat shock probation (i.e., short prison terms prior to probation) has also failed to \ndemonstrate significant deterrent effects (Boudouris & Turnbull, 1985; Friday & \nPeterson, 1973; Vito, 1984). There is even one report (Vito, Holmes, & Wilson, \n1985) suggesting that shock probation for a subgroup of probationers increased \nrecidivism! \nSome jurisdictions have received media attention by employing quasimili \ntary, boot camp regimes for offenders. In the only evaluation with a follow-up that \nwe are aware of-although more will be forthcoming in the near future (Mac \nKenzie, personal communication)-juveniles taking part in such a program did \nnot have reduced reconviction rates compared to nonparticipatory youths (Thorn \nton, Curran, Grayson, & Holloway, 1984). Curiously, older adolescents reported \nan easier time in the program compared to their previous experiences with incar \nceration. \nDeath Row \nOnce an issue of little importance, the pragmatics of how best to deal with \ninmates awaiting capital punishment is now of particular concern. The rate of \ndeath penalty commitments between 1981 and 1983 ranged from 228 to 264 per \nyear in the United States, and these rates are expected to remain in the same range \n(Cheatwood, 1985). Since the rate of executions is far lower, a considerable num \nber of offenders are on death rows waiting out lengthy appeal applications. In fact, \n· psychiatrists are now being asked to assess the death row inmate's appreciation of \nthe appeal process and competency for execution (Kenner, 1986). In 1985, nearly \n1,500 inmates were in this situation (Cheatwood,  1985).  The growing numbers \nhave led to crowded conditions on some death rows, and, in one incident, appar \nently motivated two condemned prisoners to take hostages as a sign of protest \n(The Citizen, 1986). \nVery little evidence is available on how inmates adjust to death row. Perhaps \nthe first study reported is that by Bluestone and McGahee (1962). They inter \nviewed 19 inmates (18  men and one woman) awaiting execution at Sing Sing \nprison.  Expecting to find  intense anxiety and  depression,  they found  none. \nGallemore and Panton (1972) tested 8 rrien awaiting execution at reception and \nseveral times thereafter up to a period of 2 years. Five men showed no observable \ndeterioration upon the measures employed whereas 3 reported symptoms ranging \nfrom paranoia to insomnia. In a further study of 34 inmates on death row, Panton \n(1976)  compared their MMPI profiles with a large prison sample.  Death row \ninmates showed increased feelings of depression and hopelessness. Severe dis \nturbances (e.g., psychosis) were not observed. \nJohnson (1982) interviewed 35 men on death row and found them concerned \nover their powerlessness, fearful of their surroundings, and feeling emotionally \ndrained. Younger inmates were more susceptible to these concerns. However, no \ncomparison group was employed and the prevalence of these feelings  among \ninmates in general is unknown. \nSmith and Felix (1986) conducted unstructured psychiatric interviews of 34 \ndeath row inmates. Most of their sample exhibited well-intact defenses regarding \nVERMILLION 003560\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 19 of 27 PageID #:\n 2452\n364  BONTA AND GENDREAU \ntheir alleged guilt. Only 7 inmates evidenced a depressed mood that might have \nrequired further counseling intervention. Debro, Murty, Roebuck, and McCann \n(1987) interviewed 25  death row inmates and found that all slept well and felt \nrelatively good about themselves. None requested or received tranquilizers. Fi \nnally, in a rare study of death row inmates who had their sentences commuted to \nlife imprisonment, 23 inmates (46%) showed no change in personality functioning \nas measured by the MMPI (Dahlstrom, Panton, Bain, & Dahlstrom, 1986). Fur \nthermore, 18 (36%) showed an improvement while only 9 (18%) deteriorated. \nThis literature, inadequate as it is, is meaningful for what it fails to produce \nevidence of severe psychological reactions to  a tragic fate.  Why this is  so  is \nunclear. Some (Bluestone & McGahee, 1962; Smith & Felix, 1986) have suggested \nthat death row inmates have particularly well-developed defense mechanisms, but \nthis hypothesis has been based solely on subjective clinical impressions. In fact, \nit may be those associated with the condemned inmate (family, prison staff, etc.) \nthat suffer more (Smykla, 1987). The limited data are a testimony to the ability of \nmen to cope with the worst of consequences. \nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \nWhen it comes to scholarly inquiry in the field of criminal justice, a perni \ncious tendency has been to invoke rhetoric over reality and affirm ideology over \nrespect for empirical evidence. We have witnessed this sad state of affairs in the \ndebates over the effectiveness of rehabilitation, personality and crime, and the \nrelationship between social class and criminal behavior (Andrews & Wormith, \n1989; Cullen & Gendreau, 1989). \nIf we are to make progress in understanding what it is our prisons do to \ninmates, then we must respect the available evidence. We do not discount the \nimportance of phenomenology in assessing prison life; this line of inquiry does \nprovide valuable insight (e.g., Toch,  1977).  But, if we  stray too far from the \nepistemic values that are crucial to a vigorous social science then we run the risk \nof marking disastrous policy decisions. Therefore, if we are to have a more con- . \nstructive agenda we must face the fact that simplistic notions of the \"pains of \nimprisonment\" simply will  not be instructive and will  mitigate against the in \nmate's well-being. \nThe facts are that long-term imprisonment and specific conditions of confine \nment such as solitary, under limiting and humane conditions, fail to show any sort \nof profound detrimental effects. The crowding literature indicates that moderating \nvariables play a crucial role. The health risks to inmates appear minimal. Unfor \ntunately prisons, in a way, may minimize some stress by removing the need to \nmake daily decisions that are important for community living (Zamble &  Por \nporino, 1990). \nIf we approach prison life with sensitivity, however, we will foster a much \nmore realistic and proactive research and policy agenda.  Our literature review \nrevealed considerable support for this notion. We repeatedly found that interac-\nVERMILLION 003561\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 20 of 27 PageID #:\n 2453\nCRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT  365 \ntions between certain types of individual differences and situational components \nexplained a meaningful percentage of the variance. To illustrate, we found that \nage, changes in the prison population, and the chronicity of the situation had \nprofound influences on the responses of inmates to high population density. There \nalso appear to be some cognitive and biological individual differences that may \ninfluence adjustment to solitary confinement. \nIn regard to the above, it is important that the assessment of environments \nreach the same level of methodological sophistication as the assessment of indi \nviduals. There have been some promising developments toward that end. Wenk \nand Moos (1972) have developed the Correctional Institutions Environment Scale; \nToch (1977), the Prison Preference Profile; and Wright (1985), the Prison Envi \nronment Inventory. These are initial steps and it is hoped that research along \nthese lines will continue. \nOur final comments are in regard to theory development. To date, the incar \nceration literature has been very much influenced by a \"pains of imprisonment\" \nmodel. This model views imprisonment as psychologically harmful. However, the \nempirical data we reviewed question the validity of the view that imprisonment is \nuniversally painful. Solitary confinement, under limiting and humane conditions, \nlong-term imprisonment, and short-term detention fail to show detrimental ef \nfects. From a physical health standpoint, inmates appear more healthy than their \ncommunity counterparts. We have little data on the effects of death row, and the \ncrowding literature indicates that moderating variables play a crucial role. \nOn a brighter note,  the  stress model does provide a positive agenda for \nameliorative action. In the long-term incarceration literature, researchers (Zam \nble, 1989; Zamble & Porporino, 1988, 1990) have found that some inmates cope \nsuccessfully with prison but others do not and that the type of coping is modestly \nrelated to future recidivism. Furthermore, on the basis of their analysis, if emo \ntional distress is reported by inmates, it is more often early on in their incarcer \nation. It is at this point that they may be receptive to treatment. The implications \nfor the timing of prison-based treatment programs is obvious. The crucial point is \nthat on the basis of this evidence, we can now develop a variety of cognitive \nbehavioral and/or skills training programs that could assist prisoners in dealing \nwith their experiences in the most constructive manner possible. There is accu \nmulating and persuasive evidence, moreover, that certain types of offender pro \ngramming  strategies  in prison can reduce subsequent recidivism (Andrews, \nZinger, Hoge, Bonta, Gendreau, & Cullen, 1989). This proactive agenda, we wish \nto emphasize, was not forthcoming from those who viewed prisons as invariably \ndestructive. Unfortunately, their recommendations were for almost total deinsti \ntutionalization, which is not only an extreme view, but also one that is totally \nunpalatable given North American cultural values and the current sociopolitical \nreality (see Currie, 1985; Glazer, 1989). \nIn our view, a social learning perspective (cf. Bandura, 1977) provides a more \ncomprehensive explanation of the evidence. Social learning theory examines be \nhavior (attitudes, motor actions, emotions) as a function of the rewards and pun \nishments operating in a prison environment. There is an explicit acceptance of \nperson variables moderating the responsivity to imprisonment. Several questions \nVERMILLION 003562\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-24   Filed 06/21/19   Page 21 of 27 PageID #:\n 2454\n366  BONTA AND GENDREAU \nemerge from this perspective: Who perceives prisons as stressful? What aspect of \nimprisonment shapes behavior? And how do individuals respond to imprison \nment? Answers to these questions would provide insight into the individuals who \ndo not perceive their environments as stressful while imprisoned and what aspects \nof imprisonment attenuate the prison experience. In addition, this perspective \nwould clarify the links between emotions, attitudes, and behavior. \nFrom this review, we also see a clear research agenda.  Further efforts to \nunderstand the effects of prison overcrowding should focus on individual levels of \nanalysis along with multiple measures of the three outcome variables (emotions, \nattitudes, and behavior). Longitudinal designs (e.g., Zamble & Porporino, 1990) \nshould be the rule. The inherent difficulties in interpreting aggregate level data \nappear only to confuse our understanding of the impact of crowded conditions on \nthe individual.  We  need to  know  under what conditions an individual feels \ncrowded, becomes emotionally distressed, and copes with this distress in a mal \nadaptive manner. For example, Ruback, Carr, and Hopper (1986) suggested that \nperceived control is a possible mediator. The solution to prison overcrowding is \nnot to embark on a prohibitively expensive prison construction program (Funke, \n1985) but rather to alter the rate of intake and release (Skovron, 1988). One way \nof accomplishing this task is to increase community correctional treatment pro \ngrams that would allow the diversion of inmates away from prisons (Bonta & \nMotiuk,  1987).  Despite the reluctance of many  correctional administrators  to. \ndevelop such programs, there appears to be considerable public support not only \nfor community treatment initiatives  (Skovron,  Scott,  &  Cullen,  1988)  but for \nrehabilitation in general (Cullen, Skovron, Scott, & Burton, 1990). \nThe application of longitudinal designs using data collected at the individual \nlevel is also needed in the other areas we have discussed. This is especially so with \nlong-term imprisonment and health risks where the data suggest that if anything, \nthe prison system may actually prevent deterioration. However, only longitudinal \ndesigns will allow us to make such a conclusion with any high degree of certainty. \nIf future research leads us to the same conclusion, then the next step would be to \nidentify the system contingencies that support such an environment, for certainly \nwe can learn something positive from this type of result. Finally, and remarkably, \nwe know so little about the psychological impact of a system that houses over a \nmillion individuals: the jails. Here, almost any type of reasoned research would be \na step in the right direction. \nAll of the above is easier said than done. The host of issues that need to be \nresearched  seem infinite.  The methodological complexities in examining both \nperson and situation interaction are pronounced. But, it appears to us to be a \npositive agenda in order to gain knowledge addressing a vital question. \nREFERENCES \nAltman, I. (1978).

This study of \n502 male and female jail inmates attempts to bridge this gap. Results showed optimism was \nnegatively associated with physical health concerns upon entry to jail and prior to release or \ntransfer. Additionally, optimism assessed upon entry to jail predicted modest decreases in physical \nhealth concerns over incarceration. Results suggest that optimism is a health-related variable that \nmay be beneficial when optimism-increasing components are integrated into treatment. \nKeywords \nphysical health; optimism; jail; inmates \nFrom June 2005 to June2006, the US prison and jail population increased 2.8%, housing \n2,245,189 inmates (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2007). This housing is expensive and a \nsubstantial part of the cost is medical care~ totaling $3.3 billion in state prisons during 2001 \n(Stephan, 2004). One third ofj ail inmates in a nationally representative sample reported a \nphysical health problem, many of which were present prior to incarceration (Maruschak & \nBeck, 2001; Maruschak, 2006). Inmates have a wide variety of health problems ranging \nfrom arthritis, asthma, and backaches, to more serious diseases such as hepatitis, HIV, and \ntuberculosis (Conklin, Lincoln & Tuthill, 2000; Hammett, Harmon & Rhodes, 2002; \nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care, 2002; Staton-Tindall, Duvall, Leukefled \n& Oser, 2007). \nInmates also have a number of risk factors for health problems. Many come from \nneighborhoods mired in poverty with limited access to community based health care and \noften have lower levels offonnal education (Glaser & Greifinger, 1993). Additionally, the \nprevalence of drug and alcohol abuse, and associated health problems, is high among \noffenders. Moreover, the increasing rate of incarceration of females and older individuals \nfurther taxes the medical resources ofj ails and prisons, as both populations have a higher \nlikelihood of physical health concerns relative to young male inmates (Maruschak & Beck, \nCorrespondence concerning this article should be addressed to Caron P. Heigel, Deparbnent of Psychology, George Mason University, \nFairfax, Virginia 22030. cwalter4@gmu.edu. \nVERMILLION 003571\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312-25   Filed 06/21/19   Page 3 of 15 PageID #:\n 2463\nHeigel et al.  Page2 \n2001; Maruschak, 2006). In general, inmates have a wide variety of risk factors that have \nbeen associated with poor physical health (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2004; Garrity, Hiller, \nStaton, Webster & Leukefeld, 2002; Harlow, 2003; Staton-Tindall et al., 2007). While \nuseful for planning and prevention purposes, these variables are relatively fixed and do not \nreadily point to areas of intetvention for individuals currently incarcerated. \nAs the care for the physical health of offenders is becoming increasingly expensive, \ninterventions that can improve the offenders' physical health are desirable. Our interest is in \nidentifying more malleable psychological factors that are related to physical health and that \ncan be incorporated into intetventions for those currently incarcerated. One possible \npsychological factor is optimism, the expectation of positive outcomes and confidence in \nfuture success (Domino & Conway, 2001; Scheier & Carver 1985). \nCross-sectional results from studies in the general community indicate that higher optimism \nis associated with fewer mental and physical health problems (Aspinwall & Taylor, 1992; \nBrissette, Scheier & Carver, 2002; Peterson & Bossio, 2001; Ustundag-Budak & Mocan \nAydin, 2005). More importantly, in longitudinal studies, optimism has been prospectively \ncorrelated with outcomes such as a decreased likelihood of becoming ill, reduced severity \nand length of illness, and faster and more complete recovery following surgery (Carver & \nScheier, 2002; Scheier & Carver, 1985; 1987; Scheier et al., 1989). For example, in a \nlongitudinal study of men undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, Scheier et al. (1989) \nfound that higher levels of optimism the day before surgery was associated with faster rates \nof physical recovery during hospitalization and better postsurgical quality of life at 6 month \nand 5 year follow-ups. \nAspinwall, Richter and Hoffman (2001) have offered three explanations for the optimism/ \npositive outcome relationship. First, optimists are likely to utilize more effective and \nadaptive coping strategies, such as choosing and maintaining appropriate goal-directed \nbehaviors. Second, optimists are better able to distinguish controllable situations from those \nthat are uncontrollable and thus are more likely to demonstrate acceptance in the face of \nevents that they cannot control. Finally, optimists demonstrate more flexible and adaptive \nthinking than pessimists. Optimists pay more attention to the most useful information \navailable and show evidence of greater flexibility. Aspinwall et al. (2001) posit that \noptimists' openness to new information allows them to better process infonnation in their \nenvironment and respond accordingly. Findings from research with cancer patients indicate \nthat optimists address stressors by reframing negative situations, scan the environment \nlooking for information to apply to their situation, plan and expect recovery, and implement \ngoals that will help them to achieve recovery (Carver et al., 1993; Carver & Scheier, 2002). \nNot only have higher levels of optimism been related to better health outcomes in the \ngeneral community, but optimism is presumably amenable to intetvention. Research \nindicates that there are several interventions that can help individuals increase their level of \noptimism (Carver & Scheier, 2002; Gillham & Reivich, 2004). One approach is cognitive \nbehavioral therapy (CBT), which may increase optimism by helping individuals change their \nnegative thought patterns. In CBT, individuals learn to identify and evaluate their negative \nthinking patterns, and generate more realistic and optimistic thoughts and beliefs. Other \ntherapies that teach individuals to set and reach realistic goals also appear to be related to \nincreased levels of optimism (Carver & Scheier, 2002). \nAlthough there is extensive literature examining the relationship between optimism and \nphysical and psychological health in the general community, to date only one article is \nknown to address optimism in an inmate population (van Harreveld, Pligt, Claassen, & Dijk, \n2007). In a sainple of 30 male inmates in the Netherlands, optimism was associated with \nJ Correct Health Care.

Page3 \nlower concurrent self-reports of mental and physical health problems. Researchers have yet \nto replicate this finding with female inmates, with larger samples of inmates, or in samples \nof inmates incarcerated in the United States correctional system, and none have exam.ined \ninmates' optimism and health longitudinally. \nDrawing on data from a larger longitudinal study (Tangney, Mashek & Stuewig, 2007), the \ncurrent paper addresses three ai-eas. First, we examine the concurrent relationship between \nself-reported physical health and optimism in a sample of 501 county jail inmates in the U.S. \nIt was hypothesized that, as in community samples, optimism would be negatively \nassociated with reported physical health concerns. \nSecond, we examine whether the number of reported physical health concerns changes over \nthe course of incarceration. Much ofthe literature regarding inmates' physical health \ninvestigates physical health upon entry to the correctional facility, and medical treatment \nwhile incarcerated, but does not adequately address changes in inmates' self-reported health \nconcerns ove; the course of incarceration. Based on the expec,tation that participants would \nhave access to services, such as medical exams, medication and a regular diet, which may be \nunavailable in the community for a substantial portion of inmates (Conklin et al., 2000; \nStaton-Tindall et al., 2007), it was hypothesized that there would be a decline in reported \nphysical health concerns over the period Of incarceration. Although inmates face significant· \nstressors, such as separation from loved ones, loss of freedom, and overcrowding while \nincarcerated, it was expected the benefits from nutritious meals and access to medical \nservices would offset these negatives. \nThird, we examine the possibility that optimism upon incarceration may explain some of the \nchanges in physical health concerns observed over the period of incarceration. We \nhypothesized that the higher the optimism the more likely symptomatology would decline. \nMethods \nParticipants \nThe sample consisted of 501 male and female inmates at an urban Adult Detention Center \nwho agreed to participate in a large-scale recidivism study (Tangney et al, 2007). The \nmajority, 349 (69.7%), were male and 152 (30.3%) were female. Participants's ages ranged \nfrom IS to 69 (M ~ 32, SD ~ 10). The racial/ethnic background of the participants was \n44.8% African American, 35.9% Caucasian, 9.2% Mexican American/Hispanic, 2.8% \nAsian/Pacific Islander, 7.4% Other/Mixed. The number of days participants were \nincarcerated ranged from 12 days to 607 days (M ~ 160.87, SD ~ 114.04). \nInmates were eligible to participate if they (I) were arrested on at least one felony charge \nand held without bond or on total bond of at least $7,000; (2) were initially assigned to the \njail's medium or maximum security \"general population\" (e.g., not in solitary confinement \nor forensics), and (3) had sufficient language proficiency to complete study protocols in \nEnglish or Spanish. \nParticipants were eligible for a follow-up assessment just prior to release or transfer from the \nfacility (Time 2) if they had been incarcerated for at least 6 weeks. Of the 502 inmates in the \nstudy at Time I, 407 were eligible for the Time 2 assessment. Of those eligible, 267 (65.6%) \nwere re-interviewed at Time 2. Attrition at Time 2 was primarily due to unanticipated \ntransfer to another correctional facility or unanticipated release to the community; 8 \nindividuals refused to be re-interviewed. Of the 267 inmates interviewed at Time 2, 39 \n(14.6%) participants had missing data on one or more variables used in this analysis due to \nincomplete protocols. For Time 2 data analysis, complete data were available for 227 \nJ Correct Health Care.

The racial/ethnic \nbackground of the Time 2 participants was 46.5% African American, 35.1% Caucasian, \n9.2% Mexican American/Hispanic, 1.8% Asian/Pacific Islander, 7.4% Other/Mixed. \nProcedures \nShortly after assignment to the general population, eligible inmates were presented with a \ndescription of the study and asked to participate, with assurance of the voluntary and \nconfidential nature of the project. In the interest of confidentiality, interviews were \nconducted in the privacy of the professional visiting rooms in the jail. In addition, the PI \nobtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices to ensure the confidentiality of the data collected. Inmates who agreed to \nparticipate and who completed the initial four sessions of interviews received an honorarium \nof$15to$181. \nEnglish-speaking participants (95% of the sample) completed computer-based \nquestionnaires using ~'touch-screen\" computers that required minimal familiarity with \ntechnology (e.g., no keyboard, no mouse). In addition to presenting questionnaire items \nvisually, the computer read each item aloud to participants via headphones, thus \naccommodaiing participants with limited reading proficiency. For participants requiring \nSpanish versions of the questionnaires (5%), questionnaire responses were gathered via \nindividual interview. Both the interviewer and participant had paper copies of the translated \nquestionnaires. The participant followed along as the interviewer read each question aloud. \nTo approximate the level of privacy afforded by the touch-screen (funding was not available \nto support programming a Spanish touch-screen) participants filled in their own responses. \nParticipants were reassessed in a similar manner just prior to transfer to another facility or \nrelease into the community (Time 2; $25 honorarium). Participants who missed the Time 2 \ninterview were contacted within two weeks following their release date in order to complete \nthe interview via telephone. \nMeasures \nOptimism was assessed at Time 1 and Time 2 using an abbreviated version of the Values in \nAction-Inventory of Strengths hope/optimism scale (VIA; Peterson & Seligman, 2001). \nDue to time constraints, the VIA was abbreviated for this study. To assess optimism, the \nhope/optimism scale was modified to 4 items. Items that appeared to assess entitlement and \nsuperiority, e.g .. \"I always expect the best,\" were dropped from the current scale in order to \nachieve a measure of dispositional optimism. Items retained were: \"I always look on the \nbright side\" \"I can always find the positive in what seems negative to others\" \"Despite \nchallenges, I always remain hopeful about the future\" and \"If! feel down, I always think \nabout what is good in my life.\" Participants responded on a 5-point Likert scale from I \"not \nat all like me\" to 5 \"very much like me.\" The revised optimism scale demonstrated a good \nreliability at Time 1 and Time 2 (see Table I for Cronbach's alphas of measures). \nPhysical Health was assessed with two self-report measures. Participants completed the \nCohen-Hobennan Inventory of Physical Symptoms (CHIPS; Cohen & Hoberman, 1983), a \nlist of 33 commonly experienced physical symptoms that are rated on their presence over the \npast 2 weeks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 \"not at all bothered\" to 4 \"extremely \nbothered.\" One item was deleted from the measure due to a clerical error. The final score is \ncalculated as the average of the 32 item ratings. The scale has been shown to have adequate \nI We took great care to ensure that the honorarium was not coercive by working closely with our IRB, correctional staff, and inmates \nat the facility to become familiar with the jail's \"economy\" so that we could establish a fair, but non-coercive honorarium for initial \ninterviews and pre-release interviews. \nJ Correct Health Care.

Page 5 \nreliability and validity (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983) and was internally consistent for this \nsample (see Table 1) . \nAdditionally, participants completed the Personality Assessment Inventory (P AI; Morey, \n1991). The PAl is a self-report instrument designed to assess a variety of personality traits as \nwell as symptoms associated'with mental illness and personality disorders. The items are \nrated on a 4-point likert scale (\"False,\" \"Slightly True,\" \"Mainly True,~' and \"Very True\"). \nOf specific interest in this paper is the Somatic Complaints scale and its three clinical \nsubscales (Health Concerns, Conversion, and Somatization). \nItems on the Health Concerns subscale (e.g. \"It's a struggle for me to get things done with \nthe medical problems I have\") reflect a preoccupation with physical health functioning. \nItems on the Conversion subscale (e.g. \"I've had numbness in parts of my body that I can't \nexplain\") assess physiological symptoms prevalent in conversion disorders. Items on the \nSomatization subscale (e.g.\"! suffer from a lot of pain\") address routine physical complaints \nsuch as headaches, back problems or pain. Raw scores were converted toT-scores using the \ncensus matched standardization sample (Morey; 1991). The reliability and validity of the \nPAl has been demonstrated in multiple studies (Edens, Cruise, & Buffington-Vollum, 2001; \nMorey, 1991). \nResults \nConcurrent Relationships between Optimism and Physical Health \nIt was hyfothesized that optimism would be inversely related to reports of physical health \nconcerns . As ,shown in Table 2, optimism was indeed significantly negatively correlated \nwith the total PAl Somatic Complaints Scale, as well as its three subscales, and this was the \ncase at both Time 1 (entry to the jail) and Time 2 (pre-transfer or pre-release). Physical \ncomplaints, assessed by the CHIPS, were not significantly related to concurrent assessments \nof optimism at Time 1, but at Time 2 optimism and CHIPS were significantly negatively \nrelated. Overall, results indicate that the higher the optimism, the fewer physical health \nconcerns. \nInmates' Optimism over the Period of Incarceration: How optimistic are they? \nBefore examining the relationship between physical health and optimism, analyses were \nconducted to determine how optimism ch~nged or did not change over time in this sample. \nOf those who had data at both time points, the mean score for optimism at Time 1 was 3.81 \n(SD ~ 0.78) and at Time 2 the mean was 3.77 (SD ~ 0.75), indicating no significant overall \nchange in level of optimism across the period of incarceration (t ~ 1.02,p > :05). Moreover, \nindividual differences in optimism were moderately stable (r ~ .64,p < .001). In general, the \naverage level of optimism in this sample was mildly elevated, given that a 3 on the Likert \nscale meant \"Neutral\" and a 4 meant \"Like Me.\" \nPrevalence of Physical Health Concerns among Jail Inmates \nBefore examining whether inmates' physical health concerns diminish over the period of \nincarceration, we compared the overall level of health concerns in our sample ofj ail inmates \nto other non-correctional samples. On the PAl Somatic Complaints scale and its three \nsubscales, participants reported slightly higher meanT-scores (ranging from M ~50 toM~ \n54) compared with those observed in Morey's (1991) college and standardized samples \n2Because two measures of physical health concerns (CHIPS and PAl) were utilized in this .study, a factor analysis was conducted to \ndetennine if the physical health variables were tapping multiple domains. Results indicated the presence of only one factor. However, \nbecause researchers often use the CHIJlS without the PAl, and vice versa, we present results separately for each sCale. \nJ Correct Health Care.

Page 6 \n(ranging from M ~ 46 to M ~50). Inmates' scores were slightly lower than those observed \nin Morey's (1991) clinical sample (ranging from M ~55 toM~ 58). \nMaking comparisons between our sample and other samples using the CHIPS was more \ndifficult. As described above, one question was invalid due to a clerical error. As a result, \nthe CHIPS used in this study had 32, rather than 33 questions. In addition, previous studies \nvary in the number of questions asked (N .of questions range from 32 to 40) and in the time \nframe used (ranging from \"past week\" to \"past month\"). One study was identified as being \ncomparable to our study in number of items and in time frame. The total CHIPS score in one \ncollege sample (M ~ 0.82, SD ~ 0.59) (Hale, Hannum & Espelage, 2005) was very similar \nto the inmates' total score (M ~ 0.83, SD ~ 0.66), although we assessed one fewer item. Pro \nrating inmate scores for 33 items, the comparisons remained the same (inmates' transfonned \nCHIPS score increased to 0.86.). \nDo Physical Health Concerns Change Over the Period of Incarceration? \nTo determine if the number of physical health concerns endorsed changed from arrival at the \njail (Time 1) to release or transfer (Time 2), paired t-t~sts were conducted on each variable. \nAs seen in Table 3, there was a statistically significant decrease over time in the level of \nphysical health concerns on 4 out of 5 study measures. Analysis of the CHIPS, indicated that \ninmates were bothered by fewer physical health concerns upon leaving the jail than upon \nentry. The PAl total Somatic Complaints scale and two subscales (Conversion and \nSomatization) also showed a significant decrease between Time I and Time 2. No \nsignificant difference was observed for ihe Health Concerns subscale between Time 1 and \nTime 2. These results indicate that, on average, physical health concerns declined modestly \nover the period of incarceration. \nAnother question is whether participants retain their relative rank order over time, as \nindicated by the correlation between Time 1 and Time 2 measures. As shown in the far right \ncolumn of Table 3, health concerns were quite stable across time, indicating that inmates \nwho had more health concerns relative to others upon entry to the jail tended to have more \nconcerns relative to others just prior to release. Although physical health concerns appear to \ndecline over the period of incarceration, individual's rank order relative to each other \nremained quite stable. \nRelationship between Time 1 Optimism and Subsequent Changes in Physical Health \nConcerns \nWe examined whether optimism at Time 1 predicted a decrease in physical health concerns \nover the period of incarceration. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions were \nconducted in which each Time 2 physical health variable was regressed on its corresponding \nTime 1 physical health variable. Time 1 optimism was then entered into the equation on \nStep 2, allowing us to determine the main effect of optimism on changes in physical health. \nOptimism at Time I was consistently negatively related to changes in physical health \nconcerns, but only one regression was significant at the .05 level (two others show a \nmarginally significant trend). Individuals higher in optimism at Time 1 reported \nsignificantly larger decreases in symptoms of Somatization over time relative to their less \noptimistic peers (Table 4). \nDiscussion \nIn a sample of501 jail inmates, we examined whether physical health concerns increased or \ndecreased over the period of incarceration, and whether optimism was associated with \nphysical health. Our first hypothesis examined the relationship between physical health and \nJ Correct Health Care.

Whereas optimism has been widely investigated in the general community, it has \nbeen largely ignored in the inmate population. Consistent with studies of community \nsamples, the concurrent relationship between inmates' optimism and physical health \nconcerns was negative. \nGiven the documented high rates of physical problems in incarcerated populations, it was \nexpected that health concerns would be elevated in this sample. However, inmates in this \nsample did not report levels of physical health concern significantly higher than community \nsamples. It is possible that inmates in this sample entered the jail in better physical health \nthan other correctional samples. It is also possible that this finding may be due to our \nassessment of general health concerns as opposed to specific medical conditions. Future \nresearch should investigate the differential implications of these types of health \nmeasurement. \nOur second hypothesis, that there would be a decline in reported physical health concerns \nduring incarceration, was confirmed as participants reported significantly fewer health \nproblems upon release or transfer to another facility, compared to the onset of incarceration. \nThis finding is inconsistent with Maruschak (2006) who found no change in the number of \nmedical problems reported by a nationally representative sample ofj ail inmates. One \npossible explanation for this discrepancy is that we assessed general health perceptions, \nwhereas Maruschak (2006) questioned jail inmates about the existence of specific medical \nproblems. It is possible that although an individual may have the same medical problem over \nthe course of incarceration, his or her perception of impairment or day to day symptomology \nmay change. \nA strength of this research project is the longitudinal design, thus allowing us to examine the \npredictive relationship between optimism and changes in self-reported health. Although only \none regression equation was statistically significant, results across measures were in a \ndirection consistent with the notion that optimism predicts decreases in physical symptoms \novertime. \nAlthough results of this study document concurrent and predictive relationships between \noptimism and physical health, the causal nature of the link is not completely understood as \noptimism is a complex concept which includes various values and cognitions. One possible \npathway for further investigation among offenders is coping style. Research on non-inmates \nindicates optimists are more likely to productively deal with stressors and major life \ntransitions as a result of engaging in effective and adaptive coping styles (Carver et a!., \n2002; Scheier eta!., 1986). It is unknown whether such effects would generalize to inmates \nin jail or prison (a very different and greatly constricted environment). \nAlternatively, it may be that optimists are more likely to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Results \nfrom several studies found a significant positive relationship between optimism and \nengagement in health-promoting behaviors, such as exercise and good nutrition (Robbins, \nSpence, & Clark, 1991; Steptoe eta!., 1994). By engaging in health-promoting behaviors, \noptimists may reduce their likelihood of contracting illnesses, increase their overall physical \nhealth, and recover more quickly when feeling ill. Future research should investigate the \nmechanisms by which this change might take place. \nThere are several limitations to this study. One limitation is that all data analyzed are self \nreport measures. Therefore, the data are subject to the well-known· response distortion and \nsocially desirable responding. Second, pharniaceuticals may influence results as the \nobserved decline in physical health symptoms over the period of incarceration may be a \nresult of receiving medical attention (which is unknown). It would be beneficial to examine \nJ Correct Health Care.

Page 8 \ninmate medical records to detennine the amoum of medical care requested, medical care \nreceived, medications prescribed, and medication compliance. \nAnother limitation is the generalizability of the results as participants were from an urban \njail population. It is probable that unique factors exist across various correctional facilities \nand inmates in rural settings may differ from those in an urban setting. Replication of these \nresults is necessary to determine whether these findings apply to individuals in different \ntypes of facilities, such as rural jails, and state or federal prisons. \nFindings from this study suggest that inmates' optimism is a valid and informative variable \nwith clinical implications. Given the multiple physical and mental problems often seen in \nthe inmate population, it is important to view incarceration as an opportunity to provide \nmedical care to underserved individuals. Future research can examine appropriate \ninterventions, such as health programs in correctional facilities which could be designed to \nincorporate optimism raising techniques, such as those using cognitive-behavioral methods. \nIncarcerated individuals represent a unique and socially important population to explore the \nrelationship between optimism and physical health as an estimated 95% of prisoners are \neventually released into the community (Petersilia, 2003) with their physical health \nproblems. In addition, communicable diseases may be transmitted to other inmates, \ncorrectional employees and visitors to the facility, all of whom may unknowingly carry the \ndisease into the community (Hammett, Roberts, Kennedy, 2001; National Commission of \nCorrectional Health Care, 2002). Many of the variables previously identified as associated \nwith poor physical health are difficult, if not impossible, to change. Psychological factors, \nsuch as optimism offer an opportunity for researchers to explore potential points of \nintervention. It is important that future research continue to explore the relationship between \noptimism and physical health in an inmate population. \nAcknowledgments \nThis research was supported by Grant #RO I DA14694 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse awarded to the \nthird author.

The Court struck the first\ncomplaint and allowed Plaintiff “to file an amended complaint containing only a single claim or\nrelated claims.” (DE 8 at 3.) Plaintiff did file an amended complaint, but again sought to proceed\nagainst numerous defendants on unrelated claims. The Court then struck the amended complaint,\nand ordered Vermillion to file a second amended complaint “containing only a single claim or\nrelated claims arising at the same facility.” (DE 13 at 3.)\nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint names as defendants the IDOC, two deputy\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 2 of 7 PageID #: 162\nattorneys general and twenty-one officials employed at the IDOC central office, at the WCU, and\nat the Indiana State Prison (“ISP”). Like its predecessors, the Second Amended Complaint\nattempts to initiate a multi-claim, multi-defendant suit, involving events that occurred at two\ndifferent facilities over a period of years. Rhetorical paragraph A asserts that when Investigators\nWillard Plank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan questioned Vermillion on July 29, 2009, about\nan escape by other inmates at the ISP, he “exercised [his] constitutionally protected right to\nterminate their questioning of [him] in their investigation of [the] escape.” (DE 14 at 3.)\nVermillion contends that all of the Defendants conspired to retaliate against from him from July\n29, 2009, to the present, for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent on this\noccasion. (Id.)\nThe Court reviewed the Second Amended Complaint. Relying on George v. Smith, 507\nF.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) and Owens v. Hinsley, 635 F.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2011), the Court\ngranted leave to proceed for damages only against Defendants Mark Levenhagen, Howard\nMorton, Mark Brennan, Bret Mize, and Sally Nowatzke in their individual capacities on\nPlaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment due process claim alleged in paragraphs E and F. That claim\nis that the Defendants transferred him from the ISP to the WCU without affording him due\nprocess. The Court dismissed all other claims Plaintiff attempted in the Second Amended\nComplaint, without prejudice to his right to replead them in other complaints. This case is now\nbefore the Court on Plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider, Alter and/or Amend Judgment, in which\nPlaintiff asks the Court to let him proceed on all of his claims against all of the Defendants\nnamed in the Second Amended Complaint. \nThe Second Amended Complaint alleges that all its disparate claims are related because\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 3 of 7 PageID #: 163\nall the Defendants conspired to retaliate against Plaintiff. On pages 2 through 7 of the Motion to\nReconsider, Plaintiff attempts to distinguish his complaint from the one in George. He concedes\nthat his Second Amended Complaint named multiple defendants on multiple claims, but reasserts\nthat his allegations were tied together by the theory that all Defendants conspired to retaliate\nagainst him. This would be a concerted effort by nearly two dozen state officials at different\nfacilities, the IDOC Central Office, and the Indiana Attorney General’s office, all inspired by\nPlaintiff’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions during a\ndisciplinary investigation in July 2009.\nPlaintiff alleged in the Second Amended Complaint that this violated 42 U.S.C. 1985(2)\nand (3), but the Court screened out these claims for improper pleading. (DE 17 at 3–4.) The\ninstant Motion to Reconsider concedes that Plaintiff stated no claim under §§ 1985 and 1986,\nand specifically withdraws those claims. (DE 19 at 8.) Now, however, Plaintiff says he wants to\nassert a general conspiracy claim under § 1983. (DE 19 at 9.)\nAnd while the court did state, as noted above, that nothing in my Second Amended\nComplaint suggests a plausible whiff of the alleged conspirators’ assent, and that\nnothing in my submissions suggest that the defendants’ actions were unlikely to have\nbeen undertaken in the absence of an agreement, at this juncture I can only assume\nthat this of the court’s assessments was exclusive to these secondary allegations of\nconspiracy under Sec. 1985, and for that reason, additional “screening” is necessary.\n \n(Id.)\nPlaintiff’s assumption is wrong. It is as true of the § 1983 claim as it is of the claim under\n§ 1985 that nothing in the Second Amended Complaint suggested a plausible whiff of an\nagreement, or that the Defendants’ actions were unlikely to have been undertaken without an\nagreement. Even before Twombly and Iqbal, “mere conclusory allegations of a conspiracy [were]\ninsufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.” Fries v. Helsper, 146 F.3d 452, 457 (7th Cir. 1998).\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 4 of 7 PageID #: 164\nPlaintiff emphasizes in his Motion to Reconsider that when screening a prisoner\ncomplaint, “a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint”\n(DE 19 at 4.) He posits that because he alleged in his complaint that all of the actions by all of\nthe nearly two dozen individual Defendants were “the result of a continuous and ongoing series\nof inextricably related transactions and occurrences,” (id.) the Court was required to accept his\nconspiracy claims. The Court fulfilled its obligation to give Plaintiff the benefit of the inferences\nto which he was entitled on his individual factual claims as to what the individual defendants\ndid.\nBut Plaintiff has not raised plausible inferences of assent or agreement, whether overt or\ntacit. See Amundsen v. Chi. Park Dist., 218 F.3d 712, 718 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining\nrequirements). As this Court ruled in its screening order, nothing in the Second Amended\nComplaint suggests a plausible “whiff of the alleged conspirators’ assent,” and nothing in\nPlaintiff’s submissions suggests Defendants’ actions were unlikely to have been undertaken in\nthe absence of an agreement. Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of the inferences to which he is\nentitled at the pleadings stage, his Second Amended Complaint does not meet the requirements\nfor a § 1983 conspiracy claim. The conspiracy and retaliation claims are simply implausible; the\n“plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels\nand conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell\nAtl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The factual allegations in the complaint “must\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Id. at 555.\nDetermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a\ncontext-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial\nexperience and common sense. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the\ncourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 165\nalleged – but it has not shown – that the pleader is entitled to relief.\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 680 (2009) (quotation marks, alteration, and citations omitted).\n“[I]t is not plausible that two deputy attorneys general and twenty-one officials at the\nIDOC central office and two separate facilities conspired to retaliate against Vermillion over a\nperiod of years for invoking his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions on a single\noccasion that did not even result in a criminal prosecution.” (DE 17 at 5.) Plaintiff argues this\nfinding “has no factual basis and it amounts to nothing more than an articulation of the court’s\narbitrary refusal to acknowledge and/or accept the fact that IDOC officials have conducted\nthemselves in the manner in which I have alleged.” (DE 19 at 12.)\nThe Court has indeed accepted, for present purposes, the factual allegations of what the\nDefendants did, however whether a grand conspiracy was their motivation is another matter that\nthe Court need not, and does not accept, without more particularity. “[W]here the well-pleaded\nfacts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint\nhas alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). “[D]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible\nclaim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience and common\nsense.” Id. \nIt is implausible that so many state actors in so many locations over such a length of time\nconspired to retaliate against Plaintiff for such a small act as invoking the Fifth Amendment\nduring an internal investigation. This is the conclusion compelled by the Court’s experience and\ncommon sense. Accordingly, the Court will not reinstate Vermillion’s claim that all of the\nDefendants conspired to retaliate against him for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 6 of 7 PageID #: 166\nsilent on July 29, 2009.\nThe screening order did allow Plaintiff to proceed on one individual claim — that some\nof the Defendants violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when they transferred\nhim from the ISP to the WCU, a super-max facility. In his Motion to Reconsider, Plaintiff\nappears to suggest that this Court selected the wrong individual claim on which to allow him to\nproceed. (DE 19 at 18.) While it will not grant the Plaintiff’s request in his Motion to Reconsider\nthat he be allowed to proceed on all of the claims in his Second Amended Complaint, the Court\nwill let Plaintiff select another claim to proceed on in this case, if he wishes, subject to all other\nrequirements of law. The Court cautions Plaintiff that he may select only a single claim or\nrelated claims arising at the same facility, and that the claim or claims must be plausible.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n(1) GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Reconsider, Alter and/or Amend Judgment (DE 19) in\npart and DENIES it in part; \n(2) DENIES Plaintiff’s request to reinstate his claim that all Defendants conspired to\nretaliate against him for invoking the Fifth Amendment during an ISP internal investigation in\nJuly 2009, and his request to proceed on all of his individual claims against all of the Defendants\nnamed in his Second Amended Complaint;\n(3) GRANTS Plaintiff leave to select another individual claim or related claims and\nDefendant or set of Defendants upon which to proceed in this case if he wishes; and\n(4) AFFORDS Plaintiff until December 7, 2012, to advise the Court whether he wishes to\ncontinue to proceed in this case on his claim that some IDOC officials violated his Fourteenth\nAmendment due process rights when they transferred him from the ISP to the WCU, or whether\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 33   Filed 11/05/12   Page 7 of 7 PageID #: 167\nhe wishes to proceed against a Defendant or set of Defendants on one of the other claims\npresented in the Second Amended Complaint. If Plaintiff does not respond by December 7, 2012,\nthe action will proceed only upon the claim regarding the alleged violation of Plaintiff’s\nFourteenth Amendment due process rights through his transfer from the ISP to the WCU.\nSO ORDERED on November 5, 2012.\n  s/ Joseph S.

      "text": "\n############# New Text on 20240822 ###############\n6/8/2020  Inmate kept in solitary will get $400K from state, lawyers say \nIndyStar. \nPUBLIC  SAFETY \nIndiana  will  pay  inmate  $100K  for  each \nyear  he  spent  in  solitary,  lawyers  say \nCrystal  Hill  IndyStar \nPublished  5:00  a.m.  ET  Nov.  10,  2019  |  Updated  9:25 a.m.  ET  Nov.  11,  2019 \nIn  his  own  words,  Jay Vermillion  described  his  temporary  home  at  the  Westville  Correctional \nFacility,  inside  a  unit  that  housed  the  “worst  of the  worst.” \nVermillion  spent  23-24  hours  a  day  in  a  cold  “concrete  tomb  with a  solid  steel  door.\"  There \nwas  ho  direct  contact  or  interaction  with  others.  No  telephone  use,  work  or  recreation.  Just \nthe  smell  of mace  fumes,  the  ransacking  of cells  and  \"humiliating  strip  searches,\"  Vermillion \nsaid. \n“All  of the  out-of-control  and  unmanageable  worst-of-the-worst  are  housed  in  ‘cold  storage’ \nto  induce  dormancy,”  he  stated  in  a  federal  complaint. \nVermillion,  who’s  serving  a  decadeslong  sentence  for  murder  and  other  offenses,  said  he \ndidn’t  belong  there.  But  starting  in  2009,  Vermillion  remained  in  the  unit  for  more  than  four \nyears,  he  said.  All  while  being  denied  a  clear  explanation  for  why  he  was  there  and  a  chance \nto  explain  why  he  believed  he  shouldn’t  be  —  a  right  afforded  to  him  and  every  inmate  under \nthe  law,  attorney  Maggie  Filler,  of the  Chicago-based  MacArthur  Justice  Center,  told \nIndyStar. \nIndiana  law  says  the  maximum  allowable  term  in  solitary  is  30  days,  after  which  the \ndepartment  must  review  the  offender  to  determine  whether  the  inmate  should  stay \nsegregated.  Rather  than  hold  these  required  reviews,  Filler  said,  the  DOC  simply  tacked  on \nmore  days  to  Vermillion’s  term. \nVermillion  said  he  served  back-to-back  disciplinary  terms  in  solitary:  1,513  days  to  be  exact. \nNow,  after  suing  the  Department  of Correction,  the  state,  namely  taxpayers,  will  pay \nVermillion  roughly  $100,000  for  each  year  he  spent  in  isolation,  according  to  Filler.  As \nVermillion’s  case  was  heading  to  trial  in  Indianapolis  federal  court,  his  attorneys  reached  a \nhttps://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/11/10/inmate-kept-solitary-get-400-k-state-law yers-say/2454201001/  1/4\n6/8/2020  Inmate kept in solitary will get $400K from state, lawyers say \nsettlement  last  month  with  the  state  for  $425,000,  according  to  a  copy  of the  settlement \nprovided  to  IndyStar. \nThe  case,  Filler  said,  illustrates  the  need  to  protect  the  rights  of prisoners—a  population  that \nmay  not  always  garner  sympathy,  but  are  still  linked  to  society,  even  behind  bars. \n“Most  people  who  enter  prison  are  one  day  going  to  get  out,”  Filler,  one  of Vermillion’s \nlawyers,  said.  “And  they’re  going  to  be  living  in  free  society.  So  it’s  incumbent  upon  us  to \nmake  sure  that  the  prison  experience  is  more  rehabilitative  than  it  is  just  purely  destructive.” \nBut  even  if one  is  not  inclined  toward  sympathy  for  prison  inmates,  there  is  another  reason  to \nbe  concerned  about  the  state's  actions:  It  came  at  a  significant  cost  to  taxpayers. \nIndiana  Department  of Correction  spokesman  Dave  Bursten  told  IndyStar  that  the  agency \nagreed  to  resolve  the  case  to  avoid  the  \"uncertainties\"  of litigation  and  the  expenses  that \nwould  be  incurred. \n\"We  continue  to  deny  any  fault,  wrongdoing  or  liability  with  respect  to  this  litigation,\" \nBursten  said  in  the  statement. \nWhy  the  DOC  was  sued \nVermillion  was  convicted  in  1997  of shooting  and  killing  his  former  girlfriend  in  1995,  court \ndocuments  show.  He’s  currently  detained  at  the  Pendleton  Correctional  Facility  and  won’t  be \nreleased  until  around  2036. \nIn  July  2009,  he  was  serving  time  at  Indiana  State  Prison  when  three  men  known  to \nVermillion  escaped  from  the  prison  and  were  later  apprehended,  according  to  Vermillion’s \ncomplaint.  Vermillion  said  prison  officials  questioned  him,  believing  he  was  involved  in  the \nescape.  Vermillion  said  he  shut  down  the  interview  after  invoking  his  constitutional  right \nagainst  self-incrimination. \nHe  was  later  taken  to  the  Westville  Control  Unit's  super-max  facility,  where  he  spent  the  next \n50  months. \nPrison  officials  had  charged  Vermillion  with  trafficking,  but  his  attorneys  say  he  was  denied \nhis  constitutional  right  of due  process. \n“What  should  have  happened  at  that  point,”  Filler  said,  “is  there  should  have  been  a  hearing.” \nShe  added  that  he  was  also  supposed  to  receive  the  opportunity  to  make  his  case  as  to  why  he \n|\n6/8/2020  Inmate kept in solitary will get $400K from state, lawyers say \nbelieved  solitary  was  not  appropriate  for  him  and  why  he  was  able  to  function  in  regular \nconditions,  as  he  had  been  doing  for  many years  prior  to  solitary,  she  said. \nWhen  asked  for  an  explanation,  Filler  says  the  prison  kept  it  simple. \n“Essentially,  they  said  the  reason  (Vermillion’s  sentence)  was  extended  was  because  another \ncorrectional  official  said  so,\"  she  said.  \"So  that's  not  much  in  the  way  of rationale.” \nVermillion  received  this  explanation  on  a  piece  of paper,  Filler  said,  but  the  law  requires \nmuch  more.  Because  solitary  confinement  can  be  so  damaging  to  inmates,  Filler  said,  Indiana \nprisons  must  conduct  reviews  of their  solitary  terms  at  the  end  of the  30-day  period. \n“At  every  review,  he  would just  get  the  same  piece  of paper  over  and  over  again,”  Filler  said. \n“No  indication  as  to  what  he  needed  to  do  to  get  out.  No  consideration  of how  his  behavior \nhas  been  up  to  that  point.” \nRestrictive  Housing \nFiller  told  IndyStar  that  Vermillion’s  settlement  is  one  of the  largest  she's  aware  of for  a \nperson  who  is  still  serving  a  prison  sentence.  She  compared  it  to  the  federal  case  of Aaron \nIrby-Israel,  an  Indiana  inmate  who  said  he  spent  more  than  20  years  in  solitary  and  won \n$314,000  after  a  bench  trial  earlier  this  year. \nHad  his  case  gone  to  a jury,  Vermillion,  59,  could  have  possibly  gotten  more  than  $425,000, \naccording  to  Jeff Cardella,  a  criminal  defense  attorney  in  Indianapolis.  But  with  a  murder \nconviction,  he  would  have  also  been  rolling  the  dice. \n“Some  clients  are  more  sympathetic  than  others,”  Cardella  said.  “And  somebody  who  is  in \nprison  generally  falls  at  the  lower  end  of the  sympathy  spectrum.  It's  not  technically \nsomething jurors  should  be  considering.  But jurors  are  human.  And  it's  something  they  do \nconsciously  or  unconsciously  consider.” \nCardella  said  $425,000  is  not  an  unreasonable  number,  given  how  damaging  solitary  can  be \non  individuals.  The  punishment,  which  has  become  more  controversial  over  time,  can  cause \nsevere  depression,  distortions  and  hallucinations,  nightmares  and  lower  levels  of brain \nfunction,  according  to  the  Vera  Institute  of Justice. \nDOC  spokesman  Dave  Bursten  told  IndyStar  that  the  department  does  not  house  offenders  in \nsolitary  confinement.  The  DOC  does  put  offenders  in  \"restricted  housing  assignment \nclassification.\" \nI\n6/8/2020  Inmate kept in solitary will get $400K from state, lawyers say \n\"Any  offender  placed  into  restrictive  housing  is  provided  a  review  each  30  days  to  determine \nif such  housing  classification  remains  appropriate,\"  Bursten  said.  \"Additionally,  each \noffender  receives  an  annual  classification  review  to  determine  appropriate  housing \nassignment.” \nBut  prisoner  advocates  say  the  use  of terms  such  as  \"restricted  housing\"  is  largely  semantics. \n\"The  issue  of whether  it’s  solitary  confinement  or  some  other  thing  is  hotly  disputed  between \ncorrections  agencies  and  advocates  in  the  human  rights  community,\"  Filler  said.  \"We'd  say \nthat  his  conditions  of confinement  had  all  the  hallmarks  of solitary  confinement.\" \nCorrections  agencies  like  IDOC,  Filler  said,  would  \"probably  dispute  that  it  was  what  you  and \nI  would  think  of when  we  hear  the  term  solitary  confinement.\" \nThe  National  Institute  of Correction  defines  restrictive  housing,  which  is  also  called \nadministrative  segregation,  as  the  practice  of housing  inmates  separately  from  other  inmates \nat  a  prison,  typically by  isolating  them  in  high  security  cells,  and  restricting  their  \"Movement, \nbehavior  and  privileges.\" \nAlthough  some  people  still  call  the  punitive  isolation  of prisoners  solitary  confinement,  those \nin  the  field  of corrections  prefer  to  call  it  something  else,  such  as  \"Special  Housing  Units\"  or \n\"Intensive  Management  Units,\"  according  to  a  report  from  the  Criminal  Justice  Institute. \nCardella  said  he  believes  such  a  punishment  should  be  reserved  for  cases  in  which  the  inmate \nposes  a  serious  danger  to  other  inmates  and  prison  employees,  not  used  as  discipline  for bad \nbehavior. \n“We  want  as  a  society  to  have  punishment  for  crime,”  Cardella  said,  “and  we  want  to  be \nprotected  from  people  who  are  potentially  dangerous.  But  at  the  same  time,  we  don’t  want \nthe  punishment  to  be  sadistic  or  unnecessarily  harsh,  merely  for  the  point  of harming \nanother  individual,  even  if that  individual  has  done  something.\" \nContact IndyStar  reporter  Crystal Hill  at 317-444-6094  or  cnhill@gannett.com.

Introduction  \n \nI have been retained by the MacArthur Justice Center on behalf of its client, Jay \nVermillion. As an expert in penology, I was asked to tour prison facilities to \nassess conditions of confinement and review documents regarding the practices \nand policies of the Indiana Department of Correction (IDOC) and the actions of \nIDOC employees named as defendants as they relate to this case. I was asked \nto assess if the Defendants complied with generally accepted practices, \nprinciples and standards, as well as IDOC policy, with regard to the \nmanagement, placement, and retention of Jay Vermillion in segregation. \n \nAs described in further detail below, it is my opinion that the Defendants’ conduct \nin this case deviated from accepted correctional practices and standards for the \nuse of restricted housing. It is my further opinion that there was no legitimate \npenological justification for the Defendants to place Mr. Vermillion in segregation \nfor an extended indeterminate period of time. \n \nII.  Methodology \n1.  Reviewed various documents relevant to Mr. Vermillion’s experience \nas an inmate of IDOC. (See Attachment 4: Documents Reviewed)  \n2.  Conducted a review of materials related to the management of \nsegregation units.  \n3.  On November 8, 2018, I viewed the Westville Control Unit where Mr. \nVermillion was housed for over three years.  That same day, I also \n  2 \n\ntoured the Indiana State Prison, including the honor dorm where Mr. \nVermillion had been housed prior to his placement in the WCU. \nIn preparing this report, I have also relied upon my thirty-five (35) years of \nexperience and related training and education in the field of adult institutional \ncorrections. This experience includes: Correctional Officer (2.5 years); Lieutenant \n(3 years); Captain (6 years); Superintendent (5 years); Director of Performance \nManagement (4 years); eight years in administration (Deputy Director Prisons, \nDirector Prisons, Deputy Secretary, and Secretary) in the Washington State \nDepartment of Corrections (WADOC); and work performed in over 20 states and \nfour jurisdictions outside of the continental United States. I have also been a \nconsultant with the National Institute of Corrections, Defense Technology \nCorporation and New York University and have published a number of articles \nrelated to the field.  \n \nAs a Correctional Sergeant and Captain, I directly managed long-term \nsegregation units, and as a Superintendent and Deputy Director, I led efforts to \nreform the system-wide use of long-term segregation in WA state, which resulted \nin an over 50% decrease in the number of people housed in this setting while \nalso lowering system-wide violence for eight consecutive years. I co-authored a \nbook and field guide on prison safety, Keeping Prisons Safe, and co-designed \nthe WADOC CORE training program and the Correctional Officer Achievement \nProgram (See Attachment 1-3: CV). At New York University, I was co-director of \nSegregation Solutions, an initiative assisting correctional agencies to reduce or \n  3 \n\neliminate the use of segregation while also maintaining or improving safety in \nfacilities. \n \nIII.  Factual Background  \n \n1.  Jay Vermillion is a 59-year-old inmate who has been in the custody of the \nIndiana Department of Correction (IDOC) since 1997. He currently resides \nat Pendleton Correctional Facility (PCF).  \n2.  On July 12, 2009, when Mr. Vermillion resided at the Indiana State Prison \n(ISP), three inmates in his housing unit escaped and were later \napprehended.  \n3.  In the course of their investigation of the escape, IDOC staff interviewed a \nstaff member who denied being involved in the escape but admitted to \ntrafficking tobacco and alleged that he had brought in this contraband for \nMr. Vermillion. \n4.  On July 22, 2009, Mr. Vermillion was interviewed by IDOC Internal Affairs \nInvestigators Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan. When \nasked about Mr. Bates allegation that Mr. Vermillion was involved in \ntrafficking tobacco, Mr. Vermillion declined to continue with the interview. \nMr. Vermillion was then immediately placed in segregation.  \n5.  On July 31, 2009, IDOC Internal Affairs Investigator Ralph Carrasco wrote \na conduct report charging Mr. Vermillion with trafficking. \n6.  On August 12, 2009, Mr. Vermillion was found guilty of trafficking by \nDisciplinary Hearing Board Officer Bessie Leonard, who sanctioned him to \n  4 \n\none year in disciplinary segregation, demoted him from Credit Earning \nClass (CC) I to CCII, and took 30 days of earned time credit. \n7.  On August 12, 2009, Mr. Vermillion was transferred from ISP to Westville \nCorrectional Facility and placed into their maximum control (segregation) \nunit. \n8.  On September 4, 2009 and October 5, 2009, Case Manager Doug Barnes \nconducted Thirty Day Segregation Reviews of Mr. Vermillion which both \nstate, “Your segregation time is still warranted and it has been determined \nthat you should remain in segregation”. \n9.  On October 08, 2009, Mr. Vermillion’s appeal of his disciplinary sanction \nand classification, having previously been denied by Superintendent Mark \nLevenhagen and WCU Classification Director Larry Warg, received a final \ndenial with a modification from Final Reviewing Authority Charles Penfold. \nMr. Penfold reduced Mr. Vermillion’s sanction from one year to thirty days \nto comply with an Executive Directive issued on January 21, 2009 that \nlimited disciplinary segregation sanctions to thirty days for Class A \ninfractions. This Executive Order is reflective of the changes that many \ncorrectional systems have implemented in disciplinary segregation in the \npast few decades, as correctional professionals have become aware of \nthe harmful impact and limited usefulness of extended periods of \nsegregation. \n10. On October 22, 2009, Mr. Vermillion was transferred from disciplinary \nsegregation to department wide administrative segregation, an indefinite \n  5 \n\nchange in status but not a change in housing unit.  The change came \nabout via an email exchange among Superintendent Levenhagen, \nExecutive Director Brett Mize and others, reacting to the Penfold decision \nand concluding that Mr. Vermillion would “have to [be] put … in AS \n[administrative segregation] somewhere.” \n11. On October 22, 2009, a Classification Hearing was conducted by Case \nManager Doug Barnes approving Mr. Vermillion’s placement in \ndepartment wide administrative segregation “per B Mize”. In the box on \nthe hearing report designated for the signature of offender, it states, \n“unable to sign”. \n12. On October 22, 2009, Mr. Vermillion, after being informed of his \nplacement on department wide administrative segregation, appealed the \ndecision. \n13. On October 28, 2009, Case Manager Doug Barnes conducted Mr. \nVermillion’s first Administrative Segregation Review. It stated that \n“Department-Wide Administrative status shall remain in effect unless \notherwise rescinded by the Executive Director.” Mr. Vermillion received \nthese reviews approximately every thirty days throughout his time in \nadministrative segregation.  \n14. On November 10, 2009, Superintendent Levenhagen denied Mr. \nVermillion’s appeal of his classification. \n15. On April 07, 2010, Mr. Vermillion filed a Petition for Habeas Corpus (3:10-\nCV-119-PPS). \n  6 \n\n16. On August 3, 2010, Final Reviewing Authority Charles Penfold remanded \nMr. Vermillion’s disciplinary action for a rehearing. \n17.  On September 07, 2010, Hearings Officer Robert Johnson found Mr. \nVermillion guilty of the same trafficking violation and sanctioned him to \none year in disciplinary segregation, demoted him from Credit Earning \nClass (CC) I to CCII, and took 30 days of earned time credit. \n18.  On December 08, 2010, Mr. Vermillion’s appeal of his disciplinary \nsanction and classification, having previously been denied by \nSuperintendent Mark Levenhagen and WCU Asst. Director of Operations \nDavid Leonard, received a denial from Final Reviewing Authority Charles \nPenfold. After resubmitting his appeal, Mr. Vermillion received another \ndenial of his appeal from Mr. Penfold on February 23, 2011. \n19. On March 23, 2011, Mr. Vermillion filed another Petition for Habeas \nCorpus (3:11-CV-123-TLS). \n20. On May 5, 2011, Caseworker Sally Nowatzke completed Mr. Vermillion’s \nannual classification review on Mr. Vermillion, overriding his level 2 \nsecurity score to a level 4 and adding a note “remain 1 year clear of \nconduct”. \n21. On June 27, 2011, Mr. Penfold remanded Mr. Vermillion’s disciplinary \ncase back to the facility for a second rehearing. \n22. On July 27, 2011, Mr. Vermillion received his third hearing on the \ntrafficking charge from 2009. At the hearing, Hearing Officers B. Spencer \n  7 \n\nand Paula Antisdel found him guilty and sanctioned him to lose 60 days of \nearned credit time and receive a demotion to CCII. \n23. On January 12, 2012, Mr. Vermillion, having already received a denial of \nhis appeal from Superintendent Levenhagen, received a denial from \nMichael Barnes from IDOC’s Legal Services Division.  \n24. On March 29, 2012, Mr. Vermilion filed his third Habeas petition (3:12-CV-\n150-PPS). \n25. On February 18, 2013, Mr. Vermillion was transferred to Pendleton \nCorrectional Facility. \n26. On June 7, 2013, Mr. Vermillion was approved for release from \ndepartment-wide administrative segregation and on September 19, 2013, \nhe was placed back on general population. \n27. On November 14, 2013, Mr. Robert Bugher from IDOC Legal Services \nDivision remanded Mr. Vermillion’s disciplinary case from 2009 back to the \nfacility for a fourth rehearing. \n28.

Restricted Housing: National Perspective \nOver the past two decades, efforts have steadily increased to understand and \nmitigate the use and negative impacts of segregation. In Washington State, our \nacuity around this issue was initially informed by the work of Dr. David Lovell and \n  10 \n\nDr. Lorna Rhodes from the University of Washington, beginning with a study1 \nthey published in 2000 examining who we were keeping in segregation. This \nfocus on understanding and mitigating the impacts of segregation and reducing \nits use overall continued through the latter half of my career, a process I \ndescribed in a U.S Department of Justice (US DOJ) policy paper, More than \nEmptying Beds: A Systems Approach to Segregation Reform.2  Washington \nState was not alone in these efforts.  Across the country, many states and the \nfederal government have initiated policies to reduce the use of segregation, \nbuilding on the growing recognition that long-term isolation is harmful, \ncounterproductive, and costly.3  \n \nNationally, mental health professionals such as Dr. Stuart Grassian and Dr. Craig \nHaney started writing about the psychological impacts of segregation in the late \n80’s, and soon after, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union \n(ACLU) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) began investigating what was \nhappening in these units.  IDOC in particular should have an institutional memory \naround these issues as it was challenged in court regarding its segregation \npractices not long after opening its first super-max facility. This federal class \n                                                 \nLovell, D., Cloyes, K., Allen, D., Rhodes, L. 2000. Who Lives in Super-Maximum Custody? A \nWashington State Study.

In 1994 the \naction was settled, but in 1997, HRW issued a report, “Cold Storage: Super-\nMaximum Security Confinement in Indiana,”4 which criticized the operations of \nboth super-max facilities operated by IDOC and assessed how they failed to \ncomply with human rights standards in the hope of “assist(ing) the people and \ngovernment of Indiana evaluate their legality, wisdom, and impact.”5 This report \nmade recommendations for segregation reform in the treatment and conditions of \nconfinement for mentally ill inmates, lengths of stay, improvements in physical \nconditions at the facilities, use of “harsh and counterproductive practices,” and \nmonitoring.6  \n \nStarting in 2005, with their creation of the Commission on Safety and Abuse in \nAmerica’s Prisons, the Vera Institute of Justice (“Vera”) has convened \ncorrectional and criminal justice professionals to identify issues and reform \npractices in segregation. In 2010, they began working more intensively with \nspecific jurisdictions, including Washington State, to analyze their data, policies \nand practices, offer recommendations, and identify promising practices to reduce \nthe use of segregation. In a report issued by Vera in May 2018, examining \nlessons learned from their more than ten years of working on restricted housing \n                                                 \nHuman Rights Watch.

Restricted Housing Practices: Length of Stay \nIn 2018, the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) and the \nArthur Liman Center at Yale Law School (Liman) published a research project,12 \nthe fourth in a series examining nationwide data on the use of solitary \nconfinement. Data was collected from 43 responding jurisdictions that collectively \naccounted for 80.6% of the U.S. prison population. Of the responding \njurisdictions, 22.8% of those prisoners in restrictive housing were there for 15 \ndays to one month; 31.6% served one to three months; 15.9% served three to 6 \nmonths; 11.1% served 6 months to a year; 9.7% served one to three years; 4.3% \nserved three to six years; and 4.7% had been in restricted housing for six years \nor more. (2018 ASCA-Liman, pg. 14). In their response to the ACSA-Liman \nSurvey, IDOC reported that during the time period surveyed, 6.6% (1,741) of its \npopulation was being held in some form of restrictive housing (pg. 12), an \nincrease from their data in the previous report published in this series, 2016’s \nAiming to Reduce Time-in-Cell,13 in which they reported that 5.9% (1,621) of their \n                                                 \n12 Resnik, Judith and VanCleave, Anna and Bell, Kristen and Harrington, Alexandra and \nConyers, Gregory and McCarthy, Catherine and Tumas, Jenny and Wang, Annie, Reforming \nRestrictive Housing: The 2018 ASCA-Liman Nationwide Survey of Time-in-Cell (October 10, \n2018).

Yale Law School, \nPublic Law Research Paper No. 597. pg. 22. \n  14 \n\npopulation was in restrictive housing. For the 2018 report, IDOC communicated \nthat of the 1,741 inmates they held in restricted housing, 7.5% served 15 days to \none month; 20% served one to three months; 16.1% served three to six months; \n20.3% served six to twelve months; 22.5% served one to three years; 7% served \nthree to six years; and 6.6% served more than six years (pg. 15). \n \nThe ASCA-Liman reports are the best benchmarks the correctional industry has \nto understand the national practices and trends in restricted housing length of \nstay. As illustrated in Chart 1, IDOC’s average length of stay vary from the \nnational trend. Specifically, IDOC has double the inmates serving 6 months to \nthree years in restrictive housing than the national average and it uses shorter 15 \nday to 3 months sanctions far less than the national average.  \nChart 1* \n*Data from ASCA-LIMAN Restrictive Housing 2018 Report \n  15 \n\nRestricted housing practices have been evolving for several decades. IDOC’s \nExecutive Directive #09-07, issued on January 21, 2009, on which Mr. Penfold \nrelied when he modified Mr. Vermillion’s initial disciplinary sanction from six \nmonths to thirty days, reflects this national shift towards shorter lengths of stay in \nrestricted housing. Unfortunately, as the ASCA-Liman Report data reflects, \nchanges in policy doesn’t always equate to changes in practice. Correctional staff \nstill exercise a great deal of discretion, especially in the use of administrative \nsegregation, which can result in abuses such as inmates remaining in \nsegregation for extended periods with no penological purpose, despite positive \nchanges in the formal policy. \n \nVI.  Administrative Segregation  \nA 2016 report on the topic released by the U.S. Department of Justice National \nInstitute of Justice defines administrative segregation as a practice “used to \nseparate those deemed to pose a significant threat to institutional security from \nthe general population.” It further states, “Inmates are often classified to \nadministrative segregation or transferred to these units and facilities based on \npatterns of disruptive behavior, security threat group identifications, or \ndesignation as high-risk inmates.”14 \n \n                                                 \n14 N.A. Frost & C.E. Monteiro, U.S. Department of Justice National Institute of Justice, March \n2016. Administrative Segregation in U.S. Prisons. Page 5. \nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/249749.pdf \n  16 \n\nIDOC has two types of administrative segregation. According to their \nAdministrative Segregation Policy # 02-01-111(V), Facility Administrative \nSegregation can be used for offenders “who have not been charged with a rule \nviolation” based on “threat to self, others, property, the security and/or orderly \noperation of the facility presented by the offender’s continued presence in the \ngeneral offender population.” The policy then provides a list of example reasons \nfor this placement, with the caveat that administrative segregation assignment is \nnot limited to these. The examples listed include history of escape risk, active \nmember of a security threat group who pose a threat to the safe and orderly \noperation of the facility, and a documented history of behavior that causes staff to \nbelieve that that the offender’s continued presence in general population would \nbe detrimental to the security of the facility, among others.  \n \nThe policy also describes a second type of administrative segregation called \nDepartment-Wide Administrative Segregation. Appendix XVI-C of Policy # 02-01-\n111, Criteria/Procedure for Placement in Department-Wide Administrative \nSegregation Unit, offers details regarding criteria for admittance. “Offenders \nselected for a Department-wide administration segregation unit must have \nexhibited extraordinary security concerns, such as seriously injuring staff or \noffenders, participating in a hostage situation, identified security threat group \nleader, heavily involved in trafficking or have a lengthy history of serious (Class A \nand/or Class B) conduct violations.” \n \n  17 \n\nIDOC’s administrative segregation policies were examined in a 2013 project of \nthe Liman Public Interest Program at Yale Law School, which conducted a \nnational review of correctional policies on administrative segregation.15  In \nreviewing these policies nationwide, they found that “most permit placement in \nsegregation based on a wide range of rationales” and that “the elasticity suggests \nthat administrative segregation may be used for goals other than incapacitation.”  \nIn their review, some commenters noted that administrative segregation had the \npotential for overuse if the placement decision was based on being “mad” at \nrather than “scared” of an inmate.  In other words, officials with broad discretion \nmight misuse administrative segregation to retaliate against an inmate rather \nthan using it as a tool to manage inmates who pose a legitimate threat to the \nsecurity of the institution. In looking at different policy examples regarding \nplacement, their review notes IDOC Policy #02-01-111 as an example with “few \nenumerated factors and general authority.” Lacking clear factors necessary to \nmake an administrative segregation placement and general authority to do so \nleaves a great deal of discretion to correctional administrators to use, or misuse, \nthis classification.  \n \nWhen Mr. Vermillion’s initial disciplinary sanction of one year in disciplinary \nsegregation was found to be outside of an executive directive limiting this \n                                                 \nH.Metcalf, J.

Department-wide administrative segregation (DWAS) is an \nindefinite placement requiring an override of his medium custody classification \nscore. It was Charles Penfold, who served at IDOC as the Final Reviewing \nAuthority for Adult Disciplinary Policies and Procedures in the initial years of Mr. \nVermillion’s placement in segregation, who modified Mr. Vermillion’s initial \ndisciplinary sanction of one year to 30 days upon appeal. In deposition, when \nasked why he thought Mr. Vermillion had initially received a sanction outside the \nallowable limits on disciplinary segregation, Mr. Penfold speculated that this was \ndue to the escape at the facility, the “hype based on the case” and “all of the \ninconveniences that it cost the facility”. In his words, they were trying to get “their \npound of flesh.”16  \n \nIn assessing IDOC’s placement of Mr. Vermillion in department-wide \nadministrative segregation, nothing in the documents related to this case \nindicated to me that Mr. Vermillion exhibited extraordinary security concerns. In a \ncharge that was later dropped and expunged from his record, he was initially \nfound guilty of trafficking, for which he served a term in disciplinary segregation. \nHe has only one infraction on his record, a Class C for insolence, vulgarity, or \nprofanity.  His disciplinary record does not justify placement in administrative \n                                                 \nPenfold deposition pg. 95. \n16\n \n  19 \n\nsegregation at all, much less holding him there for the debilitating period of more \nthan three years.  \n \nIn the October 8, 2009 email chain, Mr. Levenhagen, the Superintendent of ISP \nat the time, asserts that Mr. Vermillion was the funder or “money man” who \n“financed the entire escape.” This assertion is not supported by the Escape \nInvestigation Report, which documents a great deal of staff and inmate \nmisconduct, including that of Counselor Bates, who told investigators he had \ntrafficked in contraband (a cell phone and tobacco) with Mr. Vermillion, but does \nnot offer concrete evidence connecting Mr. Vermillion to the escape.  \n \nWhen asked in deposition why he believed that Mr. Vermillion was involved in the \nescape, Mr. Levenhagen stated that he believes this because a large amount of \ncash was found in the law library where Mr. Vermillion worked and because the \nescapees had cash when they left the prison that it was “more than coincidence”.  \nIf this connection were strong enough to implicate Mr. Vermillion in the escape, \nthere certainly would have been some mention of it in the investigative report.  \nThere is none.  When asked if there were any other evidence that Mr. Vermillion \nprovided cash to any of the escapees, he states that to his knowledge there is \nnone and that he had “not heard anything more substantial than that.”17 \n \n                                                 \nLevenhagen deposition pg. 146-150. \n17\n \n  20 \n\nWhen questioned regarding how the escape had affected him personally, Mr. \nLevenhagen admitted that the incident was a professional embarrassment and \nthat he felt humiliated. He speculated that he may have been “treated a little bit \nmore kindly” because the superintendent who preceded him, Ed Buss, was the \nIDOC Commissioner at the time of the escape so “it was actually more his \nadministration more than mine.”18  Levenhagen stated that he “was instructed to \ntake action” by either Commissioner Buss or the Commissioner’s Chief of Staff, \nDan Ronray, which is why he forwarded the email chain to Executive Director \nBrett Mize and stated that they would “have to put him in AS [administrative \nsegregation] somewhere.” In deposition, Brett Mize stated that he knew nothing \nabout the outcome of the ISP escape investigation and the only information he \nhad related to Levenhagen’s allegations against Vermillion was this email.19 \n \nThis exchange suggests that the Defendants were using DWAS to retaliate \nagainst Mr. Vermillion for something they never charged him with and did not \nhave sufficient evidence to support. In my experience, and in the IDOC’s written \npolicies, administrative segregation should be used for inmates presenting a \nserious threat to the safety of employees, contract staff, volunteers or other \ninmates as demonstrated through a pattern of violent or seriously disruptive \nbehavior, or for inmates with extreme protection needs.  It is not meant to punish \n                                                 \nLevenhagen deposition pg. 113-115. \n18Mize deposition pg. 152-153. \n \n19\n \n  21 \n\nan inmate based on nothing more than the suspicions of embarrassed prison \nofficials.   \n \nThe dangers of misusing administrative segregation in this manner are apparent. \nIn this case, Mr. Vermillion had no way of knowing that he was in administrative \nsegregation for suspected involvement with the escape, because he was never \nnotified or charged with anything related to the escape.  Under those \ncircumstances, there was no way for him to argue or prove that he was not \ninvolved in the escape.  Instead, he was placed in disciplinary segregation based \non a trafficking charge, for which he was found guilty and ultimately sentenced to \n30 days, after his original sentence was reduced to conform with IDOC policy.  \nMr. Vermillion appealed, and the charges were finally expunged from his record \nafter four rehearings, but regardless of the outcome of the appeal, there was \nnever reason to hold him in segregation for more than 30 days. Nonetheless, \nafter his disciplinary segregation sanction was reduced to 30 days, he was \nmoved to administrative segregation status indefinitely.  Once he was there, he \nhad no possible way to contest his placement or work his way out.  He was \nsubject to the whims of IDOC officials, and they held him there for more than \nthree years.   \n \nThe fact pattern in this case is similar to fact patterns that I have seen throughout \nmy career when reviewing administrative segregation cases. The facility \nsuspected wrong doing, subsequently issued a violation, and when the \n  22 \n\ndisciplinary sanction was complete (in Mr. Vermillion’s case after being reduced \non appeal), IDOC maintained him in administrative segregation status, effectively \nincreasing the segregation sanction without regard to the evidence in the case or \ndue process considerations. As a result, Mr. Vermillion spent more than three \nyears in segregation, ostensibly for a trafficking charge that was ultimately \ndropped.  \n \nDisciplinary segregation and administrative segregation should not be \ninterchangeable. Administrative segregation is not intended to be a punishment \nfor a specific infraction. It should be a hold of necessity based on an inmate’s \ncurrent condition or status. Mr. Vermillion’s placement on department-wide \nadministrative segregation appears to be based on Mr. Levenhagen and other \nIDOC administrator’s belief that Mr. Vermillion was involved in the escape, \nsomething for which there is no evidence and for which he was never charged. I \nsee no evidence that Mr. Vermillion represented an actual security concern.  \nIt is the job of correctional professionals to solve safety and security problems in \na manner that is legal, fair, and causes the least amount of harm. If IDOC’s \nsecurity concerns related to Mr. Vermillion were about trafficking, they had far \nless harmful, less expensive, and more practical options rather than placing him \nin indefinite segregation. By moving Mr. Vermillion to a different institution or \nlimiting his ability to work in positions where he wouldn’t be closely monitored, \nthey could have addressed their concerns, caused less harm to Mr. Vermillion, \nand saved themselves a lot of time and effort. \n  23 \n\n \nThe escape at ISP brought to light extensive inmate and staff misconduct. The \nevent was humiliating for Mr. Levenhagen as it surely was for Commissioner \nBuss. I would concur with Mr. Penfold’s opinion that IDOC administrators wanted \ntheir pound of flesh.  They were mad at Mr. Vermillion rather than scared of him, \nand this led to his placement in administrative segregation. \n \nVII.  Reviews of Administrative Segregation Status \nThe 2018 Vera Institute of Justice report examining lessons learned from their \nmore than ten years of working on restricted housing reform in jurisdictions \nthroughout the country.20 The report includes several recommendations for \nadministrative segregation. First, they recommend systems minimize placement \nin administrative segregation and shorten lengths of stays. To accomplish this, \nthey suggest using “procedural safeguards, such as frequent multidisciplinary \nteam reviews to ensure that it is used 1) only as a last resort, when people \ncannot be housed in the general population because they pose a serious threat \nto the safety of others; and 2) only when a less-restrictive setting is not \nsufficient.” They also suggest frequent reviews of this placement by a \nmultidisciplinary team with the goal of returning inmates as soon as possible to a \nless-restrictive setting. This echoes guidance provided by the U.S. Department of \nJustice’s in 2016 which stated that administrative segregation (which they call \n                                                 \n20 Léon Digard, Elena Vanko, and Sara Sullivan. Rethinking Restrictive Housing: Lessons from \nFive U.S. Jail and Prison Systems. New York: Vera Institute of Justice, 2018. Available at: \nhttps://www.vera.org/publications/rethinking-restrictive-housing \n  24 \n\npreventative segregation) should be used only as a last resort, when “officials \nconclude, based on evidence, that no other form of housing will ensure the \ninmate’s safety and the safety of staff, other inmates, and the public.” They also \nstate that this placement “should be guided by clearly articulated procedural \nprotections, including the use of a multidisciplinary review team.21 \n \nIDOC Policy 02-01-111, The Use and Operation of Adult Offender Administrative \nSegregation, requires periodic administrative segregation placements reviews \n(Section VII), conducted by the Classification Committee or staff designated by \nthe Facility Head. Unfortunately, in practice, these reviews seem to be \nmeaningless as conducted at WCU.  \n \nMr. Vermillion received what IDOC refers to as Thirty Day Segregation Reviews, \nbut these were not conducted by a multidisciplinary team nor did they contain \nany actual meaningful review or due process. In reviewing the documentation of \nMr. Vermillion’s placement reviews while he was in administrative segregation, it \nis clear that these reviews were perfunctory. These nearly identical one-page \nforms contain nothing specific regarding Mr. Vermillion other than his name, DOC \nnumber, arrival date, and cell location. This is further supported by statements \nmade by Doug Barnes, the former Case Manager of the Westerville Control Unit \nand the individual that conducted the majority of Mr. Vermillion’s reviews while he \nwas in department-wide administrative segregation. In deposition, Mr. Barnes \n                                                 \n21 U.S. DOJ pg. 5 \n  25 \n\nwas questioned as to the substance of the review process for Mr. Vermillion and \ndepartment-wide administrative segregation in general. When he was asked the \npurpose of the 30-day review, he stated: \n“I never fully understood. Because unless something had changed \nexternally, the review wasn’t going to change anything.”22  \n \nWhen asked to describe the process he used to perform the reviews he stated:  \n“I would spend a few minutes looking at the roster of the offenders, and \nthen I would use a computer to print out the forms that said they were to \nreview. It was not a review that the offender participated in and there was \nno special review of the records.”23 \n \nUpon further questioning, Mr. Barnes stated that even though a mental health \nreview was required every 30 days, those reviews weren’t factored into their \nsegregation review. Likewise, Mr. Barnes stated that he “rarely saw” and only \noccasionally looked at the weekly behavioral logs kept by custody staff on the \nunit when performing a review and that these would not normally factor into what \nhe was reviewing. Mr. Barnes also acknowledged that the thirty-day review forms \nwere prefilled and that although he would occasionally change the form if there \nwere changes in policy, the text did not vary for specific offenders.24Mr. Barnes \nwas also asked if he was familiar with Indiana Statute IC 11-10-1-7, which \n                                                 \nBarnes deposition pg. 157-158. \n22Id. Pg. 158-159. \n \n23Id. Pg. 160-163. \n \n24\n \n  26 \n\nrequires that IDOC conduct a review “at least once every 30 days to determine \nwhether the reason for segregation still exists”. Though he was not familiar with \nthe statute, when asked if he would have been effectuating the law when he did \nhis 30-day reviews, he responded, “That appears to be the case.”25 \n \nSally Nowatzke, Mr. Vermillion’s Caseworker when he was at WCU, was asked \nin deposition about the annual classification reviews required under IDOC Policy \n01-04-101 “Adult Offender Classification” for every inmate, not just those in \nsegregation. She explained how all inmates are assigned a level with 4 being the \nhighest custody or security level and 1 being the lowest and how for any inmate \nin segregation, if they scored a 1 or a 2, she would apply an automatic override \nto a level 3 or 4, regardless of their conduct.26 Ms. Nowatzke was asked if she \nwas ever asked to provide input or information for the segregation review \nrequired in IDOC Policy #02-01-111, to which she responded no.27 On this issue, \nMr. Barnes was asked whether an inmate scoring as a Level 1 in their annual \nclassification review would cause him to recommend that the inmate be removed \nfrom administrative segregation and he responded that he would not “because \nthis has nothing to do with the ultimate reason why they were placed on \ndepartment-wide administrative segregation.” He further states, “unless that \nreason changes in the mind of the director of adult facilities, they’re going to \nremain on department-wide segregation.”  \n                                                 \nBarnes deposition pg. 169-170. \n25Nowatzke deposition pg. 144-147. \n \n26Id. pg. 167. \n \n27\n \n  27 \n\n \nIn reading the depositions of Mr. Barnes and Ms. Nowatzke, it was clear that they \ndid not take responsibility, in either the classification or the 30-day segregation \nreviews, to actually assess whether the reason for segregation still existed. Both \narticulated that placement in department-wide administrative segregation was a \ndecision made above their authority level and that any changes in that placement \ndecision would usually be generated from that authority level. In deposition, Gary \nBrennan, who served as Unit Manager and supervised the work of Mr. Barnes, \nstated that he only “periodically”28 looked at the 30-day reviews but \nacknowledged that he knew Mr. Barnes dropped names in a boilerplate review \nand didn’t conduct any analysis of individual circumstances.29 He clearly did not \nensure that the 30-day or the classification reviews were in done in accordance \nwith the letter and intent of the policy.  For Mr. Vermillion, and likely any inmate \non DWAS, these reviews were meaningless. Mr. Vermillion’s actual classification \nlevel, which should be largely determined by security risk, was always overridden \ndue to his placement designation. Thus, his risk, actual custody level, and \nconduct, was never factored into his segregation reviews. It wasn’t until 2013, \nafter Mr. Vermillion was moved to Pendleton Correctional Facility, that he \nreceived an actual review and was recommended for removal from DWAS. \n \n                                                 \nBrennan deposition pg. 222.\n28Id. pg. 222-224 \n   \n29\n \n  28 \n\nBoth Mr. Barnes and Ms. Nowatzke were asked if they knew why Mr. Vermillion \nhad been placed on department-wide administrative segregation and both \nrecalled being told that it was because he was involved in the ISP escape.30 This \nis yet another indicator that Mr. Vermillion was being punished with placement in \nsegregation for an offense that he was never charged with, was unable to defend \nhimself against, and for which he would never receive a real review. \n \nVIII.  Conditions of Confinement \nI toured the Indiana State Prison and saw the honor unit in which Mr. Vermillion \nhad lived prior to his transfer to segregation. In this unit, Mr. Vermillion lived in a \nlarge cell and had the ability to earn privileges such as possessing a pet cat. It \nwas designed for inmates whose positive behavior had earned them the right to \nhave greater privileges. Mr. Vermillion’s placement on this unit speaks to his \nconduct in the facility up until he was placed in segregation for years for the \nviolation that the IDOC ultimately expunged from his record.  \n \nI also toured the Westville Control Unit (WCU) where Mr. Vermillion spent the \nmajority of his years in segregation. WCU functions as a super max facility. \nInmates in this unit are confined to their cell 23 hours a day with an hour out-of-\ncell time each day for showering or recreation. WCU was dirty, somewhat in \ndisarray, and inmates could be heard yelling from cell door to cell door on the \nday of our tour. Access to books, congregate programs, phone calls and other \n                                                 \nNowatzke deposition pg. 209, Barnes deposition pg. 110-111. \n30\n \n  29 \n\nactivities is minimal. I find it surprising that given IDOC’s history of being litigated \nagainst over super max conditions of confinement and the Human Rights Watch \nreport issued more than two decades ago, that IDOC does not demonstrate more \nacuity around the condition and management of these units. \n \nIn the 2018 Vera report, their other recommendation for improving use of \nadministrative segregation is to increase the availability of productive activities in \nthese settings and to “ease their return to the general population.”31 This would \ninclude access to programs, both in-cell and congregate, increasing out-of-cell \ntime and group interaction. Similarly, ASCA’s 2013 Guidelines suggest that \nsystems “provide structured and progressive levels that include increased \nprivileges as an incentive for positive behavior and/or program participation”32 \n \nEducational and other programs can help address underlying criminogenic \nneeds, which are the factors that research has found most directly relate to an \nindividual's likelihood to re-offend. Of these, anti-social values, anti-social \npersonality, criminal peers, dysfunctional family, low self-control, substance \nabuse, and a lack of a prosocial way to occupy one’s time, such as work or \nschool, are the criminogenic needs that if addressed, make the biggest impact on \nfuture criminal behavior. These programs provide participants with new skills in \norder for them to live more productively in general population or when released \n                                                 \nVera 2018. Pg. 33.\n31ASCA pg. 2.\n   \n32\n   \n  30 \n\nand they allow an inmate to demonstrate a willingness to change. These \nprograms are even more important in administrative segregation as it is an \nindefinite placement intended to be used for inmates that pose the highest safety \nand security risks to the institution.  Absent meaningful programs, the facility or \nsystem has by default decided that merely residing in segregation for an \nundefined period of time will correct the deficit that got them there in the first \nplace, in effect, abdicating its responsibility to rehabilitate, a duty made clear in \nthe title “department of correction”.  \n \nCongregate activities give inmates a chance to interact with others, reducing \nisolation and helping to mitigate the negative psychological impacts of \nsegregation. These activities are also necessary for assessing their behavior \naround others, e.g., do they interact appropriately with the instructors and \nengage in prosocial practices with their peers in the classroom? Without these \nopportunities, correctional professionals lack the information they need to \nadequately assess an inmate’s current abilities and limitations in interacting with \nother people. In Washington, as in other states, observations about these \ninteractions are an important part of the segregation review process. \n \nCurrent best practices include use of structured and progressive levels that \ninclude increased privileges as an incentive for positive behavior and/or program \nparticipation”33 Providing incentives for positive behavior is more effective than \n                                                 \nVera pg. 33, ASCA Guidelines, pg. 2. \n33\n \n  31 \n\nonly addressing negative behavior. It appears that the unit in which Mr. Vermillion \nwas housed provides few incentives for positive behavior. Despite a remarkably \nstrong behavioral record, he remained in administrative segregation and, \naccording to Mr. Barnes who conducted his required placement reviews, his \nbehavior was not factored into his continued placement in administrative \nsegregation.  \n \nStep-down programming is also viewed as a best practice in segregation \nmanagement.34 These typically involve a system of review with established \ncriteria to prepare an inmate, either those who have been in segregation for an \nextended period of time or who cycle through frequently, for transition to the \ngeneral population or to the community. Through a gradual lifting of restrictions \nand increased time with others, these inmates are better prepared to self-\nmanage in general population. These programs often involve a multidisciplinary \nreview team that includes mental health, case management, and security \npractitioners. This team coordinates behavior response and sets transition goals \nas it assesses progress. These programs, usually located in specific housing \nunits, are typically designed with the assumption that the transitioning inmates \nwere in segregation due to a lack of ability to self-manage or cope in general \npopulation. IDOC’s two super-max facilities have a step-down program available \nto some inmates called ACT.35 For reasons I could not ascertain in the \n                                                 \nVera pg. 33, ASCA-Liman 2018, pg. 63 \n34IDOC Executive Directive #09-48 \n \n35\n \n  32 \n\ndocuments provided to me and were not known to the facility staff questioned \nabout this in deposition, Mr. Vermillion was not approved to participate in ACT \ndespite having requested to attend and meeting the requirements for \nparticipation. \n \nFrom all available documentation, Mr. Vermillion’s placement in administrative \nsegregation was based on a belief by IDOC administrators that he was involved \nin the 2009 escape at ISP. His behavior while institutionalized was never violent \nand IDOC’s own custody tool assessed Mr. Vermillion as being appropriate for a \nmedium security setting. The fact that IDOC administrators did not even attempt \nto offer him programs, increased congregant time out-of-cell, or participation in \nthe step-down program, even if pretextual, makes clear that their intentions were \nnever rehabilitative. Mr. Vermillion’s placement in department-wide administrative \nsegregation was an indefinite punishment for an offense he was never charged \nwith rather than for security purposes. \n \nIV.  Conclusion:  \nThere was no legitimate penological purpose for holding Jay Vermillion in \ndepartment-wide administrative segregation for any length of time, much less \nthree years.  His disciplinary record in no way justified his placement here.  If in \nfact IDOC administrators were concerned that Mr. Vermillion was involved in \ntrafficking in contraband, in addition to imposing the maximum 30-day \nsegregation period allowable under IDOC disciplinary rules, there are common \n  33 \n\nsense precautions they could have been taken such as moving him to another \nfacility and restricting him from obtaining employment in areas that have low \nstaffing levels or sensitive materials. These are follow-up actions that would have \nmitigated potential risks without subjecting Mr. Vermillion to years of extreme \nisolation.  \n \nThe fact pattern in this case is not dissimilar from fact patterns that I have seen in \nreviewing administrative segregation cases throughout my career. The facility \nstaff suspected wrong doing, issued a violation on Mr. Vermillion, and when the \nsanction was reduced, IDOC administrators maintained him in administrative \nsegregation status, effectively administering a longer sanction without regard to \nthe evidence of the case or due process. Even more alarming, his segregation \nplacement appears to be a punitive response to IDOC administrators’ belief that \nMr. Vermillion was guilty of assisting in an escape, an offense for which he was \nnever charged.  \n \nAfter reviewing the documents in this case, I have no doubt that Mr. Vermillion’s \nextended placement in administrative segregation, which lacked any meaningful \nreview or penological justification, was a way to sidestep the established \ndisciplinary process. His three-year stay in segregation for a perceived offense \nfor which there was no proof and for which he was not charged that was \nextremely excessive, especially in light of the stark conditions and lack of \ncongregant activities or programming at WCU. From the information I have \n  34 \n\nreviewed, I conclude that IDOC’s placement of Mr. Vermillion in department-wide \nadministrative segregation was an action taken to accomplish one thing- to \nretaliate against and to punish Mr. Vermillion.  \n \n   3/31/19 \n_________________  __________________ \nDan Pacholke    Date \n \n \n  35 \n\n \n \n \n \nATTACHMENT 1 \n\nAttachment 1 \n \nDAN PACHOLKE                 \n \n \nPROFILE \n \nServed the Washington State Department of Corrections for 33 years, starting as a Correctional \nOfficer and retiring as Secretary.

VERMILLION,    for the Northern District of Indiana, \n  Plaintiff-Appellant,  Indianapolis Division. \n   \n  v.  No. 3:11-CV-280 JVB \n   \nMARK E. LEVENHAGEN, et al.,  Joseph S. Van Bokkelen, \n  Defendants-Appellees.  Judge. \n \n \nO R D E R \nJay Vermillion, an Indiana prisoner, sued more than 20 Department of Correction \nemployees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that each of them retaliated for his \ninvocation of the right to remain silent when questioned about the escape of fellow \nprisoners. At screening, see 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the district court allowed Vermillion to \n                                                 \n* After examining the briefs and record, we have concluded that oral argument is \nunnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and record. See FED. R. APP. \nP. 34(a)(2)(C). \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 87-3   Filed 04/06/15   Page 2 of 6 PageID #: 431\nCase: 14-2327      Document: 00712503618            Filed: 04/06/2015      Pages: 6\nNo. 14-2327    Page 2 \n \nproceed only on a claim that his transfer to a “supermax” facility after the aborted \ninterview violated his right to due process. The district court then granted summary \njudgment for the defendants on the ground that Vermillion had failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies on that claim. On appeal Vermillion challenges this ruling as \nwell as the district court’s dismissal of most of his claims at screening. We conclude that \nthe defendants failed to establish their affirmative defense of failure to exhaust and that \nthe district court should have allowed Vermillion to at least proceed with his additional \nclaims arising from the same factual basis as the due-process claim. \nIn his second amended complaint, Vermillion alleges that on July 29, 2009, he \nwas interviewed by Internal Affairs investigators after several fellow inmates had \nescaped from the Indiana State Prison (“ISP”). The interviewers accused him of being \ninvolved in the escape and threatened to pursue criminal charges, prompting \nVermillion to stop answering their questions. Following this encounter, according to \nVermillion, the three interviewers along with another investigator from Internal Affairs \nand five administrators from ISP, Westville Correctional Facility, and DOC \nheadquarters retaliated for his silence by immediately placing him in punitive \nsegregation at ISP and then on August 12, 2009, transferring him to Westville, where he \nwas housed in the Maximum Control Segregation Unit. This transfer, Vermillion \nalleges, occurred after two of the administrators falsified documents to exaggerate his \nsecurity classification. All nine of these employees are named defendants. \nVermillion claims that for more than three years after the transfer, he was \nconfined in his segregation cell at Westville for at least 23 hours per day without \npersonal interaction with other inmates, and during those years, five of the same nine \nemployees—joined by many others—continued retaliating against him for invoking his \nright to remain silent. This retaliation, Vermillion alleges, ranged from intercepting his \nmail to mishandling the administrative hearings concerning a disciplinary ticket for \ntrafficking contraband. \nVermillion’s operative complaint followed two earlier versions that the district \ncourt had rejected on the ground that he was trying to join unrelated claims against \nunrelated defendants. See FED. R. CIV. P. 18, 20(a)(2), 21; George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, \n607 (7th Cir. 2007). After Vermillion’s third attempt, the district court dismissed the \nmajority of his claims and defendants on the same ground, allowing him to proceed \nsolely on a due-process claim against the five administrators allegedly involved in his \ntransfer to Westville. See Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 223–25 (2005) (holding that \ntransfer to “supermax” facility may implicate federally protected liberty interest if \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 87-3   Filed 04/06/15   Page 3 of 6 PageID #: 432\nCase: 14-2327      Document: 00712503618            Filed: 04/06/2015      Pages: 6\nNo. 14-2327    Page 3 \n \nconditions there impose an “atypical and significant hardship”); Westefer v. Neal, \n682 F.3d 679, 684–86 (7th Cir. 2012) (“Inmates transferred to a supermax prison are \nentitled to informal, nonadversarial due process.”). In this claim Vermillion alleges that \nhe was transferred without “any notice, reason, or opportunity for rebuttal.” He \nprotested the district court’s screening decision, arguing that his other claims are \nproperly joined with this one. All of the claims, Vermillion insisted, arose from a broad \nconspiracy among the defendants to retaliate for his assertion of his Fifth Amendment \nright to remain silent. \nThe defendants remaining after the district court’s screening decision moved for \nsummary judgment on the ground that Vermillion had not exhausted his \nadministrative remedies on the due-process claim as required by the Prison Litigation \nReform Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The defendants asserted that an inmate who wants \nto challenge a transfer decision must submit a “classification appeal” on Form 9260 \nwithin ten days of receiving notice that he was being transferred, and Vermillion did \nnot file a Form 9260 complaining about his transfer to Westville. Vermillion responded \nthat prison regulations require a written appeal within ten days of receiving a \n“Classification Analyst’s decision,” not merely “notice” of transfer. And it is undisputed \nthat Vermillion had never received a Classification Analyst’s decision either before or \nafter being moved to Westville. Moreover, Vermillion added, even though he never \nreceived such a decision, he submitted a Form 9260 to administrators at Westville or \nDOC headquarters—not once but five times—and never received a response. The \ndefendants replied that they had not found any of these forms in the prison records and \ninsisted that Vermillion, by his own account, had sent them to the wrong staff members \nif he sent them at all.   \nThe district court concluded that Vermillion failed to exhaust because he should \nhave, but admittedly did not, submit a Form 9260 to the proper authorities within ten \ndays of the transfer. The transfer itself, the court determined, gave Vermillion “notice” \nof the decision to reclassify and transfer him. \nOn appeal Vermillion first challenges the district court’s conclusion that he failed \nto exhaust administrative remedies, a decision we review de novo. See Maddox v. Love, \n655 F.3d 709, 720 (7th Cir. 2011); Dole v. Chandler, 438 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir. 2006). He \nmaintains that he did not receive a Classification Analyst’s decision to transfer him, and \nso his obligation to appeal under DOC regulations was never triggered. Under the \nPLRA, a prisoner must exhaust all available administrative remedies and follow \nadministrative procedures—including time limits—before filing suit. See 42 U.S.C. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 87-3   Filed 04/06/15   Page 4 of 6 PageID #: 433\nCase: 14-2327      Document: 00712503618            Filed: 04/06/2015      Pages: 6\nNo. 14-2327    Page 4 \n \n1997e(a); Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 85 (2006); Conyers v. Abitz, 416 F.3d 580, 584 (7th \nCir. 2005); Pozo v. McCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1024–25 (7th Cir. 2002). Failure to exhaust \nis an affirmative defense, so it was the defendants’ burden to establish the absence of \ndisputed issues of material facts concerning whether Vermillion had an available \nadministrative remedy that he failed to pursue. See Maddox, 655 F.3d at 720; Pavey v. \nConley, 663 F.3d 899, 903 (7th Cir. 2011).   \nThe DOC policy at issue does not require that an inmate file a “classification \nappeal” within ten days of transfer or receipt of notice of a transfer. Instead, the policy \ndirects inmates to challenge a transfer by “[s]ubmitting a written appeal within ten (10) \nworking days from the date that the offender received the Classification Analyst’s \ndecision.” IDOC MANUAL OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, No. 01-04-101 (“Classification \nAppeals Policy”) § IV(J)(2)(b)(1) (emphasis added). The defendants do not dispute \nVermillion’s declaration that he never received a decision from a Classification Analyst, \nnor did they produce evidence of such a decision. And neither did the defendants \nproduce evidence—or even assert—that Vermillion had reason to know that the written \npolicy does not mean what it says and that the ten-day appeal clock starts to run when \nthe inmate is moved, with or without a Classification Analyst’s decision to appeal from. \nCf. Curtis v. Timberlake, 436 F.3d 709, 712 (7th Cir. 2005) (concluding that prisoner had \nexhausted available remedies by following unofficially modified procedures). \nIn short, the defendants have never contested Vermillion’s assertion that the \nDOC did not provide him with any decision that its regulations directed him to \nappeal—or that he could appeal—before filing this lawsuit. As Vermillion notes in his \nbrief to this court, without a decision to review, he would have “no idea what the \ndecision was, wh[ose] decision it was, or what an appeal could possibly be based \nupon.” Vermillion was required to exhaust only those remedies that were available to \nhim, and “when prison officials prevent inmates from using the administrative \nprocess … , the process that exists on paper becomes unavailable in reality.” Kaba v. \nStepp, 458 F.3d 678, 684 (7th Cir. 2006). The defendants cannot fault Vermillion for not \ndoing more or proceeding differently than DOC procedures require. See Hurst v. Hantke, \n634 F.3d 409, 411 (7th Cir. 2011); Dole, 438 F.3d at 811; Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 650 \n(7th Cir. 2002). The defendants did not carry their burden of showing that no genuine \nissue of material fact exists concerning their defense of failure to exhaust. To the \ncontrary, their inability to make that showing seems clear. Summary judgment on this \nground was inappropriate. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 87-3   Filed 04/06/15   Page 5 of 6 PageID #: 434\nCase: 14-2327      Document: 00712503618            Filed: 04/06/2015      Pages: 6\nNo. 14-2327    Page 5 \n \nVermillion next challenges the district court’s decision to dismiss all but the \ndue-process claim from his second amended complaint. His operative complaint \nattributes everything that happened to him while in segregation at Westville to a broad \nconspiracy to retaliate for invoking the Fifth Amendment. The district court rejected as \nimplausible Vermillion’s suspicion that so many DOC employees from two different \nfacilities were out to get him. With that conclusion we readily agree. But even without a \nwidespread conspiracy that would encompass all of Vermillion’s disparate claims \nagainst more than 20 defendants, some of his other claims can go forward. Other \ndefendants are properly joined with the five administrators if the claims against the \nadditional defendants arise from the same transaction or occurrence as Vermillion’s \ndue-process claim against the administrators. See FED. R. CIV. P. 20(a)(2)(A).   \nVermillion argues that his transfer violated his right to due process but also was \ninitiated for the purpose of retaliating for his refusal to answer questions about the \nescaped prisoners. The Fifth Amendment gives a person the right “not to answer official \nquestions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, \nwhere the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.” Lefkowitz v. \nTurley, 414 U.S. 70, 77 (1973). This right applies in the prison disciplinary context, and \nprison officials may violate a prisoner’s right against self-incrimination if a prisoner’s \nsilence alone results in punishment of the kind capable of compelling waiver of the \nright. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 434 (1984); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. \n308, 317 (1976); LaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban, 54 F.3d 387, 390 (7th Cir. 1995). \nAlthough not all of his claims can be linked to his assertion of this right, Vermillion \nplausibly alleges that more than just the five administrators were involved in retaliating \nagainst him for his refusal to talk to the Internal Affairs investigators. Vermillion claims \nthat his placement in punitive segregation at ISP, his transfer to the Maximum Control \nSegregation Unit at Westville, and the alleged falsification of documents to exaggerate \nhis security classification and keep him confined in segregation were punishments \naimed at retaliating against him because he asserted his right to silence. Because this \nclaim points to joint conduct by the five administrators and four Internal Affairs \ninvestigators and would invariably rely on some of the same facts as his due-process \nclaim relating to the transfer, Vermillion properly joined the defendants allegedly \nresponsible. \nOnce Vermillion properly joined parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n20, Rule 18 allows him to join all claims he has against each defendant. See Intercon \nResearch Assocs., Ltd. v. Dresser Indus., Inc., 696 F.2d 53, 57 (7th Cir. 1982) (noting that \n“joinder of claims under Rule 18 becomes relevant only after the requirements of \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 87-3   Filed 04/06/15   Page 6 of 6 PageID #: 435\nCase: 14-2327      Document: 00712503618            Filed: 04/06/2015      Pages: 6\nNo. 14-2327    Page 6 \n \nRule 20 relating to joinder of parties has been met with respect to the party against \nwhom the claim is sought to be asserted”); 6A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. \nMILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1585 (3d ed. 2010) \n(“Once parties are properly joined … as to a particular claim, additional claims, whether \nthey are related or unrelated or they are by or against all or less than all of the parties \nmay be joined under Rule 18(a).”). Defendants Levenhagen, Morton, Brennan, Mize, \nand Nowatzke remained in the case after screening because Vermillion’s due-process \nclaim was asserted against them. The addition of his self-incrimination retaliation claim \nadds defendants Plank, Buss, Whelan, and Carrasco. Vermillion therefore properly \njoined all claims he had against these defendants. We note, however, that even though \nthese claims are properly joined, they do not necessarily have to proceed together. \nUnder Rule 21 the district court has the discretion to sever any claims that are “discrete \nand separate” in the interest of judicial economy and to avoid prejudice. See Gaffney v. \nRiverboat Servs. of Ind., Inc., 451 F.3d 424, 442 (7th Cir. 2006); Rice v. Sunrise Express, Inc., \n209 F.3d 1008, 1016 (7th Cir. 2000); Otis Clapp & Son, Inc. v. Filmore Vitamin Co., 754 F.2d \n738, 743 (7th Cir. 1985). We leave these considerations for the district court to address in \nthe first instance. \nVermillion also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his state-law \nclaims. Because the district court allowed only the due-process claim to proceed, the \ncourt did not separately analyze Vermillion’s supplemental claims. Our decision here \nreinstates all claims, federal and state, against the nine defendants who are properly \njoined in Vermillion’s lawsuit, and on remand the district court will have the \nopportunity to decide whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law \nclaims against these defendants. \nVermillion finally argues that his request to transfer his case to the Southern \nDistrict of Indiana should have been granted. As Vermillion is now imprisoned in that \ndistrict, on remand the district court may, in its discretion, decide to grant the request. \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1404; Research Automation, Inc. v. Schrader–Bridgeport Int’l, Inc., 626 F.3d \n973, 978–79 (7th Cir. 2010).  \nWe have reviewed Vermillion’s remaining arguments and conclude that none \nhas merit. Accordingly, the district court’s judgment is VACATED insofar as it \ndismisses any claim against defendants Levenhagen, Morton, Brennan, Mize, \nNowatzke, Plank, Buss, Whelan, and Carrasco, and as to those defendants, the case is \nREMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this decision. In all other respects, \nthe judgment is AFFIRMED. ",

VERMILLION,\nPlaintiff, \n   Civil Action No.  3:11-CV-280 JVB\nv.\nWILLARD PLANK et al.,\nDefendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nJay F. Vermillion, a prisoner, is proceeding pro se on a claim that he was transferred to a\ndifferent correctional facility in violation of his due process rights. (DE 17.) Defendants move\nfor summary judgment on the ground that Vermillion did not exhaust his administrative remedies\nbefore filing suit. (DE 53.) \nSummary judgment must be granted when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine\nissue of material fact exists when “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a\nverdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).\nNot every dispute between the parties makes summary judgment inappropriate; “[o]nly disputes\nover facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly\npreclude the entry of summary judgment.” Id. To determine whether a genuine issue of material\nfact exists, the court must construe all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party\nand draw all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor. Ogden v. Atterholt, 606 F.3d 355, 358\n(7th Cir. 2010). Nevertheless, a party opposing a properly supported summary judgment motion\nmay not rely merely on allegations or denials in his or her own pleading, but rather must\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 63   Filed 03/19/14   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 338\n“marshal and present the court with the evidence she contends will prove her case.” Goodman v.\nNat’l Sec. Agency, Inc., 621 F.3d 651, 654 (7th Cir. 2010).\nUnder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), prisoners are prohibited from\nbringing an action in federal court with respect to prison conditions until “such administrative\nremedies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); see also Booth v. Churner, 532\nU.S. 731, 741 n.6 (2001) (observing that under § 1997e(a) an “inmate must exhaust irrespective\nof the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues”). The Seventh Circuit\nCourt of Appeals has taken a “strict compliance approach to exhaustion.” Dole v. Chandler, 438\nF.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir. 2006). Thus, “[t]o exhaust remedies, a prisoner must file complaints and\nappeals in the place, and at the time, the prison’s administrative rules require.” Pozo v.\nMcCaughtry, 286 F.3d 1022, 1025 (7th Cir. 2002). “[U]nless the prisoner completes the\nadministrative process by following the rules the state has established for that process,\nexhaustion has not occurred.” Id. at 1023. Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense on which\nthe defendant bears the burden of proof. Dole, 438 F.3d at 809. \nHere, Vermillion was granted leave to proceed on a claim that he was transferred from\nIndiana State Prison (“ISP”) to the Westville Control Unit (“WCU”), a state “supermax” facility,\nwithout adequate due process protections. See Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 220 (2005)\n(“inmates have a protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment” at state supermax facility);\nWestefer v. Neal, 682 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir. 2012) (“Inmates transferred to a supermax prison\nare entitled to informal, nonadversarial due process.”). The record reflects that Vermillion was\ntransferred on August 12, 2009. (DE 17 at 5–6; DE 61 at 9.) As of that date, the Indiana\nDepartment of Correction (“IDOC”) had an administrative review process in place whereby an\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 63   Filed 03/19/14   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 339\ninmate could challenge a transfer from one correctional facility to another. (DE 53-1, Hendrix\nDecl. ¶ 9; DE 53-1, IDOC Manual of Policies and Procedures, No. 01-04-101 (“Classification\nAppeals Policy”) § IV(J)(2).) Under that process, an inmate must file a classification appeal\nwithin ten days of receiving notice of the transfer. (DE 53-1, Hendrix Decl. ¶ 10.) A record is\nkept of all classification appeals, and those records show that Vermillion did not file a\nclassification appeal challenging his transfer from ISP to WCU. (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.) Relying on this\nomission, Defendants argue that Vermillion did not properly exhaust his available administrative\nremedies before filing suit. (DE 54.) \nIn his response, Vermillion does not dispute that an administrative process was in place\nthat allowed him to appeal a facility transfer. (See DE 61 at 9.) He also does not dispute that he\ndid not file an appeal of his transfer to WCU. (Id.) Instead, he argues that he was not given\nproper written notice of his transfer, and thus his obligation to file an appeal was never\n“triggered.” (Id. at 8–9.) This argument is unavailing. Even if Vermillion did not get written\nnotice of his transfer, and even if such notice was required by IDOC rules, he was obviously\naware of the transfer as of the date he was actually transferred. He could requested\nadministrative review of the transfer decision within ten days of that date, but failed to avail\nhimself of that remedy.\nVermillion also points to appeals he filed after he was assigned to Department Wide\nAdministrative Segregation (“DWAS”), or long-term administrative segregation, in October\n2009, while he was housed at WCU. (See DE 61-2.) However, his assignment to long-term\nadministrative segregation in October 2009 is a separate issue from his transfer to WCU two\nmonths earlier, and the transfer is the event he is challenging in this lawsuit. Documents he filed\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 63   Filed 03/19/14   Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 340\nin November and December 2009 were not timely under the prison policy for challenging a\ntransfer that occurred in August 2009. (DE 53-1, Classification Appeal Policy § IV(J)(2); DE 53-\n1, Hendrix Decl. ¶ 10.) Furthermore, the process for appealing a placement in DWAS is different\nfrom the process for appealing a facility transfer; among other things, they involve different\ndecision-makers. (See DE 53-1, Classification Appeal Policy § IV(J)(2); DE 53-1, Hendrix Decl.\n¶ 19.) A request for review of a facility transfer must be submitted to the IDOC Director of\nClassification (DE 53-1, Hendrix Decl. ¶ 11), whereas Vermillion sent the appeal of his\nplacement in DWAS to the IDOC Deputy Commissioner of Operations. (See DE 61-2 at 3.) This\ndid not comply with prison administrative requirements for appealing a facility transfer. See\nPozo, 286 F.3d at 1025 (explaining that, to properly exhaust, a prisoner must file documents “in\nthe place, and at the time, the prison’s administrative rules require”). Accordingly, Vermillion\ndid not exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing suit.\nThis action is therefore subject to dismissal. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). It is not clear that\nVermillion has the ability to exhaust at this point, but because the state could allow him to cure\nhis omission, the dismissal will be without prejudice. Ford v. Johnson, 362 F.3d 395, 401 (7th\nCir. 2004) (“[A]ll dismissals under § 1997e(a) should be without prejudice.”). \nFor these reasons, Defendants’ motion (DE 53) is GRANTED, and this action is\nDISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\nSO ORDERED on March 19, 2014.\n  s/ Joseph S.

FILLER:)· Dr. Morgan, I'm pass -- Dr.\n13· ·Morgan, I'm passing you what's been marked as Expert 1.\n14· ·Is this the report that you submitted in this case?\n15· · · A.· Yes, it is.\n16· · · Q.· And if you could turn to Attachment A to that\n17· ·report, I believe that's your CV?\n18· · · A.· Yes, it is.\n19· · · Q.· Dr. Morgan, let's start by just going over some\n20· ·of what's in your CV, okay?\n21· · · A.· Yes.\n22· · · Q.· Does this CV accurately describe your background\n23· ·and your qualifications?\n24· · · A.· Yes, it does.\n25· · · Q.· And I believe that it is signed May 4th, 2019?\n\n·1· ·The very -- page 29 of Attachment A.\n·2· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n·3· · · Q.· And so would you say that the CV then is\n·4· ·up-to-date?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.\n·6· · · Q.· Is there anything missing that's more recent that\n·7· ·is not included in the CV?\n·8· · · A.· No.\n·9· · · Q.· Dr. Morgan, you are a licensed psychologist in\n10· ·the State of Texas; is that right?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· Have you ever had your license suspended?\n13· · · A.· No, I have not.\n14· · · Q.· Have you ever been professionally disciplined?\n15· · · A.· No, I have not.\n16· · · Q.· Are there any lawsuits regarding your conduct as\n17· ·a psychologist?\n18· · · A.· Pending?\n19· · · Q.· Have there ever been any lawsuits regarding your\n20· ·conduct as a psychologist?\n21· · · A.· There was a file when I was in the Kansas\n22· ·Department of Corrections, an inmate had filed suit\n23· ·against the Department and I was named in it.· I had\n24· ·left the Department.· I was a doctoral student at\n25· ·Oklahoma State University, found out after the fact that\n\n·1· ·the State had failed to represent me, so there was a --\n·2· ·I don't know what it's called.\n·3· · · Q.· A default judgment?\n·4· · · A.· A default judgment.· So I wrote back and said, \"I\n·5· ·didn't know about this.\"· I was a member, and they took\n·6· ·care of it.· And I don't -- I never heard anything else\n·7· ·by way of outcome.\n·8· · · Q.· Do you know anything about the substance of that\n·9· ·complaint?\n10· · · A.· Yes.· It was in regard to the practice of the\n11· ·segregation review board in a segregation unit.· And as\n12· ·the mental health professional assigned to that unit, I\n13· ·was by default a member of the segregation review board.\n14· ·So it named the segregation review board, plus the\n15· ·warden, I believe, of the facility, and I was named with\n16· ·everybody else on the review board.\n17· · · Q.· Got it.· Thank you.\n18· · · A.· Uh-huh.\n19· · · Q.· Have you ever been named in any lawsuit other\n20· ·than the case that you were just describing?\n21· · · A.· No, I have not.\n22· · · Q.· And Dr. Morgan, I understand that you are a\n23· ·Professor of Psychology at Texas Tech here in Lubbock;\n24· ·is that right?\n25· · · A.· That's correct.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And if we look at the first page of your CV, you\n·2· ·have a heading for Education.· And if I understand this\n·3· ·correctly, you have three degrees; is that right?\n·4· · · A.· Yes.\n·5· · · Q.· An undergraduate degree, a master's degree in\n·6· ·Clinical Psychology, and a doctoral degree in Counseling\n·7· ·Psychology, correct?\n·8· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n·9· · · Q.· Dr. Morgan, you are not a medical doctor, meaning\n10· ·you didn't go through medical training, right?\n11· · · A.· No, I did not.\n12· · · Q.· And you received your doctoral degree in\n13· ·Counseling Psychology from Oklahoma State University; is\n14· ·that correct?\n15· · · A.· Yes, it is.\n16· · · Q.· Can you explain for me, a lay person, the\n17· ·difference between Counseling Psychology and Clinical\n18· ·Psychology, please?\n19· · · A.· Yes.· The differences are really theoretical by\n20· ·way of approach to one's work.· The outcome is by way of\n21· ·what somebody will do with a clinical and counseling PhD\n22· ·are essentially the same.· I've contributed to research\n23· ·on that.· There's a body of literature to that.· We do\n24· ·the same things, we do psychological assessments, we\n25· ·provide psychotherapy, do crisis interventions,\n\n·1· ·psychotherapy being individual and group.· We teach, we\n·2· ·do research.· Essentially the practice is the same.· The\n·3· ·approach is theoretically a little bit different.\n·4· · · Q.· Can you explain that theoretical approach\n·5· ·difference that you've described?\n·6· · · A.· I can try.· It's not well articulated at the\n·7· ·professional level or in the literature.· Typically,\n·8· ·Clinical Psychology will take a bit more of a medical\n·9· ·model, diagnose and treat the disorder, in a nutshell.\n10· · · · · · · ·Counseling Psychology views itself as a\n11· ·profession.· The Counseling Psychologists within the\n12· ·field view ourselves as a bit more holistic in that we\n13· ·want to consider the entirety of an individual's life\n14· ·situation.· So things like work and family function can\n15· ·also impact how one's coping or functioning with any\n16· ·particular problem.· So it's not simply diagnose and\n17· ·treat the problem, but more broadly treat the whole\n18· ·individual.\n19· · · · · · · ·Clinical Psychologists do that as well, but\n20· ·historically they're more rooted in what we would call\n21· ·the medical model, diagnose and treat, where we tend to\n22· ·be a bit broader and more holistic.\n23· · · Q.· Thank you for that description.\n24· · · A.· Yes.\n25· · · Q.· Dr. Morgan, turning to the Academic\n\n·1· ·Position/Appointments section of your CV, it looks to me\n·2· ·like your first academic position came after you\n·3· ·received your master's degree when you were teaching at\n·4· ·a Junior College in Kansas; is that correct?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.· I taught one semester of Introductory\n·6· ·Psychology course.\n·7· · · Q.· And then after you finished your post-doc, you\n·8· ·started at Texas Tech; is that right?\n·9· · · A.· That's correct.\n10· · · Q.· And so all of these academic positions from about\n11· ·2000 forward will be here at Texas Tech?\n12· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n13· · · Q.· And then the next heading of your CV is\n14· ·Publications and Presentations.· Do you see that?\n15· · · A.· Yes, I do.\n16· · · Q.· And that is further subdivided and begins with a\n17· ·section on Refereed Journals.· Does the term \"Refereed\n18· ·Journals\" refer to peer review journals?\n19· · · A.· Yes, it does.\n20· · · Q.· And does that mean that a piece is accepted for\n21· ·-- when a piece is accepted for publication it has to be\n22· ·subjected to peer review by others in the field?\n23· · · A.· Correct.\n24· · · Q.· And I've counted here you have a number of peer\n25· ·review publications.· My count is 82.· Does that sound\n\n·1· ·about right?\n·2· · · A.· That sounds about right.\n·3· · · Q.· And these are listed in reverse chronological\n·4· ·order by publication date; is that right?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.\n·6· · · Q.· And if we look at the third page of your CV, I\n·7· ·see one article with a lead author Chadick entitled \"The\n·8· ·psychological impact of solitary:· A longitudinal\n·9· ·comparison of general population and long-term\n10· ·administratively segregated male inmates,\" and that has\n11· ·a 2018 publication date.· Is that one of the articles\n12· ·that you've cited in your opinions in this case?\n13· · · A.· Yes, I did.\n14· · · Q.· And also seen on page 3, I see a 2017 piece where\n15· ·you are the lead author, and it appeared in Corrections\n16· ·Today, \"Questioning solitary confinement:· Is\n17· ·administrative segregation as bad as alleged;\" is that\n18· ·right?\n19· · · A.· Yes.\n20· · · Q.· And Dr. Morgan, is Corrections Today the magazine\n21· ·of the American Corrections Association?\n22· · · A.· Yes.\n23· · · Q.· And so as I understand it then, the peer review\n24· ·process would involve other correctional professionals;\n25· ·is that right?\n\n·1· · · A.· Yes.\n·2· · · Q.· This isn't a peer review process where that\n·3· ·article was subjected to peer review by other research\n·4· ·psychologists, right?\n·5· · · A.· No, other professionals in the field, not\n·6· ·necessarily psychologists.\n·7· · · Q.· And the circulation of this magazine would be\n·8· ·primarily to correctional administrators and officials;\n·9· ·is that right?\n10· · · A.· It would include that -- that group, but other\n11· ·folks might access or subscribe to the journal as well.\n12· · · Q.· Are you a member of the ACA?\n13· · · A.· I am not.\n14· · · Q.· And this piece, as I understood it, essentially\n15· ·described the results of your 2016 meta-analysis; is\n16· ·that right?\n17· · · A.· That was one piece -- component of it.\n18· · · Q.· What were the other components?\n19· · · A.· Following up on an article by Dr. Metzer to\n20· ·outline best practices for mental health services in\n21· ·segregation.\n22· · · Q.· Is Dr. Metzer the same Dr. Metzer who was\n23· ·involved in the Colorado study from 2010?\n24· · · A.· Yes, he was.\n25· · · · · · · ·(EXPERT EXHIBIT NO. 2 MARKED.)\n\n·1· · · Q.· (BY MS. FILLER:)· Dr. Morgan, I'm going to pass\n·2· ·you what's been marked as Expert Exhibit 2, and could\n·3· ·you please tell me if this is the article we've just\n·4· ·been discussing, \"Questioning solitary confinement:· Is\n·5· ·administrative segregation as bad as alleged,\" that\n·6· ·appeared in Corrections Today?\n·7· · · A.· Yes, it is.\n·8· · · Q.· If you could turn to page 21, and I notice here\n·9· ·that you have recommendations for the use of\n10· ·administrative segregation?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· Is this some of what you were just describing\n13· ·that you include recommendations in this piece?\n14· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n15· · · Q.· And if we look at the second recommendation\n16· ·towards the bottom, \"the recommendation is to provide\n17· ·therapeutic and stepdown programs for inmates serving\n18· ·significant time in AS.\"· What would \"significant time\"\n19· ·be?\n20· · · A.· I didn't conceptualize a time period when I wrote\n21· ·this.· If I was to think about it now and put a time\n22· ·period to it, I would certainly say a year or more,\n23· ·possibly.· I would need to think it through, but\n24· ·possibly as much as six months.\n25· · · Q.· And you cite an example of therapeutic programs\n\n·1· ·as including, \"Stepping Up, Stepping Out, A mental\n·2· ·health treatment program for inmates detained in\n·3· ·restrictive housing.\"· Is that your program, Dr. Morgan?\n·4· · · A.· That one is, yes.\n·5· · · Q.· And is there a book in which you describe this\n·6· ·stepdown program?\n·7· · · A.· Yes, we have a treatment manual.· And to be\n·8· ·clear, it's -- I'm the second author.· So there's a\n·9· ·first author, so it's a team approach.· Yes, we have the\n10· ·treatment manual, and that manual is being published by\n11· ·a publisher.\n12· · · Q.· Is that coming out this summer?\n13· · · A.· I don't know when that's coming out.· It's --\n14· ·it's in the publisher's hands, and we've made whatever\n15· ·rec -- revisions that they requested, so now it's just\n16· ·waiting to go through the printing process.· I don't\n17· ·know if it will be out this summer or later in the fall.\n18· · · Q.· And if I'm understanding you correctly, there is\n19· ·already, though, a therapeutic manual that is available\n20· ·to prisons that wish to implement this stepdown\n21· ·approach?\n22· · · A.· Yes, absolutely.\n23· · · Q.· I want to talk more about this Stepping Up,\n24· ·Stepping Out as we go forward today.· But would you\n25· ·agree that at least one of the purposes of including\n\n·1· ·this Stepping Up, Stepping Out Program here in the\n·2· ·Corrections Today piece is that you were hoping that\n·3· ·correctional administrators would read your article and\n·4· ·develop an interest in your recommendation for the\n·5· ·Stepping Up, Stepping Out Program?\n·6· · · A.· No, actually.· I don't think a correctional\n·7· ·administrator will be inclined to pass that onto their\n·8· ·mental health professionals.· There's other ways to\n·9· ·advertise, if I were to advertise the program.· I simply\n10· ·listed that and the other treatment program here as an\n11· ·example of what we're referring to when we say \"You need\n12· ·to provide therapeutic services in segregated or\n13· ·restricted housing units.\"\n14· · · Q.· So the market for your Stepping Up, Stepping Out\n15· ·Program is mental health professionals as opposed to\n16· ·correctional administrators?\n17· · · A.· Yes.\n18· · · Q.· And are you marketing actively to correctional --\n19· ·excuse me, are you marketing actively to mental health\n20· ·professionals the Stepping Up, Stepping Out Program?\n21· · · A.· What do you mean by \"marketing\"?· I'm not sending\n22· ·out fliers, I'm not emailing people.· I get contacted by\n23· ·people, and then I'll distribute whatever -- whatever\n24· ·they want or need, including that program.· It's never\n25· ·really been my practice to market, so I -- I would say,\n\n·1· ·no, I don't market it.\n·2· · · Q.· Do you know if correctional mental health\n·3· ·professionals receive the Corrections Today magazine?\n·4· · · A.· I don't know if they do or don't.\n·5· · · Q.· Do you?\n·6· · · A.· I do not.· I look at it -- if I can elaborate?\n·7· · · Q.· Yes, please.\n·8· · · A.· I look at it on occasion online to look at the\n·9· ·table of contents, but I don't -- I don't subscribe to\n10· ·the journal.\n11· · · Q.· Dr. Morgan, looking at page 4 of your CV staying\n12· ·under the Peer Reviewed Publications, I see the third\n13· ·listing from the top is \"Quantitative synthesis of the\n14· ·effects of administrative segregation on inmates while\n15· ·being published in psychology, public, policy and law.\"\n16· ·And would this be your 2016 meta-analysis study?\n17· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n18· · · Q.· Are there any other peer reviewed publications\n19· ·regarding administrative segregation in your CV?\n20· · · A.· No.\n21· · · Q.· The next section of your CV starting on page 9 is\n22· ·\"Books,\" correct?\n23· · · A.· Yes.\n24· · · Q.· And I've counted here 11 books that you have\n25· ·published.· The first one is listed as the \"Stepping Up,\n\n·1· ·Stepping Out, a mental health treatment program for\n·2· ·inmates in restrictive housing.\"· Is this the book that\n·3· ·we were just discussing that's currently in press?\n·4· · · A.· Yes, it is.\n·5· · · Q.· Can you describe the Stepping Up, Stepping Out\n·6· ·Program?\n·7· · · A.· Yes.· It's a modification of a comprehensive\n·8· ·treatment program for individuals with serious mental\n·9· ·illness that are in the justice system, changing life,\n10· ·changing outcomes.· That was a treatment program that I\n11· ·began developing in -- roughly around 2005, 2006 and was\n12· ·published in 2018.· That was for -- again, specifically\n13· ·for individuals with serious mental illness in\n14· ·corrections generally.\n15· · · · · · · ·And doing some -- some work with Correct\n16· ·Care at the time, who was working with the Kansas\n17· ·Department of Corrections, I was a consultant on some\n18· ·work they were doing around the issue of segregation.\n19· ·And through that work, it became clear that they needed\n20· ·a treatment program, or that the field needed a\n21· ·treatment program, so one of my students at the time,\n22· ·who's no longer a student, now a colleague, we modified\n23· ·changing lives, changing outcomes to fit for inmates in\n24· ·segregation.· So we changed the content a little bit to\n25· ·focus on both coping with segregation, but also changing\n\n·1· ·behaviors that results in ones being placed in\n·2· ·segregation.· So it was both treatment and\n·3· ·rehabilitation oriented.\n·4· · · · · · · ·And because of the nature of segregation, we\n·5· ·needed to develop a program that could be administered\n·6· ·with minimal therapeutic time in face-to-face work with\n·7· ·the client.· So it's largely a self-study by way of\n·8· ·format, but guided by a clinician.· That's the general\n·9· ·summary.\n10· · · Q.· And if I understand you correctly, this is a\n11· ·treatment program that is meant for prisoners to do\n12· ·inside of their cells while they're in segregation?\n13· · · A.· Yes, that's correct.\n14· · · Q.· In other words, it's not meant to be out-of-cell\n15· ·group therapy based?\n16· · · A.· We didn't design it that way.· It certainly could\n17· ·be structured that way, and the content most definitely\n18· ·would be relevant, but we didn't structure it that way.\n19· ·I wouldn't recommend against clinicians using the\n20· ·program in that manner.· It's just not how we structured\n21· ·it.\n22· · · Q.· Do you know how many prison systems are currently\n23· ·using this Stepping Up, Stepping Out Program?\n24· · · A.· I know of one, for sure, and my colleague Dr.\n25· ·Batastini is in discussions with others.· But I know of\n\n·1· ·one, for sure.\n·2· · · Q.· Which one is that?\n·3· · · A.· Missouri Department of Corrections.\n·4· · · Q.· Is your colleague Dr. Batastini the former\n·5· ·student you were referring to?\n·6· · · A.· Yes.\n·7· · · Q.· And where does Dr. Batastini work?\n·8· · · A.· She's at Southern Mississippi University.\n·9· · · Q.· And how is Dr. Batastini identifying other\n10· ·prisons to try and have them use your Stepping Up,\n11· ·Stepping Out Program?\n12· · ·

is that right?\n·5· · · A.· That was during my master's program.· That was\n·6· ·the first summer actually of my master's program.\n·7· · · Q.· Hence, your description of it as an internship?\n·8· · · A.· Correct.\n·9· · · Q.· And so were you working under the supervision of\n10· ·a psychologist at that time?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· And did your work at the federal prison in\n13· ·Leavenworth, Kansas involve working with people in\n14· ·segregation?\n15· · · A.· No.\n16· · · Q.· Then after you received your master's degree but\n17· ·before receiving your doctorate, you started working as\n18· ·a mental health professional in two state prisons in\n19· ·Kansas;

I\n20· ·would estimate an average of two to three years.\n21· · · Q.· Are you aware of any changes in El Dorado's use\n22· ·of segregation since you were there in 1992 to 1993?\n23· · · A.· Yes.\n24· · · Q.· And what are those changes?\n25· · · A.· They had made some changes prior to the\n\n·1· ·consultation work I did with Correct Care in 2013.· They\n·2· ·had implemented group therapy.· They were working to\n·3· ·reduce the segregation population.· They had changed the\n·4· ·structure of El Dorado as a facility with the priority\n·5· ·or emphasis on reducing segregation.· I don't know of\n·6· ·any changes in policy.\n·7· · · Q.· Do you agree that the El Dorado facility and the\n·8· ·Kansas Department of Corrections was attempting to limit\n·9· ·their reliance on segregation?\n10· · · A.· They were when I was contracting with Correct\n11· ·Care in 2013.\n12· · · Q.· Going back to the 1992 to 1993 period when you\n13· ·were working there, what percentage of the prisoners in\n14· ·the units you worked with had a serious mental illness?\n15· · · A.· I would estimate 20 to 30 percent.\n16· · · Q.· And how many suicides occurred in segregation\n17· ·during your tenure there?\n18· · · A.· None.\n19· · · Q.· And did you work in the short and long-term\n20· ·segregation units or just one of those?\n21· · · A.· I was the primary mental health person,\n22· ·professional, designated to the short-term.· I provided\n23· ·backup coverage in the long-term.\n24· · · Q.· How often were you actually working in the\n25· ·long-term segregation unit?\n\n·1· · · A.· Not that often.· I would say a few times a year.\n·2· · · Q.· And --\n·3· · · A.· No, it would be a little bit more than that.

FILLER:)· Dr. Morgan, right before the\n23· ·break, we were talking about your time working in the\n24· ·federal prison in Virginia as an intern during your\n25· ·doctoral studies, right?\n\n·1· · · A.· Yes.\n·2· · · Q.· And you described as part of one of your\n·3· ·rotations performing some mental health rounds in a\n·4· ·segregation unit; is that right?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.\n·6· · · Q.· And did you perform rounds on everyone in the\n·7· ·segregation unit or only those prisoners who were\n·8· ·already on a mental health caseload?\n·9· · · A.· No, when I did rounds, it was for everybody in\n10· ·the segregation unit.\n11· · · Q.· And was the goal of those rounds to identify\n12· ·prisoners who were deteriorating in segregation\n13· ·conditions?\n14· · · A.· It was to identify inmates that might be\n15· ·deteriorating, but also if they just had any general\n16· ·mental health needs that were going unmet or unattended\n17· ·to.\n18· · · Q.· So as I understand it, your work working in\n19· ·segregation units in prison was in Kansas between 1992\n20· ·and 1993 and in a federal prison in Virginia for a\n21· ·rotation between 1998 and 1999; is that right?\n22· · · A.· That -- yes, that's correct, and then consulting\n23· ·with Correct Care in 2013.· And then as part of my\n24· ·practice here when I do forensic mental health\n25· ·evaluations, many times they're at the jails and many\n\n·1· ·times it's with inmates in segregation.· So I've\n·2· ·evaluated a number of inmates that -- both male and\n·3· ·female that were placed in what would be considered\n·4· ·segregated housing.· But it was as a forensic mental\n·5· ·health evaluation, not as a person responsible for their\n·6· ·healthcare -- or mental healthcare.\n·7· · · Q.· And when you were consulting with Correct Care,\n·8· ·what was the nature of your work in the segregation\n·9· ·units?\n10· · · A.· I toured several segregation units and worked\n11· ·with Correct Care to design or to try to improve their\n12· ·mental health services within those units.\n13· · · Q.· Did you assess any prisoners who were in\n14· ·segregation?\n15· · · A.· I met with some inmates, a handful of inmates,\n16· ·and had opportunity to ask questions.· I wouldn't say --\n17· ·I didn't do an assessment of their functioning.· It was\n18· ·more asking and assessing the nature of segregation in\n19· ·that facility, their experience in segregation.· So it\n20· ·was more of a broad-based assessment.\n21· · · Q.· And forgive me, you've probably mentioned this,\n22· ·but what facility was that?\n23· · · A.· That would have been in Larned Correctional\n24· ·Facility in Larned, Kansas.· We also -- I also toured\n25· ·Lansing Correctional Facility in Leavenworth as part of\n\n·1· ·that work.· That would be it.\n·2· · · Q.· Is Larned a maximum security facility?\n·3· · · A.· That's a psychiatric and health designated.  I\n·4· ·believe it was a maximum security facility.· That's\n·5· ·where inmates that were having severe psychiatric\n·6· ·problems or, in some cases, severe health problems would\n·7· ·be transferred.\n·8· · · Q.· And they would be held in segregation?\n·9· · · A.· Some.\n10· · · Q.· What was the average stay in segregation at\n11· ·Larned?\n12· · · A.· I didn't work there, and I don't recall -- I\n13· ·don't recall a discussion of that nature, so I don't\n14· ·know.\n15· · · Q.· And when you met with people in segregation as\n16· ·part of your forensic mental health evaluations, did you\n17· ·say that would be in a jail setting?\n18· · · A.· Oh, yes, sorry.· Yes, that would be typically\n19· ·county jails.\n20· · · Q.· And would you agree that the length of stay in\n21· ·segregation in a jail is usually shorter than length of\n22· ·stay in a prison?\n23· · · A.· No, not necessarily.· No.\n24· · · Q.· No?· Why not?\n25· · · A.· In my experience doing these evaluations, I would\n\n·1· ·be evaluating inmates that were awaiting trial a couple\n·2· ·of years, and a significant portion, if not all of that,\n·3· ·might have been in segregation.· Segregation in jail for\n·4· ·a couple of years would be longer than some folks in\n·5· ·prisons.· It would be comparable to some inmates in\n·6· ·prisons, and it would be shorter than many inmates\n·7· ·serving segregation time in prisons.\n·8· · · · · · · ·Yeah, usually in my forensic mental health\n·9· ·work, if an inmate was in segregation they'd been there\n10· ·for a bit of time.\n11· · · Q.· And did that forensic mental health evaluation\n12· ·involve assessing the effect of segregation on their\n13· ·mental health?\n14· · · A.· They were forensic mental health evaluations for\n15· ·purposes of a legal matter.· It would include an\n16· ·assessment of mental health functioning, but not\n17· ·specific to the issue of segregation.\n18· · · Q.· And what we've just covered in terms of your work\n19· ·in prison facilities, is that the prison experience that\n20· ·you are relying on in giving opinions in this case?\n21· · · A.· Actually no, I'm missing a couple of key\n22· ·experiences.· My work on matters such as this.· So\n23· ·touring and meeting with inmates in Pelican Bay State\n24· ·Prison, touring facilities in Alabama, touring\n25· ·facilities in Canada, also interviewing inmates in\n\n·1· ·Canada.· Those experiences as well.\n·2· · · Q.· Let's talk about some of those cases then.\n·3· · · A.· Sure.\n·4· · · Q.· If you turn to Attachment B of your CV, I see\n·5· ·that you've listed cases where you've testified over the\n·6· ·past four years?\n·7· · · A.· Yes.\n·8· · · Q.· And several of these appear to pertain to\n·9· ·competency evaluations, such as we were discussing.· So\n10· ·State of Texas versus Rudolfo Gill and State of Texas\n11· ·versus Marcus Gonzales;

that Dr. Kupers did, in fact, consider\n14· ·the possibility that Jay might be exaggerating?\n15· · · A.· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· But you critique Dr. Kupers because in your view\n17· ·he didn't take

Yes.\n22· · · Q.· And you are not a psychiatrist?\n23· · · A.· Correct.\n24· · · Q.· And although there are areas where the practices\n25· ·of psychiatry and psychology overlap, they're not the\n\n·1· ·same, right?\n·2· · · A.· Correct.\n·3· · · Q.· And one area where it's different is that\n·4· ·psychologists, such as yourself, don't prescribe\n·5· ·psychiatric medication, right, as a general rule?\n·6· · · A.· As a general rule, yes.\n·7· · · Q.· And so if a psychologist thinks that psychiatric\n·8· ·medication is indicated for a patient, he'll typically\n·9· ·refer the patient to a psychiatrist, right?\n10· · · A.· Typically, yes.\n11· · · Q.· But only if they think that there's a need or a\n12· ·potential need for the medication, right?\n13· · · A.· Yes.\n14· · · Q.· Otherwise, there'd be no need for a referral to\n15· ·the psychiatrist, correct?\n16· · · A.· Correct.\n17· · · Q.· Another of the areas where there's a difference\n18· ·in practice is that psychiatrists don't administer\n19· ·psychological tests, right?\n20· · · A.· In general -- as a general rule of practice,\n21· ·correct.\n22· · · Q.· Otherwise, they're taking your job, right?\n23· · · A.· There would be that potential, yes.\n24· · · Q.· And is it your position that Dr. Kupers, even\n25· ·though he's a psychiatrist, should have administered a\n\n·1· ·psychological test to rule out malingering?\n·2· · · A.· Yes.\n·3· · · Q.· But he wouldn't do that himself, would he?\n·4· · · A.· It would be my opinion that anybody conducting\n·5· ·forensic examination seeks the appropriate training to\n·6· ·administer whatever method is needed to answer the\n·7· ·questions.· There are psychiatrists that can administer\n·8· ·malingering tests.· You just simply have to get the\n·9· ·appropriate training.\n10· · · Q.· Or he could --\n11· · · A.· Or refer it out.\n12· · · Q.· -- refer it to a psychologist who --\n13· · · A.· Yes.\n14· · · Q.· -- does that kind of evaluation for a living,\n15· ·right?\n16· · · A.· Sure, that would be another option, yes.\n17· · · Q.· But Dr. Kupers would only need to order\n18· ·psychological testing if there's an indication, right,\n19· ·an indication that psychological testing was needed?\n20· · · A.· Yes.\n21· · · Q.· Just like a psychologist referring a patient to a\n22· ·psychiatrist for medication, you do the referral only if\n23· ·there's an indication that it's needed?\n24· · · A.· Yes.\n25· · · Q.· Or like an ER doctor, right, you're not going to\n\n·1· ·just ask for a CAT scan unless there's an indication of\n·2· ·the CAT scan's necessity, correct?\n·3· · · A.· Yes.\n·4· · · Q.· And here, Dr. Kupers understood that as with any\n·5· ·time you evaluate someone they might be malingering,\n·6· ·right?\n·7· · · A.· I assume he did.\n·8· · · Q.· But he found no clinical evidence of that, and so\n·9· ·he didn't order psychological testing, right?\n10· · · A.· That's my understanding, yes.\n11· · · Q.· And there's nothing generally wrong with that\n12· ·approach, right?\n13· · · A.· In a non-forensic context?· No.\n14· · · Q.· So your opinion then is that anytime there's a\n15· ·legal case involved, there must be psychological\n16· ·testing?\n17· · · A.· No, absolutely not.\n18· · · Q.· So why don't you tell me the difference, because\n19· ·you just said in a forensic setting?\n20· · · A.· Sure.· When there's a case of disability or harm\n21· ·and a person is indicating harm because of the -- not\n22· ·only potential, but the benefit for feigning disability\n23· ·or harm, malingering should be a standard practice.\n24· · · Q.· And --\n25· · · A.· And not rely on our clinical judgment.\n\n·1· · · Q.· Okay.· So if I understand you correctly, whenever\n·2· ·there is a legal case where the person at issue stands\n·3· ·to benefit, has some interest in the outcome of the\n·4· ·case, then clinical judgment isn't enough?\n·5· · · A.· Yeah.· Generally speaking, yes, I would agree\n·6· ·with that.· When it's a forensic context, yes.\n·7· · · Q.· You -- your report relies on a discussion of this\n·8· ·issue, and we can pull it up in the report.· I believe\n·9· ·it's page 12.· You discuss the importance of ruling out\n10· ·malingering, and it's a text by the lead author Melton?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· Are you familiar --\n13· · · A.· That's a textbook, yes.\n14· · · Q.· Okay.· And let's look at

DICKMEYER:· Objection.· Form.· Asked and\n13· ·answered.\n14· · · · · · · ·THE WITNESS:· Correct.\n15· · · Q.· (BY MS.

them reliable,\n19· ·right?\n20· · · A.· Again, to me, he's describing the literature in\n21· ·his report.· I can see where, as you were saying\n22· ·earlier, he didn't rely on that in his ultimate

the same data as the Colorado study, right?\n11· · · A.· Correct.\n12· · · Q.· So the only one that I want to just flag as\n13· ·potentially new information that he omitted would be the\n14· ·Chadick

not know about all of these studies, right?\n24· · · A.· Correct.\n25· · · Q.· Your concern is more that what he's written in\n\n·1· ·his report in this case is just incomplete and missing\n·2· ·some of that?\n·3· · · A.· Yes.\n·4· · · Q.· What is a controlled study?\n·5· · · A.· A controlled study would be one where you\n·6· ·systematically manage as best you can the situations\n·7· ·around the experiment that you're conducting in a\n·8· ·pre-post design, so you would assess individuals before\n·9· ·whatever the issue at hand is.· Usually in my line of\n10· ·work, that would be an intervention of some sort, like\n11· ·segregation, and you would assess post and have a\n12· ·control group to compare responses from the treatment\n13· ·group to the control group.\n14· · · Q.· It's a method of research that's designed to\n15· ·measure the effect of a variable, right?\n16· · · A.· Well said.\n17· · · Q.· Variable or, in your term, intervention?\n18· · · A.· Yes.\n19· · · Q.· And the importance of having a control group is\n20· ·that it's not exposed to the variable and that way you\n21· ·can determine the effect of that variable, right?\n22· · · A.· That's the idea with the controlled study, yes.\n23· · · Q.· Is there a particular treatise or text that you\n24· ·would say is the most well accepted source for how to\n25· ·effectively design a controlled study?\n\n·1· · · A.· No, not that I'm aware of.\n·2· · · Q.· Have you personally performed controlled studies?\n·3· · · A.· Yes.\n·4· · · Q.· And which studies are those?\n·5· · · A.· I'll refer back to my curriculum vitae.· It would\n·6· ·be the studies looking at individuals with and without\n·7· ·mental illness that are justice involved.· There's a\n·8· ·series of studies and five or six publications.· It's\n·9· ·looking at comparing inmates in prison with mental\n10· ·illness to individuals and inmates without mental\n11· ·illness and individuals in community mental health\n12· ·settings, both that are and are not justice involved,\n13· ·for purposes of comparing who's going in and what's\n14· ·happening in terms of mental illness with justice\n15· ·involvement and what we need to do on the treatment end.\n16· ·So I can point you to those studies.· It's a series of\n17· ·studies.\n18· · · Q.· Thank you.· Yeah, if you could just tick them off\n19· ·and give us a page number?\n20· · · A.· Okay.· On page 4 of 29, second from the bottom,\n21· ·Gross and Morgan, 2013.· Top of the next page\n22· ·Bartholomew, et al.\n23· · · Q.· Sorry, I don't see -- oh, you were going\n24·

page 6, Wolff, Morgan, Shi, Fisher and\n·5· ·Huening, 2011.· And then Morgan and Fisher, et al also\n·6· ·on page 6, 2010.· So those were controlled studies, but\n·7· ·not of an intervention.· If -- for controlled studies of\n·8· ·an intervention, it would be McDonald, Morgan and Metz,\n·9· ·2016.\n10· · · Q.· Can you give me a page number?\n11· · · A.· On page 4.· McDonald and Morgan, 2013 on page 5.\n12· ·And that's -- the last one would be on page 9, Morgan,\n13· ·Winterowd and Fuqua in 1999.\n14· · · Q.· And so you've given us two categories of\n15· ·controlled studies, right, ones involving an\n16· ·intervention and ones without?\n17· · · A.· Yes.\n18· · · Q.· And the difference with an intervention, that the\n19· ·point is to be able to distill the specific effects of\n20· ·that intervention, right?\n21· · · A.· Yes.\n22· · · Q.· Do you hold yourself out as an expert in the\n23· ·design and execution of controlled studies?\n24· · · A.· No.\n25· · · Q.· Do you agree, though, that it's important that\n\n·1· ·controlled studies are, in fact, controlled?\n·2· · · A.· Yes.\n·3· · · Q.· And that it's important in performing controlled\n·4· ·studies to avoid contaminating the groups you're\n·5· ·studying?\n·6· · · A.· That's the ideal, yes.\n·7· · · Q.· And by \"contamination,\" I'm referring to exposing\n·8· ·the control group to the intervention that you're\n·9· ·attempting to measure?\n10· · · A.· Correct.\n11· · · Q.· And would you agree that contamination can\n12· ·invalidate a study's results?\n13· · · A.· It can.\n14· · · Q.· Do you agree that it's difficult to perform\n15· ·controlled studies in prison?\n16· · · A.· It certainly can be, yes.\n17· · · Q.· For example, you, as a researcher, cannot keep a\n18· ·prisoner in segregation if the prison says that prisoner\n19· ·doesn't need to be in segregation?\n20· · · A.· Correct.\n21· · · Q.· That would be unethical?\n22· · · A.· Yes, it would.\n23· · · Q.· And the research that's developed on solitary\n24· ·confinement has not, in fact, relied on control studies\n25· ·because of the difficulties in conducting such studies\n\n·1· ·in prison, right?\n·2· · · A.· Yes, that's one of the primary issues.\n·3· · · Q.· So let's talk about the Colorado study.· You've\n·4· ·described it as the gold standard, right?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.\n·6· · · Q.· The Colorado study studied prisoners in the\n·7· ·Colorado State Prison System, right?\n·8· · · A.· Yes.\n·9· · · Q.· There was no -- as the name suggests, no\n10· ·examination of prisoners outside of Colorado, right?\n11· · · A.· Correct.\n12· · · Q.· And the -- it was a longitudinal study, I\n13· ·understand?\n14· · · A.· Yes.\n15· · · Q.· And so the study lasted for about one year; is\n16· ·that right?\n17· · · A.· Yes.\n18· · · Q.· And the study did not involve clinical\n19· ·interviews, correct?\n20· · · A.· Correct.\n21· · · Q.· And there was no part of the study that looked at\n22· ·the medical records of the prisoners, right?\n23· · · A.· I believe they looked at the medical records but\n24· ·did not report that in the results.\n25· · · Q.· So the results of the Colorado study did not\n\n·1· ·include review of medical records?\n·2· · · A.· Correct.\n·3· · · Q.· The results of the Colorado study were solely\n·4· ·based on self-scoring from prisoners?\n·5· · · A.· Self-reporting.\n·6· · · Q.· Self-reporting on a written score card,\n·7· ·essentially?\n·8· · · A.· On a paper pencil test, yes.\n·9· · · Q.· And we talked earlier about peer review,\n10· ·remember?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· Feels like days ago.· And a peer review is one\n13· ·way to ensure that studies and research is of a\n14· ·reasonably high quality, right?\n15· · · A.· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· The Colorado study has not been published in a\n17· ·peer review journal, right?\n18· · · A.· Well, they published a smaller version.· Not the\n19· ·full report that they submitted to NIJ, but they\n20· ·published a more succinct version.\n21· · · Q.· This was Maureen O'Keefe's article?\n22· · · A.· Yes.\n23· · · Q.· But the actual study was published just as part\n24· ·of the grant that they had, right?\n25· · · A.· The 2010 document was part of the reporting\n\n·1· ·requirements for the grant.\n·2· · · Q.· And I believe if you refer to -- I think it was\n·3· ·Expert Exhibit 6, that big folder that you have there,\n·4· ·Dr. Morgan.· If you could just identify that the first\n·5· ·tab there is the 2010 report on the Colorado study?\n·6· · · A.· Yes.\n·7· · · Q.· I won't ask you to look anymore at it.· You can\n·8· ·put it to the side.· Just want to make sure we're\n·9· ·talking about the same thing.\n10· · · A.· Yes.\n11· · · Q.· Since the time the Colorado study came out, it\n12· ·has been subjected to heavy criticism; is that fair?\n13· · · A.· Yes.\n14· · · Q.· Can you describe the criticisms of the Colorado\n15· ·study, please?\n16· · · A.· Yeah, it's been criticized in terms of relying on\n17· ·self-report, contamination of the groups, inappropriate\n18· ·data collection via the individual collecting the data.\n19· ·There's a few others, but those are the big ones.\n20· · · Q.· Are you familiar with Dr. Craig Haney?\n21· · · A.· I am.\n22· · · Q.· I think we discussed earlier that you two have\n23· ·been on -- found yourselves on opposite sides before?\n24· · · A.· Yes.\n25· · · Q.· Would you agree, though, that Dr. Haney is one of\n\n·1· ·the prominent researchers on the effects of solitary\n·2· ·confinement?\n·3· · · A.· Yes, he's recognized as such.\n·4· · · Q.· And he is a vocal critic of the Colorado study,\n·5· ·correct?\n·6· · · A.· Yes, he is.\n·7· · · Q.· Are you familiar with Dr. Haney's 2018 article\n·8· ·entitled \"The Psychological Effects of Solitary\n·9·

just\n23· ·looked at, right?\n24· · · A.· And the 2012.· But the 2012 is really a summary\n25· ·of the 2010.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And are you aware that some of the people who\n·2· ·were involved in performing that study have since said\n·3· ·that it's been taken out of context?\n·4· · · A.· Yes.\n·5· · · Q.· Can you describe that -- their views on that\n·6· ·subject?\n·7· · · A.· Yeah, that some of the authors are concerned that\n·8· ·their study is being viewed as a validation of the use\n·9· ·of segregation, and that was not the intent, nor their\n10· ·conclusions.\n11· · · Q.· The most serious critique of the Colorado study\n12· ·is that there was fatal contamination of the control\n13· ·group, right?\n14· · · A.· I would agree.\n15· · · Q.· Because if that were true, there would be real\n16· ·questions as to whether the data had any value, right?\n17· · · A.· It certainly could, yes.\n18· · · Q.· And Dr. Haney in his 2018 article has said that\n19· ·every prisoner in the 2010 Colorado study had been\n20· ·exposed to a severe form of segregation right at the\n21· ·start immediately before the study began, right?\n22· · · A.· I don't remember exactly how he phrased it

-- I think I need to look at\n11· ·it to refresh my memory on the actual selection\n12· ·procedure.· But yeah, I reviewed it.\n13· · · Q.· So as I understand it, they looked at prisoners\n14· ·who were in the disciplinary process, and those\n15· ·prisoners would be held in a form of segregation, either\n16· ·awaiting the disciplinary hearing or after.· And then\n17· ·some prisoners would come out of those disciplinary\n18· ·hearings and go to general population, some prisoners\n19· ·would come out of that process and go to administrative\n20· ·segregation, and that's how they identified the groups.\n21· ·Does that sound right?\n22· · · A.· That -- that sounds right.\n23· · · Q.· So Dr. Haney's point in his 2018 article is that\n24· ·both of those groups would have been in segregation\n25· ·right before the study started then?\n\n·1· · · A.· Yes.\n·2· · · Q.· That's contaminating the samples?\n·3· · · A.· That's -- that would be his argument, yes.\n·4· · · Q.· And is that a fair criticism, in your view?\n·5· · · A.· I don't believe so.\n·6· · · Q.· Why not?\n·7· · · A.· Because, one, we're talking about pretty\n·8· ·short-term segregation potentially there, and the\n·9· ·authors, they looked at the issue of contamination, they\n10· ·compared the groups, and there was no difference in\n11· ·terms of folks that were contaminated versus those folks\n12· ·that were not contaminated.· I mean, they speak to that.\n13· ·They analyzed that data.· I understand what Dr. Haney is\n14· ·saying in terms of at the front end they're already\n15· ·contaminated.\n16· · · · · · · ·If -- if to look at it in that sense, every\n17· ·inmate coming into prison would essentially be\n18· ·contaminated, because at some point during the booking\n19· ·process they're isolated.· You can't take just every\n20· ·instance of isolation and say they're contaminated.\n21· ·Oftentimes, those periods of detention for disciplinary\n22· ·matters, it's brief.\n23· · · Q.· What would you describe as brief?\n24· · · A.· A couple days.\n25· · · Q.· If we look at page 383 of Dr. Haney's 2018\n\n·1· ·article, do you see that in this section, generally he's\n·2· ·describing this issue of the initial contamination\n·3· ·problem?\n·4· · · A.· Yes, I see it.\n·5· · · Q.· And on 382 in the second to last paragraph, he\n·6· ·says, quote, \"It is impossible to know whether or how\n·7· ·control group prisoners were damaged by the time spent\n·8· ·in punitive segregation and whether those effects\n·9· ·continued throughout the study,\" end quote.· Do you\n10· ·agree with that?\n11· · · A.· I don't agree with the basic premise.· Do I agree\n12· ·that -- that Dr. Haney could make the argument that that\n13· ·invalidates the study?· Sure.· But I don't agree that it\n14· ·does.· I don't believe that that contaminates the\n15· ·samples and the groups when looking at the conditions of\n16· ·long-term administrative segregation.· The psychiatric\n17· ·population, I don't know that we know they had the same\n18· ·level of contamination.· I'll have to -- I have to look\n19· ·at it.\n20· · · · · · · ·Again, they were choosing inmates from the\n21· ·psychiatric unit that had behavioral problems, but I\n22· ·don't know that they were in disciplinary segregation.\n23· ·I would have to review.\n24· · · Q.· So --\n25· · · A.· And if not --\n\n·1· · · Q.· So you're not familiar with whether in fact they\n·2· ·weren't in disciplinary segregation at the start of the\n·3· ·study?\n·4· · · A.· I don't recall that, yeah.· I'd have to review\n·5· ·the report and see.\n·6· · · Q.· And if you look at page 384 of Dr. Haney's\n·7· ·article, the bottom of that first paragraph.\n·8· · · A.· 384?\n·9· · · Q.· 384.· He says, \"A key table in the National\n10· ·Institute of Justice Report indicated that at the time\n11· ·of their first test interval participants had spent\n12· ·considerable average times in av -- other sec.· GPMI\n13· ·prisoners, 12.4 days.· GPNMI, 39.8 days.· ASMI, 88.9\n14· ·days.· ASNMI, 90.3 days.\"· Would you agree that those\n15· ·periods of time are not brief?\n16· · · A.· I would agree with that.\n17· · · Q.· And Dr. Haney's critique as to contamination was\n18· ·also that there was contamination during the one year\n19· ·period as well, right?\n20· · · A.· Correct.\n21· · · Q.· And that his criticism is that it's clear that\n22· ·prisoners in fact moved back and forth to segregation,\n23· ·general population and other types of housing?\n24· · · A.· Correct.\n25· · · Q.· In fact, he found that 52 of 76 general\n\n·1· ·population control group participants spent time in\n·2· ·segregation or other non-general population setting\n·3· ·during the study, roughly two-thirds of the group?\n·4· · · A.· Correct.\n·5· · · Q.· And he found that half of the administrative\n·6· ·segregation of prisoners, 60 -- about half, 62 of 127,\n·7· ·spent an unspecified period of time in general\n·8· ·population or elsewhere during the study?\n·9· · · A.· Yes, that was his finding.\n10· · · Q.· And the data that was aggregated by the Colorado\n11· ·researchers did not take into account the contamination?\n12· · · A.· They analyzed that data.\n13· · · Q.· How so?\n14· · · A.· See if I can find it.· It will take me a second\n15· ·to find it in the document.\n16· · · Q.· Sure.· Maybe I can restate the question, and if\n17· ·you'd like to look at it, that's just fine too.· But my\n18· ·understanding is that the data from the participants was\n19· ·aggregated whether or not there had been contamination.\n20· ·In other words, they didn't exclude the people who had\n21· ·cross-contamination --\n22· · · A.· Correct.\n23· · · Q.· -- from the aggregate data results?\n24· · · A.· Correct, they did not exclude.\n25· · · Q.· Another problem with the Colorado data is that\n\n·1· ·the Colorado system, the administrative segregation, had\n·2· ·at the time of the study three different quality of life\n·3· ·levels; is that right?\n·4· · · A.· Yes.\n·5· · · Q.· And at each quality of life level, there were\n·6· ·different privileges afforded prisoners, right?\n·7· · · A.· Yes.\n·8· · · Q.· And at level 3, prisoners in segregation could\n·9· ·have jobs?\n10· · · A.· Yes, that was my understanding.\n11· · · Q.· And would you agree that the ability to have a\n12· ·job outside of your cell is a substantive difference\n13· ·than the conditions of confinement?\n14· · · A.· Relative to not having a job and being confined\n15· ·to your cell?· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· And the -- we've talked this morning about some\n17· ·of the Canada cases regarding segregation, correct?\n18· · · A.· Yes.\n19· · · Q.· Are you aware that the case involving the\n20· ·Canadian Corporation of Canada Civil Liberties, CCLA\n21· ·Case --\n22· · · A.· CCLA.\n23· · · Q.· I'll say that back.· That the CCLA Case in fact\n24· ·rejected the Colorado study because of the quality of\n25· ·life levels issue?\n\n·1· · · A.· No, I hadn't read that in the -- in the judgment.\n·2· · · Q.· And when you included the Colorado study in your\n·3· ·meta-analyses in 2016, were you aware of these critiques\n·4· ·or did they post-date your work?\n·5· · · A.· Some of it post-dated, but some of it I was aware\n·6· ·of.\n·7· · · Q.· Were you specifically aware of the contamination\n·8· ·concerns?\n·9· · · A.· Yes, more so of the cross-contamination during\n10· ·the study than the critiques in his 2018 article\n11· ·regarding the pre-contamination.\n12· · · Q.· Are you aware that the Colorado Department of\n13· ·Corrections has since limited the use of segregation to\n14· ·15 days?\n15· · · A.· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· And do you agree that this indicates that the\n17· ·Colorado Department of Corrections, at least, doesn't\n18· ·take the findings of this study to mean that they should\n19· ·continue to hold people in segregation for years at a\n20· ·time?\n21· · · · · · · ·MR.

versus four\n17· ·years of solitary confinement?\n18· · · A.· We could.\n19· · · Q.· In your report, you opine that -- and this is\n20· ·your words, \"the use of restrictive housing, such as AS,\n21· ·will, on average, produce mild to moderate health and\n22· ·mental health effects comparable to the effects of\n23· ·incarceration as a general matter,\" end quote.· Is that\n24· ·correct?\n25· · · A.· That's correct.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And you've described that the harms that solitary\n·2· ·confinement can cause include anxiety, depression,\n·3· ·posttraumatic stress and somatoform complaints; is that\n·4· ·right?\n·5· · · A.· Yes.· So that's examples of some of the symptoms\n·6· ·that can occur.\n·7· · · Q.· There are more?\n·8· · · A.· Oh, yes.\n·9· · · Q.· Is mild to moderate health effects an average?\n10· · · A.· Can you phrase that differently?· I'm not sure\n11· ·I'm understanding.\n12· · · Q.· Sure.· So you've said that in your opinion use of\n13· ·restrictive housing will, on average, produce mild to\n14· ·moderate health and mental health effects.· So when you\n15· ·say \"average,\" I'm just asking some people have much\n16· ·worse than mild to moderate and some people have less\n17· ·than mild to moderate health effects; is that right?\n18· · · A.· Yes.· Yeah, that would be kind of the average\n19· ·that you can expect across the population.\n20· · · Q.· And, in fact, we assume that there are going to\n21· ·be more and less severe cases when we're looking at an\n22· ·average?\n23· · · A.· Statistically, that's what would happen, yes.\n24· · · Q.· So in your opinion, on average, prisoners in\n25· ·solitary suffer mild to moderate harm, but some can be\n\n·1· ·harmed less than the average and some more than the\n·2· ·average?\n·3· · · A.· Correct.\n·4· · · Q.· And regarding Mr. Vermillion, you have no basis\n·5· ·to make conclusions about where he falls in that\n·6· ·potential for harm?\n·7· · · A.· That's correct.\n·8· · · Q.· What do you consider mild to moderate mental\n·9· ·health effects?· And let me specify, I'm wondering if\n10· ·you're describing symptoms as to mild to moderate\n11· ·intensity or if you're referring to the effect sizes?\n12· · · A.· No, I'm referring to symptoms.\n13· · · Q.· Okay.\n14· · · A.· Yeah.\n15· · · Q.· And so how would you describe mild to moderate\n16· ·symptoms?\n17· · · A.· Mild to moderate would be if an individual was\n18· ·functioning well in general population and having no\n19· ·adverse reaction or symptoms, place them in segregation,\n20· ·if their mood was negatively impacted, became more\n21· ·lethargic, for example, and socially withdrew, that\n22· ·would be depending on the severity of those symptoms\n23· ·mild to moderate.· It could be severe.· So it depends on\n24· ·the severity and the impairment of function.\n25· · · Q.· And so that's what I'm trying to parse, that\n\n·1· ·severity question.· So let's talk about lethargy.· What\n·2· ·is mild lethargy, moderate lethargy and severe?\n·3· · · A.· Severe would be, \"I can't get out of bed.· I just\n·4· ·stay in bed all day and spend 23, 20\" -- or sorry, \"20,\n·5· ·21 hours a day in bed because I don't have the energy to\n·6· ·get up.· Even if I want to get up, I don't have the\n·7· ·energy.\"· That would be severe.· Mild would be, \"Yeah,\n·8· ·I'm not doing as well as I was yesterday.· I went to\n·9· ·rec, but instead of running around, I just kind of\n10· ·walked around.· I just wasn't feeling as good.\"· And\n11· ·moderate would be somewhere in between.\n12· · · Q.· And so then as I understand it, you agree that\n13· ·there are negative mental health symptoms associated\n14· ·with spending time in segregation?· Your point is just\n15· ·that there's a range of severity?\n16· · · A.· That's one of them, yes.· Yeah, on average, your\n17· ·average inmate is going to have some negative\n18· ·experiences while -- when placed in segregation.· It's\n19· ·an issue of severity.· So to that point, yes.\n20· · · Q.· And how would you distinguish mild, moderate or\n21· ·severe feelings of suicidality?\n22· · · A.· Clinically, I would be looking at -- there's\n23· ·indicators of suicide.· Is there a plan?· Is there an\n24· ·intent?· Is there access to -- to whatever the plan\n25· ·would be?· Is there a history?· The more indicators, the\n\n·1· ·more severe the risk.· The fewer the indicators, \"I wish\n·2· ·I were dead, but I don't have a plan to kill myself,\"\n·3· ·that's lower risk.· Then somebody who, \"I want to die,\n·4· ·here's how I would do it, so I have a plan,\" and they\n·5· ·could actually carry the plan out in their current\n·6· ·situation, that's higher risk.\n·7· · · Q.· So let me -- I think we're -- I probably got us\n·8· ·off track, because now we're talking about risk of\n·9· ·actually committing suicide.· And I think it would be\n10· ·maybe more probative to talk about depression or\n11· ·hopelessness.\n12· · · A.· Okay.\n13· · · Q.· And so how do we establish if depression is mild,\n14· ·moderate or severe?\n15· · · A.· You can assess via clinical interview, you can\n16· ·assess through behavioral observations, you can assess\n17· ·with a measure.· There's different ways to get at it.\n18· ·Collateral information can enlighten the clinical\n19· ·interpretation.· There's a number of ways to get at\n20· ·that.\n21· · · Q.· And so if a prisoner reported that he wanted to\n22· ·die, would that be mild, moderate or severe depression?\n23· · · A.· No one indicator, no one symptom is going to\n24· ·determine how we would classify a risk level or a\n25· ·severity.· It's looking at a cluster of symptoms.· So\n\n·1· ·when looking at depression, for example, I'm looking at\n·2· ·is there suicidal ideation, but I'm also looking at that\n·3· ·energy level, level of lethargy, lethargic sort of\n·4· ·behaviors that we're talking about, engagement in social\n·5· ·activities or social withdrawal, engaging in activities\n·6· ·that they usually find pleasurable.· So reading, are\n·7· ·they still reading if they like to read, things like\n·8· ·that.· It's looking at the cluster of symptoms that go\n·9· ·to a construct like

FILLER:)· And just as a precursor\n·7· ·question, Dr. Morgan, I take it that from what you've\n·8· ·just said in your work on this case, you didn't perform\n·9· ·an assessment as to whether the symptoms that Dr. Kupers\n10· ·identified as Mr. Vermillion having experienced whether\n11· ·those were low, mild, moderate or severe effects?\n12· · · A.· No, I did not.\n13· · · Q.· Okay.· And so you've just been passed Expert\n14· ·Exhibit 18.· If you look at page 28, there's a section\n15· ·\"Psychological and Physiological Response to Solitary\n16· ·Confinement\" that might be helpful.· I can just point\n17· ·out that he describes having heart palpitations, being\n18· ·nervous and anxious the entire time he was in solitary,\n19· ·that he felt very strong anxiety and depression, that he\n20· ·considered suicide quite a lot and tried to hang himself\n21· ·with a towel, but decided against it because of his\n22· ·Christianity.· That he would get enraged and start\n23· ·kicking his door.· That he would then collapse, feel\n24· ·anxious and worried.\n25· · · A.· Yeah.· Based on what I'm reading there -- again,\n\n·1· ·to truly give an opinion as to Mr. Vermillion's mental\n·2· ·state, I would have to do my own assessment.· But based\n·3· ·on what Dr. Kupers is reporting, I'd say moderate to\n·4· ·maybe severe.\n·5· · · Q.· And he also describes, \"quite a lot of obsessive\n·6· ·thinking and compulsive activity beginning only after he\n·7· ·entered solitary in 2009.· Shaving his eyebrows and\n·8· ·plucking his eye lashes, changing his appearance.· That\n·9· ·he was compulsive about ants and bugs on the floor, and\n10· ·as he explains this to me, he physically gets down on\n11· ·the floor and looks around for signs of vermin.· He\n12· ·became quite compulsive about everything in his\n13· ·environment being in its right place.\"\n14· · · · · · · ·And he also goes onto describe how \"he is\n15· ·since leaving segregation much more withdrawn, doesn't\n16· ·go to chow hall, would prefer to eat alone.\"· Does that\n17· ·-- does that sound like the kind of functional\n18· ·impairment that you were mentioning earlier?\n19· · · A.· Yeah, it could be, yeah.· That's the kind of\n20· ·thing I would be looking for, yes.\n21· · · Q.· And so understanding that I'm not asking about\n22· ·your own evaluation of Mr. Vermillion because you didn't\n23· ·do one in this case, but based on what Dr. Kupers is\n24· ·reporting, would you agree that these are moderate to\n25· ·severe effects of solitary?\n\n·1· · · · · · · ·MR. DICKMEYER:· Objection.· Form.\n·2· · · Q.· (BY MS. FILLER:)· I believe that's what you\n·3· ·testified to a moment ago.· I'm just trying to make sure\n·4· ·I understand.\n·5· · · A.· Yeah, with the caveat that if the data is valid\n·6· ·that Mr. Vermillion would be suffering psychological\n·7· ·symptoms in the moderate to severe range, I would agree\n·8· ·with that.· Whether it's attributable to segregation, I\n·9· ·don't know.\n10· · · Q.· And again, these are the kinds of symptoms that\n11· ·have been reported as the kinds of symptoms you see from\n12· ·people who have been in segregation for a long time?\n13· · · A.· Yes.\n14· · · Q.· And so going back to this opinion that you've\n15· ·offered, \"That the use of restrictive housing will on\n16· ·average produce mild to moderate health and mental\n17· ·health effects comparable to the effects of\n18· ·incarceration as a general matter,\" the point there is\n19· ·that you're establishing a comparison to just being in\n20· ·prison?\n21· · · A.· Correct.\n22· · · Q.· And what are the sources that you're relying on\n23· ·for that aspect of your opinion?\n24· · · A.· My knowledge of the research and clinical\n25· ·experience.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And so in your report, you have a bar graph which\n·2· ·purports to show that this is the case, correct?\n·3· · · A.· It provides data to support that, yes.\n·4· · · Q.· And so if you could look at page 10 of your\n·5· ·report for a moment?\n·6· · · A.· Yes.\n·7· · · Q.· You have a \"Figure 1, Administrative Segregation\n·8· ·versus General Incarceration Effect Size Estimates.\"\n·9· ·The lightly shaded bars are effect sizes from the\n10· ·meta-analyses that we were talking about earlier,\n11· ·correct?\n12· · · A.· Specifically my Research Synthesis 2.\n13· · · Q.· That was my next question, so thank you.· And\n14· ·then the dark bar is from the -- a Bonta and Gendreau\n15· ·study from 1990; is that right?\n16· · · A.· Correct.\n17· · · Q.· And the point here, as I understand it, is that\n18· ·the general incarceration -- effect of general\n19· ·incarceration on psychological well-being is about .44?\n20· · · A.· Correct.\n21· · · Q.· And that would be a moderate effect size, right?\n22· · · A.· Yes.\n23· · · Q.· Is .5 generally considered moderate?\n24· · · A.· Yeah, with the type of effects as we had here,\n25· ·yes.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And so your point is that that is not so\n·2· ·different from the effect sizes that you've identified\n·3· ·in your RS-2 study?\n·4· · · A.· Correct.\n·5· · · Q.· So for example, mood and emotion in RS-2 had an\n·6· ·effect size of .55?\n·7· · · A.· Right.\n·8· · · Q.· Which is a moderate effect?\n·9· · · A.· Right.\n10· · · Q.· Which would indicate that people in segregation\n11· ·had negative effects on their mood or emotion?\n12· · · A.· Correct.\n13· · · Q.· And then your -- and that is itself derived from\n14· ·comparing populations in segregation to populations in\n15· ·general population?\n16· · · A.· Correct.\n17· · · Q.· And then you're comparing that to a study from\n18· ·Bonta and Gendreau, a totally different study that\n19· ·wasn't included in your meta-analyses?\n20· · · A.· Right.\n21· · · Q.· The Bonta and Gendreau study, that study was a\n22· ·study of the effects of overcrowded prisons on\n23· ·prisoners' psychological well-being, right?\n24· · · A.· That was one aspect of it, yes.· They looked at a\n25· ·few variables, but the effect size I pulled there was\n\n·1· ·from the overcrowding data.\n·2· · · Q.· So what their goal was in establishing this\n·3· ·effect size was to isolate a variable, right?\n·4· · · A.· Yes.\n·5· · · Q.· And the variable in that study was overcrowded\n·6· ·prisons?\n·7· · · A.· Correct.\n·8· · · Q.· Which some prisons are overcrowded, but not all\n·9· ·prisons are overcrowded?\n10· · · A.· Right.\n11· · · Q.· So we're comparing the effect sizes of the harms\n12· ·of segregation to the effect sizes of the harms of\n13· ·living in an overcrowded prison?\n14· · · A.· That would be fair.\n15· · · Q.· And I noticed when I was reviewing your report in\n16· ·the CCLA Case that you included a similar bar graph in\n17· ·that case report?\n18· · · A.· Yes.\n19· · · Q.· Do you recall submitting that report?\n20· · · A.· Yes.\n21· · · Q.· And that bar graph had another bar from a\n22· ·different study for physical health?\n23· · · A.· Right.\n24· · · Q.· And that bar was referencing the Heigel study,\n25· ·correct?\n\n·1· · · A.· Correct.\n·2· · · Q.· And that is at tab 3 of the big compendium here,\n·3· ·Expert Exhibit 5 -- no, Expert Exhibit 6.· Should be the\n·4· ·third tab there (indicating).\n·5· · · A.· Oh, there we go.\n·6· · · Q.· Can you read the Bates number there for us?\n·7· · · A.· The number at the bottom?· Vermillion?\n·8· · · Q.· Uh-huh.\n·9· · · A.· 003571.\n10· · · Q.· Thank you.· And do you mind also referring back\n11· ·to the report that you prepared for the CCLA Case?· It\n12· ·was Expert Exhibit 4.· I know I told you to not worry\n13· ·about the order, but -- there you go.\n14· · · A.· There (indicating).\n15· · · Q.· Thank you.· So the bar chart that you submitted\n16· ·in that case is at Vermillion 4130.· Do you have it\n17· ·there?\n18· · · A.· Yes, I have it.\n19· · · Q.· And so here you have your RS-1 effect sizes, the\n20· ·Bonta and Gendreau effect size regarding overcrowding,\n21· ·and then you had the Heigel 2010 study, which showed\n22· ·.18, right?\n23· · · A.· Right.\n24· · · Q.· And the Heigel bar was representing physical\n25· ·health, correct?\n\n·1· · · A.· Correct.\n·2· · · Q.· And did you later learn that there was an error\n·3· ·in the inclusion of this bar?\n·4· · · A.· Yes, had a computational error.\n·5· · · Q.· Okay.· Can you describe that computational error?\n·6· · · A.· I had inverted -- I forget the exact data point\n·7· ·or what, but I had it inverted.\n·8· · · Q.· So as I understand, and you can tell me if this\n·9· ·sounds right, but in this case you had looked at the\n10· ·Heigel study, which measured physical health and given\n11· ·it a negative effect size of .18 -- or negative is maybe\n12· ·not the correct term, but negative health outcomes were\n13· ·associated with general incarceration at a .18 effect\n14· ·size?\n15· · · A.· Right.· Right.\n16· · · Q.· And that actually, that was a mistake and it\n17· ·should have been negative .18?\n18· · · A.· Yes, they improved in terms of their physical\n19· ·health functioning.\n20· · · Q.· And so when we compare that study's effect size\n21· ·to, for example, your chart here of physical health,\n22· ·which is .37 effect size from your study, that would\n23· ·tend to show that there was a major difference in the\n24· ·physical health of prisoners in segregation as opposed\n25· ·to the physical health of prisoners in general\n\n·1· ·population?\n·2· · · A.· Yeah, except this was prisoners in jail, inmates\n·3· ·in jail, so it was a different setting.· But yes.\n·4· · · Q.· Well, I mean, you included it here because you\n·5· ·thought that there --\n·6· · · A.· Yeah, of course.\n·7· · · Q.· -- was value in comparing them?\n·8· · · A.· Yeah, of course.\n·9· · · Q.· And so I'm curious as to why you didn't include\n10· ·this in your report in our case?\n11· · · A.· Because I didn't want to have to deal with the\n12· ·issue of a computational error for one, and it seemed\n13· ·less relevant at that point.\n14· · · Q.· Well, I assume that you would have fixed the\n15· ·error in this case once you realized it.· And so my\n16· ·question is, why not show in your report that, you know,\n17· ·actually for physical health your study and your\n18· ·comparison would show that prisoners on average are\n19· ·effected in terms of their physical health by\n20· ·segregation?\n21· · · A.· Sure.\n22· · · · ·

FILLER:)· Dr. Morgan you've just been\n13· ·passed Exhibit 19.· Is this the Chadick study that we've\n14· ·been discussing?\n15· · · A.· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· And if I could draw your attention to Vermillion\n17· ·4533, please?\n18· · · A.· Yes.\n19· · · Q.· And under \"Results,\" do you see where there was a\n20· ·significant effect on housing location on the scores for\n21· ·the measures that I've just indicated?\n22· · · A.· Yes.\n23· · · Q.· And this article, the Chadick piece, also\n24· ·recommends a series of interventions or best practices,\n25· ·correct?\n\n·1· · · A.· Yes, we did.\n·2· · · Q.· And one of them is the Stepping Up, Stepping Out\n·3· ·Program that you yourself developed?\n·4· · · A.· Yes, we included that simply as an example of\n·5· ·something that somebody might use in intervening.\n·6· · · Q.· I want to make sure that I understand your\n·7· ·criticism of Mr. Pacholke's report, if I could?\n·8· · · A.· Yes.\n·9· · · Q.· Mr. Pacholke, you understand that he's a longtime\n10· ·corrections professional, right?\n11· · · A.· Yes.\n12· · · Q.· And your work in corrections has always been in\n13· ·the mental health sector, right?\n14· · · A.· That's correct.\n15· · · Q.· You have not worked as a prison administrator or\n16· ·a prison official, correct?\n17· · · A.· Correct.\n18· · · Q.· And I take it you do not hold yourself out as an\n19· ·expert in correctional practices?\n20· · · A.· Correct.\n21· · · Q.· And your criticism of Mr. Pacholke is that he\n22· ·says prison administrators should have let Mr.\n23· ·Vermillion participate in a stepdown program.· Because\n24· ·you say it's an unfair criticism, stepdown programs\n25· ·weren't best practices at the relevant period?\n\n·1· · · A.· That rehabilitation as a practice for altering\n·2· ·inmate behavior in ways that would help them stay out of\n·3· ·segregation wasn't commonly recognized as a -- as a\n·4· ·practice within segregation.\n·5· · · Q.· But you agree --\n·6· · · A.· At that time, yeah.\n·7· · · Q.· But you agree that prisoners in segregation\n·8· ·should be given incentives to improve their behavior and\n·9· ·leave segregation?\n10· · · A.· I do.\n11· · · Q.· And you agree that there should be a clear\n12· ·pathway for them to work their way out of segregation?\n13· · · A.· I do.\n14· · · Q.· So your problem with Mr. Pacholke's conclusions\n15· ·is that you don't agree it was the best practice or the\n16· ·common practice as of 2009 to 2013 when Mr. Vermillion\n17· ·was himself in segregation?\n18· · · A.· Correct.\n19· · · · · · · ·MR. DICKMEYER:· Objection.· Form.\n20· · · Q.· (BY MS. FILLER:)· Are you familiar with the Act\n21· ·Program in the Indiana Department of Corrections?\n22· · · A.· No.\n23· · · Q.· I'll represent to you that Gary Brennan, who is a\n24· ·Defendant in this case, testified that he developed the\n25· ·Act Program as a way for prisoners in segregation to\n\n·1· ·stepdown from segregation.· Did you have that\n·2· ·information when you expressed your criticism of Mr.\n·3· ·Pacholke's conclusion?\n·4· · · A.· No.\n·5· · · Q.· And were you aware that Mr. Brennan developed the\n·6· ·Act Program for Indiana after he had observed a similar\n·7· ·program in Colorado?\n·8· · · A.· No.\n·9· · · Q.· And I don't know what the program was\n10· ·specifically that he observed in Colorado, but seems\n11· ·like it's possible it's that quality of life privileges\n12· ·model that we discussed earlier, because we know that\n13· ·Colorado did, in fact, have some kind of incentive-based\n14· ·program at the time of the Colorado study, right?\n15· · · A.· Yes, they did in Colorado.\n16· · · Q.· And the Colorado study came out in 2010, right?\n17· · · A.· Right.\n18· · · Q.· So at least if you -- if you accept for a moment\n19· ·my representation regarding what Mr. Brennan testified\n20· ·to, then you'd agree that Indiana and Colorado, at\n21· ·least, had stepdown incentive-based programs at the\n22· ·relevant period?\n23· · · A.· Yeah, based on what you're telling me, yes.\n24· · · · · · · ·MS.

FILLER:· Nope.· Thank you.\n14· · · Q.· (BY MS. FILLER:)· You criticized Dr. Kupers for\n15· ·referring to SHU Post-Release Syndrome; is that right?\n16· · · A.· Yes.\n17· · · Q.· And as I understand it, your criticism is that\n18· ·this isn't a official diagnosis in the DSM, right?\n19· · · A.· Well, that it's not an official diagnosis and not\n20· ·a scientifically accepted syndrome.\n21· · · Q.· Do you agree that the symptoms that he describes\n22· ·are, in fact, symptoms that have been associated with\n23· ·people after they've been released from long-term\n24· ·solitary?\n25· · · A.· I do.\n\n·1· · · Q.· And you've described in your report an anonymous\n·2· ·prisoner.· You call him, I think, Prisoner A?\n·3· · · A.· Yes.\n·4· · · Q.· And I've reviewed a few of your reports in other\n·5· ·cases now, and I feel like I've seen that description\n·6· ·also attributed to a prisoner named Jonathan?\n·7· · · A.· Yes.\n·8· · · Q.· And is that just the same person but a different\n·9· ·way of anonymizing the prisoner for purposes of\n10· ·confidentiality?\n11· · · A.· That's correct.\n12· · · Q.· And I read in one of the depositions, I believe,\n13· ·that Jonathan, or Prisoner A, was a real prisoner who\n14· ·you evaluated in Pelican Bay?\n15· · · A.· Correct.\n16· · · Q.· And how many prisoners did you evaluate in\n17· ·Pelican Bay again?\n18· · · A.· Somewhere between 40 and 50.\n19· · · Q.· And was Jonathan the only prisoner who -- well,\n20· ·strike that.· Some prisoners, I assume, from that sample\n21· ·described negative mental health effects from\n22· ·segregation?\n23· · · A.· Correct.\n24· · · Q.· And some of those negative mental health effects\n25· ·were severe, some were moderate, and Jonathan would have\n\n·1· ·been in the low end?\n·2· · · A.· Yes.\n·3· · · Q.· Was Jonathan the prisoner who had the least\n·4· ·negative effects from segregation?\n·5· · · A.· I don't recall specifically.· He was not one of\n·6· ·the class members named.· And relative to them, yes.\n·7· ·Relative to the others, I would need to go back and look\n·8· ·at my -- my notes on that.\n·9· · · Q.· One moment.· I see you've already got it?\n10· · · A.· Yes.\n11· · · Q.· Expert Exhibit 5, which is the deposition, or as\n12· ·the Canadians call it, cross-examination transcripts,\n13· ·from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the CCLA\n14· ·Case?\n15· · · A.· Yes.\n16· · · Q.· And if I could draw your attention to Vermillion\n17· ·4341, which is page --\n18· · · A.· I'm there.\n19· · · Q.· Okay.· And you were asked at line 13, quote, \"Dr.\n20· ·Morgan, how does Jonathan, the Jonathan example, relate\n21· ·to the other 150 you interviewed?\"· Answer, \"And just to\n22· ·be clear, it was approximately 150.· I don't recall the\n23· ·exact number, somewhere around 130 to 150.· Jonathan\n24· ·reported less concerns.\"· And then goes on to say on the\n25· ·next page that essentially, \"He expressed no concerns\n\n·1· ·and no significant distress, whereas the majority of\n·2· ·other inmates I interviewed expressed distress and\n·3· ·concern resulting from their segregation placement.\"\n·4· ·Does that refresh your recollection some?\n·5· · · A.· Yes, it does.· Yeah.\n·6· · · Q.· And is this deposition testimony that you gave in\n·7· ·the CCLA Case regarding Jonathan accurate?\n·8· · · A.· Yes, it's accurate.\n·9· · · · · · · ·MS.

FACTS: \n1.  On Sunday, July 12,2009, three (3) men with whom Vermillion was circumstantially \n2 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 3 of 44 PageID #: 475\nassociated escaped from the Indiana State Prison, (hereinafter ISP), which is located in \nMichigan City, Indiana. And, because said escape was from the same housing unit in \nwhich all Indiana Death Row Inmates are housed, authorities from numerous \ninvestigative agency converged upon the ISP, including those from the Internal Affairs \nDivision of the IDOC Central Office, which is located in Indianapolis, Indiana. \n2.  By July 22, 2009, all three men were apprehended without incident. However, because \nof their continuing investigation of the matter, at approximately 8:40AM on \nWednesday, July 29,2009, Vermillion was taken to the ISP's office of Internal Affairs, \nwhere he then sat in the outer-office for approximately a half an hour waiting his turn \nto be questioned. \n3.  Thereafter, at approximately 9:15AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Internal \nAffairs Investigators Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan introduced \nthemselves; advised that all three were digitally-recording the conversation; and \ninformed Vermillion that they believed he was involved in said escape, and some \ntrafficking related thereto. \n4.  At approximately 9:22AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Willard Plank, \nDawn Buss, and Charles Whelan informed Vermillion that for his alleged involvement \nin said offense(s), they were going to have criminal charges filed against him. \n5.  As such, at approximately 9:25AM on the same Wednesday, July 29,2009, Vermillion \nthen exercised his constitutionally protected right to terminate their questioning of \nhim so that hls answers to their questions could not thereafter be used to incriminate \nhim in the criminal action they said they were going to file. \n3 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 4 of 44 PageID #: 476\n6.  Immediately subsequent to his having engaged in the constitutionally protected \nactivity of terminating the defendants' questioning of him, Vermillion was then \npunished -retaliated against- which said punishment/ retaliation, from start to finish, \nspanned the course of the next fifty (50) months, (1,513 days), as follows: \n7.  At 9:33AM on the same Wednesday, July 29, 2009, Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, and \nCharles Whelan had Vermillion escorted from their office and placed in IDU, which is \nthe facility's punitive segregation unit. \n8.  On July 31, 2009, despite there being absolutely no possibility of it being true, Internal \nAffairs Investigator Ralph Carrasco prepared a Conduct Report, thereby charging that \nVermillion had engaged in the offense of \"trafficking\" with ISP Counselor \"Don \nBates\" in \"ICH\"1 at \"9:30AM\" on \"July 29, 2009.\" \n9.  On August 4, 2009, while \"screening\" him for said trafficking offense, ISP Screening \nOfficer Dawn Walker advised Vermillion that statements from Willard Plank, Dawn \nBuss, Charles Whelan, Karen Sabinski and Kevin Springfield would enable him to \nsubstantiate his whereabouts at the time of the alleged misconduct, and further \nadvised that she would assist him with the acquisition of the same. \n10.  On or about August 6, 2009, however, Ms. Walker sent Vermillion's proposed \nwitnesses \"blank\" witness statement forms, and provided them with absolutely no \nindication of the testimony he expected of them. \n11.  On or about the same August 6, 2009, ISP DHB Chairman Bessie Leonard advised \nICH is the abbreviation for I-Cellhouse, which was the Honor Housing Unit in which Vermillion \nresided until 8:40AM on Wednesday, July 29, 2009. \n4 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 5 of 44 PageID #: 477\nVermillion that his hearing for said trafficking charge would not occur until \napproximately seven (7) days after the facility was no longer on lockdown. \n12.  On August 12, 2009, however, (with the facility still on lockdown), in proceedings in \nwhich he was denied sufficient written notice of the charge; denied the opportunity to \ncall witnesses and present evidence; denied consideration of exculpatory evidence; \ndenied the requisite indicia of reliability for the utilization of confidential sources; \ndenied a decision properly supported by \"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that \nhe clearly could not have been trafficking with Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the \nsame time he was being interrogated by Internal Affairs, ISP DHB Chairman Bessie· \nLeonard found Vermillion guilty as charged. \n13.  On the same August 12, 2009, despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the maximum \nallowable sanction, Ms. Leonard sentenced Vermillion to one (1) year in disciplinary \nsegregation; took thirty (30) days of his earned good time credit; and demoted him \nfrom Credit Earning Class I to Credit Earning Class II. \n14.  On the same August 12, 2009, within approximately one (1) hour of the above-stated \npretextual guilty adjudication and sanctioning, and without any notice, reason, or \nopportunity for rebuttal, Vermillion was escorted to the ISP's North Gate, where the \ngood majority of his personal effects and a running dark-blue Chrysler minivan were \nwaiting to whisk him away to the WCU Super Max facility. \n15.  On or about the same August 12, 2009, WCU Case Counselor Sally Nowatzke and \nWCU Director of Operations Gary Brennan then falsified information and \ndocumentation to increase Vermillion's Security Classification Designation so that he \n5 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 6 of 44 PageID #: 478\ncould be housed at said Super Max facility. \n16.  On the same August 12,2009, Vermillion was then committed to the WCU Housing \nUnit, (i.e. C Pod, a.k.a. \"The Loony Bin\"), wherein all of the psychotic, out-of-control, \nand unmanageable worst-of-the-worst are kept in\" cold-storage\" to induce dormancy. \n17.  And, for the next three and a half (31/z) years, Vermillion was then subjected to \ncomplete isolation in a solid concrete tomb with a solid steel door for 23-24 hours a \nday; no direct contact or interaction with others; extreme cold; constant strobe \nlighting; cell-flooding; Mace fumes; people threatening to, and in fact actually \ncommitting suicide; no actual \"recreation;\" no telephone use (for 21/z years); no work, \nincome, or educational opportunities; no religious services; no hot water; cold meals; \nregular cell ransacking; and humiliating strip-searches. \n18.  In the meantime, on September 15, 2009, despite his knowledge that the above \ndescribed \"trafficking offense\" of July 29, 2009, could not have occurred and that the \ndisciplinary proceedings of August 12, 2009, were a sham and constitutionally infirm, \nSuperintendent Mark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively \napproved, condoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n19.  On September 16, 2009, despite having been called upon to remedy Vermillion's illegal \nretaliatory segregation, WCU Classification Director Larry Warg instead approved, \ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n20.  On October 8, 2009, despite his knowledge that the above-described disciplinary \nproceedings of August 12, 2009, were constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing \nAuthority Charles Penfold affirmed the same on appeal, thereby effectively \n6 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 7 of 44 PageID #: 479\napproving, condoning, and turning a blind eye to it. \n21.  On October 16, 2009, ISP Administrative Assistant Howard Morton intercepted \nVermillion's \"Certified Mail\" containing proposed Affidavits for his witnesses, and \nthereafter advised: \" ... staff will not be signing any affidavits for you.\" \n22.  On October 22,2009, without any notice, reason, or opportunity for rebuttal, IDOC \nDeputy Director of Operations Brett Mize relegated Vermillion to Department-Wide \nAdministrative Segregation. \n23.  On the same October 22,2009, WCU Property Officer Craig Travis confiscated all of \nVermillion's \"PersonalProperty Inventory Lists/' and WCF Property Officers \nErnestine Cole and Celia Bobson then \"lost\" approximately 99.9% of his personal \nbelongings. (See Tort Notice WCC 2009-101, attached hereto, here incorporated by \nreference, and made a part hereof.) \n24.  On November 10,2009, despite his knowledge of, and participation in Vermillion's \nretaliatory and constitutionally infirm classification and segregation, Superintendent \nMark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n25.  On four (4) different occasions between November 10, and December 17,2009, despite \nhis knowledge of, and participation in Vermillion's retaliatory segregation, IDOC \nDeputy Director of Operations Brett Mize refused to acknowledge and/ or act on \nVermillion's repeated requests for relief. \n26.  On January 20, 2010, in furtherance of their retaliatory aggression, WCU Director of \nOperations Gary Brennan ordered the confiscation and destruction of Vermillion's \n7 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 8 of 44 PageID #: 480\ntelevision. (See Tort Notice WCC 16-2010, attached hereto, here incorporated by \nreference, and made a part hereof.) \n27.  On January 30, 2010, in furtherance of their retaliatory aggression, WCU Director of \nOperations Gary Brennan ordered the ransacking of Vermillion's cell and destruction \nof his personal effects. (See Tort Notice WCC 18-2010, attached hereto, here \nincorporated by reference, and made a part hereof.) \n28.  On April7, 2010, in an effort to obtain relief from Mr. Penfold's deliberately flawed \nfinal review decision of October 8, 2009, Vermillion filed his Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:10-CV-119-PPS. \n29.  On August 31, 2010, however, despite his prior conclusion that there were no \nprocedural defects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings of August 12, \n2009, that would entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with attorney \nLinda Leonard, Mr. Penfold issued an unsolicited\" second opinion\" thereby vacating \nthe disciplinary conviction of August 12, 2009, and remanded the matter to the WCU \nDHB with instructions to conduct a re-hearing. \n30.  On September 3, 2010, acting on Mr. Penfold's re-hearing instructions, WCU Screening \nOfficer David Dombrowsky refused to document the names and proposed testimony \nof Vermillion's witnesses, and thereafter failed to apprise them of the testimony \nVermillion expected of them. \n31.  On September 7, 2010, despite his knowledge of the above-stated acts of Mr. \nDombrowsky and others, and despite Vermillion's repeated requests for his \nintervention, WCU Case Manager Doug Barnes instead effectively approved, \n8 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 9 of 44 PageID #: 481\ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n32.  On the same September 7, 2010, in proceedings in which Vermillion was denied \nsufficient written notice of the charge; denied the opportunity to call witnesses and \npresent evidence; denied consideration of exculpatory evidence; denied the requisite \nindicia of reliability for the utilization of confidential sources; denied a decision \nproperly supported by \"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that he clearly could not \nhave been trafficking with Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the same time he was \nbeing interrogated by Internal Affairs, WCU DHB Chairman Robert Johnson again \nfound Vermillion guilty as charged. \n33.  On the same September 7, 2010, despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the maximum \nallowable sanction, and despite the fact that he had already been segregated for \nfourteen (14) months, Mr. Johnson once again sentenced Vermillion to one (1) year of \ndisciplinary segregation; took thirty (30) days of his earned good time credit; and \ndemoted him from Credit Earning Class I to Credit Earning Class II. \n34.  On September 29, 2010, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Penfold, attorney Linda \nLeonard filed a Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas corpus action under \nCause No. 3:10-CV-119-PPS to be dismissed. \n35.  On October 11, 2010, despite his knowledge of the above-stated acts of Mr. Johnson \nand others, and despite Vermillion's request for his intervention, WCU Assistant \nDirector of Operations David Leonard instead effectively approved, condoned, and \nturned a blind eye to it. \n36.  On February 4, 2011 despite his knowledge that the alleged trafficking offense of July \n9 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 10 of 44 PageID #: 482\n29,2009, could not have occurred and that the \"second round\" of disciplinary \nproceedings were also a sham and constitutionally infirm, Superintendent Mark \nLevenhagen, by again affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n37.  On February 23, 2011, despite his knowledge that the disciplinary proceedings of \nSeptember 7, 2010, were also constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing Authority \nCharles Penfold, by again affirming the same on appeal, again approved, condoned, \nand turned a blind eye to it. \n38.  On March 23,2011, in an effort to obtain relief from Mr. Penfold's deliberately flawed \nfinal review decision of February 23, 2011, Vermillion filed his Petition for a Writ of \nHabeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:11-CV-123-TLS. \n39.  On June 27, 2011, however, despite his prior conclusion that there were no procedural \ndefects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings of September 7, 2010, that \nwould entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with attorney Stephanie \nRothenberg, Mr. Penfold issued another unsolicited\" second opinion\" thereby \nvacating the disciplinary conviction of September 7, 2010, and remanded the matter to \nthe WCU DHB with instructions to conduct another re-hearing. \n40.  On July 5, 2011, acting on Mr. Penfold's re-hearing instructions, WCU Screening \nOfficer Ms. C. Reis failed to apprise Vermillion's witnesses of what he expected of \nthem, and thereafter failed to secure statements from them. \n41.  On July 12, 2011, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Penfold, attorney Stephanie \nRothenberg filed another Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas corpus action \n10 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 11 of 44 PageID #: 483\nunder Cause No. 3:11-CV-123-TLS to be dismissed. \n42.  On July 27, 2011, in proceedings in which Vermillion was denied sufficient written \nnotice of the charge; denied the opportunity to call witnesses and present evidence; \ndenied consideration of exculpatory evidence; denied the requisite indicia of reliability \nfor the utilization of confidential sources; denied a decision properly supported by \n\"some evidence;\" and, despite the fact that he clearly could not have been trafficking \nwith Mr. Bates in I-Cellhouse at exactly the same time he was being interrogated by \nInternal Affairs, WCU DHB Chairpersons B. Spencer and Pamela Antisdel again found \nVermillion guilty as charged. \n43.  On the same July 27, 2011, despite the fact that Vermillion had already been \nsegregated for two (2) years, and despite the fact that thirty (30) days was the \nmaximum amount of\" good time\" that could be taken, Pamela Antisdel took sixty (60) \ndays of his earned good time credit and again demoted Vermillion from Credit \nEarning Class I to Credit Earning Class II .. \n44.  On September 28, 2011, despite his knowledge that the alleged trafficking offense of \nJuly 29,2009, did not, and could not have occurred, and that the \"third round\" of \ndisciplinary proceedings were also a sham and constitutionally infirm, Superintendent \nMark Levenhagen, by affirming the same on appeal, again effectively approved, \ncondoned, and turned a blind eye to it. \n45.  On January 12, 2012, despite his knowledge that the disciplinary proceedings of July \n27, 2011, were constitutionally infirm, IDOC Final Reviewing Authority Michael \nBarnes, by affirming the same on appeal, effectively approved, condoned, and turned \n11 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 12 of 44 PageID #: 484\na blind eye to it. \n46.  On March 29, 2012, in an effort to obtain relief from Michael Barnes' deliberately \nflawed final review decision of January 12, 2012, Vermillion filed his Petition for a \nWrit of Habeas Corpus under Cause No. 3:12-CV-150-PPS. \n47.  On November 14,2013, however, despite Michael Barnes' previous conclusion that \nthere were no procedural defects or due process errors in the disciplinary proceedings \nof July 27, 2011, that would entitle Vermillion to relief, in his concerted efforts with \nattorney Stephanie Rothenberg, Executive Director of IDOC Legal Services Robert \nBugher issued another unsolicited \"second opinion\" thereby vacating the disciplinary \nconviction of July 27, 2011, and remanded the matter to the ISR DHB with instructions \nto conduct yet another re-hearing. \n48.  On the same November 14, 2013, in her concerted efforts with Mr. Bugher, attorney \nStephanie Rothenberg filed yet another Motion thereby causing Vermillion's habeas \ncorpus action under Cause No. 3:12-CV-150-PPS to be dismissed. \n49.  On February 13, 2014, however, instead of conducting the instructed third rehearing of \nthis same, at the time, four and a half (41/z) year old charge, IDOC authorities, with the \nassistance of Indiana State Reformatory officials, dismissed said pretextual trafficking \ncharge of July 29,2009, altogether, and ordered the entire matter expunged from \nVermillion's record. \n50.  And finally, because most of the above-stated 1,513 days of retaliatory segregation \nwere spent lying on an ergonomically incorrect mat, painfully cold, and without \naccess to a chair, Vermillion now suffers potentially permanent spinal problems. \n12 \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 96   Filed 05/08/15   Page 13 of 44 PageID #: 485\nB.

The Court struck his previous two attempts but gave\nleave “to file an amended complaint containing only a single claim or related claims.” (E.g., DE\n8 at 3.) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, this Court must review the merits of a prisoner complaint\nagainst governmental entities or officials and dismiss it if the action is frivolous or malicious,\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a\ndefendant who is immune from such relief. \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 2 of 8 PageID #: 109\nGeorge v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007) requires a district court to “question”\nand “reject” any complaint that contains unrelated claims against separate defendants: \nA buckshot complaint that would be rejected if filed by a free person—say, a suit\ncomplaining that A defrauded the plaintiff, B defamed him, C punched him, D failed\nto pay a debt, and E infringed his copyright, all in different transactions—should be\nrejected if filed by a prisoner. George did not make any effort to show that the 24\ndefendants  he  named  had  participated  in  the  same  transaction  or  series  of\ntransactions or that a question of fact is “common to all defendants”.\nGeorge v. Smith, 507 F.3d at 607. \nThe district court did not question George’s decision to join 24 defendants, and\napproximately 50 distinct claims, in a single suit. It should have done so. The\ncontrolling principle appears in Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a): “A party asserting a claim to\nrelief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, may join,\neither as independent or as alternate claims, as many claims, legal, equitable, or\nmaritime, as the party has against an opposing party.” Thus multiple claims against\na single party are fine, but Claim A against Defendant 1 should not be joined with\nunrelated Claim B against Defendant 2. Unrelated claims against different defendants\nbelong in different suits, not only to prevent the sort of morass that this 50-claim,\n24-defendant suit produced but also to ensure that prisoners pay the required filing\nfees . . . .\nId. at 607. \nMore recently, the Seventh Circuit criticized a district court for disregarding George and\nreemphasized its concerns regarding “multi-claim, multi-defendants suits” and their potential as\nan end-run around filing fees under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Owens v. Hinsley, 635\nF.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court held that\n“[c]omplaints like this one . . . should be rejected, George, 507 F.3d at 607, either by severing\nthe action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants.” Id.  \nThe Second Amended Complaint, like its predecessors, would create a multi-claim,\nmulti-defendant suit involving events that occurred at two different facilities over a period of\nyears. Plaintiff seeks to justify its scope by stating that “as a result of [his] having engaged in the\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 3 of 8 PageID #: 110\nconstitutionally protected activity of terminating . . . questioning . . . , the herein-named\ndefendants retaliated against [him], and conspired with one another to retaliate against [him], by\nimplementing the continuous and ongoing chronological series of inextricably related\ntransactions and occurrences . . . .” (DE 14 at 3.)\nRhetorical paragraph A of the Second Amended Complaint asserts that when Willard\nPlank, Dawn Buss, and Charles Whelan questioned Plaintiff on July 29, 2009, about an escape\nby other inmates at the ISP, Plaintiff “exercised [his] constitutionally protected right to terminate\ntheir questioning.” (DE 14 at 3.) He contends that all of the Defendants conspired to retaliate\nagainst from him from July 29, 2009, to the present, for exercising his right to remain silent on\nthis occasion. (DE 14.)\nPlaintiff asserts his conspiracy claim under Section 1985(3), which deals with racially\nmotivated conspiracies to interfere with civil rights. To prevail on this claim, he needs “(1) an\nexpress or implied agreement among defendants to deprive [him] of his . . . constitutional rights\nand (2) actual deprivations of those rights in the form of overt acts in furtherance of the\nagreement.” Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 442 (7th Cir. 1988).(“To state a cause of action\nunder § 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege (1) a conspiracy (2) for the purpose of depriving a person\nor class of persons of the equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under\nthe law; (3) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to the plaintiff’s\nperson or property, or a deprivation of a right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.”\nTraggis v. St. Barbara’s Greek Orthodox Church, 851 F.2d 584, 586-87 (2d Cir. 1988).)\nIn § 1985 cases, vague and conclusory allegations of a conspiracy cannot survive.\nAmundsen v. Chi. Park Dist., 218 F.3d 712, 718 (7th Cir. 2000); Sampson v. Yellow Cab Co., 55\nF. Supp. 2d 867, 869 (N.D.Ill. 1999). Where a complaint asserts that the defendants conspired to\n3\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 4 of 8 PageID #: 111\ndeny the plaintiff his constitutional rights, that claim must be “supported by some factual\nallegations suggesting a ‘meeting of the minds.’” Amundsen, 218 F.3d at 718 (quoting Kunick v.\nRacine County, Wisc., 946 F.2d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir. 1991)). Thus, a § 1985 plaintiff:\nmust satisfy the following: (1) allege the existence of an agreement; (2) if the\nagreement is not overt, “the alleged acts must be sufficient to raise the inference of\nmutual understanding” (i.e., the acts performed by the members of a conspiracy “are\nunlikely to have been undertaken without an agreement”); and (3) “a whiff of the\nalleged conspirators’ assent . . .  must be apparent in the complaint.”\nId. (quoting Kunick, 946 F.2d 1574, 1580 ).\n Plaintiff does not allege a class-based purpose on the part of the defendants, which is an\nelement of a § 1985 claim. See Traggis, 851 F.2d at 586. Moreover, his conspiracy allegations\nare, at best, conclusory. Plaintiff alleges that two deputy attorneys general and more than twenty\nIDOC officials at two separate facilities and the central office conspired to  retaliate against him\nover a period of three years for exercising his right to remain silent on one occasion in an ISP\ninternal investigation that apparently never resulted in a criminal prosecution.\nThe alleged acts in furtherance of the conspiracy “must be sufficient to raise the inference\nof mutual understanding” (i.e., the acts performed by the members of a conspiracy “are unlikely\nto have been undertaken without an agreement”). Amundsen, 218 F.3d at 718. Nothing in the\nSecond Amended Complaint suggests a plausible “whiff of the alleged conspirators’ assent,” and\nnothing in Plaintiff’s submissions suggest that Defendants’ actions were unlikely to have been\nundertaken in the absence of an agreement. The few facts stated in the Second Amended\nComplaint also do not show a class-based animus. Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of the\ninferences to which he is entitled at the pleadings stage, he has not met the pleading\nrequirements for a § 1985(3) complaint. \nMoreover, Plaintiff’s conspiracy and retaliation claims are simply not plausible. The\n4\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 5 of 8 PageID #: 112\n“plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels\nand conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Bell\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). The factual allegations in the complaint “must\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Id. “[W]here the well-pleaded\nfacts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint\nhas alleged – but it has not shown – that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU.S. 662, 679 (2009) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).\nThis Court concludes that it is not plausible that two deputy attorneys general and\ntwenty-one officials at the IDOC central office and two separate facilities conspired to retaliate\nagainst Plaintiff over a period of years for invoking his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to\nanswer questions on a single occasion that did not even result in a criminal prosecution.\nAccordingly, Plaintiff may not use this alleged conspiracy to justify avoiding George’s\nprescription against bringing multiple unrelated claims against separate defendants.\nA prisoner’s multi-claim, multi-defendant complaint “should be rejected, either by\nsevering the action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants.”\nOwens v. Hinsley, 635 F.3d at 952 (citation omitted). Severing Vermillion’s multiple claims into\nseveral separate lawsuits, some of which would state no claim upon which relief could granted,\nwould obligate him to pay many filing fees. Instead, the Court will allow Vermillion to proceed\non one claim in this action, and will dismiss the improperly joined defendants and claims, giving\nhim the option to file additional complaints if he wishes. \nThe centerpiece of the Second Amended Complaint appears to be the claim, found in\nrhetorical paragraph E, where he alleges that on August 12, 2009, “without providing [him] with\nany notice, reason, or opportunity for rebuttal, the defendants transferred [Plaintiff] to the\n5\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 6 of 8 PageID #: 113\nW.C.U. Super Max facility” in violation of Plaintiff’s rights to due process. (DE 14 at 4–5.)  In\nrhetorical paragraph F, Plaintiff alleges that at about the same time, Defendants Brennan and\nNowatzke improperly increased Plaintiff’s security classification so that he could be sent to the\nWCU. (Id. at 5.)\nVermillion alleges that the WCU is a “supermax” facility with harsh and restrictive\nconditions of confinement. “Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly\nrestrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general\nprison population.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 213 (2005). “The Constitution itself does\nnot give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.”\nWilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. at 221–22 (citing Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976)).\nBut where the conditions of special confinement are restrictive enough in relation to those of\nordinary prison life, the circumstances may constitute a state policy or regulation that gives rise\nto a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding transfer. Id. at 223–24.\nIn Wilkinson, the Supreme Court considered whether placement in an Ohio supermax\nfacility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (“OSP”), with many of the same harsh conditions as\nVermillion alleges exist at the WCU, implicated the due-process clause. The Supreme Court\nconcluded that the conditions at the OSP constituted an atypical or significant hardship on\ninmates in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life, requiring that prisoners be afforded\ndue process before being transferred there. Id. at 224. On the other hand, in some instances, the\nprocess afforded to inmates before placement in a supermax facility need not be adversarial and\nmay be informal. Id. at 228–29.\nIf placement in the WCU constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship,” then\nVermillion possesses a liberty interest in not being placed in the WCU without due process. With\n6\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 7 of 8 PageID #: 114\nthe benefit of the inferences to which Plaintiff is entitled at the pleadings stage, his allegations\nthat Defendants transferred him to the WCU without providing due process are a plausible\nFourteenth Amendment due-process claim under the standards set forth in Wilkinson v. Austin.\nOn April 24, 2012, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related Action. (DE 16.) In it, Plaintiff\nargues the Local Rules mandate transfer of this case to Chief Judge Philip Simon because this\ncase, Plaintiff says, is related to a habeas petition that was before Judge Simon in cause number\n3:10-CV-119. Regardless of whether the two cases “grow[] out of the same transaction or\noccurrence,” so as to qualify as related under Local Rule 40.1(d), subparagraph (e) calls for\ntransfer only where the earlier case remains pending. Judge Simon’s case is no longer pending.\nOn March 16, 2011, Judge Simon dismissed the habeas petition and the Clerk entered judgment\nthe following day. Therefore, this case will not be transferred to Judge Simon at this time.\n  For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b), the Court:\n(1) DENIES Plaintiff leave to proceed against multiple defendants on unrelated claims in\nhis Second Amended Complaint;\n(2) GRANTS Plaintiff leave to proceed against Defendants Mark Levenhagen, Howard\nMorton, Gary Brennan, Bret Mize, and Sally Nowatzke in their individual capacities for\ndamages on his Fourteenth Amendment claim in paragraphs E and F of his Second Amended\nComplaint that they transferred him from the ISP to the WCU without affording him due\nprocess; and \n(3) DISMISSES all other claims and DISMISSES Defendants Willard Plank, Charles\nWhalen, Dawn Buss, Ralph Carrasco, Dawn Walker, Bessie Leonard, Larry Warg, Charles\nPenfold, Craig Travis, Ernestine Cole, Celia Bobson, Linda Leonard, David Dombrowsky, Doug\n7\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 17   Filed 05/08/12   Page 8 of 8 PageID #: 115\nBarnes, Robert Johnson, David Leonard, Stephanie Rothenberg, and the IDOC, pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1915A. This dismissal is without prejudice to Plaintiff’s right to bring those claims in\nother actions.\n(4) The Court further ORDERS, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g)(2), that Defendants\nLevenhagen, Morton,  Brennan, Mize and Nowatzke respond to the Second Amended\nComplaint, as provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and\n(5) DIRECTS the Marshals Service to effect service of process on Defendants\nLevenhagen,  Morton, Brennan, Mize, and Nowatzke on Plaintiff’s behalf, and DIRECTS the\nClerk’s Office to ensure that a copy of this Order is served on them along with the summons and\nSecond Amended Complaint.\nSO ORDERED on May 8, 2012. \n  s/ Joseph S.

He names as Defendants the IDOC and twenty-seven individual IDOC officials.\nUnder Section 1915A of Title 28 of the United States Code, the Court must review the merits\nof a prisoner complaint against governmental entities or officials and dismiss it if the action is\nfrivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary\nrelief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. Guided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 8   Filed 10/21/11   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 60\n18(a), a district court must “question” and “reject” any complaint that contains unrelated claims\nagainst separate defendants. George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 2007). Like free persons,\nprisoners cannot file unrelated claims against different defendants in the same suit. Id. \nPrisoners in particular may try to do so as a strategy to avoid filing fees they owe under the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act after three frivolous suits or appeals. See id. (highlighting the problem).\nIn Owens v. Hinsley, the Seventh Circuit reemphasized “that unrelated claims against different\ndefendants belong in separate lawsuits, not only to prevent the sort of morass produced by\nmulti-claim, multi-defendants suits like this one, but also to ensure that prisoners pay all fees required\nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act.” Owens v. Hinsley, 635 F.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2011)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The court explained such complaints “should be rejected, George,\n507 F.3d at 607, either by severing the action into separate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly\njoined defendants.” Id.\nThe Complaint here is similar to the one in George in that Plaintiff is attempting to bring a\nsingle lawsuit on unrelated claims against separate defendants involving events that occurred at two\nseparate IDOC facilities. These include claims arising from an investigation and subsequent\ndisciplinary proceeding against Plaintiff at the Westville Correctional Facility (“WCF”) (DE 1 paras.\n1-28, 55, 59-63,  67, 99-110, 116, 118-20, 131); his “improper” transfer from the WCF to the WCU,\nwhich is a “supermax” facility (DE 1 paras. 29-33); the physical conditions of confinement he was\nsubjected to, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, at the WCU (DE 1 paras. 33-51); the interception\nor destruction of his mail in violation of the First Amendment (DE 1 paras. 52-53); the denial of his\napplication to participate in the A.C.T program (DE 1 paras. 56-58, 80-82); the confiscation and\nsubsequent loss of his personal property (DE 1 paras. 68-70, 75-77, 83-86); the refusal of his request\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 8   Filed 10/21/11   Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 61\nfor a return to general population from administrative segregation (DE 1 paras. 66, 71-74, 79-80); the\nconfiscation of his television (DE 1 paras. 87-89, 93); the “ransacking” of his cell and destruction of\npersonal belongings on January 30, 2010 (DE 1 paras. 52-3, 90-91); and the impeding and hindering\nof his efforts to prosecute a habeas corpus petition challenging the loss of earned credit time (DE 1\nat 27-28 para. 11). \nAs instructed by George and Owens, this Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s multi-claim Complaint\nwith leave to file a separate complaint or complaints incorporating only related claims. Any\nsubsequent complaint should show the relationship between multiple claims if it contains more than\none. Plaintiff may bring only properly related claims in his amended complaint in this case. Unrelated\nclaims must be brought in separate cases.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n(1) STRIKES the Complaint (DE 1);\n(2) DIRECTS the clerk to send Plaintiff, along with his copy of this order, a blank Prisoner\nComplaint 42 U.S.C. § 1983 form with this cause number printed on it, summonses, and USM-285\nforms;\n(3) GRANTS Plaintiff until December 9, 2011, to file an amended complaint containing only\na single claim or related claims, and providing the materials necessary to serve the Defendants; and\n(4) CAUTIONS him that if he does not respond by that deadline, this case will be closed\nwithout further notice. \nSO ORDERED on October 21, 2011. \n s/ Joseph S.

Supporting his case is planned expert testimony from \ntwo highly respected authorities on solitary confinement.  These experts, Terry Kupers, M.D., \nand Dan Pacholke, will opine as to the mental and physical toll solitary conditions exact on \nprisoners and the more humane alternatives Defendants ought to have employed.   \n  Defendants tender Robert Morgan, Ph.D., to rebut this testimony.  See Morgan Report \n(Ex. 1).  Dr. Morgan did not evaluate Mr. Vermillion.  He has never stepped foot in an Indiana \nprison.  He espouses an outlier view that minimizes the harms of solitary confinement and relies \non a thoroughly discredited “meta-analysis” ignoring decades of research.  His methods \ninterpreting the meta-analysis are fatally unsound.  Dr. Morgan’s testimony will serve only to \nmislead the jury with a false veneer of objectivity.  Accordingly, Mr. Vermillion asks the court to \nbar the testimony in its entirety.  \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 2 of 34 PageID #: 1851\nI.  BACKGROUND \n  A.  Dr. Morgan’s Limited Experience Studying and Assessing the Effects of  \n    Solitary Confinement \n \n  Dr. Morgan holds a doctoral degree in counseling psychology from Oklahoma State \nUniversity.  Morgan Dep.  (Ex. 4) at 11:12–15.  He is a professor at Texas Tech University and \nsupervises students providing substance use and mental health services to probationers.  Id. at \n10:22–25; 36:23–17.  Dr. Morgan also directs the Forensic Science Institute at Texas Tech.  Id. \nat 121:16–19.  Much of his forensic practice is evaluating the competency of criminal defendants \nto stand trial and assessing criminal responsibility.  Id. at 41:16–42:23; Ex. 1 at 4.  \n  Dr. Morgan cites “20 years of providing correctional and forensic services to inmates and \ncriminal defendants,” Ex. 1 at 3, but very little experience assessing the risk of solitary \nconfinement on prisoners.  The “20 years” includes a 10-year stint at the Lubbock Mental Health \nRetardation Center, where he developed a jail-based competency restoration program, as well as \napproximately 1000 forensic examinations related to criminal responsibility and competency to \nstand trial.  Id. at 4; Ex. 4 at 42:15–43:12.  It also includes work with a school district on jail \nreentry programs.  Ex. 1 at 4.  \n  Dr. Morgan’s experience providing mental health services in segregation units is minimal \nand temporally remote.  In the early 1990’s, he completed a ten-week internship under the \nsupervision of a psychologist at the US Penitentiary in Leavenworth.  Ex. 1 at 3; Ex. 4 at 44:1–\n11.  He did not serve prisoners in segregation.  Ex. 4 at 44:12–15.  He then worked as an \nunlicensed mental health professional at one maximum-security prison in Kansas for \napproximately 18 months.  Ex. 1 at 3; Ex. 4 at 44:16–46:11.  There his duties extended to a \nsegregation unit with an average length of stay of 30–60 days for disciplinary segregation and \none year for administrative segregation.  Ex. 4 at 46:12–17; 49:3–17; 50:19–22.  He sometimes \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 3 of 34 PageID #: 1852\nprovided back-up coverage to a segregation unit with an average length of stay of two to three \nyears.  Id. at 49:18–20; 50:19–51:4.  He spent six months at a minimum-security facility, where \nthe average length of stay in segregation was two-to-three days.  Id. at 51:5–14.  He completed a \npre-doctoral internship at a federal prison from 1998–1999.  Ex. 1 at 2; Ex. 4 at 51:15–25.  \nExposure to solitary confinement during his internship was limited to a four-month rotation \nduring which he performed mental health rounds in a segregation unit one day a week.  Ex. 4 at \n52:1–53:13. \n  Dr. Morgan’s other correctional experience is his work consulting for a private company \nthat contracts to provide mental health services to prisons, and consulting on litigation.  Id. at \n54:18–55:7; 57:18–58:1.  He cites involvement (for the defense) on cases challenging the \npractice of solitary confinement in California, Canada, and Alabama.  Id. at 57:18–58:1.  In \nAlabama, Dr. Morgan toured prisons but did not assess any prisoners.  Id. at 57:24.  No federal \ncourt has qualified Dr. Morgan to testify as an expert witness.  And as will be discussed, courts \nhave been sharply critical of Dr. Morgan’s work.1  Despite Dr. Morgan’s involvement in the \nCanada litigation, a Canada Court of Appeals deemed solitary confinement unconstitutional and \nbarred it after 15 days.  Canadian Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney General), \n2019 ONCA 243 (2019) (excerpts attached as Ex. 7) at ¶ 150. \n  Dr. Morgan’s scholarly work only recently has turned to the topic of solitary \nconfinement.  His curriculum vitae categorizes 82 publications as peer-reviewed, of which three \npertain to solitary confinement.  Morgan CV (Ex. 2) at 2–9; Ex. 4 at 13:13–14:2.  The most \n                                                 \n1 See Brazeau v. Attorney General (Canada), 2019 ONSC 1888 (2019) (“I do not give much weight to Dr. Morgan’s \nmeta-analysis conclusions”) (excerpts attached as Ex. 5) ¶ 182; Corporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties \nAssociation v. Her Majesty the Queen, 2017 ONSC 7491 (2017) (excerpts attached as Ex. 6) ¶¶ 94–95 (“I do not \naccept Dr. Morgan’s evidence that some [prisoners] will be harmed, and a significant number will not.”; “I \nspecifically do not accept his evidence for concluding that some inmates will experience no serious permanent \nnegative mental health effects from prolonged administrative segregation.”). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 4 of 34 PageID #: 1853\nrecent of the three, a 2018 study in Kansas prisons, was a student project that he supervised.  Ex. \n4 at 14:6–13; 191:19–18.  Dr. Morgan is listed fourth out of the four authors on that study.  Ex. 2 \nat 3.  The second, entitled, “Questioning solitary confinement: Is administrative segregation as \nbad as alleged?” appeared in Corrections Today.  Ex. 4 at 14:14–19; Robert D. Morgan et al., \nQuestioning Solitary Confinement: Is Administrative Segregation As Bad As Alleged?, \nCORRECTIONS TODAY (September/ October 2017) (attached as Ex. 8).  Corrections Today is the \nmagazine for the American Correctional Association.  Ex. 4 at 14:20–22.  Although Dr. Morgan \ncategorized this article as “peer-reviewed,” publication in Corrections Today is not decided by \nresearch psychologists and psychiatrists, but by those in the corrections industry.  Ex. 4 at 14:23–\n15:6.  Moreover, Dr. Morgan’s article appeared in a section of the magazine called “Speak Out,” \nwhich is an opinion column.  See Questioning Solitary (Ex. 8) at 1; Corrections Today, \nAMERICAN CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION (attached as Ex. 9) at 4.2  \n  Dr. Morgan’s signature research on solitary confinement is a 2016 meta-analysis \npurporting to quantify the harms of solitary confinement.  See Ex. 1 at 9–10; Ex. 4 at 19:11–17.  \nThe meta-analytic study includes two meta-analyses, Research Synthesis 1, directed by a \nCanadian researcher, and Research Synthesis 2, directed by Dr. Morgan.  Ex. 4 at 156:8–23; see \ngenerally Robert D. Morgan et al., Quantitative Syntheses of the Effects of Administrative \nSegregation on Inmates’ Well-Being, PSYCHOL., PUB. POL’Y & L. (Aug. 2016) (attached as Ex. \n10) at 4.  The meta-analytic study disregarded decades of respected research in favor of a small \nnumber of studies that do not represent the body of work on this topic.  The reliability of Dr. \nMorgan’s meta-analysis has been heavily criticized, and at least one court has rejected it.  See \nBrazeau v. Attorney General (Canada), 2019 ONSC 1888 (2019) (excerpts attached as Ex. 5) at \n                                                 \n2 Available at http://www.aca.org/ACA_Prod_IMIS/ACA_Member/Publications/Corrections_Today_Magazine/ \nACA_Member/Publications/CT_Magazine/CorrectionsToday_Home.aspx (last visited June 20, 2019). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 5 of 34 PageID #: 1854\n¶ 182 (“I do not give much weight to Dr. Morgan’s meta-analysis conclusions.”); Craig Haney, \nThe Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement: A Systematic Critique, 47 CRIME AND \nJUSTICE 365 (Jan. 2018) (attached as Ex. 11) at 398 et seq. \n  Dr. Morgan also cites his receipt of funding to conduct research in the field of corrections \nas evidence of his qualifications.  Ex. 1 at 2–3.  But he has received no funding to research the \neffects of solitary confinement.  Ex. 4 at 34:7–16.  In fact, the National Institute of Justice \nrejected his grant proposal to perform a longitudinal study of the consequences of solitary \nconfinement after a peer-review committee identified methodological concerns with his proposed \nstudy.  Id. at 34:13–36:22. \n  B.  Dr. Morgan’s Methods in this Case \n  The bulk of Mr. Vermillion’s 1,513 days of isolation occurred on Department-Wide \nAdministrative Segregation status in the Westville Control Unit (WCU).  Both Dr. Kupers and \nMr. Pacholke toured the WCU to study its layout, operations, and atmosphere.  The WCU is a \nstand-alone facility within the Westville Correctional Complex of 224 solitary beds divided \namong four separate pods.  Its features breed solitude.  A Human Rights Watch Report described \nthe WCU’s solid steel, boxcar doors as “effectively cut[ting] inmates off from the world outside \nthe cell, muffling sound and severely restricting visual stimulus.”  Human Rights Watch, Cold \nStorage: Super-Maximum Security Confinement in Indiana at 15 (Oct. 1997).  The sole area for \n“outdoor” recreation in the WCU is a small, walled-in enclosure with a patch of sky.  Human \nRights Watch described the sensation of standing within it as “akin to being at the bottom of a \nwell.”  Id. at 17.   \n  Dr. Morgan did not join the view scheduled for the Plaintiff’s experts, nor did he visit the \nWCU (or any Indiana facility) to inform his opinions.  Ex. 4 at 81:13–19.  In his deposition, Dr. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 6 of 34 PageID #: 1855\nMorgan was not even able to provide the name of the facility where Mr. Vermillion was in \nsolitary confinement, id. at 85:15–18, much less ground his opinion in knowledge of that \nfacility’s unique characteristics, id. at 85:20–86:23.   \n  Nor did Dr. Morgan examine Mr. Vermillion.  Id. at 83:14–15.  Dr. Morgan had no \nexplanation for why he did not examine Mr. Vermillion, other than that there was insufficient \ntime.  Id. at 83:19–20.  Defense counsel never reached out to Plaintiff’s counsel to ask whether \nMr. Vermillion could be made available for an in-person evaluation by Dr. Morgan.  Instead, Dr. \nMorgan limited his investigation in this case to document review.  Id. at 81:6–12. \n  C.  Dr. Morgan’s Proposed Testimony \n  Dr. Morgan offers three overarching opinions.   \n  First, Dr. Morgan seeks to criticize Dr. Kupers’ findings regarding the effects of solitary \nconfinement on Mr. Vermillion.  Ex. 1 at 5. \n  Second, Dr. Morgan plans to opine that the serious risks of psychological harm from \nsolitary confinement, as described by Dr. Kupers and Mr. Pacholke, are not universally \nexperienced.  He intends to tell the jury that on average, solitary confinement produces mild to \nmoderate health effects as compared to the general population, with some people experiencing \nnegative effects, some experiencing no negative effects, and some improving.  Id. \n  Third, Dr. Morgan intends to testify that Mr. Pacholke’s discussion of correctional \nindustry standards is incorrect.  Id.   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which governs the admissibility of expert \nopinions, provides that: \nA  witness  who  is  qualified  as  an  expert  by  knowledge,  skill, \nexperience, training, or education may testify in the form of an \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 7 of 34 PageID #: 1856\nopinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the \nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based \non sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable \nprinciples and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the \nprinciples and methods to the facts of the case. \n \n  The district court plays the role of gatekeeper by examining: (1) the proposed expert’s \nqualifications; (2) the reliability of her methodology; and (3) the relevance of her testimony. \nGopalratnam v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 877 F.3d 771, 779 (7th Cir. 2017). \n  Rule 702 requires the Court to ensure that expert evidence “is not only relevant, but \nreliable.”  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 589 (1993).  The reliability \nrequirement serves to distinguish a well-grounded expert opinion, which is admissible, from \n“subjective belief,” which is not.  Id. at 590.  The purpose of this gatekeeping is “to make certain \nthat  an  expert,  whether  basing  testimony  upon  professional  studies  or  personal  experience, \nemploys in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an \nexpert in the relevant field.”  Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. at 157, 137 (1999).  \n“[N]othing . . . requires a district court to admit opinion evidence” that rests solely on “the ipse \ndixit of the expert.”  Id. at 157. \n  The Court has “considerable leeway in deciding in a particular case how to go about \ndetermining whether particular expert testimony is reliable.”  Id. at 152.  Courts consider the \nproposed expert’s full range of experience and training in the subject area, as well as the \nmethodology used to arrive at a particular conclusion.  Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 713, \n718 (7th Cir. 2000).  \n  In addition to being reliable, expert testimony must “assist the trier of fact to understand \nthe evidence or determine a fact at issue.”  Lewis v. CITGO Petroleum Corp., 561 F.3d 698, 705 \n(7th Cir. 2009).  The burden of admission rests with the proponent of the expert testimony.

Dr. Morgan Is Not An Appropriately Qualified Expert. \n \n  Dr. Morgan’s published and peer-reviewed scholarship on solitary confinement consists \nof one meta-analytic study summarizing research performed by others, and one student project \nhe supervised.3  Ex. 2 at 2–9; Ex. 4 at 13:13–14:2; 14:6–13; 19:11–20; 191:19–93:2.  When he \napplied to the National Institute of Justice to fund his own research into the effects of solitary \nconfinement, peer reviewers rejected it for methodological concerns, the specifics of which he \nclaimed not to remember at his deposition.  Ex. 4 at 34:13–36:22.  His clinical experience in \nprison is more than 20 years old and consists primarily of two years working in segregation units \nwith prisoners there for periods far shorter than is relevant here.  Id. at 44:16–51:14.  Since \nreceiving his doctorate degree, Dr. Morgan’s principal activities as a practicing psychologist \nhave not involved prisoners in solitary confinement.  He worked for a decade at the Lubbock \nRegional Mental Health Mental Retardation Center, and he now supervises students working \nwith probationers.  Id. at 43:5–12; 36:23–37:17.  He has a significant practice performing \ncompetency examinations in criminal justice matters, and he at times consults for a private \nprison contractor.  Id. at 41:16–42:3; 39:13–17.  He has also consulted for a private company \nproviding psychological services for the Dallas Cowboys at the NFL Combine.  Id. at 43:12–17.  \nHe has not examined Mr. Vermillion, has not toured the WCU, and has no familiarity with the \n                                                 \n3 Dr. Morgan could not recall basic details of the 2018 Chadick study, i.e., whether it included the segregation units \nhe worked at in the early 1990s: \n \nQ:  And did the study evaluate prisoners in some of the same segregation \n  units that you yourself had worked in when you were a mental health \n  professional in Kansas?  \nA:  That I don’t know.  That’s aI never thought of that.  That’s aI \n  don’t know.  I’d have to ask the lead author. \n \nEx. 4 at 192:22–93:2. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 9 of 34 PageID #: 1858\nIndiana Department of Corrections.  Id. at 81:13–82:7.  He could not even recall the name of the \nsegregation unit where Mr. Vermillion was held.  Id. at 85:15–19.  He is not an expert on solitary \nconfinement and should not be qualified as one.   \n  B.  Without Examining Mr. Vermillion, Dr. Morgan’s Opinions Regarding His  \n    Mental Health Are Fatally Unsupported.   \n \n  Like any expert, mental health professionals must root their opinions in adequate \nknowledge of the subject as to which they will testify.  See, e.g., Ancho v. Pentek Corp., 157 \nF.3d 512, 519 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that a district court properly excluded an expert witness \nbecause, among other reasons, “he did not even see fit to visit the accident scene”); O’Conner v. \nCommonwealth Edison Co., 13 F.3d 1090, 1107 (7th Cir. 1994) (adopting view that a medical \nexpert should have reviewed relevant medical literature, reviewed Plaintiff’s medical records, \nand done a thorough work-up of the Plaintiff); but see Walker v. Soo Line R. Co., 208 F.3d 581, \n591 (7th Cir. 2000) (lack of medical examination did not render expert’s testimony on effects of \nelectrical current on the body inadmissible) (citation omitted).  Moreover, expert mental health \nwitnesses must use methodology that “adhere[s] to the same standards of intellectual rigor that \nare demanded in [their] professional work in order to be reliable.”  State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. \nElectrolux Home Products, 980 F. Supp. 2d 1031, 1047 (N.D. Ind. 2013) (second alteration in \noriginal, citations omitted). \n  Dr. Morgan’s specific field is forensic psychology.  Individual evaluation is the \nfoundation of forensic psychology and its primary method.  Practice guidelines for forensic \npsychology require that “[f]orensic practitioners . . . only provide written or oral evidence about \nthe psychological characteristics of particular individuals when they have sufficient information \nor data to form an adequate foundation for those opinions or to substantiate their findings.”  \nSpecialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 10 of 34 PageID #: 1859\n(excerpt attached as Ex. 12) § 9.03 (Opinions Regarding Persons Not Examined).4  “When it is \nnot possible or feasible to examine individuals about whom they are offering an opinion,” the \nethical guidelines require that they “make clear the impact of such limitations on the reliability \nand validity of their professional products, opinions, or testimony.”  Id.   \n  Dr. Morgan acknowledges that in his forensic practice, he would only testify as to a \ncriminal defendant’s competency after having evaluated them in person.  Ex. 4 at 83:10–13.  \nUnder cross-examination, he agreed with the proposition that “a mental health professional has \nto evaluate someone to reach a conclusion as to their mental health.”  Id. at 83:5–9.  Yet he never \nsought to evaluate Mr. Vermillion.  Id. at 83:14–15.  When asked why he chose not to examine \nMr. Vermillion, Dr. Morgan indicated that he felt he did not have the time.  Id. at 83:19–20; cf. \nFuesting v. Zimmer, Inc., 421 F.3d 528, 534–35 (7th Cir. 2005), vacated in part on other \ngrounds, 448 F.3d 936 (suggesting that courts weighing an expert’s reliability consider whether \n“the expert is being as careful as he would be in his regular professional work outside his paid \nlitigation consulting”) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee’s note (2000)). \n  Dr. Morgan admits that, due to lack of familiarity with Mr. Vermillion, he cannot testify \nto Mr. Vermillion’s mental health or the effects of solitary confinement on Mr. Vermillion.  Ex. \n4 at 82:22–24.  See Castrillon v. St. Vincent Hosp. & Health Care Ctr., Inc., 2015 WL 3448947, \nat *4 (S.D. Ind. May 29, 2015) (barring a psychology expert from diagnosing the defendant \nbecause, even though it would be in his expertise to do so, the expert “conceded in his deposition \nthat he cannot make such a diagnosis, having never met [the defendant].”).  Dr. Morgan therefore \nselects a roundabout approach, commenting on his mental health indirectly through critique of \n                                                 \n4 Available at https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/forensic-psychology (last visited June 20, 2019). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 11 of 34 PageID #: 1860\nDr. Kupers.  But this limitation renders his conclusions questioning Dr. Kupers’ findings totally \nlacking in foundation and inadmissible, as will be explained.   \n1.  Dr. Morgan’s Opinions Regarding the Need For Psychological Testing \n  to Rule Out Malingering Should be Excluded. \n \n  Dr. Morgan opines that Dr. Kupers did not adequately rule out the possibility that Mr. \nVermillion was malingering.  Ex. 1 at 12.  This opinion relies on prejudicial and offensive \nspeculation as to Mr. Vermillion’s alleged propensity for deceit.  Dr. Morgan’s opinions in this \nregard are unsupported and should be excluded. \n  As a preliminary matter, Dr. Kupers considered the possibility of malingering.  He \nemphasized that it is “always important to rule out malingering in the course of a forensic \nexamination.”  Kupers Report (excerpts attached as Ex. 13) at 42.  He concluded based on his \nclinical examination that Mr. Vermillion was not exaggerating his symptoms, because he \nexhibited a tendency to minimize symptoms, not overstate them, and because the constellation of \nsymptoms he described made sense in light of Mr. Vermillion’s experiences.  Id.  In deposition, \nDr. Morgan acknowledged that scholarly reports of the negative mental health consequences of \nsolitary confinement were “not inconsistent” with Dr. Kupers’ description of Mr. Vermillion’s \nsymptoms.  Ex. 4 at 120:7–13.  He agreed this consistency “could be an indication of honest \nreporting.”  Id. at 120:20–21.  Nor is psychological testing an infallible, truth-telling serum.  Id. \nat 118:14–17.  Such tests can indicate that a person is malingering when they are not, and can \nconclude that a person is telling the truth when they are actually malingering.  Id. at 118:18–\n19:1.  \n  Nonetheless, Dr. Morgan opines that given Mr. Vermillion’s (1) “incentive to deceive \n(i.e., for financial gain),” and (2) “his history of exhibiting an antisocial personality disorder,” \nDr. Kupers’ use of the clinical interview to rule out malingering was insufficient.  Ex. 1 at 12. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 12 of 34 PageID #: 1861\n  As to (1), Dr. Morgan has no basis for attributing to Mr. Vermillion a financial incentive \nto deceive.  Under Dr. Morgan’s formulation, every person examined as part of a lawsuit \noperates with the incentive to lie and deceive.  Ex. 4 at 120:22–21:6.   \n  In arriving at this conclusion, Dr. Morgan cites a study by Dr. Heilbrun and others \nsupposedly finding that “the majority of persons (67%) assessed in a forensic context distorted \ntheir presentations in response to external motivations,” Kirk Heilbrun et al., An MMPI-Based \nEmpirical Model of Malingering and Deception, 8 BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES  & THE LAW 45 (1990) \n(attached as Ex. 14), and asserts that financial gain is one such external motivation.  Ex. 1 at 12.  \nThe subjects of the Heilbrun study, however, were patients at a forensic hospital committed as \neither incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity.  Heilbrun et al. (Ex. 14) at \n48.  They were not civil litigants responding to purported “financial gain,” and so these results \nare not in any way applicable to Mr. Vermillion.  See General Electric et al. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. \n136, 146 (1997) (upholding exclusion of expert opinions extrapolated from far-removed studies, \nfinding that the studies were too “dissimilar to the facts presented in this litigation” to support \nthe experts’ conclusions).  Moreover, Dr. Morgan’s recitation of the Heilbrun results is \nmisleading.  See Ex. 1 (“67% . . . distorted their presentations in response to external \nmotivations”).  The Heilbrun study assessed the usefulness of a new approach to categorizing \nresponse styles by testing inter-rater reliability.  Heilbrun et al. (Ex. 14) at 45.  Of 159 subjects, \nresearchers could not categorize 33% (52 subjects) using the new approach.  Id. at 51.  Of the \nremaining 67%, they classified 22% as Reliable respondents.  Id.  Forty-six percent of response \nstyles were classified as Defensive (21%), Irrelevant (16%) or Malingering (9%).  Id.  The \nauthors observed that Defensive and Irrelevant response styles were far more prevalent than \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 13 of 34 PageID #: 1862\nMalingering, notable due to the out-sized attention paid to the phenomenon.5  Id.  Furthermore, \nthose response-style categories categorized as other than “reliable” do not uniformly fit Dr. \nMorgan’s description of subjects “distorting their presentations in response to external \nmotivations.”  For example, Irrelevant refers to a response style “when one does not become \nengaged in the evaluation process; responses are not necessarily relevant to question content and \nmay be random.”  Id. at 45.  \n  Additionally, Dr. Morgan’s proposed testimony that all participants in a lawsuit have a \nmotive to lie for financial gain is unduly prejudicial against civil litigants, Fed. R. Evid. 403, and \nusurps the jury’s role as arbiter of credibility.  See Isaacs v. Hill’s Pet Nutrition, Inc., 2008 WL \n820273, at *3 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 25, 2008) (“those opinions of the doctors’ opinions that appear to \nbe reasonably calculated to opine on Isaacs’ credibility generally, are inadmissible”). \n  Dr. Morgan next cites Psychological Evaluations for the Courts: A Handbook for Mental \nHealth Professionals and Lawyers, by Melton et al., as support for his assertion that “interview-\nbased approaches to detecting malingering are of such limited utility” (citing Melton et al.), “that \ntests specially designed to detect malingering should be a routine part of forensic science.”  Ex. 1 \nat 12.  Actually, the cited text espouses “a number of strategies . . . for systematically \ninvestigating response style.”  Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for the Courts: A \nHandbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers (2018) (excerpts attached as Ex. 15) at \n58; Ex. 4 at 117:3–17.  And it identifies the clinical interview as “the most common and \nvenerable” among them.  Melton et al. (Ex. 15) at 58; Ex. 4 at 117:13–21.  The full quotation \n                                                 \n5 The 67% figure that Dr. Morgan references does not appear on the face of the study.  See Heilbrun et al. (Ex. 14).  \nDr. Morgan appears to have removed the 52 out of 159 (33%) subjects that could not be categorized from \nconsideration.  Following that reduction, the 35 subjects deemed Reliable account for 33% of the remaining 107 \nsubjects, and those classified as Defensive, Irrelevant or Malingering account for the remaining 67%.  But that \nfigure only accounts for 46% of the total 159 subjects, not “the majority of persons . . . assessed.” Cf. Ex. 1 at 12. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 14 of 34 PageID #: 1863\nfrom which Dr. Morgan cites is consistent with Dr. Kupers’ approach of performing \npsychological testing only when the clinical interview suggests malingering.  The Handbook \nreads: “Increasingly, mental health professionals have concluded that because interview-based \napproaches to detecting malingering are of such limited utility, employment of instruments \nspecifically designed for this purpose should be considered the standard of practice whenever \nthere is a basis for suspecting over-reporting of symptoms.”  Melton et al. (Ex. 15) at 59 \n(emphasis added); Ex. 4 at 117:22–18:13.  And therein lies the problem: without examining Mr. \nVermillion, Dr. Morgan lacks foundation to question Dr. Kupers’ assessment that there was no \nbasis for suspecting over-reporting. \n  Indeed, Dr. Morgan admits he is not qualified to opine as to the “standard of practice” for \na psychiatrist (such as Dr. Kupers) performing such evaluations.  When asked if conducting \npsychological testing for every person involved in a lawsuit was standard practice for \npsychiatrists, Dr. Morgan testified: “I don’t know what the standard practice or best practice is \nfor a psychiatrist being as that I’m not a psychiatrist.  I can’tI can’t opine on that.”  Ex. 4 at \n122:10–13.  Dr. Morgan therefore lacks expertise and grounds to conclude that Dr. Kupers \nshould have done more to rule out the possibility that Mr. Vermillion was malingering. \n  As to (2), Dr. Morgan cannot base his opinions on Mr. Vermillion’s unique mental health \nprofile because he did not examine him.  Yet Dr. Morgan opines that due to Mr. Vermillion’s \npast antisocial personality disorder diagnosis, Mr. Vermillion has the propensity to be deceitful, \nthereby concluding that Dr. Kupers should have suspected malingering.  Ex. 1 at 12.   \n  Dr. Morgan describes antisocial personality disorder as a “condition marked by a \npervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others . . . as indicated by at least \nthree symptoms, including breaking the law, deceitfulness, impulsivity, disregard for others’ \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 15 of 34 PageID #: 1864\nsafety, consistent irresponsibility, and lack of remorse.”  Id. at 12–13 (emphasis in original).  \nAlthough Dr. Morgan acknowledges that a patient need only identify three out of six listed \nsymptoms to warrant this diagnosis, he underlines “deceitfulness” and extrapolates from the \nmere fact of Mr. Vermillion’s past diagnosis that he is a liar until proven otherwise. \n  Dr. Kupers rejected the antisocial personality disorder diagnosis based upon the results of \nhis interview.  Ex. 13 at 43.  He noted that Mr. Vermillion had been diagnosed with antisocial \npersonality disorder in the past.  Id.  But Dr. Kupers concluded that, “[w]hile that would be a \nrelevant diagnosis for him as a much younger man, when he was abusing substances and getting \nin a lot of trouble, his current ability to plan ahead, work very hard and diligently on his legal \npursuits, remain clean and sober and help other prisoners with their legal cases pretty much rules \nout the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder.”  Id.  For that reason, Mr. Vermillion’s \nprevious antisocial personality disorder had no relevance to Dr. Kupers’ assessment of the \ninterview’s integrity.   \n  Dr. Morgan agreed that “a mental health professional has to evaluate someone to reach a \nconclusion as to their mental health.”  Ex. 4 at 83:5–9.  Without evaluating Mr. Vermillion, Dr. \nMorgan cannot say whether Mr. Vermillion currently meets criteria for an antisocial personality \ndisorder diagnosis.  Testimony as to a past antisocial personality disorder diagnosis that Dr. \nMorgan cannot say is still accurate will prejudice the jury against Mr. Vermillion without \noffering any probative value.  Thus, this opinion should be excluded under Federal Rules of \nEvidence of 402 and 403, as well as 702.   \n    2.  Dr. Morgan’s Opinions Alleging Confirmation Bias and Failure to  \n      Consider Preexisting Factors Are Inadmissible. \n \n  Dr. Morgan also criticizes Dr. Kupers for failing to rule out “confirmation bias” and \n“preexisting factors.”  Regarding confirmation bias, Dr. Morgan insists that Dr. Kupers should \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 16 of 34 PageID #: 1865\nhave “demonstrate[d] efforts to minimize bias” due to his “extreme position.”  Ex. 1 at 13.  He \ndoes not explain what Dr. Kupers should have done to minimize perceived bias.  Without any \ngrounding in scientific expertise, this attack on Dr. Kupers improperly invades the jury’s role to \nweigh credibility.  See United States v. Hall, 165 F.3d 1095, 1107 (7th Cir. 1999) \n(“[T]he credibility of eyewitness testimony is generally not an appropriate subject matter \nfor expert testimony because it influences a critical function of the jury—determining \nthe credibility of witnesses.”) (citation omitted).  \n  As to preexisting factors, the critique boils down to a repackaging of his opinion that Dr. \nKupers did not rule out malingering.  Dr. Morgan acknowledges statements Mr. Vermillion made \nduring his clinical interview that “attribute his current mental health functioning to the effects of \nsegregation,” rather than preexisting, chronic concerns.  Ex. 1 at 13.  But he refuses to credit Mr. \nVermillion’s reported statements without psychological testing to prove their veracity.  Id.  \nHowever, “[e]xperienced forensic clinicians” such as Dr. Kupers, “develop their own interview \nquestions” to detect malingering.  Melton et al. (Ex. 15) at 58.  Dr. Morgan cannot render an \nopinion on the need for psychological testing in Mr. Vermillion’s case, because he did not \nexamine him, and because he is unfamiliar with standard practice for forensic psychiatrists.  \n  For these reasons, Dr. Morgan’s opinions criticizing Dr. Kupers’ assessment of Mr. \nVermillion should be excluded and Dr. Morgan should not be permitted to testify to any aspect \nof Mr. Vermillion’s mental health. \n  B.  Dr. Morgan’s Opinions Minimizing the Harms that Attend Solitary    \n    Confinement Are Based on Unreliable Methods and Data. \n \n  The Daubert framework for evaluating admissibility of expert testimony is equally \napplicable to the social sciences.  Tyus v. Urban Search Mgmt., 102 F.3d 256, 263 (7th Cir. \n1996).  Experts in the social sciences must derive their opinions from reliable methods and base \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 17 of 34 PageID #: 1866\ntheir opinions on sufficient facts and data in order for those opinions to be admissible.  Hale v. \nGannon, 2012 WL 3867039, at *1 (S.D. Ind. Sept. 5, 2012).  Courts may consider additional \nfactors bearing on reliability, including “[w]hether a theory or technique . . . can be (and has \nbeen) tested; [w]hether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; [w]hether, in respect \nto a particular technique, there is a high known or potential rate of error and whether there are \nstandards controlling the technique’s operation; and [w]hether the theory or technique enjoys \ngeneral acceptance within a relevant scientific community.”  Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 149–50 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n    1.  Dr. Morgan Has No Basis to Conclude that Conditions in the    \n      Segregation Units He Has Studied Are Similar to Conditions at Issue  \n      in this Case. \n \n  Dr. Morgan seeks to opine that solitary confinement produces “mild to moderate health \nand mental health effects comparable to the effects of incarceration as a general matter,” and that \n“some inmates placed in AS will experience negative effects, some will not experience negative \neffects, and some will experience improved functioning.”  Ex. 1 at 5.  For these opinions to be \nadmissible, they must be helpful to the jury.  In other words, they must connect to the facts of the \ncase.  Porter v. Whitehall Labs., Inc., 9 F.3d 607, 613 (7th Cir. 1993) (“Expert testimony which \ndoes not relate to an issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful.”) (quoting Daubert, \n509 U.S. at 591); see also Hemmings v.

He has never been to an Indiana prison, Ex. 4 at 81:18–19, has never been \nto the WCU, id., and did not familiarize himself with literature about those conditions, id. at \n82:8–14.  See, e.g., Ancho, 157 F.3d at 519 (holding that a district court properly excluded an \nexpert witness because, among other reasons, “he did not even see fit to visit the accident \nscene”).  His report does not address the prison conditions at issue in this case.  Id. at 85:20–86:1 \n(“Q: And your report doesn’t describe the segregation unit at issue in this case, correct?  A: No, \nnot beyond what was reported in Dr. Kupers’ and Mr. Pacholke’s report.”).  He acknowledges \nthat segregation in the United States is not uniform and that variation in conditions matters a \ngreat deal: \nQ:  Do you agree that the conditions in segregation vary across \n  facilities in prison systems? \nA:  I do. \nQ:  Do you agree that those conditions are important in assessing \n  the effects of segregation on prisoners? \nA:  I do. \nQ:  For example, do you agree that the degree of isolation varies \n  across prison segregation units? \n[Objection as to form.] \nA:  I do. \nQ:  And is it important in evaluating a segregation unit to be \n  aware of the degree of isolation? \nA:  Yes. \n \nId. at 84:9–22. \n  In the other solitary confinement cases Dr. Morgan has worked on, he made the effort to \ntour the facility so as to have a basis for his opinion.  Id. at 57:22–25 (describing touring prisons \nin Alabama, California, and Canada).  Dr. Morgan said that he did not tour the WCU because he \nwas not asked to opine “as to Mr. Vermillion’s mental state as it pertained to the effects of \nsegregation.”  Id. at 85:10–12.  But “the effects of segregation” is the precise topic of Dr. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 19 of 34 PageID #: 1868\nMorgan’s report.  See Ex. 1 at 1 (“the use of restrictive housing (such as AS) will, on average, \nproduce mild to moderate physical and mental health effects comparable to the effects of \nincarceration as a general matter”).  He grounds his opinions as to the effects of segregation by \nrelying on his experience in Kansas, id. at 3, his litigation work in Alabama, California and \nCanada, id. at 4, and studies of systems in Colorado, Kansas, and Canada.  Id. at 6–8 (citing \nO’Keefe 2010, Chadick 2018, and Zinger 2001, respectively).  None of the sources he relies on \nprovides a sufficient basis for understanding conditions in the WCU.  Because Dr. Morgan’s \nopinions are not tethered to the conditions at issue in this case, they are irrelevant, will not help \nthe jury assess the effects of segregation at the WCU, and should be excluded.   \n    2.  Dr. Morgan Relies on Inapplicable Studies and Misleading Data. \n \n  Dr. Morgan’s 2016 meta-analysis shapes his view that solitary confinement produces \n“mild to moderate health and mental health effects on average,” comparable to the consequences \nof general imprisonment, and that some individuals in solitary confinement will experience \nnegative consequences, while some will improve and others will remain unchanged.  Ex. 1 at 11.  \nA court in Canada, informed by preeminent scholars in this field of serious errors in the meta-\nanalysis, did not “give much weight to Dr. Morgan’s meta-analysis conclusions.”  Ex. 4 at 63:3–\n16.  Dr. Craig Haney has authored an article thoroughly exposing these errors.  See Haney (Ex. \n11) at 398–407.  Dr. Morgan’s meta-analysis is fatally flawed, as are the ways in which he \nattempts to derive meaning from the results.   \n  First, Dr. Morgan’s meta-analytic study excludes most relevant data on the harms of \nsolitary confinement.  Id. at 399–400.  Meta-analysis is a tool to measure the “magnitude of \nrelationships between variables.”  Id. at 398.  The integrity of Dr. Morgan’s meta-analytic \napproach requires that there be multiple, high-quality controlled studies whose effect sizes can \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 20 of 34 PageID #: 1869\nthen be synthesized.  But “[t]he prison setting rarely lends itself to collection of meaningful \nquantitative data capable of generating the kinds of effect sizes on which meta-analyses depend.”  \nId.  That is, there are few quantitative, controlled studies of the effect of segregation on \nprisoners, because it is unethical to demand that prisoners endure the torture of solitary \nconfinement solely for research.  See Ex. 4 at 135:14–36:2 (“Q: And the research that’s \ndeveloped on solitary confinement has not, in fact, relied on control studies because of the \ndifficulties in conducting such studies in prison, right? A: Yes, that’s one of the primary issues.”) \n  For this reason, much of the research on solitary confinement is qualitative.  Haney (Ex. \n11) at 367.  But “there is a substantial amount of it and the findings are robust.”  Id.  At least two \nU.S. Supreme Court justices have cited this research approvingly, as have multiple other \nmembers of the federal judiciary.6  See Apodaca v. Raemisch, 139 S. Ct. 5 at n.8 (2018) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring); Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring) \n(stating that “penology and psychology experts, including scholars in the legal academy, \ncontinue to offer essential information and analysis” and observing that “research . . . confirms \nwhat this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible \nprice.”); Porter v. Clarke, 923 F.3d 348, 356 (4th Cir. 2019) (explaining that “[n]umerous studies \nreveal that prolonged detention of inmates” in solitary conditions on death row has damaging \nresults); Grissom v. Roberts, 902 F.3d 1162, 1175–78 (10th Cir. 2018) (Lucero, J., concurring) \n(citing research on solitary confinement including the work of Terry Kupers, Craig Haney, and \nStuart Grassian); Williams v. Sec’y Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corr., 848 F.3d 549, 566 (3d Cir. \n2017) (citing “[t]he robust body of scientific research on the effects of solitary confinement” as \n                                                 \n6 See also Ruiz v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 1246 (2017) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of stay of execution) (observing \nthat Mr. Ruiz’s “severe anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, disorientation, memory loss, and \nsleep difficulty” are symptoms “long associated with solitary confinement”). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 21 of 34 PageID #: 1870\nsupport for the conclusion that “the deprivations of protracted solitary confinement so exceed the \ntypical deprivations of imprisonment” as to create a liberty interest in avoiding solitary). \n  Dr. Morgan’s meta-analyses artificially limited the universe of solitary confinement \nresearch.  Haney (Ex. 11) at 399–401.  Research Synthesis 1 reviewed 150 studies for potential \ninclusion in the meta-analysis but included just 14 (9.3%).  Morgan (Ex. 10) at 4; Haney (Ex. 11) \nat 400.  Research Synthesis 2 identified 40,589 such articles and reduced that number to 61 it \ndeemed related to the research question.  It then excluded all but 19 for meta-analysis (31.15%).  \nMorgan et al. (Ex. 10) at 4–5; Haney (Ex. 11) at 400.  Moreover, many of the included studies \n“have little or nothing to do with the key question of whether and when solitary confinement is \npsychologically harmful,” instead addressing medical outcomes, recidivism, and institutional \nmisconduct.  Haney (Ex. 11) at 400 & n.18 (finding that only six studies in Research Synthesis 1 \nand ten in Research Synthesis 2 address the psychological effects of solitary confinement).  This \nunrepresentative sample is not a sound basis for a meta-analytic study purporting to provide a \ncomprehensive synthesis of the research.  Id. (“A meta-analysis that includes so little of the \navailable relevant literature is not a synthesis of much of anything.”). \n  Second, Dr. Morgan’s meta-analysis uses unreliable data.  See British Columbia Civil \nLiberties Ass’n. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 BCSC 62 (2018) (excerpts attached as Ex. \n16) ¶¶ 253 & 254 (agreeing with criticisms of the Colorado Study and finding that “the Morgan \net al. Study is unhelpful in understanding solitary confinement because of flaws in the Colorado \nand Zinger studies”). \n  The meta-analysis relies heavily on a 2010 study of prisoners in Colorado (the Colorado \nStudy).  Haney (Ex. 11) at 401–02 (explaining that because of the Colorado Study’s \ncomparatively large sample size, the weights given to effect sizes derived from the Colorado \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 22 of 34 PageID #: 1871\nStudy “dwarf” others in the meta-analyses).  The Colorado Study is a longitudinal study of two \ncomparator groups of prisoners in Coloradoone group in administrative segregation and the \nother in general populationwith various sub-groups.  See generally Maureen O’Keefe et al., \n“One Year Longitudinal Study of the Psychological Effects of Administrative Segregation,” \nFinal Report to the National Institute of Justice (2010) (Ex. 17); Ex. 1 at 8; Haney (Ex. 11) at \n379–80.  The goal was to isolate the variable of solitary confinement to determine its effect.  But \nbecause both comparison groups were exposed to the treatment variable (i.e., solitary \nconfinement), the resulting data is not reliable and should not be admitted at trial.  Haney (Ex. \n11) at 380–86.  \n  The contamination began at the very start of the Colorado Study.  The study selected \nparticipants by identifying prisoners who were given disciplinary tickets and then were either \nsent to administrative segregation (and designated members of the treatment group) or to general \npopulation (control group).  Id. at 380–81.  But the disciplinary process necessarily involved \nexposure to solitary confinement for a significant period of time, thereby contaminating the \ncontrol group at the start.  Id. at 380–84.  Moreover, conditions in disciplinary segregation were \nmore severe than those in administrative segregation.  Id. at 381–82.  So what the Colorado \nresearchers really studied was how prisoners rated their mental health immediately after moving \nfrom a highly restrictive form of segregation to a less restrictive form of segregation.  See Peter \nScharff Smith, “The Effects of Solitary Confinement: Commentary on One Year Longitudinal \nStudy of the Psychological Effects of Administrative Segregation,” CORRECTIONS & MENTAL \nHEALTH (June 2011) (attached as Ex. 18) at 7 (“study participants were already damaged by \nsolitary confinement when the study began”). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 23 of 34 PageID #: 1872\n  There was also cross-contamination during the study itself.  Haney (Ex. 11) at 384–86.  \nSome members of the treatment group left segregation for unspecified periods to move to less \nrestrictive housing, and some members of the control group were exposed to solitary during the \nstudy.7  Id.  Yet the aggregated results did not exclude study participants who were subject to \ncross-contamination.  Id. at 385; Ex. 4 at 147:16–24.  \n  Dr. Morgan professes awareness of the critiques of the Colorado Study, but he exhibited \na surprising lack of familiarity with the Study itself.  He agreed that “[t]he most serious critique \nof the Colorado study is that there was fatal contamination of the control group,” Ex. 4 at \n142:11–14, and that if there were such contamination there “could” be real questions as to the \nvalue of the data.  Id. at 142:15–17.  He agreed that Dr. Haney “found that half of the \nadministrative segregation [group] of prisoners, 60about half, 62 of 127, spent an unspecified \nperiod of time in general population or elsewhere during the study.”  Id. at 143:5–9.  But he \ndidn’t recall whether or not participants were in disciplinary segregation at the start of the study, \nid. at 143:1–5, and was unable to describe the selection procedure for identifying participants.  \nId. at 143:8–12.   \n  There are other major problems with the Colorado Study.  See Haney (Ex. 11) at 386–98.  \nThe sole mechanism for collecting data on prisoners’ mental health was self-scoring pen and \npaper tests.  Id. at 396.  Dr. Haney explains:  \nResearchers who use many rating scales (especially ones not validated for the \nparticular population) generally use other methods of data collection as a validity \ncheck.  The most basic is a face-to-face interview to establish rapport and acquire \nbackground information.  When possible, behavioral data (by records reviews or \n                                                 \n7 See also Smith (Ex. 18) at 6 (describing contamination in the Colorado Study and concluding that “the GP control \ngroup was not really a GP control group at all since the majority of these experienced either AS or punitive \nsegregation during their participation in the study, and in addition mostperhaps allexperienced AS immediately \nprior to their AS hearing, after which they went into GP”; “the Colorado study is in fact not a study comparing \nsegregation/solitary confinement with non-segregation/solitary confinement, since most of the GP inmates \nexperienced solitary confinement during the study”).   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 24 of 34 PageID #: 1873\nbehavioral rating scales completed by others) are included. These different sources \nof information should be reconcilable, and the interviews provide the glue that \nbinds them. \n \nId.  While the Colorado Study researchers had access to mental health and medical records and \ncrisis reports that could have provided a check as to the accuracy of the prisoners’ self-reporting, \nthey ignored this data.  Id. at 396–97; Stuart Grassian & Terry Kupers, “The Colorado Study vs. \nthe Reality of Supermax Confinement” (Ex. 19) at 6–7.  They eschewed face-to-face interviews \naltogether.  Haney (Ex. 11) at 396; Smith (Ex. 18) at 2 (criticizing Colorado Study on basis that \ntests were administered “without in-depth interviews” and “self-reported data was not collected \nby a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or an experienced prison researcher”). \n  In addition, the applicability of the Colorado Study data to solitary confinement in other \nsystems is highly fraught because of the nature of Colorado’s administrative segregation \nprogram.  Haney (Ex. 11) at 389–390.  Colorado divides its administrative segregation into three \nlevels and provides additional privileges at each level.  Id.  Those at Level 3 are still in \nadministrative segregation, but they have an array of privileges including institutional work \noutside of their cells that are not common features of solitary.  Id. at 390 and n.5.  These \ndifferences led a court in California to discount the relevance of the Colorado Study to their \nsolitary confinement regimen entirely.8  See Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146 (upholding exclusion \nof expert opinions derived from studies too “dissimilar to the facts presented in this litigation”).  \n                                                 \n8 See Corp. of the Canadian Civil Liberties Ass’n., 2017 ONSC 7491 (Ex. 6) ¶¶ 236–37 (“The respondent also relied \non the O’Keefe study completed in Colorado in 2010.  I do not accept this study is valid in Canada because the \nsystem of administrative segregation is different in Canada.  Specifically, at page 11 of the study the authors \ndescribe the incentive-based Colorado program.  This program has three quality-of-life levels.  Each level brings \nwith it more privileges which must be earned through appropriate behavior.  At quality-of-life level 3, inmates in \nadministrative segregation are allowed four three-hour visits per month, four 20-minute phone sessions, $25 worth \nof canteen per week and the opportunity to work as a porter or barber in the institution.  This is not comparable to \nthe Canadian system.”). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 25 of 34 PageID #: 1874\nThe WCU does not have a similar privileges program.  See Summary Judgement Opinion and \nOrder (Doc. No. 214) at 11–12. \n  Moreover, “[i]t is critical under Rule 702 that there be a link between the facts or data \nthe expert has worked with and the conclusion the expert’s testimony is intended to \nsupport.”  United States v. Mamah, 332 F.3d 475, 478 (7th Cir. 2003).  As discussed supra, Dr. \nMorgan cannot assess the relevance of segregation conditions in Colorado to conditions in the \nWCU, because he has never been to the WCU.   \n  Despite the Colorado Study’s problems and Dr. Morgan’s inability to connect the \nconditions studied in Colorado to the conditions at the WCU, he relies on the Colorado Study \nheavilynot only in his meta-analysis, but in his expert report.  His report describes the \nColorado Study as the “[g]old standard” of methodological approaches to examining the effects \nof solitary confinement, emphasizing the outsized weight he attributes to this unintelligible \nstudy.  Ex. 1 at 8.  The unreliability of Dr. Morgan’s testimony is compounded by the fact that he \ncannot opine as to the value of the studies relied on in his meta-analysis, because he is admittedly \nnot an expert in design of controlled studies.  Ex. 4 at 134:22–24 (“Q: Do you hold yourself out \nas an expert in the design and execution of controlled studies?  A: No.”). \n  The discredited Colorado Study is not the only unreliable source that Dr. Morgan relied \non for his meta-analyses.  He relied on the Zinger 2001 study in the meta-analysis and in his \nexpert report, repeating its purported finding of “no significant mental health decompensation for \nsegregated inmates compared to their peers in the general prison population.”  Ex. 1 at 6–7.  But \nthe Zinger study suffered from multiple flaws, including a major attrition problem.  Over the 60-\nday period of the study, the number of administrative segregation prisoners dropped from 83 to \n23.  Ivan Zinger et al., “The Psychological Effects of 60 Days in Administrative Segregation,” 43 \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 26 of 34 PageID #: 1875\nCANADIAN J. CRIMINOLOGY 47 (2001) (Ex. 20) at 63; Haney (Ex. 11) at 403.  Of those 23, only \n10 were involuntary, meaning that attrition decreased the number of involuntary segregation \nparticipants by 80%.  Zinger et al. (Ex. 20) at 64; Haney (Ex. 11) at 403.  The study’s authors \nexplain that “[t]he problem with attrition is especially relevant to the evaluation of the \npsychological effects of segregation,” because “[s]ubjects who decide to no longer participate in \nthe experiment may be the same individuals who would not cope well with the conditions of \nsegregation and would be negatively affected by them.”  Zinger et al. (Ex. 20) at 56. \n  The Zinger study also involved prisoners who volunteered for segregation; another \nproblem with multiple studies Dr. Morgan relied on for his meta-analysis.  Ex. 4 at 164:5–10 \n(Zinger 2001 (attached as Exhibit 20); 168:2–12 (Walters 1963 (attached as Ex. 21); 168:24–\n69:10 (Ecclestone 1974 (attached as Ex. 22)).  Researchers have warned against extrapolating the \neffects of voluntary segregation to the very-different context of forced segregation.  Haney (Ex. \n11) at 402–03 (“Voluntarily isolated prisoners . . . control their own fates; at least in theory, they \ncan leave. . . . They should not be treated as if their experiences represent the effects of solitary \nconfinement on involuntarily segregated prisoners.”).  Dr. Morgan agreed that “whether a \nprisoner is in solitary voluntarily or involuntarily could effect that prisoner’s experience in their \nconfinement.”  Ex. 4 at 164:11–14.  See Sheehan v. Daily Racing Form, Inc., 104 F.3d 940, 942 \n(7th Cir. 1997) (statistical study claiming that negative correlation between employees’ age and \nretention proved age discrimination was inadmissible under Daubert because it failed to consider \nor correct for obvious alternative explanatory variables).   \n  These studies also analyzed such short periods of time that they do not provide reliable \ndata for opinions as to the effects of solitary confinement in a case such as this one.  Id. at \n164:15–18 (Zinger (Ex. 20) 60 days); 168:17–20 (Walters (Ex. 21) 4 days); 169:11–13 \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 27 of 34 PageID #: 1876\n(Ecclestone (Ex. 22) 10 days).  Such studies are not meaningfully similar to the facts of this case.  \nSee Joiner, 522 U.S. at 146 (approving exclusion of expert’s use of dissimilar scientific studies).  \nYet another study compared two different forms of solitary confinement and had no general \npopulation control group.  Id. at 166:3–22 (Cloyes 2016 (attached as Ex. 23)).   \n  Third, Dr. Morgan’s interpretation of the results of his meta-analysis lacks rigor and is \nunreliable.   \n  The meta-analysis results purport to show small-to-moderate (0.06 to 0.55) effect sizes on \nmeasures of mental health and wellbeing for those in solitary confinement.  Morgan et al. (Ex. \n10) at 1.  As discussed, the meta-analysis arrived at these results by synthesizing studies \ncomparing those in solitary confinement to those in prison general population.  In his expert \nreport, Dr. Morgan then takes an illogical step forward.  He compares the results from his meta-\nanalysis to the effects of general incarceration on mental health and wellbeing.  Ex. 1 at 10.  He \nthus purports to compare the effects solitary confinement to the effects of general incarceration \nusing the following (flawed) approach. \nSolitary Confinement (X)  :  General Population (Y) = Association between Solitary Confinement \nand Mental Health Consequences \nGeneral Incarceration (Y)9  :  Life Outside Prison (Z)=  Association between General \nIncarceration and Mental Health Consequences \n  The proper method would be to first assess the strength of the association between \nsolitary confinement and mental health as compared to a control group of people not in prison, \nthen test the strength of the association between general population and mental health as \n                                                 \n9 It is not even clear from Dr. Morgan’s report that “general incarceration” excludes solitary confinement and is the \nequivalent of general population, as it should. \n \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 28 of 34 PageID #: 1877\ncompared to a control group of people not in prison, and then compare the two effect sizes.  Thus \nthe correct formula is as follows:  \nSolitary Confinement (X) :  Life Outside Prison (Z) = Association between Solitary Confinement \nand Mental Health Consequences \nGeneral Incarceration (Y) :  Life Outside Prison (Z) =  Association between General \nIncarceration and Mental Health Consequences \n  Dr. Morgan’s attempts to compare the effect sizes of segregation from his 2016 meta-\nanalysis to the effect sizes of general incarceration on prisoners’ well-being have not been peer \nreviewed.10  Ex. 4 at 186:10–17.  Cf. Tyus, 102 F.3d at 263 (holding expert opinions were \nadmissible where expert relied on “peer-reviewed articles accepted in his profession”).  His \nmethod is an apples-to-oranges comparison that proves nothing.  See State Farm Fire, 980 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1049 (“When conducting a comparative analysis, to meet the reliability \nthat Daubert demands, an expert must select samples that are truly comparable . . . . care must be \ntaken to be sure that the comparison is one between ‘apples and apples’ rather than one between \n‘apples and oranges.’ ”) (citations omitted).   \n  Problems with Dr. Morgan’s comparative analysis go beyond even this “fatal flaw.”  Id.  \nHis comparison of the effects of solitary confinement to the effects of general incarceration is a \nmethodological disaster. \n  Dr. Morgan relies on the self-reported experience of a single prisoner, “Inmate A,” whom \nhe examined at Pelican Bay State Prison, California.  He cites Inmate A’s view that prisoners \n                                                 \n10 His bar chart, reproduced infra, appeared in the correctional magazine of the American Corrections Association, \nCorrections Today.  Ex. 8 at 20.  While Dr. Morgan categorizes this publication as peer-reviewed in his curriculum \nvitae, he acknowledged under deposition questioning that the peer reviewers are corrections industry professionals \nand not research psychologists.  Ex. 4 at 15:2–6.  Moreover, the magazine published the piece in an opinion column, \n“Speak Out.”  See Ex. 8; CORRECTIONS TODAY (Ex. 19) at 4 (“Corrections Today is the perfect space to share your \nopinions that are relevant to corrections.  We invite submissions to the Speak Out column for just this \nopportunity.”). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 29 of 34 PageID #: 1878\n“eventually adjust and cope adequately in the structured environment of AS” as support for his \nhypothesis that prisoners “adapt to their environment, whether it be a general prison population \nsetting or AS.”  Ex. 1 at 11.  But out of the 130–150 prisoners Dr. Morgan interviewed, Inmate A \nwas a major outlier.  Ex. 4 at 198:1–200:8.  Whereas Inmate A expressed no concerns or \nsignificant distress related to his isolation, “the majority of other inmates [Dr. Morgan] \ninterviewed expressed distress and concern resulting from their segregation placement.”  Id. at \n199:19–200:8.  Dr. Morgan thus ignored the experiences of all those prisoners that did not fit his \ntheory and elevated the experience of the one prisoner that did.  \n  Dr. Morgan includes the following bar chart purporting to compare the effect size \nestimates for administrative segregation to the effect size estimates for general incarceration.   \nEx. 1 at 10.  The blackened bar showing the effect size of “General Incarceration” derives from a \n1990 study by James Bonta and Paul Gendreau.  See James Bonta and Paul Gendreau, \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 30 of 34 PageID #: 1879\nReexamining the Cruel and Unusual Punishment of Prison Life, L. & HUMAN BEH. 347 (1990) \n(attached as Ex. 24).  Contrary to Dr. Morgan’s representations in his report, the data he pulls \nfrom Bonta & Gendreau for the bar chart is not the effect size of general incarceration.  Ex. 4 at \n179:21–180:14.  It is the effect size of overcrowding.  Id. (“Q: So we’re comparing the effect \nsizes of the harms of segregation to the effect sizes of the harms of living in an overcrowded \nprison?  A: That would be fair.”); see Bonta & Gendreau (Ex. 24) at 352.  There is nothing to \nlearn from this inapt comparison.  Dr. Morgan’s use of it here is deeply misleading. \n  In another solitary confinement case, Dr. Morgan submitted a bar chart (copied below) \nthat was similar in all but one respect to the bar chart he uses here.   \n \n  See Ex. 4 at 180:15–81:1.  Dr. Morgan cited this bar chart as support for his conclusion \nthat the adverse health effects of solitary confinement on health are similar to the adverse health \neffects of general incarceration.  See id. at 180:15–182:1.  Dr. Morgan acknowledged under \ncross-examination that the bar on that chart representing the effect size of the adverse health \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 31 of 34 PageID #: 1880\neffects of general incarceration was totally wrongit was inverted.  Id. at 182:2–82:19.  The \nstudy he relied on for that comparison (Heigel et al. 2010 (attached as Ex. 25)) actually showed \nthat people in general incarceration “improved in terms of their physical health functioning.”  Id. \nat 182:16–19.  This error led a Canadian court to disregard Dr. Morgan’s comparison opinions.  \nCorporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association v. the Queen, 2017 ONSC 7491 (2017) \n(excerpts attached as Ex. 6) ¶ 95 (“Specifically, his report that administrative segregation was no \nmore harmful than incarceration in the general prison population was based on an erroneous \nconclusion that there was a negative association between incarceration in the general population \nand health outcomes when the opposite was correct.”).   \n  Dr. Morgan did not revisit his incorrect methodology and adjust his conclusions when \noffering expert testimony in this case.  Instead, Dr. Morgan reports the same conclusion, but \nwithout the bar chart comparison (or any evidence on health) to support his claim: “In totality, it \ncan be expected that the use of restrictive housing (such as AS) will produce mild to moderate \nhealth . . . effects comparable to the effects of incarceration generally.”  Ex. 1 at 11.  Dr. \nMorgan’s opinion rests on nothing but his own “ipse dixit.”  Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 157.   \n  Dr. Morgan’s erroneous methods produce precisely the type of opinions that Daubert and \nits progeny require courts to address.  His proposed testimony threatens to subvert the fairness of \nMr. Vermillion’s trial by persuading the jury that his charts and figures constitute objective and \nreliable scientific evidence.11  Cross-examination to sufficiently demonstrate the errors in his \n                                                 \n11 Dr. Haney pinpoints the problem of Dr. Morgan’s meta-analysis in this regard:  \n \nThe concern is not only that meta-analyses on important prison topics almost invariably ignore or \nunderrepresent the larger literature, but also that they privilege certain kinds of studies far beyond \ntheir actual scientific merit, and do so in a way that many readers are unlikely to appreciate.  One \ncritique rightly observed that readers “might not be motivated to look beyond the meta-analyses \nthemselves due to confidence in the objective, straightforward nature of the tasks of conducting a \nmeta-analysis, reporting findings, and making recommendations.”  Reducing entire studies to single \nor multiple effect sizes almost invariably creates a false equivalency between them.  Readers can be \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 32 of 34 PageID #: 1881\nopinions will require educating the jury on complicated topics involving effect sizes, meta-\nanalysis, and controlled studies that are very far from what this case is about.  Mr. Vermillion \nshould not be required to put on a mini-trial to demonstrate the unreliability of Dr. Morgan’s \nanalysis, and the jury should not have to endure it.  Instead, Dr. Morgan’s opinions should be \nexcluded. \n  C.  Dr. Morgan Is Not Qualified to Testify to Correctional Industry Standards \n \n   Dr. Morgan is not qualified by experience or study to opine about correctional industry \nstandards.  See Ex. 4 at 194:12–20; cf. Cage v. City of Chicago, 979 F. Supp. 2d 787, 803 (N.D. \nIll. 2013) (“experts may rely on their professional experience to offer opinion testimony \nregarding the standard of care and generally-accepted industry standards”).  His experience \nworking for a prison system is minimal, temporally remote, and limited to mental health \noperations.  See Section I.A supra.  He acknowledges he is not an expert in correctional \npractices.  Ex. 4 at 194:18–20 (“Q: And I take it you do not hold yourself out as an expert in \ncorrectional practices?  A: Correct.”).   \n  However, Dr. Morgan presumes the role of correctional expert, opining that Mr. Pacholke \nincorrectly states the correctional practices applicable at the time of Mr. Vermillion’s solitary \nconfinement.  See Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610, 617 (7th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the \nrelevant question is “not whether an expert witness is qualified in general, but whether his \nqualifications provide a foundation for [him] to answer a specific question”) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  He does so by pointing out that two sources Mr. Pacholke refers to \n                                                 \neasily mesmerized by arrays of numbers that appear simply and accurately to represent highly \ncomplex and substantially different underlying realities. \n \nHaney (Ex. 11) at 399 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Substitute “jurors” for “readers” and Dr. \nHaney has explained the risk of misleading the jury with inaccurate meta-analytic data purporting to show the \neffects of solitary confinement. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 33 of 34 PageID #: 1882\nare dated after Mr. Vermillion’s release from solitary confinement.  Ex. 1 at 15–16.  Defense \ncounsel are free to point out this issue in cross-examination, but Dr. Morgan will not add \nanything of substance to the jury’s understanding on this topic.  “[I]f he is to give testimony to \nassist jury members and expand their knowledge. . . , [he] must testify to something more than \nwhat is ‘obvious to the layperson’ in order to be of any particular assistance to the jury.”  Ancho, \n157 F.3d at 519.  Because Dr. Morgan admittedly lacks expertise on this topic, his opinion \nshould be excluded. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n \n  Defendants’ expert is unqualified, unfamiliar with the facts of this case, and espouses \noutlier opinions based on unreliable methods and data.  He admits that his view of the harms of \nsolitary confinement is “outside of the mainstream.”  Ex. 4 at 98:17–99:5.  Dr. Morgan should \nnot be allowed to offer opinion testimony in this matter.  In the alternative, he should be \nprecluded from testifying as to (1) Mr. Vermillion’s mental health and Dr. Kupers’ assessment \nthereof; (2) the propensity of civil litigants to lie for financial gain; (3) the effects of segregation; \n(4) comparison of the effects of solitary confinement to the effects of general incarceration; and \n(5) correctional practices.  \nBy: /s/ Maggie Filler \nMaggie Filler (pro hac vice) \nRODERICK AND SOLANGE \nMACARTHUR \nJUSTICE CENTER \n745 Atlantic Avenue, 8th Floor \nBoston, MA 02111 \nPhone: (857) 284-1455 \nFax: (857) 284-8049 \nmaggie.filler@macarthurjustice.org   \n   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 312   Filed 06/21/19   Page 34 of 34 PageID #: 1883\n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n  I hereby certify that on June 21, 2019, the foregoing was filed using the Court’s CM/ECF \nelectronic filing system.

Introduction \nThis action was transferred from the Northern District of Indiana to this district following \nthe Seventh Circuit’s Mandate issued April 6, 2015. The Mandate summarized Vermillion’s claims \nas follows. \nVermillion alleges that on July 29, 2009, he was interviewed by Internal \nAffairs investigators after several fellow inmates had escaped from the Indiana \nState Prison (“ISP”). The interviewers accused him of being involved in the \nescape and threatened to pursue criminal charges, prompting Vermillion to stop \nanswering their questions. Following this encounter, according to Vermillion, the \nthree interviewers along with another investigator from Internal Affairs and five \nadministrators from ISP, Westville Correctional Facility, and DOC headquarters \nretaliated for his silence by immediately placing him in punitive segregation at \nISP and then on August 12, 2009, transferring him to Westville, where he was \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 2 of 28 PageID #: 1368\nhoused in the Maximum Control Segregation Unit. This transfer, Vermillion \nalleges,  occurred  after  two  of  the  administrators  falsified  documents  to \nexaggerate his security classification. All nine of these employees are named \ndefendants. \n \nVermillion claims that for more than three years[1] after the transfer, he \nwas confined in his segregation cell at Westville for at least 23 hours per day \nwithout personal interaction with other inmates, and during those years, five of \nthe same nine employees—joined by many others—continued retaliating against \nhim for invoking his right to remain silent. This retaliation, Vermillion alleges, \nranged from intercepting his mail to mishandling the administrative hearings \nconcerning a disciplinary ticket for trafficking contraband. \n \nMandate at p. 2 \nVermillion argues that his transfer violated his right to due process but \nalso was initiated for the purpose of retaliating for his refusal to answer questions \nabout the escaped prisoners. The Fifth Amendment gives a person the right “not \nto answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, \nformal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal \nproceedings.” Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77 (1973). This right applies in \nthe prison disciplinary context, and prison officials may violate a prisoner’s right \nagainst self-incrimination if a prisoner’s silence alone results in punishment of \nthe kind capable of compelling waiver of the right.  See Minnesota v. Murphy, \n465 U.S. 420, 434 (1984); Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976); \nLaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban, 54 F.3d 387, 390 (7th Cir. 1995). Although \nnot all of his claims can be linked to his assertion of this right, Vermillion \nplausibly alleges that more than just the five administrators were involved in \nretaliating against him for his refusal to talk to the Internal Affairs investigators. \nVermillion claims that his placement in punitive segregation at ISP, his transfer \nto  the  Maximum  Control  Segregation  Unit  at  Westville,  and  the  alleged \nfalsification of documents to exaggerate his security classification and keep him \nconfined  in  segregation  were  punishments  aimed  at  retaliating  against  him \nbecause he asserted his right to silence. Because this claim points to joint conduct \nby the five administrators and four Internal Affairs investigators and would \ninvariably rely on some of the same facts as his due-process claim relating to the \ntransfer, Vermillion properly joined the defendants allegedly responsible. \n \nCase No. 14-2327, Mandate at dkt. 87-3 at p. 5.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The summary judgment record reflects that Vermillion was in solitary confinement for 1,513 \ndays or more than four years. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 3 of 28 PageID #: 1369\nFollowing the transfer of this action to this district, Vermillion was instructed to file a Third \nAmended Complaint. That pleading was screened and the following claims were permitted to \nproceed consistent with the Mandate. See dkt. 97.  \nClaim 1. Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, Ralph Carrasco, \nMark  Levenhagen,  Brett  Mize,  Howard  Morton,  Sally  Nowatzke,  and  Gary \nBrennan placed Vermillion in punitive segregation at ISP, transferred him to the \nMaximum Control Segregation Unit (the “Westville Control Unit” or “WCU”) at \nWestville, and confined him in segregation in retaliation for his assertion of his \nright to silence during an interview by internal affairs investigators.  \n \nClaim 2. Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, Ralph Carrasco, \nMark  Levenhagen,  Brett  Mize,  Howard  Morton,  Sally  Nowatzke,  and  Garry \nBrennan placed Vermillion in the Westville Control Unit for 1,513 days in violation \nof his right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.  \n \nClaim 3. Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, Ralph Carrasco, \nMark  Levenhagen,  and  Brett  Mize  transferred  Vermillion  from  the  ISP  to \ndepartment-wide  administrative  segregation  at  the  Westville  Control  Unit  in \nviolation of his due process rights.  \n \nClaim 4. Howard Morton confiscated Vermillion’s certified legal mail in \nviolation of his due process and First Amendment rights.  \n \nThe defendants seek summary judgment as a matter of law on all but the claim against Levehagen \nand  Mize  related  to  Vermillion’s  transfer  from  the  ISP  to  department-wide  administrative \nsegregation at Westville in violation of his due process rights. See claim 3. The defendants argue \nthat they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all other claims.  \n  Given the age of the case and the number of claims and defendants the evidentiary record \nis  relatively  sparse.  In  support  of  summary  judgment,  the  defendants  present  Vermillion’s \ndeposition (including 30 pages of exhibits), a two page declaration from Charles Whelan, and an \naudio recording of Vermillion’s July 29, 2009, interview with internal affairs officers. Vermillion \nopposes summary judgment. In addition to his Third Amended Complaint, which was signed under \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 4 of 28 PageID #: 1370\npenalty of perjury, he presents fourteen exhibits which all appear to be IDOC records.2 The \ndefendants replied and Vermillion submitted a surreply. The motion for summary judgment is now \nfully briefed. \nII.  Summary Judgment Standard \nA motion for summary judgment asks the court to find that a trial is unnecessary because \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and, instead, the movant is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, \nwhether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the \nasserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or \naffidavits.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A).  A party can also support a fact by showing that the \nmaterials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse \nparty cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B).  \nAffidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be \nadmissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(c)(4).  Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant’s factual assertion \ncan result in the movant’s fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of \nsummary judgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).    \nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court need only consider disputed facts \nthat are material to the decision.  A disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the \n                                                 \n2 The Seventh Circuit has held that a complaint “is the equivalent of an affidavit for summary \njudgment purposes” when it is verified under penalty of perjury and based on personal knowledge. \nLocke v. Haessig, 788 F.3d 662, 665 (7th Cir. 2015) (citing Devbrow v. Gallegos, 735 F.3d 584, \n587 (7th Cir. 2013). \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 5 of 28 PageID #: 1371\nsuit under the governing law.  Williams v. Brooks, 809 F.3d 936, 941-42 (7th Cir. 2016).  In other \nwords, while there may be facts that are in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate if those facts \nare not outcome-determinative.  Montgomery v. American Airlines Inc., 626 F.3d 382, 389 (7th \nCir. 2010).  Fact disputes that are irrelevant to the legal question will not be considered.  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nOn summary judgment, a party must show the court what evidence it has that would \nconvince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events.  Gekas v. Vasilades, 814 F.3d 890, 896 \n(7th Cir. 2016).  The moving party is entitled to summary judgment if no reasonable fact-finder \ncould return a verdict for the non-moving party.  Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 875 (7th Cir. \n2009).  The court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draws \nall reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.  Skiba v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., 884 F.3d 708, 717 \n(7th Cir. 2018).  It cannot weigh evidence or make credibility determinations on summary \njudgment because those tasks are left to the fact-finder.  Miller v. Gonzalez, 761 F.3d 822, 827 \n(7th Cir. 2014).  The court need only consider the cited materials, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), and the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly assured the district courts that they are not \nrequired to “scour every inch of the record” for evidence that is potentially relevant to the summary \njudgment motion before them.  Grant v. Trustees of Indiana University, 870 F.3d 562, 573-74 (7th \nCir. 2017).  Any doubt as to the existence of a genuine issue for trial is resolved against the moving \nparty.  Ponsetti v. GE Pension Plan, 614 F.3d 684, 691 (7th Cir. 2010).   \n   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 6 of 28 PageID #: 1372\nIII. Material Facts \nA.  Parties \n1.  Willard Plank was, at all times relevant to the allegations made against him in the \nThird Amended Complaint, an employee of the Indiana Department of Correction (“IDOC”), \nDivision of Internal Affairs as Chief Investigator. Other than his participation in the July 29, 2009, \ninterview, Vermillion has no information regarding Plank’s involvement in the circumstances at \nissue in this case. \n 2.  Dawn Buss was, at all times relevant to the allegations made against her in the Third \nAmended Complaint, an IDOC employee, Division of Internal Affairs as Deputy Chief. Other than \nher participation in the July 29, 2009, interview, Vermillion has no information regarding Dawn \nBuss’s involvement in the circumstances at issue in this case. \n3.  Charles Whelan was, at all times relevant to the allegations made against him in the \nThird Amended Complaint, employed by the IDOC in the Division of Internal Affairs at the ISP \nas Internal Affairs Officer 3. Vermillion had no interaction with Charles Whelan other than the \ninterview.  \n4.  Ralph Carrasco was, at all times relevant to the allegations made against him in the \nThird Amended Complaint, an employee of IDOC, Division of Internal Affairs at ISP as Internal \nAffairs Officer 4. Vermillion’s only support for a claim against Carrasco is that he prepared a \nconduct report charging Vermillion with a trafficking offense.  \n5.  Mark Levenhagen was at all times relevant to the Third Amended Complaint \nemployed by IDOC as the Superintendent of Westville Correctional Facility. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 7 of 28 PageID #: 1373\n6.  Brett Mize was, at all times relevant to the allegations made against him in the Third \nAmended Complaint, employed by IDOC as Director of Operations. Vermillion was told that he \nwas placed in department-wide administrative segregation by Mize. Mize was “the one who \ndecided whether or not you were going to be placed in this administrative segregation status.” \n(Vermillion Dep. 42:24-43:1.) \n7.  Howard  Morton  at  all  relevant  times  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint  was \nemployed by the IDOC at ISP as an Administrative Assistant.  \n8.  Sally  Nowatzke  at  all  relevant  times  to  the  Third  Amended  Complaint  was \nemployed by the IDOC at Westville as a Counselor. She served as a case manager who worked in \nthe WCU.  \n9.  Gary Brennan at all relevant times to the Third Amended Complaint was employed \nby the IDOC at Westville as an Administrative Assistant. Brennan was one of the officials who \noversaw the WCU.  \nB. Investigation and transfer \n1.  On July 12, 2009, Offenders Lance Battreal, Charles Smith, and Mark Booher \nescaped from ISP, which is located in Michigan City, Indiana.  \n2.  During the course of the investigation into the escape, information was received \nfrom an offender that Unit Team Counselor Don Bates and Vermillion were trafficking tobacco \ninto ISP and that the proceeds were being stored in the law library. During a subsequent interview \ninto the allegations of trafficking with offenders, Bates confessed to trafficking tobacco with \nVermillion.  \n3.  Based on this information, investigators decided to interview Vermillion.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 8 of 28 PageID #: 1374\n4.  On July 29, 2009, Vermillion was taken from his cell at ISP to the Internal Affairs \nOffice, where he was interviewed by IDOC Internal Affairs Investigators Charles Whelan, Dawn \nBuss, and Willard Plank. The audio recording reviewed by the court reflects that the Officers \nwanted Vermillion to assist with their investigation and they suggest that if he cooperated he might \nbe permitted to keep his cat in “lock up.” Dkt. 200, manual filing, audio recording at 4:48. \nVermillion then asks “why would I go to lock up?” Id. at 5:18. He is told for trafficking. Id. at \n5:32. One of the officers goes on to say that they spoke with Bates yesterday and that “he doesn’t \nwork here any longer.” Id. at 5:40.  Vermillion asks what that has to do with him. Id. at 5:41. The \nanswer cannot be discerned from the audio, but the Officer goes on to state that they would like \nVermillion to assist them because he has “a wealth of information you could help us with.  That \npertains to escape, to trafficking with Bates, cell phones, tobacco three or four times a week.  We \nhave a general idea of what’s going on but we just want you to play ball with us, that’s all.” Id. at \n6:04-6:24. Vermillion then told Plank “I don’t think we have anything else to talk about.” Id. at \n6:44; Ver. Dep. 10:22-23. In response, Plank said “okay lock him up.” Audio at 6:47. \n   5.  Plank then explained that Vermillion would be placed in segregation pending the \ninvestigation and the outcome would probably be a charge of trafficking with a staff member. \nAudio at 6:52.  In addition, if as a result of the investigation it was determined that he was involved \nwith the escape he would be charged with aiding and abetting the escape. Audio at 7:11. \n6.  Plank then asked “you got any questions?” Vermillion said “no.” Audio at 7:22. \n7.  Vermillion  was  handcuffed  and  taken  from  the  interview  to  the  disciplinary \nsegregation unit (“IDU”).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 9 of 28 PageID #: 1375\n8.  On July 31, 2009, Internal Affairs Investigator Ralph Carrasco prepared a conduct \nreport charging Vermillion with trafficking with Indiana State Prison Counselor Don Bates.  The \nconduct report provides in relevant part: \n \n \n9.  A few days later, a screening officer met with Vermillion and provided him with a \nscreening report indicating that he was under investigation for trafficking with staff. Vermillion \nwas also provided a Segregation/Confinement Report which informed him that he was being \nplaced in segregation pending investigation for trafficking with staff. Dkt. 208-1.3  \n10.  Prior to his confinement in segregation, Vermillion worked in the law library. \nFollowing the internal affairs interview, a search of the law library uncovered $12,000 in cash and \nfour pounds of tobacco.  \n                                                 \n3 The defendants note that Mr. Bates pled guilty to trafficking as a Class C Felony under Indiana \nCode § 35-44-3-9. State of Indiana v. Donald Bates, 46D02-1004-FC-000022, docket sheet \navailable  online  at  mycase.in.gov.  The  docket  sheet  reflects  that  Mr.  Bates’  sentence  was \nsuspended and served as probation. After probation was successfully completed, the charge was \nconverted to a Class A Misdemeanor.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 10 of 28 PageID #: 1376\n11.  Trafficking in money and tobacco is a security risk to the orderly operation of a \nprison  facility.  Segregating  an  offender  involved  in  trafficking  is  a  means  of  disrupting  a \ntrafficking network.  \n   12.  Whelan testified that Vermillion was placed in segregation pending the outcome of \nthe investigation into trafficking, and not because he refused to answer questions during his \ninterview. Any offender involved in trafficking would be placed in segregation and Vermillion \nwas not treated any differently.   \n13.  Vermillion was confined in the IDU from July 29 to August 12, 2009.  \n14.  On August 12, 2009, Vermillion was found guilty of trafficking and transferred \nfrom ISP to the Westville Control Unit or WCU. He was sentenced to one year in disciplinary \nsegregation, lost 30 days of earned good time credit and was demoted from Credit Earning Class \nI to Credit Earning Class II. Dkt 209 at 5. Vermillion’s trafficking conviction was vacated for \nrehearing three times.4 The Seventh Circuit’s Order which remanded Vermillion’s petition for a \nwrit of habeas corpus in Vermillion v. Superintendent, 3:12-cv-150-PPS, was decided years after \nthis civil rights action was initiated. That Order discusses the fact that Vermillion was not given \nnotice of the charge alleged against him. See Vermillion v. Mark E. Levenhagen, Case No. 12-2436 \n(7th Cir. March 26, 2013) (nonprecedential disposition) (attached to this Entry). On February 13, \n2014, however, instead of conducting a fourth hearing of the trafficking charge, Vermillion’s \n                                                 \n4 See Vermillion v. Superintendent, Cause No. 3:10-cv-119-PPS (N.D. Ind. March 16, 2011), \nVermillion  v.  Superintendent  3:11-cv-123-TLS  (N.D.  Ind.  October  24,  2011),  Vermillion  v. \nSuperintendent 3:12-cv-150-PPS (N.D. Ind. 2012). All filed in the Northern District of Indiana \nand attacking Vermillion’s trafficking conviction. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 11 of 28 PageID #: 1377\ntrafficking charge of July 29, 2009, was dismissed and the entire matter was expunged from his \nrecord. Dkt. 208 at ¶ 58. \n15.  Vermillion repeatedly argues that he should never have been found guilty of \ntrafficking because on July 29, 2009, he was being interviewed by internal affairs and not available \nfor trafficking. There is no doubt the conduct report was flawed. The conduct reports lists, for the \ndate of offense, the date when the prison counselor confessed that he and Vermillion trafficked. \nThe Seventh Circuit noted that “The only incident date appearing in this record is July 29, and the \nprison does not contend that it ever believed that this date was correct.” Vermillion, No. 12-2436 \nat p. 4. The conduct report does not reflect that on that date and time Vermillion was actively \ninvolved in trafficking. Dkt. 208-1 at p. 2. It is for this reason that the anticipated testimony of ISP \nOfficers Sabinski, McCormack and Walker and ISP Disciplinary Hearing Board Chairman Bessie \nLeonard is insufficient to create a material fact in dispute. These individuals were expected to \ntestify that it was not possible for Vermillion to have been trafficking with staff in I-Cellhouse at \nthe exact date and time he was being interrogated by Internal Affairs Investigators. There is no \ndispute that Vermillion was not trafficking on July 29, 2009. \n16.  On or about August 12, 2009, WCU case counselor Sally Nowatzke and WCU \nDirector  of  Operations  Gary  Brennan  falsified  information  and  documentation  to  increase \nVermillion’s security classification designation so that he could be housed at the super max \nfacility.  \n17.   Vermillion testified that from August 12, 2009, he was placed in C-Pod where \npsychotic, out-of-control, and unmanageable inmates are housed. For the next three and a half \nyears he was subjected to the following conditions. Dkt. 208 at p. 7. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 12 of 28 PageID #: 1378\na. complete isolation in a solid concrete cell with a solid steel door \nfor 23-24 hours a day; \n \n  b. no direct contact or interaction with others; \n  c. extreme cold; \n  d. constant strobe-lighting; \n  e. cell-flooding; \n  f. mace fumes; \n  g. people threatening to and actually committing suicide; \n  h. no actual recreation; \n  i.  no telephone use (for two and a half years); \n  j. no work, income, or educational opportunities; \n  k. no religious services; \n  l. no hot water; \n  m. cold meals; \n  n. regular cell ransacking; and  \n  o. humiliating strip-searches. \n 18.  In October of 2009, Vermillion met with Doug Barnes who informed him that he \nwas being placed on department-wide administrative segregation per Brett Mize.5  \n19.  Howard Morton’s only involvement in this lawsuit was with regard to Vermillion’s \nlegal mail. Vermillion wrote letters and hand-drafted affidavits for Sergeant Sabinski, Officer \nSpringfield, and Officer Day. Vermillion wanted the Sergeant and Officers to sign affidavits in \n                                                 \n5 There is no indication that this classification changed Vermillion’s physical placement or the \nconditions of his confinement listed above at paragraph number 17.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 13 of 28 PageID #: 1379\nsupport of his appeal from his prison disciplinary conviction for trafficking. Howard Morton sent \nVermillion two letters informing Vermillion that he received the letters and that IDOC staff would \nnot be signing affidavits for Vermillion. Sergeant Sabinski, Officer Springfield, and Officer Day \nwere not Vermillion’s attorneys, but were employees of the Indiana Department of Correction. \nThe letters reflect the following: \n \nDkt. 196-1 at 136.  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 14 of 28 PageID #: 1380\n \nThis letter was located in Vermillion v. Superintendent, 3:10-cv-119-PPS, at dkt 1-1.  \n20.  Vermillion is now back in general population. (Ver. Dep. 50:16-19.) \n21.  Spending 1,513 days on an ergonomically incorrect mat, in a painfully cold cell, \nand without access to a chair caused Vermillion spinal problems. In addition, being placed in \nsolitary confinement under harsh conditions without due process and based on a conduct report \nthat was ultimately expunged caused him mental, emotional and psychological injury.  \nIV.  Discussion \nA. Retaliation \n  Vermillion’s  first  claim  is  that  Willard  Plank,  Dawn  Buss,  Charles  Whelan,  Ralph \nCarrasco, Mark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Howard Morton, Sally Nowatzke, and Gary Brennan \nplaced Vermillion in punitive segregation at ISP, transferred him to the Maximum Control \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 15 of 28 PageID #: 1381\nSegregation Unit (the “WCU”) at Westville, and confined him in segregation in retaliation for his \nassertion of his right to silence during an interview by internal affairs investigators. Dkt. 97, p. 2. \nFor the reasons explained below, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim. \nAs a preliminary matter, Vermillion argues that the Seventh Circuit’s “decree of March 5, \n2015,” decided that the evidence was sufficient to support his claim of retaliation and that this \nruling  is  binding  in  all  subsequent  proceedings,  including  the  instant  summary  judgment \nproceedings. Dkt. 209 at p. 5. Vermillion is mistaken. The standard for surviving a motion to \ndismiss is different from the summary judgment standard set forth above. The fact that plausible \nclaims were identified based solely on accepting the allegations in the complaint as true, is not the \nsame as a finding that there is evidence to support those claims for purpose of summary judgment. \nThus the Seventh Circuit’s opinion is not evidence that can be used for the purposes of defeating \nsummary judgment, just as this court’s entry cannot be used as evidence to support either party at \na future trial.  \nTo prevail on his First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show that “(1) he \nengaged in activity protected by the First Amendment; (2) he suffered a deprivation that would \nlikely deter First Amendment activity in the future; and (3) the First Amendment activity was ‘at \nleast a motivating factor’ in the Defendants’ decision to take the retaliatory action.”  Bridges v. \nGilbert, 557 F.3d 541, 546 (7th Cir. 2009); see Mays v. Springborn, 719 F.3d 631, 635 (7th Cir. \n2013); Devbrow v. Gallegos,  735 F.3d 584, 588 (7th Cir. 2013) (“Retaliation requires a showing \nthat the plaintiff’s conduct was a motivating factor in defendant’s conduct.”). \nThere is no dispute that Vermillion engaged in protected activity when he refused to \nprovide information to assist internal affairs with the investigation into trafficking and other \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 16 of 28 PageID #: 1382\nprisoners’ escapes. The Fifth Amendment gives a person the right “not to answer official questions \nput to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might \nincriminate him in future criminal proceedings.” Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77 (1973). This \nright applies in the prison disciplinary context, and prison officials may violate a prisoner’s right \nagainst self-incrimination if a prisoner’s silence alone results in punishment of the kind capable of \ncompelling waiver of the right. See Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 434 (1984); Baxter v. \nPalmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 317 (1976); LaSalle Bank Lake View v. Seguban, 54 F.3d 387, 390 (7th \nCir. 1995). \nThere is also no dispute that Vermillion suffered deprivations that would likely deter First \nAmendment activity in the future. For example, he was placed in punitive segregation at ISP; he \nwas transferred to WCU, and he was kept in solitary confinement for more than four years. \n  Retaliation also requires a showing that the plaintiff’s conduct was a motivating factor in \nthe  defendants’  conduct.  Mere  speculation  is  insufficient  to  meet  this  burden.  Devbrow  v. \nGallegos, 735 F.3d 584, 588 (7th Cir. 2013). A defendant can prevail if he shows that the offending \naction would have happened even if there had been no retaliatory motive, i.e., the alleged harm \nwould have occurred anyway. Mays v. Springborn, 719 F.3d 631, 634-35 (7th Cir. 2013). If \ndefendants meet this burden, Vermillion must then show that the defendants’ proffered reason is \npretextual, that is, a lie. Thayer v. Chiczewski, 705 F.3d 237, 250 (7th Cir. 2012). \nThe defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to all of Vermillion’s retaliation \nclaims because no reasonable fact finder could conclude that Vermillion’s refusal to answer \nquestions about other prisoner’s escapes on July 29, 2009, was a motivating factor in any \ndefendant’s decision to take retaliatory action. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 17 of 28 PageID #: 1383\nThe audio recording of the interview with internal affairs reflects that Vermillion was told \nthat he was going to lock up for trafficking before he was asked to “play ball” and assist with the \ninvestigation. Vermillion then told Plank “I don’t think we have anything else to talk about,” and \nPlank then said “okay lock him up.” Audio at 6:44.  Plank then explained that Vermillion would \nbe placed in segregation pending the investigation and the outcome would probably be a charge of \ntrafficking with a staff member. Audio at 6:52. In addition, if as a result of the investigation it was \ndetermined that Vermillion was involved with the escape he would be charged with aiding and \nabetting the escape. Audio at 7:11. \n  The adverse actions taken against Vermillion were all based on the investigation into \ntrafficking. Internal Affairs Officer Whelan testified that another offender reported to internal \naffairs that then Unit Team Counselor Don Bates and Vermillion were trafficking tobacco into ISP \nand that the proceeds from the trafficking were being stored in the law library. Bates also confessed \nto  trafficking  tobacco  with  Vermillion.  Searches  were  conducted  at  ISP  that  uncovered \napproximately $12,000 in cash hidden in the law library and four pounds of tobacco. Vermillion \nwas treated like any other offender believed to be involved with trafficking in that he was placed \nin segregation.  \nVermillion disagrees with this conclusion arguing that he has alleged a chronology of \nevents from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred. In particular, Vermillion argues that \nimmediately after he asserted his right to terminate the internal affair’s interview he was placed in \nsolitary confinement in the facility’s punitive segregation unit. He argues that the conduct report \nwas issued as a pretext to justify his segregation.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 18 of 28 PageID #: 1384\nAs explained above, however, the decision to send Vermillion to “lock up” was made prior \nto Vermillion stating that he was done talking to the internal affairs officers. In addition, his \nplacement in segregation was a result of the trafficking investigation. Vermillion goes on to claim \nthat he was charged with an offense that could not have occurred; that is, trafficking with \nCounselor Don Bates in I-Cellhouse at 9:30 a.m. on July 29, 2009, which is the exact date and \ntime he was being interrogated by defendants Plank, Buss, and Whelan. Vermillion is correct that \nthe conduct report was poorly written and ambiguous, but that does not negate the fact that internal \naffairs conducted an investigation into Vermillion trafficking tobacco with Bates and that internal \naffairs concluded after locating thousands of dollars in the law library that trafficking had occurred. \nAccepting the record in the light most favorable to Vermillion, it is possible that he was not \ninvolved in trafficking, but the undisputed evidence is that the internal affairs officers believed he \nwas. In addition, the undisputed facts show that Vermillion was segregated as a result of an \ninvestigation showing evidence of ongoing trafficking, and not because he was believed to be \ntrafficking in the Internal Affairs office on July 29, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. Under these circumstances \nthe deficient conduct report does not establish that the explanation for his segregation was a \npretext. \nFinally, there is no evidence to support the assertion that defendants were motivated to \ndeny Vermillion due process during the disciplinary proceedings because he refused to assist the \ninternal affairs investigation. Vermillion argues that a number of IDOC employees would testify \nthat they were instructed to take actions with respect to Vermillion in retaliation for his invocation, \nor they “understood” he was placed in the WCU in retaliation for refusing to answer questions \nconcerning the July 12, 2009, escape of three men from ISP. See dkt. 194. But this testimony, even \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 19 of 28 PageID #: 1385\nif accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment, it is insufficient to create a material fact in \ndispute because the testimony does not include any reference to the individual defendants or how \nthe individual defendants were involved in retaliating against Vermillion. Instead, this anticipated \ntestimony appears to show that certain non-parties were aware of or participating in retaliation. \nHearsay statements are insufficient to survive summary judgment. \nThe  IDOC’s  due  process  failures  and  Vermillion’s  extended  placement  in  solitary \nconfinement are problematic for the reasons discussed below, but there is no evidence that \nretaliation was a motivating factor.  \n  No reasonable trier of fact could conclude that that the adverse actions Vermillion faced \nwere the result of the defendants’ retaliating against him for exercising his Fifth Amendment \nrights. Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the retaliation \nclaim. \nB.   Conditions of Confinement at Westville Control Unit \n \n  Vermillion next claims that Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, Ralph Carrasco, \nMark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Howard Morton, Sally Nowatzke, and Gary Brennan placed \nVermillion in the Westville Control Unit for 1,513 days in violation of his Eighth Amendment \nright to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. See dkt. 97, pp. 2-3. For the reasons explained \nbelow, Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, Ralph Carrasco, and Howard Morton are \nentitled to summary judgment because they lack personal involvement in the conditions of \nconfinement Vermillion faced in the WCU. Meanwhile, the Eighth Amendment claim shall \nproceed as to Mark Levenhagen, Brett Mize, Sally Nowatzke and Gary Brennan.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 20 of 28 PageID #: 1386\nIn Isby v. Brown, 856 F.3d 508 (7th Cir. 2017), the Seventh Circuit explained that in order \nto prevail on a conditions of confinement claim,  \ntwo elements are required to establish a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment: first, an objective showing that \nthe conditions are sufficiently serious—i.e., that they deny the inmate “the \nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities,” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. \n337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), creating an excessive risk to the \ninmate’s health and safety—and second, a subjective showing of a defendant’s \nculpable state of mind. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, \n128  L.Ed.2d  811  (1994).  We  have  held  that  “prolonged  confinement  in \nadministrative segregation may constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment \n... depending on the duration and nature of the segregation and whether there \nwere feasible alternatives to that confinement.” Rice ex rel. Rice v. Corr. Med. \nServs., 675 F.3d 650, 666 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing Walker v. Shansky, 28 F.3d 666, \n673 (7th Cir. 1994)); see also Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 416 (7th \nCir. 1987). \n \nId. at 521. \nThe  defendants  do  not  provide  any  evidence  as  to  the  conditions  of  confinement \nVermillion faced in the WCU. Instead, they argue that Vermillion has failed to articulate a \nsingular, legally cognizable human need of which he has been deprived. The defendants point out \nthat the Seventh Circuit has held that “[i]nactivity, lack of companionship and a low level of \nintellectual stimulation do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment even if they continue for \nan indefinite period of time.” Isby v. Brown, 856 F.3d 508, 522 (2017) (quoting Bono v. Saxbe, \n620 F.2d 609, 612 - 614 (7th Cir. 1980)). They further argue that given the “extensive case law \nrejecting Eighth Amendment claims based upon”  conditions  of  confinement  like  those  found \nat the Westville Control Unit, “[w]ithout some egregious deprivation … complaints about the \nconditions of confinement fall short.” Isby,  856 F.3d 508, 522 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that the \ndistrict court did not err in rejecting an Eighth Amendment challenge to the conditions of \nconfinement in the Special Confinement Unit at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 21 of 28 PageID #: 1387\nVermillion testified that for more than four years he was subjected to complete isolation \nin a solid concrete cell with a solid steel door for 23-24 hours a day with no direct contact or \ninteraction with others. While in his cell he was exposed to extreme cold, constant strobe-lighting, \ncell-flooding, mace fumes, people threatening to and actually committing suicide, no actual \nrecreation, no telephone use (for two and a half years), no work, income, or educational \nopportunities, no religious services, no hot water, cold meals, regular cell ransacking, and \nhumiliating strip-searches. Unlike the plaintiff in Isby there is no suggestion that Vermillion’s \nfailure to cooperate was the reason he remained in the WCU. In addition, unlike the plaintiff in \nIsby, there is no basis in the record to conclude that Vermillion was a security threat beyond the \nfact that he had been investigated for trafficking with an officer. Vermillion attached Executive \nDirective #09-07 dated January 21, 2009 (effective date February 15, 2009). This directive and \nthe disciplinary appeal for case number ISP 09-08-0006 reflect that the disciplinary segregation \ntime associated with the trafficking conviction (which was later expunged) was limited to 30 days \non October 8, 2009. Dkt. 208-1 at 6. These facts suggest that “there were feasible alternatives to \nthat confinement.”  Isby, 856 F.3d at 521. \nUnder these circumstances, the defendants request to find that there was no sufficiently \nserious deprivation must be denied. Similarly, the claim that Vermillion has not alleged an injury \nsufficient to survive summary judgment is rejected. He testified that the cold caused him pain, the \ndeprivation of human contact associated with solitary confinement caused him psychological \ninjury, and that the accommodations injured his back. Dkt. 209 at p. 27. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 \nU.S. 678, 686-87 (1978) (“[T]he length of confinement cannot be ignored in deciding whether the \nconfinement meets constitutional standards.”); Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2210 (2015) \n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (discussing “[t]he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation” \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 22 of 28 PageID #: 1388\nId. at 2209) (citing Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U.J.L. & Pol’y \n325 (2006) (common side-effects of solitary confinement include anxiety, panic, withdrawal, \nhallucinations, self-mutilation, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors)).  \nNext, the defendants argue that several defendants lack the requisite personal involvement \nsuch that there is no evidence that suggests they had the necessary culpable state of mind. Plank, \nBuss, and Whelan were involved in Vermillion’s interview and the investigation into trafficking, \nbut there is no evidence that they were involved in any of the events that transpired after he was \ninitially placed in segregation after leaving the Internal Affairs office. As for Carrasco, he drafted \nthe conduct report, but Vermillion has no information about what Carrasco did after that or any \ninformation showing that he was involved in any of the events that would transpire after he left \nthe Indiana State Prison.  \nA defendant can be held liable under Section 1983 only for deprivations that he or she \npersonally caused, either by direct action or by approval of the conduct of others – vicarious \nliability cannot support a Section 1983 claim. Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. \n658, 694 (1978). Moore v. State of Indiana, 999 F.2d 1125, 1129 (7th Cir. 1993) (liability under \nSection 1983 must be based on personal responsibility, not respondeat superior). In order to be \nheld responsible for the violation of a federally secured right pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, an \nindividual must have personally participated in the alleged constitutional violation. Zimmerman v. \nTribble, 226 F.3d 568, 574 (7th Cir. 2000) (citing Starzenski v. City of Elkhart, 87 F.3d 872, 879 \n(7th Cir.1996)). Accordingly, Plank, Buss, Whelan, Carrasco and Morton are entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law on the Eighth Amendment claim based on the conditions of confinement \nVermillion faced in WCU. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 23 of 28 PageID #: 1389\nAs to the remaining defendants, Superintendent Levenhagen, Sally Nowatzke, Brett Mize \nand Gary Brennan, the claims against them shall proceed as submitted. Vermillion argues that \nthese defendants had to have known of the risks inherent to long-term solitary confinement but \ndeliberately subjected Vermillion to those conditions for more than three years such that a jury \ncould conclude they possessed the sufficiently culpable state of mind. Dkt. 209 at p. 28. In the \nabsence of any evidence from the defendants to contradict this claim, Vermillion’s argument is \naccepted. Each of these defendants knew or should have known that Vermillion had been placed \nin solitary confinement for over four years under conditions readily apparent.  \nIn  particular,  Vermillion  testified  that  Nowatzke  and  Brennan  were  responsible  for \nchanging/falsifying Vermillion’s security classification so that he would remain in the WCU. \nBrennan was also responsible for confiscating of Vermillion’s television and the destruction of \nVermillion’s personnel effects which impacted the conditions of Vermillion’s confinement and is \nconduct consistent with deliberate indifference. In addition, given the nature of the undisputed \nconditions in the WCU, Superintendent Levenhagen and Brett Mize, the officer who placed \nVermillion on department-wide administrative segregation status in the WCU as the IDOC \nDirector of Operations, should have known of the conditions Vermillion faced and were the \nindividuals in the best position to correct the problems. “A defendant will be deemed to have \nsufficient personal responsibility if he directed the conduct causing the constitutional violation, or \nif it occurred with his knowledge or consent.” Sanville v. McCaughtry, 266 F.3d 724, 740 (7th Cir. \n2001).  \n Summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim based on \nVermillion’s placement in solitary confinement for 1,513 days in the WCU is denied as to \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 24 of 28 PageID #: 1390\nDefendants Brennan, Nowatzke, Levenhagen and Mize. \nC. Transfer to Department-Wide Administrative Segregation \nVermillion alleges that Plank, Buss, Whelan, Carrasco, Levenhagen, and Mize, transferred \nhim from the Indiana State Prison to department-wide administrative segregation at WCU in \nviolation of his due process rights. There is no dispute that Vermillion did not have a liberty interest \nin avoiding a transfer to Westville. However, inmates transferred to a “supermax” prison are \nentitled to informal, non-adversarial due process.  Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 229-29 \n(2005) (describing supermax facilities “as maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive \nconditions,  designed  to  segregate  the  most  dangerous  prisoners  from  the  general  prison \npopulation.” Id. at 213). This informal due process requires “‘some notice’ of the reasons for the \ninmate’s placement . . . and enough time to ‘prepare adequately’ for the administrative review.” \nWestefer v. Neal, 682 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir. 2012). This informal review procedure need only \ntake place within a ‘reasonable time’ of the inmate’s transfer to the supermax facility. Id. The \nSupreme Court has held that when an inmate is transferred to administrative segregation, he must \nhave: \nan opportunity to present his views to the prison official charged with deciding \nwhether  to  transfer  him  to  administrative  segregation.  Ordinarily  a  written \nstatement  by  the  inmate  will  accomplish  this  purpose,  although  prison \nadministrators may find it more useful to permit oral presentations in cases where \nthey believe a written statement would be ineffective. So long as this occurs, and \nthe decisionmaker reviews the charges and then-available evidence against the \nprisoner, the Due Process Clause is satisfied. \n \nHewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 476 (1983) (quoted by Westefer, 682 F.3d at 685). No written \ndecision describing the reasons for an inmate’s placement or appeal procedure is required. \nHowever, a periodic review of the placement determination is required. Id. See also Littler v. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 25 of 28 PageID #: 1391\nIndiana Dep't of Corr. Com'r, No. 3:11-CV-218 CAN, 2013 WL 4551072, at *1 (N.D. Ind. Aug. \n28, 2013) (discussing available damages when IDOC agreed constitutionally required due process \nhearing was denied prior to placement in department-wide administrative segregation unit).  \nVermillion argues that because the defendants have not argued or offered any evidence that \nthey complied with the requirements of Wilkerson and Westefer and Vermillion has testified that \nhe was not given due process, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the defendants violated \nhis due process rights. In particular, defendants Levehagen and Mize do not seek summary \njudgment as to this claim. These defendants are allegedly responsible for Vermillion’s transfer \nfrom the ISP to department-wide administrative segregation in the WCU at Westville in violation \nof his due process rights. The due process claim against defendants Levehagen and Mize shall \nproceed. \nWillard  Plank,  Dawn  Buss,  Charles  Whelan,  and  Ralph  Carrasco  do  seek  summary \njudgment on this claim. These defendants were involved in Vermillion’s original placement in \nsegregation, but there is no evidence they were involved in Vermillion’s placement in department-\nwide  administrative  segregation  which  was  a  decision  made  by  Mize  and  approved  by \nLevenhagen. Accordingly, they are entitled to summary judgment on the due process claim.  \nD. Certified Mail Seeking Affidavits \nVermillion’s final claim for relief is that defendant Morton confiscated three pieces of \ncertified  legal  mail  in  violation  of  Vermillion’s  due  process  and  First  Amendment  rights. \nVermillion explains that the mail included a cover letter, proposed affidavit of staff witnesses and \na self-addressed stamped envelope. Morton intercepted this mail and in a letter dated October 16, \n2009, advised Vermillion that, after consulting with IDOC’s legal staff, no employees would be \nsigning affidavits for him.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 26 of 28 PageID #: 1392\nThe  letters  were  directed  toward  Vermillion’s  administrative  appeal  of  his  prison \ndisciplinary sanction. The letters requested that three staff members sign affidavits. Sgt. Sabinski \nwas asked to testify to the fact that on Wednesday, July 29, 2009, at 8:40 a.m., he escorted \nVermillion to the Internal Affairs office and that Vermillion never returned to I-Cellhouse. Sgt. \nSpringfield was asked to testify that on Wednesday, July 29, 2009, at 8:40 a.m. he witnessed Sgt. \nSabinski escort Vermillion to the Internal Affairs office and that Vermillion did not return to I-\nCellhouse. Dkt. 196-1 at 125. Sgt. Day was asked to testify to the fact that Vermillion’s August \n12, 2009, disciplinary hearing was conducted by only one hearing officer. Dkt. 196-1 at 127.  \nThese letters including the affidavits were not entitled to any special protection. “Inmates \nhave a First Amendment right both to send and receive mail, but that right does not preclude prison \nofficials  from  examining  mail  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  contain  contraband.”  Kaufman  v. \nMcCaughtry, 419 F.3d 678, 685 (7th Cir. 2005). Vermillion’s rights were not violated when \nHoward Morton reviewed mail sent by Vermillion to employees of the Department of Correction \nwho were not his attorneys and responded that IDOC staff would not sign his affidavits. In \naddition, Vermillion was not injured by the confiscation of these letters. The content reflects that \nhe intended to use them to challenge his trafficking conviction. That conviction was ultimately \nexpunged. Under these circumstances, Vermillion was not injured by Morton’s confiscation of the \nletters nor was he denied access to court. Had the disciplinary hearing process worked properly (it \ndid not), the proper manner for Vermillion to receive the testimony he sought was by requesting \nwitnesses statements.  \nMorton is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. \n   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 27 of 28 PageID #: 1393\nV. Conclusion \nThe defendants’ motion for summary judgment, dkt [196], is granted in part and denied \nin part.  \nDefendants Howard Morton, Willard Plank, Dawn Buss, Charles Whelan, and Ralph \nCarrasco are entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to all claims alleged against them. The \nclerk is directed to terminate these five defendants on the docket. \nAll defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the retaliation claim. \nSummary Judgment is denied as to the claim that Mark Levenhagen, Sally Nowatzke, Brett \nMize and Gary Brennan violated Vermillion’s Eighth Amendment rights through his placement in \nthe Westville Control Unit for 1,513 days.  \nSummary Judgment is denied as to the claim that Mark Levenhagen and Brett Mize \ntransferred  Vermillion  from  the  ISP  to  department-wide  administrative  segregation  at  the \nWestville Control Unit in violation of Vermillion’s due process rights.   \n  No partial final judgment shall issue at this time as to the claims resolved in this Entry.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n   \n5/22/2018\n27 \n \n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 214   Filed 05/22/18   Page 28 of 28 PageID #: 1394\n \n \nDistribution: \n \nJAY F.

VERMILLION,     \n    \nPlaintiff,     \n    \nv.         Case No. 3:11-CV-280 JVB\n    \nWILLARD PLANK, et al.,     \n      \nDefendants.     \nOPINION AND ORDER\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the Court screens this prisoner plaintiff’s Amended\nComplaint and will strike it, with leave to amend, because the claims it asserts against various\ndefendants are insufficiently related to each other. See George v. Smith, 507 F.3d 605, 607 (7th\nCir. 2007) (explaining the need and proper approach for § 1915A screening of prisoner\ncomplaints that contain unrelated claims).\nPlaintiff is confined at the Westville Control Unit (“WCU”) and proceeding pro se. His\nfirst complaint, which, like the Amended Complaint, arose under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, asserted a\nvariety of claims that Indiana Department of Correction (“IDOC”) officials violated his federally\nprotected rights in myriad respects. The Court screened and struck that complaint, as well, but\nleft Plaintiff time “within which to file an amended complaint containing only a single claim or\nrelated claims, and providing the materials necessary to serve the defendants.” (DE 8 at 3.) In\nresponse, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint naming as Defendants the IDOC and twenty-\ntwo individual IDOC officials, some of whom are employed at the WCU and some of whom are\nemployed at the Indiana State Prison (“ISP”).\nSo we are now back for the next round of obligatory screening by the Court. Under\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 13   Filed 02/02/12   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 86\n§ 1915A, the Court must review the merits of a prisoner complaint against governmental entities\nor officials and dismiss it if the action is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such\nrelief. A district court must question and “reject” any complaint that contains unrelated claims\nagainst separate defendants. George, 507 F.3d at 607.\nAs noted in this Court’s previous screening order (DE 8 at 2), the Seventh Circuit has\ncriticized a district court for disregarding the George case, and reemphasized “that unrelated\nclaims against different defendants belong in separate lawsuits, not only to prevent the sort of\nmorass produced by multi-claim, multi-defendants suits like this one, but also to ensure that\nprisoners pay all fees required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act.” Owens v. Hinsley, 635\nF.3d 950, 952 (7th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court explained such\ncomplaints “should be rejected, George, 507 F.3d at 607, either by severing the action into\nseparate lawsuits or by dismissing improperly joined defendants.” Owens, 635 F.3d at 952.  \nPlaintiff’s Amended Complaint, like the first complaint, is similar to the one rejected in \nGeorge in that it seeks to make a single case from unrelated claims involving events that\noccurred at two separate IDOC facilities. Most of Plaintiff’s claims arose at the ISP, but he also\nalleges that his transfer from the ISP to the WCU, which is a “supermax” facility, violated his\ndue-process rights (DE 11 para. 7) and that the physical conditions of confinement he has been\nsubjected to at the WCU violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishments (id. para. 9).\nThe Amended Complaint drops several of the claims presented in his original complaint,\nbut still asserts ones involving events that occurred at two different facilities, the ISP and the\n2\n\nCase 1:15-cv-00605-RLY-TAB   Document 13   Filed 02/02/12   Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 87\nWCU, and still names officials at both facilities as defendants. As instructed by George and\nOwens, this Court will therefore strike Plaintiff’s multi-claim Amended Complaint with leave to\nthe Plaintiff to file a separate complaint or complaints incorporating only related claims. He may\nbring only properly related claims in his next amended complaint in this case. Unrelated claims\nmust be brought in separate cases. For example, if Plaintiff brings his claims related to the WCU\nin this case, he would bring the claim that ISP officials violated his rights in another complaint.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n(1) STRIKES the amended complaint (DE 11);\n(2) DIRECTS the clerk to send Plaintiff, along with his copy of this Order, a blank\nPrisoner Complaint 42 U.S.C. § 1983 form with this cause number already printed on it,\nsummonses, and USM-285 forms; \n(3) GRANTS Plaintiff up to and including March 8, 2012, within which to file an\namended complaint containing only a single claim or related claims arising at the same facility,\nand providing the materials necessary to serve the defendants; and\n(4) CAUTIONS Plaintiff that if he does not respond by that deadline, this case may\nclosed without further notice. \nSO ORDERED on February 2, 2012.\n s/ Joseph S. Van Bokkelen                   \nJOSEPH S. VAN BOKKELEN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n3",
