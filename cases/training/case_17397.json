Plaintiff was present in person and by counsel. The Defendants were present by counsel and Defendants Jerry Snyder and Richard Brown appeared in person. At the conclusion of Monday's proceedings, counsel for the Plaintiff raised a desire to obtain additional blood tests. The Court instructed counsel to provide authority the next morning as to how the Court could be engaged in the process of obtaining blood tests on the Plaintiff for purposes of this case. No authority was presented and counsel did not raise the issue again, so the Court construes any request concerning additional blood tests as having been withdrawn. Plaintiff rested. Defendants James Wynn, Beverly Gilmore, Julie Snider, Jack Hendrix, and Dusty Russell moved for judgment as a matter of law in their favor pursuant to Rule 50(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That motion was granted as to Defendants James Wynn, Julie Snider, and Dusty Russell, and denied as to Defendants Jack Hendrix and Beverly Gilmore. No partial final judgment shall issue at this time. The remaining Defendants are Richard Brown, Jack Hendrix, Jerry Snyder, and Beverly Gilmore. Defendants began their case-in-chief. Exhibits 101, 101a, and 102 were admitted without objection. Plaintiff offered Exhibit 7 and it was admitted with Defendants' sustained objection that it be offered only for its use as a demonstrative aid. The following witnesses testified: Jaymison Bennett, Frank Busby, Amy Reed, Chris Nicholson, Jerry Snyder, and Richard Brown. Defendants rested. Plaintiff Aaron Isby-Israel was called as a rebuttal witness. Counsel gave closing arguments. The parties have through August 28, 2015, in which to submit Final Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The Court took this matter UNDER ADVISEMENT. Court was adjourned.

The Court is mindful that \"prolonged  confinement in administrative segregation may constitute a violation of the  Eighth Amendment (and therefore the Fourteenth), depending on the duration and  nature of  the segregation and whether there were feasible alternatives to that  confinement.\" Townsend, 759 F.3d at 690 (internal quotation omitted). And prior  to trial the Court considered the duration of Mr. Isby-Israel's confinement in administr ative  segregation to be stunning, but the Court has found no case under similar  circumstances where duration alone, coupled with a prisoner's refusal to  participate in correctional programming, supported a finding of a  constitutional violati on. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the  defendants are entitled to judgment in their favor, and the plaintiff shall  take nothing from his second amended complaint. Final judgment shall now issue  consistent with this Entry and with the Entry of July 30, 2013 (dismissing  defendants Lemmon and Knight).  Signed by Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson on 9/25/2015. (BGT)"

Judgment was entered September 25, 2015. On October 13, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for copy of transcript of bench trial which states that the plaintiff \"is in the process of or contemplating of pursuing an appeal to the Seventh Circuit.\" Dkt. 137. He requests that a transcript of the bench trial conducted on July 27, and July 28, 2015, be provided to him at no cost. The plaintiff's motion for copy of transcript of bench trial [dkt. 137] is denied as premature and incomplete with respect to whether the transcripts can be provided at public cost. The motion [dkt. 137], however, is also treated as a motion for extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal. To that extent, the Court finds good cause and the motion is granted. See Rule 4(a)(5) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The original deadline to file a timely notice of appeal is October 26, 2015. That deadline is extended to November 25, 2015. No further extensions will be granted. In addition to the notice of appeal and motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the plaintiff shall file a separate renewed motion requesting that the transcripts be paid by the United States. The motion for transcripts should set forth the reasons any portion of the transcript which is sought is necessary for the appeal. (See Entry.) Copy to plaintiff via US Mail.

It is confusing for the Court and the record to have the plaintiff file motions on his own. In short, at this time, the plaintiff is not pro se. The Court will only consider filings made through counsel.

On September 26, 2018, the Court conducted the second day of a bench trial in this case. Plaintiff appeared in person and by recruited counsel Daniel Kelley, Burnell Grimes and Jason Rauch. Defendants Jerry Snyder, Jack Hendrix, and Richard Brown appeared in person and by counsel David Arthur and Ryan Sterling. The parties shall have through October 11, 2018, in which to file: 1. A joint timeline of Mr. Isby's 30 day reviews, 90 day reviews, annual classification reviews and requests for transfer and any related appeals, identifying on the timeline the exhibit number that corresponds to the event. 2. A 10-page post-trial brief that includes a discussion of: a. whether the Defendants contention that plaintiff's failure to request a 90-day results in a waiver of any claim for failure to provide such a review comports with existing precedent concerning Defendants obligation to provide meaningful, periodic reviews of Mr. Isby's segregation designation b. the measure of compensatory damages available for an alleged constitutional violation (excluding any discussion of emotional distress and pain and suffering) and whether any such award is limited to nominal damages; and c. any other matter the parties wish to brief within the 10-page limit. Signed by Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson. (SEE ORDER FOR MORE DETAILS.). Signed by Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson on 9/28/2018.(MRI) (Entered: 09/28/2018)"

    "summary": "<p>On May 15, 2020, the plaintiffs, inmates at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility, filed a complaint pro se in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, claiming that their indefinite solitary detention in the Secure Housing Unit (SHU) violated their rights. They sued the Indiana Department of Corrections (IDOC), which runs the facility, under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201. They sought declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, a temporary restraining order, damages, and costs.</p><p>Specifically, they alleged that the defendants placed them in the SHU for over five years without committing an identifiable infraction, and stayed in the facility for indefinite periods. As a result, they claimed that they were denied access to the facility's exercise yard and law library, had their mail searched, and were denied in-person visitation with their families. In addition, they alleged that the guards at the facility hindered their ability to make this claim by forcing them into a burdensome grievance process that they claimed they worked within. They alleged that this led to intense emotional distress. They claimed that this treatment violated the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and substantive and procedural due process clause. In addition, the defendants invoked the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), saying that their treatment violated the basic rights laid out in these treaties.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 5. They added a First Amendment violation due to the guards' refusal to let the plaintiffs discuss their case or make their claims in court and a Sixth Amendment violation blocking access to legal counsel and the courts.  After receipt of this amended complaint, Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson issued an order dismissing parts of the complaint without prejudice on September 10, 2012 (2012 WL 3966363, S.D.Ind.). She dismissed the claims relating to the grievance process, saying that the inmates' access to the process fulfilled the requirements for due process, and the international law claims, since treaty law alone does not create a cause of action in the United States. She also removed the extra plaintiffs from the suit. She allowed the Eighth Amendment and substantive due process claims related to indefinite detention to continue. The plaintiff submitted a statement of revised complaints reflecting the Judge's statement on September 24; this was treated as the complaint going forward. </p><p>The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff's due process claims on September 23, 2014. After discovery, the plaintiff's disciplinary history showed a pattern of violent behavior and non-cooperation with prison staff, which Judge Magnus-Stinson showed to be sufficient to justify his stay in SHU in an entry granting summary judgment on the issue on June 24, 2014 (2014 WL 2866197, S.D.Ind.). Discovery also demonstrated that the facility regularly conducted administrative reviews every 30 days and reviews where the plaintiff could state his case every 90 days. Judge Magnus-Stinson said that this was more than the due process clause requires of inmates. The defendants did not seek summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment claim, and asked the plaintiff to show cause that the claim had not been abandoned, which he did on August 11, 2014.</p><p>The defendants never filed another summary judgment motion, and a bench trial on the Eighth Amendment issue occurred in July 2015. The plaintiff was now represented by counsel. On September 25, 2015 (2015 WL 5672702, S.D.Ind.), Judge Magnus-Stinson ruled in the defendants' favor, saying that, while she was concerned about the length of time the plaintiff was in solitary confinement, which now totaled over eight years, he has regularly been given avenues to get out of solitary confinement and chose not to take them. In addition, she ruled that the lighting, access to food and clothing, and communication with outside counsel did not violate the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff moved to appeal on October 15, 2015.</p><p>On February 6, 2017, the defendants in the original trial moved to dismiss the appeal, noting that one of the plaintiff's separate appeals surrounding a refusal to provide him with Kosher meals was dismissed on February 3 and the facts in that case were nearly identical to this one. For the appeal, the plaintiff retained private counsel. In an opinion dated May 10, 2017 (856 F.3d 508, 7th Cir.), an appeals panel composed of Judges Diane Wood, Joel Flaum, and William Conley upheld the District Court's decision on the Eighth Amendment claim, reiterating Judge Magnus-Stinson's reasoning. However, the panel reversed and remanded Judge Magnus-Stinson's grant of summary judgment on the due process claim, noting that for a stay this long in the SHU, more process may be needed than brief statements on the outcomes of 30-day reviews. </p><p>Upon remand, a bench hearing with Judge Magnus-Stinson was set for September 24, 2018. On December 19, 2018, Judge Magnus-Stinson released an opinion ruling that the defendants violated the plaintiff's due process rights because the periodic reviews of his continued detention in SHU were \"perfunctory\" and continued to punish him for acts years ago instead of providing new offenses each time. She also noted a discrepancy in previous statements from the defendants; initially, during summary judgment motions, she was told that 30-day reviews are sufficient due process, but, during this hearing, the defendants claimed that the real reviews were the 90-day ones, which, theoretically, would allow the 30-day reviews to be surface-level. Judge Magnus-Stinson granted $314,000 in compensatory damages and a total of $22,500 in punitive damages spread across multiple defendant-employees in the IDOC. </p><p>In addition, she granted the plaintiff's claim of injunctive relief and directed the defendants to draw up a plan for the plaintiff's release from SHU; when created, the plaintiff would have 14 days to contest it. On January 4, 2019, the defendants provided the plan, which would move the plaintiff to a general population cell immediately but mandated that the plaintiff participate in a SHU release program for permanent integration into general population. The plaintiff filed a motion contesting this plan two weeks later, saying that the program could extend indefinitely based on assessments of his behavior, and he hoped a more expeditious SHU release plan could be found. On March 4, 2019, Judge Magnus-Stinson approved the defendant's plan, since it immediately moved him out of SHU, the point of the initial injunction. </p><p>This closed the case in District Court. However, the defendants appealed the final decision to circuit court on April 2, 2019. All proceedings in the case were stayed on March 20, 2020, with the circuit court asking for an update on the status of mediation by May 20, 2020. No update has been filed, likely due to COVID concerns; the case is ongoing.</p>",

Conclusion   \nFor the foregoing reasons, Isby is ordered to pay in full all \nFootnotes \n \n*  Of the Western District of Wisconsin, sitting by designation. \n   \n1  Indiana Department of Corrections (โIDOCโ) Policy #01โ04โ101, โAdult Offender Classification,โ allows for an \n  offender to be placed in department-wide administrative segregation when that offender has a history of battery on \nothers, presents an extraordinary threat to themselves or others, or presents special safety and security concerns. \nSection 11โ10โ1โ7 of the Indiana Code similarly provides that an inmate may be involuntarily segregated from the \ngeneral population if the IDOC โfirst finds that segregation is necessary for the offenderโs own physical safety or the \nphysical safety of others.โ Ind. Code ยง 11โ10โ1โ7(a). \n \n2  According  to  Isby,  defendants-appellees  neither  gave  him  a  hearing  prior  to  placing  him  in  administrative \n  segregation in 2006 nor notified him of his placement by prison mail, and he was placed in the SCU absent any \nemergency condition, charge, prison disturbance, or investigation. As the district court noted, however, with respect \nto any claim arising from Isbyโs initial placement in the SCU without notice or a hearing, the two-year statute of \nlimitations applicable to ยง 1983 actions arising from an alleged injury in Indiana has expired. See Ind. Code ยง \n34โ11โ2โ4; Serino v. Hensley, 735 F.3d 588, 590 (7th Cir. 2013). \nAs an aside, from December 29, 2014, to March 29, 2015, Isby was held in disciplinary restrictive-status housing in \nthe SCU. His placement in this even more restrictive form of segregation presumably stemmed from a December \n2014 incident described in further detail below, see infra n.8; and his time in disciplinary restrictive-status housing is \nnot at issue in this appeal. \n \n3  This means that Isbyโs general, non-legal mail is routinely searched and read. Outgoing legal mail is checked to \n  ensure that it is entitled to treatment as legal mail but is not otherwise read, copied, or otherwise interfered with in \neither sending or receipt. \n \n4  The meals served apparently average approximately 2500 calories, or just under ninety percent of the standard. \n   \n5  Isby  takes  issue  with  the  district  courtโs  focus  on  only  his  recent  weight  fluctuations,  but  as  the \n  defendants-appellees point out in their brief, the court focused on the more recent time period because Isby had \nsubmitted into evidence Aramark menus dating back only to September 2010; and any claim accruing before May \n15, 2010, would be barred by the two-year statute of limitations. \n \n6  Section 11โ10โ1โ7 of the Indiana Code provides that the IDOC โshall review an offender [involuntarily segregated \n  from the general population] at least once every thirty (30) days to determine whether the reason for segregation \nstill exists.โ Ind. Code ยง 11โ10โ1โ7(a) and (b). \n \n \n\n \nIsby v. Brown, 856 F.3d 508 (2017)   \n \n \n7  See IDOC Policy #02โ01โ111, VII.A (โIt shall not be necessary to hold a formal Classification Committee Hearing in \n  order to complete this review.โ). \n \n8  In December 2014, Correctional Officer Jaymison Bennett went to Isbyโs cell to retrieve the phone from Isby when \n  his twenty minutes of allotted phone time was up. Isby became angry because Officer Bennett did not allow him \ntime to say goodbye. Isby testified that he then placed the phone on the โcuff-port,โ a small opening in the cell door \nthrough which prisonersโ hands can be handcuffed. Bennett testified that Isby threw the phone toward the cuff-port \nof his closed cell door. Video evidence showed that Isby swiped his hand toward the officer through the cuff-port. \nBennett then sprayed Isby with pepper spray, and Isby was found guilty of โattempted battery without a weapon.โ \nThere is no allegation that Isby made any physical contact with the officer, either with the phone handset or his \nhand. \n \n9  The operative complaint named as defendants Richard Brown (Superintendent at Wabash Valley), Bruce Lemmon \n  (Commissioner  of  IDOC),  James  Wynn  (Director  of  Classification  for  IDOC),  Stanley  Knight  (Interim  Deputy \nCommissioner for IDOC), Jack Hendrix (Assistant Superintendent at Wabash Valley), Jerry Snyder (SCU Unit Team \nManager at Wabash Valley), Beverly Gilmore (Casework Manager at Wabash Valley), Julie Snider (Counselor at \nWabash Valley), and Dusty Russell (Custody Supervisor at Wabash Valley). \n \n10  In June 2013, defendants Knight and Lemmon moved to dismiss, arguing that sovereign immunity barred Isbyโs \n  action against them and that neither of them was personally involved in the alleged deprivations of Isbyโs \nconstitutional rights. Isby did not oppose this motion, and in July 2013, the district court dismissed Knight and \nLemmon. \n \n11  After Isby presented his case during the bench trial, defendants Wynn, Beverly, Gilmore, Snider, Hendrix, and Russell \n  moved for judgment as a matter of law in their favor. The district court granted that motion as to Wynn, Snider, and \nRussell, leaving Brown, Hendrix, Snyder, and Gilmore as the remaining defendants below. \n \n12  Isby cites to Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1996), in which the Ninth Circuit held that summary judgment was \n  inappropriate where an inmate alleged that large fluorescent lights kept his cell constantly illuminated and caused \nsleeping issues and other mental and psychological problems. See id. at 1090โ91. Here, however, the district court \nweighed all available evidence at trial and found that Isby was allowed to cover his eyes with clothes or towels if the \nlight disturbed him. And, as defendants point out, the lights in Keenan involved โlarge fluorescent lights,โ not \nfive-to-nine-watt bulbs. \n \n13  But see Kervin v. Barnes, 787 F.3d 833, 837 (7th Cir. 2015) (โThe serious psychological consequences of ... \n  quasi-solitary imprisonment have been documented.โ) (collecting sources). \n \n14  It is true that there is no guarantee that participating in the IDOC self-help programs would necessarily lead to Isbyโs \n  return to the general population (unlike compliance with the prison rules at issue in Rodriguez or Freeman, or the \nexplicit testimony by prison officials in Sostre), or that program participation is a necessary predicate to being \nreleased from administrative segregation. And there was some dispute as to the extent to which Isby was aware of \nthe degree to which an IDOC program was a necessary predicate to his being released from the SCU. Regardless, the \ndistrict courtโs factual assessments of these programs do not strike us as clear error, and, given the lack of evidence \nof egregious conditions in the SCU or serious suffering on Isbyโs part, we affirm the courtโs verdict on Isbyโs Eighth \nAmendment claim. \n \n15  Defendants-appellees claim that the trial transcript does not support Isbyโs assertion that the 1990 incident is the \n  sole reason for his placement in the SCU. But Lieutenant Nicholson did testify that he never recommended Isby for \nrelease from the SCU โ[b]ecause he killed a ... dog and stabbed two officers.โ Nicholson also testified, however, that \n \n\n \nIsby v. Brown, 856 F.3d 508 (2017)   \n \n \nhe was not the sole decisionmaker, and Isby himself stated that he was eventually told that he was in the SCU \nbecause of his โconduct historyโ generally. \n \n16  Defendants-appellees argue that Smith held that the thirty-day review process at issue in this case passed \n  constitutional muster. But what we held in Smith was that the prison officialsโ uncontroverted affidavits established \nthat the inmates received notice and an opportunity to be heard on the front end as well as sufficiently frequent \nperiodic reviews. See 946 F.2d at 1254. The adequacy or potential pretextual nature of those periodic reviews was \nthus not at issue in that case. \n \n17  In response to a question from the district court during the bench trial, defendant Jerry Snyder, the Unit Team \n  Manager for the SCU at Wabash Valley, confirmed that he did not recall any conduct by Isby that prompted his \nmove from the general population to the SCU. And even accepting the district courtโs findings of fact on this issue \nand the trial testimony that Isby was โextremely argumentative and disrespectful,โ our own case law warns that \nlong stretches of solitary confinement may be too strict of a punishment for mere behavioral problems. See Kervin, \n787 F.3d at 837 (reminding prison officials and judges โto be alert for the potentially serious adverse consequences \nof protracted segregation as punishment for misbehavior in prison, especially ... nonviolent misbehaviorโ like \nrepeatedly talking back to prison guards). \n \n18  The district courtโs bench-trial order on Isbyโs Eighth Amendment claim concluded that Isby had โavenues that he \n  could take to lead him to general populationโ (emphasis added), which โhe simply has chosen not to attempt.โ But \nthese conclusions do not necessarily bear on Isbyโs due process claim (i.e., as to whether the existing process was \nsufficient). \n \n19  The Third Circuit also elaborated that โ[w]here ... the goal of the placement is solely and exclusively to encourage a \n  prisoner to improve his future behavior, the review should provide a statement of reasons, which will often serve as \na guide for future behavior (i.e., by giving the prisoner some idea of how he might progress toward a more favorable \nplacement).โ Toevs, 685 F.3d at 913; cf. Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005) \n(noting that Ohioโs requirement that a decisionmaker provide a โshort statement of reasons ... guards against \narbitrary  decisionmaking  while  also  ...  serv[ing]  as  a  guide  for  future  behaviorโ)  (citation  omitted).  The \ndefendants-appellees argue that even if they did not provide official notice or statements of reasons, Isby was \naware that he needed to improve his behavior and participate in the IDOC self-help programs in order to be eligible \nfor transfer. However, Isby argues that there was no guarantee that participation would lead to such a transfer and \nthat others were moved out of the SCU without participation, which raises issues of fact. \n \n20  The Second Circuit noted that, โin the main, Proctorโs behavior [in administrative segregation] has remained \n  positive,โ that he โhas gone long stretchesโincluding one period of almost four yearsโwithout any disciplinary \nreports,โ and that he โreceived just one disciplinary report between December 2011 and the close of the record in \nthis case.โ 846 F.3d at 603. \n \n21  At the hearing held shortly thereafter, the hearing officer found that Proctor posed a threat to the prison based on \n  his criminal history and misbehavior, including his past escape and his bad behavior during his first years in \ndisciplinary segregation. 846 F.3d at 603. \n \n \n \n \n ",

He is now so confined at the \nWestville Correctional Facility (โWestvilleโ).  Mr. Isby is confined in a small cell 23 hours a day, \nand allowed out for one hour of recreation, by himself. Whenever he leaves his cell, he is \nhandcuffed behind the back and his legs are shackled. He can shower only three times a week. He \neats all his meals alone from food trays passed through a narrow opening in his cell door. A security \nlight remains on 24 hours a day, disturbing his sleep. He is allowed no physical contact with any \nvisitors. Under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, he is entitled to meaningful \nperiodic reviews to determine whether he remains a security risk and restrictive housing is still \nwarranted. Instead, he has received nothing but perfunctory 30-day reviews and occasional 90-day \nreviews. Often, he is not given a reason for his continued segregation, and recent reasons given for \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 2 of 37 PageID #: 3666\ndenying his release from solitary confinement have been his poor attitude and refusal to participate \nin step-down programming.  Brought to mind are the words of an anguished creation in a classic \nnovel: โI am malicious because I am miserable.โ Mary W. Shelley, Frankenstein, 99 (Millennium \nPublications 1818 ed., copyright 2014). \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \n  The Court conducted a second bench trial in this action on September 25 and 26, 2018 in \nIndianapolis, Indiana, after the action was remanded by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in \nIsby v. Brown, 856 F.3d 508 (7th Cir. 2017). Mr. Isby was present in person and by counsel.1 All \ndefendants were present by counsel. Defendant Beverly Gilmore was present in person on the first \nday of trial and Jack Hendrix was present in person on the second day of trial.  Defendants Jerry \nSnyder and Richard Brown were present in person both days.  \nOn the second day of trial, counsel for the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of \nlaw as to defendants James Wynn, Beverly Gilmore, Julie Snider, Jack Hendrix, and Dusty Russell. \nThat motion was granted as to defendants James Wynn, Julie Snider, and Dusty Russell and denied \nas to defendants Beverly Gilmore and Jack Hendrix. The claims against defendants Richard \nBrown, Jack Hendrix, Jerry Snyder, and Beverly Gilmore will be resolved in this Entry.  \nThe  issue  for  trial  following  the  Seventh  Circuitโs  remand  is  whether  Mr.  Isbyโs \nconfinement  in  long-term  administrative  restrictive  status  housing,  also  known  as  solitary \nconfinement, at Wabash Valley has deprived him of a liberty interest without due process. More \nspecifically, the Seventh Circuit remanded this action for trial on the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess claim after finding that โ[g]iven the long stretches of time during which Isby had no serious \n                                                   \n1 The Court greatly appreciates the dedicated and capable representation that volunteer counsel, Daniel R. \nKelley, Melissa M. Orizondo, Burnell K. Grimes, and Jason M. Rauch of Faegre Baker Daniels LLP \nprovided to the plaintiff.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 3 of 37 PageID #: 3667\ndisciplinary problems, as well as the conflicting evidence as to the reasons for his ongoing \nsegregation, Isby has raised triable issues of material fact regarding whether his reviews were \nmeaningful or pretextual.โ Isby, 856 F.3d at 529. After consideration of the evidence presented \nduring the bench trial, the Court now issues its findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1).2  \nI.  Findings of Fact3 \nA.  Mr. Isbyโs Institutional History \nMr.  Isby  has  been  incarcerated  in  the  Indiana  Department  of  Correction  (โIDOCโ) \ncontinuously since April 1989, based on a conviction of robbery with serious bodily injury. In \nOctober of 1990, when incarcerated at the Pendleton Correctional Facility (โPendletonโ), Mr. Isby \nhit a unit counselor in the face. A canine unit was ordered into Mr. Isbyโs cell to perform a cell \nextraction and Mr. Isby stabbed two correctional officers and killed the canine with a homemade \nweapon. He was convicted of two counts of attempted murder and battery and was sentenced to \nan additional forty years in prison. He was placed in administrative restrictive status housing after \nthe 1990 stabbings at Pendleton. The terms โsegregation,โ โadministrative segregation,โ โsolitary \nconfinement,โ and โrestrictive status housingโ will be used interchangeably in this Entry because \nthey mean the same thing. Dkt. 271 at 173-74.  \n  In October of 2006, Mr. Isby was transferred to Wabash Valley. Mr. Isby had been found \nguilty of battery in April 2006 at the Indiana State Prison and served 6 months in โdisciplinaryโ at \nWestville before he was transferred to Wabash Valley. Dkt. 271 at 50, lines 7-20; Ex. Nos. 145-\n                                                   \n2 Any finding of fact that is more properly considered a conclusion of law is adopted as such. Similarly, \nany conclusion of law that is more properly considered a finding of fact is adopted as such.  \n \n3 Some undisputed facts gleaned from the first trial have been included in these Findings of Fact for \nbackground as needed.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 4 of 37 PageID #: 3668\n153. He was initially placed in the general population where he remained for 19 days. On October \n23, 2006, he was placed in department-wide administrative segregation. Defendant Jerry Snyder \ntestified that nothing happened during those 19 days to warrant him being placed in restrictive \nhousing. Dkt. 271 at 50, lines 1-20. The reclassification was based on Mr. Isbyโs โextensive and \nserious conduct history,โ his having โstabbed a correctional officer in the throat,โ ex. 200, and his \nbeing a โthreat to facility security.โ Ex. Nos. 154-55.4  \n  Mr. Isby is kept in his 7โ x 12โ cell 23 hours a day. A light stays on 24 hours a day, which \ndisrupts his sleep, frustrates him, and stresses him out. He is not allowed to cover the light. Unlike \ninmates in general population, when he leaves his cell, he is handcuffed behind his back, and \nsometimes is shackled with leg irons. Unlike inmates in general population, he has no access to \nvocational work or educational programs. When he is taken out for recreation, he can walk around \nan area that is about the size of two cells, by himself. He is allowed three showers a week, while \ngeneral population inmates shower daily. Unlike general population inmates, he cannot have \ncontact visits, meaning he cannot hug or have physical contact with family members. He is allowed \nmuch less time using a phone than general population inmates, about 20 minutes a week. Dkt. 270 \nat 45-48.  \n  When Mr. Isby receives 30-day reviews, he learns about them after the fact when a copy \nof the form is placed in his packet. Dkt. 270 at 80. He did not receive a โfullโ 90-day review each \ntime he requested one. He requested 90-day reviews for three years from 2006 to 2009 but never \nreceived one. He requested 90-day reviews from Ms. Gilmore and from Mr. Snyder in March and \nJune of 2010, and May and June of 2012, but received no response. Dkt. 270 at 81-82.  \n                                                   \n4 This action was filed on May 15, 2012. At trial, evidence was admitted dating back to 2002, but for \npurposes of the applicable two-year statute of limitations, the Court will limit most of its discussion to the \nreview procedures that were in place in 2010 and thereafter. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 5 of 37 PageID #: 3669\nMr. Isby was conduct clear from March 10, 2000 through May 26, 2005, for a total of five \nyears and two months. Dkt. 270 at 59, lines 5-11. He was also conduct clear from March 24, 2009 \nthrough December 15, 2014, for a total of five years and eight months. Dkt. 270 at 53, lines 11-\n19. He received a B level conduct report5 in December 2014, for attempted battery without a \nweapon.6 Ex. E. Mr. Isby has also been conduct clear from December 15, 2014 until September \n25, 2018, the date of trial, for a total of three years and nine months. Dkt. 270 at 53, lines 23-25.   \nMr.  Isby  is  not  willing  to  participate  in  any  type  of  programming  to  get  out  of \nadministrative segregation. Dkt. 270 at 74-5. Mr. Isby appealed his classification reviews on a \nnumber of occasions dating back to September of 2009, but they were all denied. Ex. Nos. 85, 223-\n25, 96, 198, 122, 201, 203, 208, 209, 223, 194, 213, 17, 215, 42, 43, 231. There was no response \ngiven to Mr. Isbyโs appeal of a 90-day review in May 2011 even though it was Warden Brownโs \nresponsibility to ensure that a decision was issued. Dkt. 271 at 104-105; Ex. 122. In June of 2012, \nMr. Isby appealed the denial of a transfer request. Ex. 203. This appeal was denied at the facility \nand was not sent to the Director of Classification, whose office is supposed to review appeal \ndenials. Dkt. 271 at 214-217.  \n                                                   \n5 Level C and D offenses are relatively minor, D being the lowest of the offenses. Dkt. 270 at 108, lines 8-\n16. Level A (the most severe) and B offenses are considered major conduct offenses. Id. at 102, lines 17-\n21; dkt. 270 at 189, line 15.  \n \n6 The Court described this incident in findings after the first trial in this case as follows: โOn December 15, \n2014, Mr. Isby-Israel was using a phone in his cell. Correctional Officer Jaymison Bennett went to the cell \nto retrieve the phone when Mr. Isby-Israelโs 20 minutes of time was up. Mr. Isby-Israel became angry \nbecause the officer did not allow him time to say goodbye. Officer Bennett reported that Mr. Isby-Israel \nthrew the phone toward the cuff port on his cell door. Mr. Isby-Israel testified that he set the phone back on \nthe cuff-port. Video evidence shows that Mr. Isby-Israel took a swipe with his hand toward the officer \nthrough the cuff-port. Officer Bennett then sprayed Mr. Isby-Israel with OC spray and wrote him up for \nattempted battery without a weapon. Mr. Isby-Israel was found guilty of that disciplinary charge.โ Dkt. 135 \nat 4.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 6 of 37 PageID #: 3670\nSimilarly, in April of 2014, Mr. Isby appealed a 90-day review and no appeal decision was \nmade. Dkt. 271 at 113-114; Ex. 208. The response area on the form was left entirely blank. Dkt. \n271 at 218-19; Ex. 208. Mr. Isbyโs May of 2014 request to transfer to Indiana State Prison (โISPโ) \nwas denied and the written reason made by a superintendent was that Mr. Isby could not request \nthe transfer because ISP does not have department-wide restrictive housing. Dkt. 271 at 114-118; \nEx. 205.7 The Director of Classificationโs designee did not fill out the Central Office section on \nthe form, but she should have. Dkt. 271 at 217-18.  In addition to denying his ability to even make \nsuch a request, when Mr. Isby appealed, the reason the appeal was denied was that it was โnot \nappealable.โ Dkt. 271 at 119; Ex. 209. In accordance with policy, a decision on a transfer request \nis, in fact, appealable to the Executive Director of Classification. Dkt. 271 at 120. \nIn August of 2014, a full 90-day review was conducted. Ex. 213. At this time although Mr. \nIsby had been clear of any major conduct reports for more than six years dating back to a \nnonviolent level B offense in May of 2008 for filing frivolous lawsuits, his request for release from \ndepartment-wide restrictive status was denied. Dkt. 271 at 125-127. The caseworker at the time \nwrote that Mr. Isby had โan extensive conduct history,โ noting conduct reports for โbattery, \ndisorderly conduct and filing frivolous lawsuits.โ Ex. 213. The battery offense, however, was not \neven listed on the review document because it dated back to 2006.  The disorderly conduct offense \noccurred in October of 2007, seven years earlier. Id. In addition, the caseworker listed the 1990 \nstabbing incident as a reason for his decision. Id.  \nThe reason given by the Custody Manager in August of 2014 for denying release from \ndepartment-wide restrictive status was because Mr. Isby was โargumentative during interview and \n                                                   \n7 The only prisons in Indiana that have a department-wide restrictive housing unit are Wabash Valley, \nWestville, and Pendleton.  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 7 of 37 PageID #: 3671\nwas demanding open population instead of transition units.โ Dkt. 213 at 2. The STG (Security \nThreat Group) Coordinator commented that there was โno known STG affiliation. Remains \nconfrontational with staff.โ Id. Jerry Snyder wrote, โserious history of assaults against staff. \nRemains disrespectful and argumentative with staff as documented in this review. Harbors intense \nanger toward authoritative figures. Stated refusal to go to NCN-TU.โ8 Id. Warden Brown noted \nMr. Isbyโs โcomments made during the interview that he will not go to NCN-TU.โ Id. Mr. Isby \nwas not provided with a copy of the decision and comments after this review, as it was marked \nโconfidential.โ Dkt. 271 at 124, lines 3-4; Ex. 213. Warden Brown testified that had Mr. Isby been \nwilling to go to the NCN-TU, it would have been appropriate to transfer him there regardless of \nMr. Isbyโs behavior. Dkt. 271 at 129.  \nIn May 2015, Mr. Isby again requested a transfer to ISP. Ex. 14. His request was denied \nfor the reason โappropriately placed.โ Ex. 15. Mr. Isby appealed, pointing out that he had not been \ngiven any โrationaleโ for why his request was denied. Ex. 16. He also wrote that he had been in \nrestrictive  housing  for  nine  years  and  that  placement  was  not  based  on  โvalid  security \njustifications.โ Ex. 17. Deputy Commissioner Basinger denied the appeal, writing in July 2015, \nthat, โ[a]lthough Wabash Valley may not be the facility of your choosing, you are appropriately \nplaced. You are encouraged to continue working with staff and taking advantage of available \nprogramming.โ Ex. 18.  \nOn June 22, 2017, a month after the Seventh Circuit issued its remand in this case, Mr. \nIsby  was  transferred  to  Westville,  โper  administrative  request.โ  Ex.  217.  Warden  Brown \nrecommended the transfer. Dkt. 271 at 137. The reasons given for the transfer were โdepartmental \nneedsโ and โsuperintendent recommendation.โ Id.; Ex. 217. The additional reason of โrecent \n                                                   \n8 The STAND program at New Castle Correctional Facility, called NCN-TU (transition unit), is to help \ninmates transition from restrictive housing to general population. Dkt. 271 at 15, 55.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 8 of 37 PageID #: 3672\npositive adjustmentโ was added by Director of Classification Hendrix. Dkt. 271 at 226; Ex. 218. \nWarden Brown testified that after he consulted with Jerry Snyder, he recommended the transfer \nbecause Mr. Isby could benefit from โa change of scenery.โ Dkt. 271 at 138, lines 1-11. Jerry \nSnyder, at the direction of Director Hendrix at the Central Office, advised that Warden Brown \nshould complete a letter on Mr. Isby although that was not normal procedure. Mr. Snyder wrote \nthe letter to Michael Osburn, Southern Regional Director, for the Wardenโs signature. Dkt. 271 at \n138-141; dkt. 271 at 249; Ex. 219. The letter stated that Mr. Isbyโs continued placement in \ndepartment-wide administrative restrictive status housing in the Secure Confinement Unit at \nWabash Valley was โdue to an extensive history of staff assault and a refusal to participate in \nrecommended  self-help  programs.โ Ex. 219. The letter  described the 1990 incident and  his \nDecember 29, 2014 level B conduct report for reaching out of the cuffport of his cell in an attempt \nto assault an officer. Id. It further stated that Mr. Isby had refused to participate in programs \nrecommended by the unit team. Id. The letter also noted that the mental health evaluations revealed \nthat Mr. Isby did not exhibit signs or symptoms of an AXIS 1 Diagnosis and is not at high risk to \ndecompensate  in  a  Secure  Confinement  Unit.  Id.  The  transfer  did  not  change  Mr.  Isbyโs \nclassification  at  all.  Rather,  it  continued  his  placement  in  department-wide  administrative \nrestrictive status housing at a different prison. Id. Mr. Isby was not provided a copy of the letter \nbecause it was marked โconfidential.โ Id.  \nB.  Defendantsโ Review of Mr. Isbyโs Placement \n  Defendant Beverly Gilmore was a casework manager in the administrative restrictive \nhousing unit at Wabash Valley from 2008 until July 2014. Dkt. 270 at 91, 163-64. She supervised \nCharles Dugan, a caseworker. Her supervisor was defendant Jerry Snyder, the Unit Team Manager. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 9 of 37 PageID #: 3673\n  Ms. Gilmore conducted 30-day, 90-day, and annual reviews of inmatesโ placement in \ndepartment-wide restrictive housing. The only reviews that are conducted automatically are the \n30-day and the annual reviews. Dkt. 270 at 113, lines 6-10.  \nIn her affidavit presented in support of the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment, filed \non September 23, 2013, Ms. Gilmore testified that Mr. Isby โis reviewed for continued placement \nin the department-wide administrative segregation unit every thirty days pursuant to DOC policy.โ \nDkt. 52-1, ยถ14. She further stated, โ[t]he thirty-day review consists of examining the offenderโs \nCase Plan and other documents related to behavior, conduct, and safety concerns, as well as \nreviewing any conduct reports and history.โ Dkt. 52-1, ยถ12.  \nAt this second trial, Ms. Gilmore testified that she stood by her affidavit. Dkt. 270 at 113-\n115. She testified that to prepare for each 30-day review, she reviewed case notes, spent 30 minutes \nwith Mr. Isby if he allowed that, checked his conduct report history, talked to correctional officers \nassigned to the unit about his behavior to get their perspective, considered his behavior toward her \nand other inmates, and would also take into account whether he participated in programming such \nas the ACT (โAction, Consequences, and Treatmentโ) cognitive restructuring program. Dkt. 270 \nat 115-118. Participation in such a program was not required to be recommended for release from \nsegregation, but she considered it โextremely importantโ because it showed initiative. Id. at 147. \nParticipation in those programs also does not guarantee that an inmate will be released from \nsegregation, and some ACT graduates may remain in segregation even after completing the \nprogram. Id. at 118.  \nMs.  Gilmore  testified  that  she  also  always  referred  to  notes  in  the  Offender  Case \nManagement System (OCMS). This is where all treatment team staff could place case notes and \nrecord  incidents  of  rudeness  or  cursing,  and  where  all  conduct  reports  were  automatically \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 10 of 37 PageID #: 3674\npopulated. Id. at 118. Ms. Gilmore testified that for every 30-day review, she made an individual \ndecision regarding whether she would recommend the prisoner for release from segregation and \ninto  general  population. Dkt. 270 at 116, lines 9-13. In  sum, the  factors that  Ms. Gilmore \nconsidered during a 30-day review were โtheir conduct reports, cooperation, their behavior, \nprogramming completion, [and] staff interactions.โ Dkt. 270 at 175, lines 10-14; lines 23-25.  She \nalso noted, however, that the 30-day reviews could be โcookie cutterโ reviews โwhen there is \nnothing that has changed.โ Dkt. 270 at 174, lines 1-3. \nEach 30-day review form was titled โWVCF SECURED HOUSING UNIT, Administrative \nSegregation Review.โ The date of review, offenderโs name, identification number, location, and \nsegregation intake date were listed on each report. The body of each 30-day review that Ms. \nGilmore produced provided as follows: \nPer order of the Southern Regional Director, Offender Isby, Aaron, DOC #892219, \nis currently assigned to the Department-Wide Administrative Segregation Unit of \nthe Wabash Valley Correctional Facility. \n \nYour status has been reviewed and there are no changes recommended to the \nSouthern  Regional  Director  at  this  time.  Your  current  Department-Wide \nAdministrative Segregation status shall remain in effect unless otherwise rescinded \nby the Southern Regional Director. \n \nThis segregation review was prepared by B. Gilmore, CWM, Special Confinement \nUnit. If there are any questions regarding this report, they may be directed to either \nthe Unit Counselor or the Casework Manager.  \n \nE.g., Ex. Nos. 73, 74, 78, 81-83, 86, 88, 89, 91-93, 97, 99-117, 124 (dated Dec. 15, 2008, through \nApril 2013).  \nEvery 30-day review form was the same except for the date. The form was auto-populated. \nMs. Gilmore does not remember any 30-day review resulting in a recommendation of release out \nof segregation for any offender. Dkt. 270 at 129, lines 19-21; dkt. 270 at 175, lines 1-3 (โ[N]one \nof the times that you recommended release came as a result of the 30-day reviews, correct? \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 11 of 37 PageID #: 3675\nCorrect.โ). She did recall inmates being recommended for release as a result of 90-day or annual \nreviews. Dkt. 270 at 129, lines 7-15; dkt. 270 at 171, lines 19-25; dkt. 270 at 172, lines 1-10.  \nMs. Gilmore described Mr. Isby as โbelligerent, rude, and crudeโ toward her.  Dkt. 270 at \n141, lines 24-25. Of the 288 offenders in the SHU, Ms. Gilmore testified that Mr. Isbyโs โbehavior \nwas one of the top five most belligerent, hateful, meanโ inmates. Dkt. 270 at 170, lines 15-16. She \nwould go by his cell to give him his legal mail and he would tell her to โget the F away from my \ncell.โ Id. at lines 17-19. He was uncooperative, would not sign anything for her, and she could not \nget him to listen to her. Id. at lines 23-15. Nonetheless, when asked, โMr. Isbyโs behavior generally \nwasnโt extraordinary to the point where you had to write him up, correct?โ  She replied, โCorrect.โ \nId. at 96.  \nMs. Gilmore conducted an annual review of Mr. Isbyโs classification on September 24, \n2009. Ex. 84. At that time, Mr. Isby had a single relatively minor conduct violation, a C-level, in \nthe prior year. Dkt. 270 at 99, lines 10-20. His classification remained unchanged.  \nNinety-day reviews with a hearing occur only when requested by staff or by the inmate, \nbut Ms. Gilmore is not aware of any staff member who initiated a 90-day review without Mr. Isby \nrequesting it. Dkt. 270 at 101, lines 16-25; dkt. 270 at 102, lines 1-11. She conducted a 90-day \nreview on April 27, 2011. Id. at 102, lines 1-3; Ex. 98. At that time, Mr. Isby had had no conduct \nreports since March 24, 2009, the C-level offense of โlying or providing false statement,โ meaning \nhe had been conduct clear for more than two years. Id. at 104, lines 1-4; Ex. 98. Ms. Gilmore \nadmitted that being conduct clear for more than two years would be one โvery positiveโ factor \nwhen considering whether to recommend release from segregation. Dkt. 270 at 104, lines 5-13. \nMs. Gilmore did not, however, recommend Mr. Isbyโs release from segregation. Id. at 106, lines \n6-12. Ms. Gilmore wrote the following in the review: \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 12 of 37 PageID #: 3676\nOffender believes he is all knowing about policy, procedure, and the law. He seems \nto enjoy trying to start arguments with staff. He is not a pleasant person. After \nresearching his institutional packet, I chose to add the paragraph regarding Isbyโs \nโFreedom Fightersโ activity from 1999 through 2000. I believe this exposes insight \ninto his deceptive cognitive behavior. It is my conviction that given the opportunity \nin general population Isby will have more freedom to play havoc with any situation \npossible in the [sic] order to satisfy his own wants and perceived needs.9 \n \nEx. 98 at 3. \nMs. Gilmore considered the Freedom Fighters incident, a C-level offense, as a factor for \nkeeping Mr. Isby in segregation 11 years later. Dkt. 270 at 107, lines 10-22; dkt. 270 at 108, lines \n13-17.  The  Custody  Manager,  STG  Coordinator,  Unit  Manager  J.  Snyder,  Assistant \nSuperintendent, and Superintendent D. Brown all signed the 90-day review, and circled โnot \nrecommendedโ on the form. Dkt. 98 at 3. Their comments included โdo [sic] to his violent history,โ \nโno known STG, extremely violent past, and could not maintain in G.P. (general population) the \nlast time in G.P.โ Id. Defendant Snyder commented โextremely violent past as described above.  \nHe has not done well in GP when given the opportunity (B212 on 4/4/06 in GP at ISP).โ Id.  \nOne month after the April 2011 90-day review, Ms. Gilmore conducted an annual review \nin May 2011. Not surprisingly, this review also indicated that in the prior 12-month period, Mr. \nIsby had no conduct reports. Ex. 121. Again, as of that time Mr. Isby had maintained clear conduct \nsince March 24, 2009, more than two years prior to the review. Dkt. 270 at 103, lines 13-25. The \nMarch 24, 2009, C-level conduct report was written for โlying or providing a false statement.โ Ex. \n98. The conduct report before that was issued in May 2008 for โfiling a frivolous lawsuit.โ Id. Ms. \nGilmore testified that it was Mr. Isbyโs โattitude and actionsโ that kept her from recommending \nhim for release to general population in 2011. Dkt. 270 at 101, lines 7-10. She would not \n                                                   \n9 The paragraph referenced states, in part, โIn 1999, Isby attempted to create a Non-Profit organization \ncalled โFreedom Fighters.โ The first of the investigations was initiated due to Isbyโs failure to gain IDOC \npermission to operate said organization. The next three were due to his continued efforts to operate the \norganization.โ Ex. 98 at 1.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 13 of 37 PageID #: 3677\nrecommend someone for release who โis not behaving himself and being rude and crude to staff \nand other offenders around them.โ Id. at 101, lines 11-15. \nMs. Gilmore also wrote a 90-day review on December 20, 2011. Ex. 125. She had no \nintention of recommending Mr. Isby for release from segregation because โhe had not straightened \nhis behavior up, and he is cursing me and calling me bad names. Wonโt happen.โ Dkt. 270 at 109, \nlines 19-24. She included the same paragraph about Mr. Isby believing he is โall knowingโ and the \n1999-2000 Freedom Fighters C-level conduct report in the December 2011 review. Ex. 126. The \nCustody Manager concurred and the STG Coordinator noted, โno known STG. Very disruptive \nand violent.โ Id. at 3. J. Snyder, Unit Manager, did not recommend release because of โextremely \nviolent DOC history.โ Id. Warden Brown did not recommend release but had no comments. Id.  \nEvery 90 days,  psychiatric  evaluations  were performed on inmates  in  segregation at \nWabash Valley, including Mr. Isby. Casework managers and caseworkers, however, were not \nprovided copies of the mental health reviews nor did they ask the mental health workers about the \ninmatesโ mental health status. Dkt. 270 at 122-136. As noted by Unit Team Manager Jerry Snyder, \nhowever, there are treatment team meetings during which mental health professionals discuss their \nobservations of each inmate with the caseworkers and unit team managers at least once a month. \nDkt. 271 at 44-45.  \nThe  mental  health  reports  on  Mr.  Isby  dating  from  June  2008  through  June  2017 \nconsistently included either the statement, โ[c]ustody reported [Isby] is generally cooperative and \nvoiced no specific problems with the management of this offenderโ or โ[c]ustody officers voiced \nno specific recent problems with the management of this offender.โ Ex. Nos. 182, 187, 75, 79, 80, \n87, 90, 94, 118, 119, 127, and 129, 131, 133-37, 6, 8, 9, 11, 20, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, \n45, 47, 51, 54, 56, 58, 60, 63, 65, 67. Ms. Gilmore testified that even if she had been privy to the \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 14 of 37 PageID #: 3678\nmental health reports and opinions, it โwould not have [changed her recommendations] because of \nthe fact [Isby] was belligerent, rude, and crude.โ Dkt. 270 at 141, lines 20-25; dkt. 270 at 144, lines \n3-9.  \nMr. Charles Dugan has been a caseworker at Wabash Valley since 2011. He was supervised \nby Ms. Gilmore. On direct, he was asked, โIn your opinion, sir, Mr. Isby is in restrictive status \nhousing in 2018 because of the 1990 incident with the two officers, correct?โ Dkt. 270 at 180, lines \n6-8. Mr. Dugan responded, โThat, that would be correct.โ Id. at line 9. Mr. Dugan further testified \nthat one reason for conducting 30-day reviews โis to let the offenders know how they can get out \nof restrictive status housing.โ Dkt. 270 at 196, lines 13-16. He did the 30-day reviews because \npolicy told him to. Dkt. 270 at 197, lines 20-22. Mr. Dugan did not perform 90-day reviews. Dkt. \n270 at 192, lines 3-7.   \nWhen Mr. Dugan prepared the 30-day reviews, he opened his computer, opened a form, \ntyped in the date, and an Excel spreadsheet auto-populated the report. Dkt. 270 at 197, lines 23-\n25; dkt. 270 at 198, lines 1-15. Mr. Dugan checked the spelling of the inmateโs name and DOC \nnumber and then hit โprintโ and gave a copy to the inmate. Id. at 198, lines 16-25. A copy was also \nsent to classification. That was the entire process. Id. at 199, lines 3-6. Mr. Dugan prepared 30-\nday reviews on Mr. Isby from approximately March 2015 through June 2017. See Ex. Nos. 5, 19, \n25, 46, 55, 57, 64, 66 (representative exhibits).  \nAs noted above, each 30-day review form said, โYour status has been reviewed and there \nare no changes recommended . . . at this time.โ Dkt. 270 at 198, lines 3-4; dkt. 270 at 208, lines \n23-25. There was no other form that said, โyour status has been reviewed and a change has been \nrecommended.โ Id. at 198, lines 6-8; dkt. 270 at 209, lines 1-7. Mr. Dugan conceded that there was \nโnot much review behind it.โ Id. at 199, lines 7-9. He was trained to do the reviews this way by \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 15 of 37 PageID #: 3679\nMs. Gilmore and she never told him that he was leaving out any steps in the process. Id. at 199, \nlines 13-25; dkt. 270 at 200, lines 1-3. In any given month, it took him 15-20 minutes to do the 30-\nday reviews for all 144 inmates on his caseload, depending on how long it took the printer to print \nthem. Id. at 207, lines 20-25; dkt. 270 at 208, lines 1-6; dkt. 270 at 211, lines 1-9. Mr. Dugan \ntestified that he never did and would not have enough time to sit down and talk with each inmate \nto discuss each 30-day review. Id. at 211, lines 13-19.  \nWhen completing the 30-day review forms, Mr. Dugan did not take into account how long \nMr. Isby had gone without any conduct reports being issued or any other updated circumstances \nsince the last review. Dkt. 270 at 212, lines 19-25. Indeed, โthere was no way that you would have \nor could have recommended that Mr. Isby be released from the SCU, correct?โ โCorrect.โ Id. at \n213, lines 2-5. When Mr. Dugan completed the 30-day reviews, โit had already been determined \nthat release was not going to be recommended?โ โCorrect.โ Id. at 213, lines 8-10. That was true \nfor every 30-day review that he completed for Mr. Isby, and for everybody on his caseload, every \nmonth. Id. at 213, lines 11-18. The only thing that changed was the date. Id. at 213, line 18. Mr. \nDugan testified that the conclusion on the 30-day forms was a โpreordained conclusion.โ Dkt. 270 \nat 219, lines 10-11. When asked, โ[b]ut there is never any actual review that takes place in \nconnection with the 30-day review, correct?โ Mr. Dugan responded, โCorrect.โ Id. at 225, lines \n19-23.  This is how Mr. Dugan was trained to do the 30-day reviews by Ms. Gilmore and others. \nId. at 213, lines 19-23.  \nWhen asked about Ms. Gilmoreโs statement in her affidavit presented in support of the \ndefendantsโ motion for summary judgment, dkt. 52-1, ยถ 12, that โ[u]nder DOC policy, offenders \nwho are housed in the department-wide administrative segregation unit are reviewed for continued \nplacement there every 30 days,โ Mr. Dugan testified that those offenders are not actually reviewed \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 16 of 37 PageID #: 3680\nfor continued placement. โThe process that we have gone over repeatedly, that is the process that \nis, that is how the review is done.โ Dkt. 270 at 226, lines 8-16. When asked, โ[t]hat is the only \nprocess[?]โ Mr. Dugan responded, โ[f]or the 30-day review?โ Correct.โ Id. at lines 17-18. For all \n30-day reviews, โ[n]o thought goes into what that conclusion is going to be, right?โ โThat is \ncorrect.โ Id. at 224, lines 5-17. โAnd you didnโt do a review in any meaningful sense of that word \nin connection with [the 30-day review], right?โ โThatโs correct.โ Id. at 225, lines 6-8. โAnd you \nare not aware of a review in any meaningful sense of that word having been done with any of the \n30-day reviews we have looked at, right?โ โThatโs correct.โ Id. at lines 9-12. Although the \nstatement that Mr. Isbyโs โโstatus has been reviewedโ appears on all of the 30-day reviews of Mr. \nIsbyโs status in solitary confinement,โ โthere is never any actual review that takes place in \nconnection with the 30-day review, correct?โ โCorrect.โ Id. at lines 15-21. Mr. Dugan admitted \nthat the statement that an offendersโ โstatus had been reviewedโ was false. Id. at lines 19-23. Mr. \nDugan also responded to the question that โit is fairly common to get in arguments with staff when \nyou are a prisoner on the SCU, right?โ โCorrect.โ  Dkt. 270 at 192, lines 21-23.  \nJerry Snyder has been employed as a correctional officer, counselor, casework manager, \nand unit team manager with the IDOC. He has worked at Wabash Valley since 1993. Dkt. 271 at \n3-5. Mr. Isby was on Mr. Snyderโs unit team caseload for a long time. Id. at 6, lines 8-11. He \ntestified that Mr. Isby remains in restrictive housing based on his serious past conduct, based on \nhis anger and hatred exhibited on a daily basis, and based on his refusal to participate in programs. \nDkt. 271 at 10, 12. Mr. Snyder admitted that participation in programs is not required for an \noffender to be released from restrictive status housing and that some offenders in that status have \nparticipated in programs but not been released. Dkt. 271 at 12, lines 5-22. Mr. Isby was transferred \nout of Wabash Valley to Westville on June 22, 2017, because โit was determined that a change of \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 17 of 37 PageID #: 3681\nscenery might be better for his attitude.โ Dkt. 271 at 13, lines 3-6. Warden Brown and Mr. Snyder \nmade that decision, along with deputy wardens. Id. at lines 7-12.  \nMr. Snyder testified that the mechanism that the IDOC relies on to conduct meaningful \nreviews of inmatesโ restrictive housing status is the 30-day review process. Dkt. 271 at 45-47. He \ntestified that to conduct a 30-day review, โall staff does is just enter information into the computer, \nand it generates the form, correct?โ โYes.โ Id. at 22, lines 9-11. He further admitted that โall staff \ndoes is change a few things like the date, the name, and submit that to the offender.โ Dkt. 271 at \n22, lines 12-15. As a supervisor, he checks to make sure they are being done correctly. Id. at lines \n16-20. \nMr. Snyder stated that the 90-day reviews also comply with the Supreme Courtโs directive \nfor meaningful review, but offenders are required to request those even though staff have the option \nto request them. Dkt. 271 at 47, lines 10-16. In response to questioning from the Court, Mr. Snyder \ntestified that every inmate who is disrespectful, angry, surly, cussing, and every inmate who has \ncommitted murder is not in restrictive housing. Dkt. 271 at 46-47.  \nWhen Mr. Snyder participated in 90-day reviews, in determining whether an inmate should \nbe released from solitary confinement, he considered the reason the offender was in solitary \nconfinement, the offenderโs conduct history since being admitted to solitary confinement, a review \nof the OCMS notes, the offenderโs interactions with staff, and whether programs have been \nrecommended and whether the offender has participated in those programs. Dkt. 271 at 17-18. \nNinety-day reviews are not automatic. They can be requested by the offender or initiated by staff. \nId. at 18, lines 13-19. The recommendation process during 90-day reviews goes from the casework \nmanager, to the housing lieutenant, to the Office of Investigation and Intelligence, to the unit team \nmanager, to the deputy warden of operations, and finally to the warden. Id. at 18-19. During the \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 18 of 37 PageID #: 3682\nAugust of 2014 90-day review, Mr. Snyder interviewed Mr. Isby but recommended denying \nrelease from solitary confinement based on the โbest interest of safety and security.โ Dkt. 271 at \n19, lines 13-25; dkt. 271 at 20, lines 12-14; Ex. 192. Mr. Isby was not provided any report of what \nfactors were considered during the review. Specifically, he was not informed that his attitude, \nrefusal to participate in programs, or interactions with staff were considered in making the \ndetermination. Dkt. 271 at 20-21.  \nMr. Snyder testified on cross that in addition to the 1990 incident, when Mr. Isby was \nreleased from department-wide restrictive status housing and assigned to general population in \n1996, within ten months he threatened to do physical harm on a staff member. Dkt. 271 at 56. He \nfurther testified that when Mr. Isby was released from department-wide restrictive status housing \nto facility restrictive status housing in 2005, within six months he had threatened staff and had \nbattered another offender. Id. That is why Mr. Snyder believes that Mr. Isby should go through \nprogramming before recommending that he be released from administrative restrictive status \nhousing. Id.  \nMr. Richard Brown has been the Warden of Wabash Valley since February of 2011. Dkt. \n271 at 58. Offenders in segregation, unlike those in general population, are in their cell 23 hours a \nday, they have recreation alone, their property is restricted, they cannot have contact visits, and \nthey do not have access to an email kiosk that allows general population inmates to email family \nand friends. Dkt. 271 at 61-62, 97.  \nWarden  Brown  agreed  that  Indiana  law  requires  that  every  offender  placed  in \nadministrative segregation be reviewed at least once every 30 days to determine whether the reason \nfor segregation still exists. Dkt. 271 at 73; Ex. 232; Ind. Code ยง 11-10-1-7. He testified that the \nbasic objective of the IDOC classification system is to assign offenders to the least restrictive \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 19 of 37 PageID #: 3683\nsecurity and custody levels consistent with the goal to protect the community and to ensure the \nsafety of staff and other offenders. Dkt. 271 at 77. Participation in programming is not one of the \ncriteria that must be met to be released from department-wide administrative restrictive status \nhousing. Dkt. 271 at 89-90.  \nWarden Brown testified that the  purpose  of  the 30-day  reviews  is to  determine the \ncontinuing need for and appropriateness of continued placement in restrictive status housing. Dkt. \n271 at 83-84. Warden Brown agreed that Mr. Isby was originally placed in and remains in \nsegregation because of his past assaultive behavior, his continued attitude and demeanor toward \nstaff, and his unwillingness to participate in programming. Id. at 85.  \nAs Warden, Mr. Brown is the last facility decision-maker in the line of reviewers during \n90-day reviews. Dkt. 271 at 65-66; 79-81; 148. If an offender is recommended for transfer or \nrelease from restrictive status housing, only then would the review go from the Warden to the \nCentral Office. Id. at 149. According to IDOC policy, wardens are responsible for the operation of \ntheir respective facilities, including the intrafacility classification and assignment of offenders. The \nWarden of each facility is responsible for providing ongoing in-house classification training to \nensure that all staff members involved in offender classification are aware of the procedures and \ntheir roles and responsibilities in offender classification, assignment, and reassignment. Id. at 81. \nWarden Brown has not provided any ongoing classification training at Wabash Valley nor is he \naware of the last time training was provided. Id. at 81-82.  \nWhen Warden Brown makes 90-day review decisions, he considers past conduct history, \ncomments made by staff who deal with the offender on a daily basis, cooperation with staff, current \nconduct, sentencings, and whether or not the inmate participated in any programming within the \nunit. Dkt. 271 at 149. The main reasons Warden Brown never recommended that Mr. Isby be \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 20 of 37 PageID #: 3684\ntransferred out of department-wide administrative restrictive status housing were because of Mr. \nIsbyโs unwillingness to participate in programs and comments from staff about how uncooperative \nhe was. Dkt. 271 at 150.  \nDefendant Jack Hendrix was an Assistant Superintendent at Wabash Valley from 2006 \nuntil 2011. He became Director of Classification for the IDOC in the Central Office in 2011. In \n2014, he became Executive Director of Classification for the IDOC and was on the Commissioner \nof the IDOCโs executive staff. Dkt. 271 at 168-170. He reports to the Deputy Commissioner of \nOperations. Id. at 177. It is among his duties to ensure that IDOC personnel are complying with \npolicies and state and federal law and to โdevelop, implement, operate, monitor, evaluate, and \nrevise the departmentโs [IDOCโs] classification system.โ Dkt. 271 at 177-79.  He supervises the \noffender placement section. Id. at 179.  \nDirector Hendrix testified that the goal of the 30-day reviews was to determine whether the \nconditions that warranted placement in solitary confinement still existed. Dkt. 271 at 174. For \ninmates assigned to department-wide restrictive status housing, including Mr. Isby, any appeal \nfrom a 30-day, 90-day, or annual review complaining about his continued placement in segregation \nwas supposed to be directed to Mr. Hendrixโs office rather than handled at the facility. Dkt. 271 at \n179-83.  As noted, Mr. Isbyโs appeals were not always reviewed by Director Hendrixโs office. \nOtherwise, 90-day reviews come to his office only if a warden recommends transfer. Dkt. 271 at \n245.  \nAs noted, Mr. Isby was transferred from Wabash Valley to Westville in June of 2017. Dkt. \n217. On July 27, 2017, a full review was completed at Westville and it recommended Mr. Isby for \nrelease from department-wide administrative restrictive status housing. Dkt. 271 at 226-228; Ex. \n228. There were no comments written in by the signature of each of the six reviewers. Ex. 228. \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 21 of 37 PageID #: 3685\nThereafter, Director Hendrix contacted the Westville warden, classification supervisor, and unit \nteam manager at Westville, and requested an additional review. Dkt. 271 at 227-233. Then in less \nthan a month, on August 17, 2017, the same employees and officials conducted another full review \nand this time the request for release from department-wide administrative restrictive status housing \nwas denied. Dkt. 271 at 229-232; Ex 229.  The comments given the second time were โthis offender \ndoesnโt want to comply with policy or procedure,โ โsince arrival at WCU on June 28, 2017, the \noffender has been anti-administration. He wants to control the facility rather than following \nprocedure/policy,โ and โnot recommended at this time due to his anti-social behavior, seems to \nthink all DOC personnel is against him and continuously fights back, seems to have a lot of anger \nissues.โ Dkt. 229. This confidential report was not provided to Mr. Isby. \nII.  Conclusions of Law and Analysis \nโThe Supreme Court held in Hewitt [v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983)] that the Due Process \nClause  mandates  that  prison  officials  periodically  review  whether  an  inmate  placed  in \nadministrative segregation continues to pose a threat.โ Isby, 856 F.3d at 524. As noted above, the \nquestion presented here is whether Mr. Isbyโs due process rights have been violated by the \ndefendants while keeping him in solitary confinement, a/k/a โdepartment-wide restrictive status \nhousing,โ for years.  Consideration of the circumstances presented in this case is influenced by the \nCourtโs awareness that โresearch still confirms what this [Supreme] Court suggested over a century \nago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price.โ Davis v. Ayala, 135 S. Ct. 2187, \n2210  (2015)  (J.  Kennedy,  concurring).  โProlonged  solitary  confinement  exacts  a  heavy \npsychological toll that often continues to plague an inmateโs mind even after he is resocialized.โ \nIncumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 534 (4th Cir. 2015); see also Williams v. Secretary Pennsylvania \nDept. of Corrections, 848 F.3d 549, 573-74 (3d Cir. 2017) (โexplicitly add[ing] our jurisprudential \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 22 of 37 PageID #: 3686\nvoice to this growing chorusโ of the โjudiciaryโs increasing recognition of the scientific evidence \nof the harms of solitary confinement.โ).  \nโ[T]he extraordinary length of Isbyโs segregation in the SCU implicates his due process \nrights.โ Isby, 856 F.3d at 524. โTo evaluate Wabash Valleyโs procedures in light of Hewitt, we \nconsider the three Mathews v. Eldridge factors: (1) the private interest (that is, Isbyโs interest) \naffected by a governmental decision, (2) the governmental interests at stake, and (3) โthe risk of \nan erroneous deprivation of [the private] interest through the procedures used, and the probable \nvalue, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.โโ Isby, 856 F.3d at 525 (quoting \nMathews, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976)).  \nThe Seventh Circuit held that the โextended, indefinite length of his placement in the SCU \ntips the scale in [Isbyโs] favor on this [first] prong of the analysis.โ Id. at 526. The Isby Court \nfurther found that the governmentโs interests are โsubstantialโ because โ[m]aintaining institutional \nsecurity and safety are crucial considerations in the management of a prison, and, to the extent that \nan inmate continues to pose a threat to himself or others, ongoing segregation may well be \njustified.โ Id.  \nThe Seventh Circuit continued its analysis by stating, โ[w]ith no potential end date on \nIsbyโs segregation, we confront the third of the Mathews factors and note that the boilerplate output \nof each review seems all the more concerning.โ Id. at 526-27. On remand, the Isby Court held that \nโthere is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the thirty-day reviews take into account any \nupdated circumstances in evaluating the need for continued confinement, given the length of Isbyโs \nsegregation, his long stretches of time without any disciplinary issues, and the rote repetition of \nthe same two boilerplate sentences following each review.โ Id. at 528.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 23 of 37 PageID #: 3687\nInmates placed in solitary confinement are entitled to โan informal and nonadversary \nperiodic review (the frequency of which is committed to the discretion of the prison officials) that \nkeeps administrative segregation from becoming a pretext for indefinite confinement.โ Isby, 856 \nF.3d at 525 (internal quotation omitted). The Seventh Circuit also quoted with approval the Tenth \nCircuitโs holding in Toevs v. Reid, 685 F.3d 903, 913 (10th Cir. 2012) that โโa meaningful review \n... is one that evaluates the prisonerโs current circumstances and future prospects, and, considering \nthe reason(s) for his confinement to the program, determines whether that placement remains \nwarranted.โโ Isby, 856 F.3d at 527. โAnd while submission of new evidence or a full hearing may \nnot be necessary to meet the requirements of due process under Hewitt, an actual reviewโi.e., one \nopen to the possibility of a different outcomeโcertainly is.โ Id. at 528 (citing Proctor v. LeClaire, \n846 F.3d 597, 611 (2d Cir. 2017) (โIt is inherent in Hewittโs use of the term โperiodicโ that ongoing \nAd Seg reviews may not be frozen in time, forever rehashing information addressed at the inmateโs \ninitial  Ad  Seg  determination....prison  officials  must look to the  inmateโs  present and  future \nbehavior and consider new events to some degree to ensure that prison officials do not use past \nevents alone to justify indefinite confinement.โ)).  \nThus, periodic reviews must be meaningful and cannot be a sham or pretext for indefinite \nsegregation. They cannot rely only on past events, nor can they only include uninformative \nboilerplate language. In this case, periodic reviews must consider Mr. Isbyโs current circumstances \nand future prospects, in addition to the reasons for his placement in solitary confinement when \ndetermining whether his continued solitary confinement is warranted.  \nIt is plain from the record that the 30-day reviews at Wabash Valley were perfunctory, \nmeaningless, and not even rubber stamped. The identical forms with the same language were \nprinted out each month by a single reviewer, a caseworker or casework manager. No factual basis \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 24 of 37 PageID #: 3688\nor rationale is provided in the 30-day reviews, leaving the basis for โno changesโ in status entirely \nunknown. See Incumaa v. Stirling, 791 F.3d 517, 534 (4th Cir. 2015) (discussing similar reasons \nfor finding Mathewsโ โrisk of erroneous deprivationโ factor weighed in favor of inmate who had \nbeen in solitary confinement for 20 years).  \nThe testimony by the two caseworkers relating to how the 30-day reviews were actually \nconducted tell completely different stories. Although what circumstances were considered for each \nreview, or whether or not anything was considered, ranged from some consideration to none, the \nend result was always the same: a predetermined form that provided no explanation for what \nreview took place or any rationale for the decision.  \nThe Court does not credit the testimony of Ms. Gilmore that for each 30-day review she \nreviewed case notes, spent time with Mr. Isby if he allowed it, talked to correctional staff, and \nreferred to OCMS notes. Mr. Dugan admitted that no actual review took place in the 30-day \nโreviewโ and that Ms. Gilmoreโs statement to the contrary was false. Ms. Gilmore is a defendant \nin this case and faces personal liability, unlike Mr. Dugan, whose candid testimony was credited \nby the other defendants. She had a personal animus toward Mr. Isby because of how he treated \nher.   \nIt was only after counsel was appointed in this case after remand on the due process issue \nthat the striking testimony from caseworker Dugan was discovered. While one might argue that \nMs. Gilmore and Mr. Dugan conducted their reviews very differently, Mr. Dugan made it clear \nthat Ms. Gilmore trained him to do the reviews just the way he did them. It took him a matter of \nminutes to do 30-day reviews for his entire caseload. Each review took seconds. All of the \ncaseworkers simply printed out the forms each month the way he did. Mr. Dugan never examined \ncase plans or other documents in connection with a 30-day review. He did not meet with each \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 25 of 37 PageID #: 3689\ninmate every 30 days. No possibility for a different outcome existed. And, no one testified that the \nmanner in which Mr. Dugan conducted the 30-day โreviewsโ was improper. \nThe 30-day โreviewsโ were โfrozen in time.โ Not surprisingly, there was no evidence that \nany inmate had ever been released from solitary confinement as a result of a 30-day โreview.โ  \nBased on this record, the only reasonable answer to the question of whether the 30-day \nreviews were pretextual is โyes.โ The Seventh Circuit foreshadowed this Courtโs conclusion when \nit stated, โHere, the repeated issuance of the same uninformative language (without any updates or \nexplanation  of  why  continued  placement  is  necessary)  coupled  with  the  length  of  Isbyโs \nconfinement, could cause a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Isby has been deprived of his \nliberty interest without due process.โ Isby, 856 F.3d at 529. For these reasons, the Court finds the \n30-day process conducted at Wabash Valley rendered the โrisk of an erroneous deprivationโ \nunacceptably high. Simply put, the 30-day reviews do not pass Constitutional muster.  \nOf great concern is the fact that defendants have done a complete about face as to their \nposition throughout this litigation that the 30-day reviews satisfied the Constitution. Isby, 856 F.3d \nat 524 (Defendants โclaim, however, that the reviews that Isby receives every thirty days are \nsufficient for due process.โ). They now argue that โ[t]he important review of the plaintiffโs status \nis what is referred to as the 90-day review.โ Dkt. 225 at 2. In opening argument, defendants stated \nthat โthe Seventh Circuit did not focus solely on the 30-day reviews, and the facts will show that \nin addition to the 30-day reviews, the offenders in administrative restrictive status housing may \nrequest a  full review.โ Dkt. 270 at 19. They contend  what  was  not  supported through any \ntestimony, that โ[t]he 30-day review is merely to make sure no offender is overlooked,โ rather than \nbeing an actual review of the appropriateness of placement in solitary confinement. Dkt. 225 at 2. \nInterestingly, at trial, casework manager Gilmore testified that the 30-day reviews do not exist \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 26 of 37 PageID #: 3690\nsolely to make sure that no offender was overlooked. Dkt. 270 at 119, lines 14-16. Mr. Snyder also \ntestified that the 30-day review was the mechanism by which the IDOC provided meaningful \nreview, in addition to the 90-day review when an inmate requested one. IDOC policy requires the \n30-day reviews. Warden Brown also confirmed that the purpose of the 30-day reviews was to \ndetermine the continuing need and appropriateness of continued confinement in restrictive status \nhousing.  \nThis change in defendantsโ position from what was presented on summary judgment to this \nCourt and on appeal to the Seventh Circuit is extremely troubling. Judicial estoppel โgenerally \nprevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a \ncontradictory argument to prevail in another phase.โ New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 \n(2001) (internal quotation omitted). The purpose of the rule of judicial estoppel is โto protect the \nintegrity of the judicial process.โ Id. (internal quotation omitted). The doctrine of judicial estoppel \nโprotects the courts from being manipulated by chameleonic litigants who seek to prevail, twice, \non opposite theories.โ Grochocinski v. Mayer Brown Rowe & Maw, LLP, 719 F3d 785, 795 (7th \nCir. 2013). โThere are certain clear prerequisites that must obtain before judicial estoppel applies: \n(1) the later position must be clearly inconsistent with the earlier position; (2) the facts at issue \nshould be the same in both cases; and (3) the party to be estopped must have convinced the first \ncourt to adopt its position.โ 1st Source Bank v. Neto, 861 F.3d 607, 612 (7th Cir. 2017) (internal \nquotations omitted). All three elements are present here.  Therefore, the defendants cannot slink \naway from their position that the 30-day reviews passed Constitutional muster.   \n  Having attempted to retreat from their position that the 30-day reviews satisfied due \nprocess, the defendants back further into a position where there was no periodic review. Even \nthough prison staff can initiate the reviews, they did so only once while Mr. Isby was at Wabash \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 27 of 37 PageID #: 3691\nValley, in 2017 shortly after the Seventh Circuitโs ruling in this case. The 90-day reviews were \nsimply not periodic. They were not conducted every 90 days, nor were they even conducted each \ntime Mr. Isby requested one. As recruited counsel observed in closing argument, โ[a] system in \nwhich the important reviews might not happen at all is not a system of ongoing reviews under \n[Smith v.] Shettle [946 F.2d 1250 (7th Cir. 1991)].โ Dkt. 271 at 279, lines 22-23.  \nThe defendants also take the startling position for the first time that Mr. Isby has waived \nhis right to due process merely by not exercising it. Defendants cite to Domka v. Portage County, \n523 F.3d 776, 782 (7th Cir. 2008) for this proposition, but as counsel for Mr. Isby points out, \nDomka does not support this position at all. Id. (โA constitutional waiver is considered to be valid \nif it is knowing and voluntary.โ). Consistent with Domka, the law is well-settled that any waiver \nof procedural due process rights must be knowing and voluntary. See United States v. Baptist, 759 \nF.3d 690, 695 (7th Cir. 2014) (โWhile due process rights can be waived, such a waiver must be \nmade knowingly and voluntarily.โ) (internal quotation omitted). Even if Mr. Isby had signed some \nkind of waiver form, which he has not, that would not necessarily suffice. โWhen constitutional \nrights are implicated, more is required [than signing a waiver]; [m]eticulous care must be exercised \nlest the procedure by which [the plaintiff] is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards \nof fairness.โ Id. (internal quotation omitted). Merely not asking for the periodic reviews at regular \nintervals, reviews to which he is entitled, would not constitute a waiver of Mr. Isbyโs due process \nrights. And in fact, Mr. Isby often appealed and requested release from solitary confinement which \nmilitates against any alleged waiver.  \nThe appeals that Mr. Isby filed challenging his continued placement in solitary confinement \nwere ignored or not reviewed to the highest level on more than one occasion. Warden Brownโs \ntestimony about his failure to train and ensure proper compliance with classification procedures \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 28 of 37 PageID #: 3692\nwas startling, especially in light of how long the issue of long-term segregation in this case has \nbeen in litigation. When Mr. Isby filed a classification appeal in June 2015, he complained that he \nhad been in administrative segregation since 2006 and had received no explanation for why his \nrequests to be released from that status were denied. Ex. 17. In response, the only explanation \ngiven was he was โappropriately placed,โ with no explanation as to why. Ex. 18.  \nNo one having any responsibility for classification of inmates at Wabash Valley and at the \nstate level can feign ignorance of or justify the lack of attention given to these concerns. Even after \nthe Seventh Circuit spelled out due process law that is already well-settled, the only thing that \nWarden Brown did in terms of ratcheting up the focus on Mr. Isbyโs plight was to transfer him to \na different prison. Mr. Isby was still kept in solitary confinement even though to justify the transfer \nExecutive Director of Classification Hendrix noted that Mr. Isbyโs behavior had improved (โrecent \npositive adjustmentโ). Ex. 218. In his letter explaining the transfer, dated June 26, 2017, Warden \nBrown still highlighted Mr. Isbyโs assault in 1990. Dkt. 219.  \nDefendants continue to argue that no statement of reasons was required during reviews. \nThe Seventh Circuit discussed this on appeal and said, nonetheless, the periodic review must be \nmeaningful  and  not  a  pretext  or  a  sham.  โWhile  such  a  statement  of  reasons  may  not  be \nconstitutionally required, however, under Hewitt, the periodic review must still be meaningful and \nnon-pretextual.โ Isby, 856 F.3d at 527.  \nWarden Brown testified that participating in programming or refusal to do so is not among \nthe IDOC criteria for placement or retention in segregation. When Commissioner Lemmon granted \nMr. Isbyโs appeal in 2005 to release him to facility administrative segregation, ex. 278, he did so \nwithout having Mr. Isby agree to participate in programming. Before May of 2015, Mr. Isby was \nnever informed through any written review process that his refusal to participate in various \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 29 of 37 PageID #: 3693\nprograms was one reason he was denied release from segregated housing. Of course, even if he \nhad been so informed, the record is clear that participating in step down programs did not \nnecessarily guarantee a change in status. Some inmates have completed those programs and still \nnot been released from restrictive housing.  \n  The Court acknowledges the difficulty prison staff face every day in dealing with inmates \nwho behave like Mr. Isby. See Isby, 856 F.3d at 524-25.  Isby and Hewitt emphasize that an \ninmateโs security risk is the reason to allow segregation, not an inmateโs manners. Id. at 525 (โโThe \ndecision whether a prisoner remains a security risk will be based on facts relating to a particular \nprisonerโฆ.โโ) (quoting Hewitt, 459 U.S. at 477 n. 9); Id. (โThe [Hewitt] Court recognized that \nlawfully incarcerated persons retain only a narrow range of protected liberty interests, and that \nbroad discretionary authority is necessary because the administration of a prison is at best an \nextraordinarily difficult undertaking.โ) (internal quotation omitted). At the same time, however, \nprison staff cannot keep an inmate in solitary confinement indefinitely because they do not like \nhim, or even because he is vulgar, rude, and belligerent.  They cannot even keep him in solitary \nconfinement indefinitely for an assault that occurred 28 years ago. Yet that is what the evidence \nestablishes here. When this case was filed, it had been four years since Mr. Isby had been written \nup for any major conduct violation โ a non-violent offense of filing frivolous lawsuits. Mr. Isby \nhad no conduct reports for most of 2009, all of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and through December \n29, 2014. He also had no conduct incidents in 2015, 2016, and 2017.  \nNo one is urging that Mr. Isby is a model of decorum or that the 1990 incident was not \nserious. But neither factor can result in his being kept in solitary confinement for decades. It is \ndifficult for the Court to comprehend how the defendants could reasonably expect a compliant \nattitude would result from decades of solitary confinement without meaningful review, a clear path \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 30 of 37 PageID #: 3694\nto release, or human interaction.  โโThe state may not use Ad Seg as a charade in the name of \nprison security to mask indefinite punishment for past transgressions.โโ Isby, 856 F.3d at 529 \n(quoting Proctor, 846 F.3d at 611).  \nThe  May  2011  90-day  review  was  denied  based  on  Mr.  Isby  being  unpleasant, \nargumentative, and for organizing a group called the โFreedom Fightersโ back in 2000, the agenda \nfor which is not of record but nowhere is it implied that it was to perpetuate violence. The \nDecember 20, 2011 90-day review was denied for having an โextremely violent DOC history.โ \nEx. 126 at 3. This โextremely violentโ history dated back to 1990 and 2006 (when he was found \nguilty of battery). A 2014 90-day denial of release from solitary also was based in large part on \nthe 1990 incident. These examples of the rationale applied to Mr. Isby that demonstrate his years \nof being conduct clear were given inadequate consideration because of his past transgressions.  \nThe Court finds that the defendants denied Mr. Isbyโs Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights  by  failing  to  provide  meaningful  and  periodic  reviews  of  his  placement  in  solitary \nconfinement. Having found this constitutional violation, the Court turns to what remedies shall be \nawarded. \nIII.  Remedies \n  Mr. Isby seeks compensatory damages and injunctive relief as well as punitive damages. \nThe Court considers each in turn. \n  Compensatory Damages \nThe 30-day reviews are what the defendants have held up as meeting โconstitutional \nmuster.โ In truth, these were reviews in name only. There was a preordained outcome each month. \nThe review consisted of nothing more than printing a form. No consideration was given to changed \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 31 of 37 PageID #: 3695\ncircumstances or the current lack of major conduct reports. In addition, the 90-day reviews were \nnot โperiodic.โ \nDefendants contend that because Mr. Isby has been appropriately housed even if his due \nprocess rights were violated, he is entitled to only nominal damages. The Court finds, however, \nthat if a meaningful review based on proper criteria had been provided, Mr. Isby would have been \nreleased from department-wide restrictive status housing as of May 2010, at which time he had \nbeen clear of major conduct reports for two years. Moreover, he remained conduct clear until \nDecember 15, 2014.10  \nMr. Isby acknowledges that because he did not suffer any physical injury, he cannot \nrecover compensatory damages for mental or emotional injury. 42 U.S.C.A. ยง 1997e(e); Calhoun \nv. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 940 (7th Cir. 2003) (โWe agree that, absent a showing of physical injury, \nยง 1997e(e) would bar a prisonerโs recovery of compensatory damages for mental and emotional \ninjury.โ). โBut if that same prisoner alleges some other type of non-physical injury, the statute \nwould not foreclose recovery, assuming that the damages sought were not โforโ any mental or \nemotional injuries suffered.โ Id. Although Mr. Isby claims that he has suffered mental and \nemotional injuries,  something  the  Court views as obvious in light  of  his extensive  solitary \nconfinement, Mr. Isby is not seeking money damages for those injuries.  \nMr. Isby argues correctly that he is entitled to compensatory damages for other types of \ninjuries, even if intangible, including the deprivation of society, deprivation of meaningful human \ncontact and ease of communication, the loss of freedom of movement, lack of access to the law \nlibrary, vocational programs, and job assignments, and diminished quality of life. See Aref v. \n                                                   \n10 The Court notes that in 2017 Mr. Isby was recommended for release from department-wide restrictive \nstatus housing, ex. 228, but then defendant Hendrix talked to the Warden of Westville and those same \nreviewers recommended against release a few weeks later. Ex. 229; dkt. 271 at 232-34.  \n \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 32 of 37 PageID #: 3696\nLynch, 833 F.3d 242, 264-65 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (โWe therefore conclude there exists a universe of \ninjuries that are neither mental nor emotional and for which plaintiffs can recover compensatory \ndamages under the PLRA.โ) (listing cases); Cassidy v. Indiana Department of Correction, 199 \nF.3d 374, 377 (7th Cir. 2000) (plaintiffโs claims for damages for mental and emotional injuries \nwere barred but he โmay nonetheless pursue all of his other claims for damages.โ).  \nIn his post-trial brief, Mr. Isby suggests an award of $140 per day of segregation for 3,071 \ndays between May 15, 2010 (two years before this action was filed) and the date of the brief, \nOctober 11, 2018, amounting to a total of $429,940.00, citing Smith v. Rowe, 761 F.2d 360, 368 \n(7th Cir. 1985) (affirming $119 per day of segregation) and Campbell v. Peters, 1999 WL 1313698 \n(N.D.Ill. Sept. 30, 1999) ($140 per day of unjustified confinement), revโd on qualified immunity \ngrounds, 256 F.3d 695 (7th Cir. 2001). Although Rowe is still cited for its $119 per day award of \ndamages, the Court does not rely on that case because it predated the Prison Litigation Reform Act \nof 1996 and its bar on damages for mental and emotional injury without a prior showing of physical \ninjury. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(e).   \nGuidance from other courts aids in exercising the Courtโs discretion in assessing damages. \nSee McClary v. Kelly, 237 F.3d 185 (2d. Cir. 2001) (affirming district courtโs award of $125 per \nday to prisoner held for extensive period in administrative segregation without periodic review);  \nTrobaugh v. Hall, 176 F.3d 1087 (8th  Cir. 1999) (reversing $1.00 award with directions to district \ncourt to award compensatory damages in the vicinity of $100 per day for days unlawfully spent in \nadministrative segregation and citing cases awarding between $25 and $129 per day).  \nThe Court finds that a reasonable per day damages award lies within the range of $25 and \n$129. An award of $100 per day in damages for Mr. Isbyโs wrongful loss of freedom of movement, \ndeprivation of human contact, lack of access to services, and ease of communication is supported \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 33 of 37 PageID #: 3697\nby the evidence and caselaw. There are 3,140 days between May 15, 2010 and the date of this \nEntry, December 19, 2018. This amounts to $314,000.00 in compensatory damages. \nInjunctive Relief \nMr. Isbyโs claim for injunctive relief is also granted.  The record establishes the Defendants \nhave violated Mr. Isbyโs due process rights and have failed to provide meaningful review of the \nbasis of his segregation. While the Court might ordinarily simply order Mr. Hendrix to ensure \ncompliance with Mr. Isbyโs due process rights by providing ongoing periodic and meaningful \nreview of his placement in administrative restricted housing, Defendantsโ conduct in its years-long \nreview of Mr. Isbyโs segregation status gives the Court no assurance that the same pre-ordained \nconclusion would not be reached. Accordingly, not later than January 4, 2019, Executive Director \nHendrix shall file a proposed plan by which Mr. Isby is removed from department-wide or facility \nrestrictive status housing. Mr. Isby will have fourteen (14) days in which to respond to the proposed \nplan, and the Court will then decide whether to accept the proposed plan.  The Court understands \nthat Mr. Isby cannot be placed directly into general population given his years of isolation, but \nthere is evidence that within the IDOC there are transition options.   \nThe Court is mindful that some of Mr. Isbyโs conduct while in segregation might have \notherwise prompted discipline but for his extreme housing status. Nothing in this Order should be \nread to imply that the IDOC  cannot  fairly, and  in a non-retaliatory  manner, implement  its \ndisciplinary policies. The Court also takes this opportunity to advise Mr. Isby that he would be \nwell-served by toning down his angry and belligerent behavior and attempting to cooperate with \nthe people who are charged with his safety and security.  \n33 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 34 of 37 PageID #: 3698\nPunitive Damages \nWith regard to punitive damages, they may be awarded in a section 1983 case โโwhen the \ndefendantโs conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless \nor callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.โโ Alexander v. City of Milwaukee, \n474 F.3d 437, 453 (7th Cir. 2007) (quoting Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)). Ms. Gilmoreโs \ntestimony evidenced a willful violation of Mr. Isbyโs due process rights. She had no intention of \nreleasing him from segregated housing because of how he verbally abused her and how angry he \nwas. She held against him the violence he exhibited in 1990 and for which he is serving an \nadditional 40-year sentence. She admitted that Mr. Isby being conduct clear for two years was a \nโvery positive factor.โ Yet, his attitude and long past actions won out in her mind. It was Mr. \nDuganโs opinion that Mr. Isby is still in restrictive status housing because of the 1990 incidents.  \nTestimony from Warden Brown demonstrated that he willfully failed to comply with the \nIDOCโs own policies and procedures. He utterly failed to provide training or otherwise ensure that \nthe reviews and appeals were being processed according to policy, state law, and the Constitution. \nMr. Isby persuasively posits that Warden Brown and Director Hendrix were reckless in \ntheir management styles which resulted in the deprivation of Mr. Isbyโs due process rights. \nMoreover, the Court views Warden Brownโs and Mr. Snyderโs transfer of Mr. Isby to a different \nprison a month after the Seventh Circuit issued its opinion in this case as a willful and knowing \nattempt to avoid an order of injunctive relief. After years of confinement at Wabash Valley, the \ntransfer immediately after the Seventh Circuit foreshadowed this Courtโs rulings cannot be viewed \nas motivated by anything but an attempt to avoid some of the penalties. Certainly, no other viable \nreason for the coincidental โchange of sceneryโ with no change in housing status has been offered. \n34 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 35 of 37 PageID #: 3699\nThe fact that Mr. Isby was conduct free for years at various times while he was kept in \nsolitary confinement is proof that he was being held there for past behavior or because he was \nbelligerent. The purported determinations based on safety and security were again grounded in \nlong ago incidents while not taking into account Mr. Isbyโs more recent clear conduct. The 30-day \nreviews were nothing but a sham. The 90-day reviews were not consistently provided. None of the \ndefendants ever requested 90-day reviews on Mr. Isbyโs behalf. Even when Mr. Isby did not violate \nprison rules for years on end, there was no possibility that he would be released from solitary \nconfinement. Mr. Isby has shown much more than mere sloppiness or inattentiveness on the part \nof the defendants. See Littler v. Indiana Dept. of Corrections Commissioner, No. 3:11-cv-218, \n2013 WL 4551072 at *4 (N.D. Ind. Aug. 28, 2013) (โIf all Littler needed to prove [to be awarded \npunitive  damages]  was  that  the  defendants  were  sloppy  and  inattentive  to  the  procedural \nrequirements inherent in such transfers, he would have easily succeeded. But that is not the test.โ). \nIn sum, the record demonstrates that the defendants who participated in the decision-making \nprocess or lack thereof held a personal animus against Mr. Isby and showed a reckless or callous \nindifference to his due process rights.  \nThe Court does not impose punitive damages lightly, but by concluding that an inmateโs \ndue process rights have been willfully violated for years resulting in his indefinite confinement in \nsolitary confinement, they must be awarded. Due process is hardly a new concept. Retaining a \nhuman being in solitary confinement for years is unconstitutional unless it is accompanied by \nmeaningful and thoughtful consideration of whether he continues to pose a safety or security risk. \nAgain, the defendants have shown a callous disregard for this well-settled doctrine.  \nThe purpose of punitive damages is to punish and deter future conduct. See Hendrickson \nv. Cooper, 589 F.3d 887, 894 (7th Cir. 2009); see also Federal Civil Jury Instructions of the\n35 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 36 of 37 PageID #: 3700\nSeventh Circuit; Constitutional Torts, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, Jury Instruction 7.28 (2017) (โThe \npurposes of punitive damages are to punish a defendant for his or her conduct and to serve as an \nexample or warning to Defendant and others not to engage in similar conduct in the future.โ).  \nMs. Gilmore is no longer employed with the IDOC. Although she acted willfully in \ndisregarding Mr. Isbyโs due process rights, the concept of deterrence does not apply to her as \ndirectly as it does to the other defendants.  \nDirector Hendrix, Warden Brown, and Mr. Snyder are still employed by the IDOC. \nDirector Hendrix will continue to be involved in Mr. Isbyโs reviews. There is a possibility that \nWarden Brown and Mr. Snyder could cross paths again with Mr. Isby if either he is transferred \nback to Wabash Valley or they change jobs. Warden Brown arguably had the most direct high-\nlevel responsibility to protect Mr. Isbyโs due process rights and failed to provide leadership in that \nregard.  \nTaking these circumstances into consideration, punitive damages are not assessed against \nMs. Gilmore. Punitive damages are assessed as follows: Warden Brown, $10,000.00; Director \nHendrix, $7,500.00. and Mr. Snyder, $5,000.00.  \nIV. Conclusion\nThe Court summarizes its findings as follows: \na. Defendants willfully violated Mr. Isbyโs due process rights by failing to provide\nperiodic, meaningful review of his long-term placement in solitary confinement;\nb. Compensatory damages in the amount of $314,000.00  are awarded;\nc. Punitive damages in the amounts set forth above are awarded;\nd. Injunctive relief is awarded as set forth above;\n36 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 274   Filed 12/19/18   Page 37 of 37 PageID #: 3701\ne. Plaintiffโs counsel may seek attorneyโs fees consistent with 42 U.S.C. 1997e(d),\nwhich limits fees to 150% of the damages award. See Pearson v.

The Defendants were present by counsel and\nDefendants Jerry Snyder and Richard Brown appeared in person.

The Court instructed counsel to provide authority the next morning as to how the Court\ncould be engaged in the process of obtaining blood tests on the Plaintiff for purposes of this\ncase.

The Court is mindful that\n\"prolonged confinement in administrative segregation may constitute a violation of the\nEighth Amendment (and therefore the Fourteenth), depending on the duration and nature of\nthe segregation and whether there were feasible alternatives to that confinement.\" Townsend,\n759 F.3d at 690 (internal quotation omitted). And prior to trial the Court considered the\nduration of Mr. IsbyโIsrael's confinement in administrative segregation to be stunning, but\n\nCase: 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   As of: 02/23/2020 08:17 PM EST   13 of 26\nthe Court has found no case under similar circumstances where duration alone, coupled with\na prisoner's refusal to participate in correctional programming, supported a finding of a\nconstitutional violation. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the defendants are\nentitled to judgment in their favor, and the plaintiff shall take nothing from his second\namended complaint.

      "text": " \nIsby-Israel v. Lemmon, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)   \n \n \n \n \n2012 WL 3966363 \nOnly the Westlaw citation is currently available. \nUnited States District Court, \nS.D. Indiana. \nAaron ISBYโISRAEL, Plaintiff, \nv. \nBruce LEMMON, Commissioner of IDOC, et al., Defendants. \nNo. 2:12โcvโ116โJMSโMJD. \n| \nSept. 10, 2012. \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nAaron IsbyโIsrael, Carlisle, IN, pro se. \n \n \n \n \nEntry Discussing Amended Complaint and Directing Further Proceedings \nJANE MAGNUSโSTINSON, District Judge. \n \n \nI. \n*1 The 26โpage amended complaint is subject to the screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(b). Lagerstrom v. \nKingston, 463 F.3d 621, 624 (7th Cir.2006). Pursuant to this statute, โ[a] complaint is subject to dismissal for failure to state a \nclaim if the allegations, taken as true, show that plaintiff is not entitled to relief.โ Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, \n921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). \n  \nTo satisfy the notice-pleading standard of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint must provide a โshort \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,โ which is sufficient to provide the defendant \nwith โfair noticeโ of the claim and its basis. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) \n(per curiam) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) and quoting \nFed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) (2)). To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint โmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, \nto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.... A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotations omitted). Pro se complaints such as that filed \nby Aaron IsbyโIsrael, are construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. \nErickson, 551 U.S. at 94; Obriecht v. Raemisch, 517 F.3d 489, 491 n. 2 (7th Cir.2008). \n \n\n \nIsby-Israel v. Lemmon, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)   \n \n \n  \n \n \nII. \nFour claims are apparent in the amended complaint, each of which is discussed below. As a preliminary matter, any claims \nthought to be brought by plaintiff Aaron IsbyโIsrael on behalf of other inmates are dismissed without prejudice. The \nplaintiff is not an attorney and does not have standing to assert the rights of other plaintiffs, and no right to act on their behalf. \nOโBam v. Hawk, 451 S.E.2d 456, 1994 WL 692969 (N.D. Ind 1994) (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S.Ct. \n2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); Newsom v. Norris, 888 F.2d 371, 381 (6th Cir.1989); Cotner v. Hopkins, 795 F.2d 900, 902 \n(10th Cir.1986); Gillespie v. Crawford, 858 F.2d 1101, 1103 (5th Cir.1988); Gometz v. Henman, 807 F.2d 113, 115 (7th \nCir.1986); Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077 (11th Cir.1986); Martin v. Sargent, 780 F.2d 1334 (8th Cir.1985)). \n  \n \n \nA. Grievance Process \nThe claim that the defendants interfered with the grievance process in order to prevent the plaintiff from filing a lawsuit is \ndismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. It is true that the Prison Litigation Reform Act \nrequires that a prisoner exhaust his available administrative remedies before bringing a suit concerning prison conditions. 42 \nU.S.C.1997e(a); Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524โ25, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). It has been recognized, \nhowever, that โa remedy becomes โunavailableโ if prison employees do not respond to a properly filed grievance or otherwise \nuse affirmative misconduct to prevent a prisoner from exhausting.โ See Dole v. Chandler, 438 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir.2006). \nGiven these circumstances, the plaintiff has failed to โmake specific allegations as to the prejudice suffered because of the \ndefendantsโ alleged conduct[ ] and any right to access-to-courts claim is dismissed. Ortloff v. United States, 335 F.3d 652, \n656 (7th Cir.2003). Further, the Seventh Circuit has โspecifically denounc [ed] a Fourteenth Amendment substantive \ndue-process right to an inmate grievance procedure.โ Grieveson v. Anderson, 538 F.3d 763, 772 (7th Cir.2008). As explained \nin Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81 F.3d 1422, 1430โ31 (7th Cir.1996), โany right to a grievance procedure is a procedural right, not \na substantive one. Accordingly, a stateโs inmate grievance procedures do not give rise to a liberty interest protected by the \nDue Process Clause.โ Id. at 1430โ31 (internal citations omitted). Because the plaintiff had no expectation of a particular \noutcome of his grievances, there is no viable claim which can be vindicated through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Juriss v. McGowan, \n957 F.2d 345, 349 n. 1 (7th Cir.1992) (without a predicate constitutional violation one cannot make out a prima facie case \nunder 1 1983). \n  \n \n \nB. International Law \n*2 The plaintiff alleges that the defendantsโ actions violate international law such as the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights (ICCPR), Article 7 and 79 to the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners. But, the \nICCPR is not self-executing and does not give rise to a private cause of action. Sosa v. AlvarezโMachain, 542 U.S. 692, \n734โ35, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004); Clancy v. Office of Foreign Assets Control of U.S. Dept. of Treasury, 2007 \nWL 1051767, 17 (E.D.Wis.2007). Similarly, this court is not aware of any authority which supports the position that the \nUnited Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners creates a private cause of action. Accordingly, any claims \nbased on international law are dismissed. \n \n\n \nIsby-Israel v. Lemmon, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)   \n \n \n  \n \n \nC. Eighth Amendment \nThe plaintiff alleges that the conditions of confinement in administrative segregation violate the Eighth Amendment \nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. This claim shall proceed as submitted consistent with Part III of this Entry. \n  \n \n \nD. Due Process \nThe plaintiff alleges that his placement in administrative segregation for more than five years without a hearing or review \nprocess violates his right to due process. This claim shall proceed as submitted consistent with Part III of this Entry. \n  \n \n \nIII. \nThe plaintiff shall have through October 1, 2012, in which to file a statement of remaining claims. Given the rulings in Part \nII of this Entry, the statement of remaining claims should identify the circumstances associated with the alleged violation of \nplaintiffโs Eighth Amendment and Due Process rights and for each such alleged violation, identify what role any of the \ndefendants played in personally causing the alleged violation. \n  \nAs discussed in Part II of this Entry, four claims for relief were identified by the court. If the plaintiff intended to advance \nadditional claims he should restate such claims in his statement of remaining claims. \n  \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n  \nAll Citations \nNot Reported in F.Supp.2d, 2012 WL 3966363 \n \n \n ",

Dkt. 274. The Court \ndetermined that the defendants willfully violated Mr. Isbyโs due process rights by failing to provide \nperiodic, meaningful review of his long-term placement in solitary confinement. Id. In addition to \nawarding compensatory and punitive damages, the Court advised it would grant injunctive relief \nand directed Jack Hendrix, Executive Director of Classification, to submit a proposed plan by \nwhich Mr. Isby would be removed from department-wide or facility restrictive status housing. Id. \nThe proposed plan was filed and Mr. Isby objected and has offered a counter-proposal. Dkt. 279, \ndkt. 288, dkt. 289, dkt. 290, dkt. 291.  \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 293   Filed 03/04/19   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 3788\n  Mr. Hendrix proposes that Mr. Isby be transferred to O housing unit at the New Castle \nCorrectional Facility (โNew Castleโ), a general population unit that offers programs for inmates. \nDkt. 279. There would be ten days of initial admission processing and orientation. Id. Mr. Isby \nwould be admitted to the STAND (โStriving Toward a New Directionโ) Program, a step-down \nprogram for inmates leaving restrictive status housing. Id. The STAND program at New Castle is \nrun by the GEO Corporation, not the Indiana Department of Correction (โIDOCโ). Dkt. 289.  \n  Mr. Isby objects to Mr. Hendrixโs proposed plan on the basis that the completion of the \nSTAND Program would provide opportunities for the defendants to block Mr. Isbyโs release into \ngeneral population. Dkt. 288 at 3, ยถ 7.1 As noted above, however, the New Castle program is not \nmanaged by the IDOC. Moreover, O housing unit is a restricted movement unit in general \npopulation. Dkt. 288-1. Mr. Isbyโs counter-proposal is that he be transferred to a restrictive \nmovement unit at the Indiana State Prison, or any facility other than Wabash Valley Correctional \nFacility.  \n  Having considered the partiesโ proposals, the Court agrees with the defendants in finding \nthat it lacks the authority to order the IDOC to transfer Mr. Isby to a particular prison of the Courtโs \nchoice or that of Mr. Isby. After finding that Mr. Isbyโs due process were violated, the Courtโs sole \ngoal in awarding injunctive relief was to remove Mr. Isby from solitary confinement. Fashioning \nthe injunctive relief for that violation, however, must accord prison administrators โwide-ranging \ndeference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed \nto preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.โ Bell v. Wolfish, \n                                                 \n1 The Court acknowledges Mr. Isbyโs additional reasonable concern about the ACT program (part \nof the STAND program), having a Christian religious component. Dkt. 288, n. 2. He identifies as \nHebrew Israelite. The testimony at trial, however, was that the ACT program did not have a \nreligious component. The Court finds no basis on which to delve further into this issue at this time.  \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00116-JMS-MJD   Document 293   Filed 03/04/19   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 3789\n441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979). The Court must defer to the judgment of the IDOC in making that \ndetermination.  Mr.  Hendrixโs  proposal  falls  well  within  the  discretion  afforded  prison \nadministrators.  \n  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this action for a period of two years from the date \nof issuance of judgment to ensure that the defendantsโ placement decisions concerning Mr. Isby \ncomport with due process.  \nMr. Hendrixโs proposed plan, dkt. 279, is APPROVED.
