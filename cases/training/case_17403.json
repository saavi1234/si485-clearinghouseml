    "summary": "<p>Plaintiffs, individuals held in the Hamblen County (TN) jail pre-trial due to an inability to pay bail, filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, on February 16, 2020, on behalf of themselves and all other past and future detainees in the jail unable to make bail. They sued officials in the Hamblen County Court system and the Hamblen County Sheriff for what they alleged were unconstitutional bail practices. The plaintiffs were represented by the Civil Rights Corps, the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP) at the Georgetown University Law Center, and private counsel.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs specifically alleged that because they were unable to make bail they were forced to remain in a jail that consistently operates at over 150 percent capacity. They claimed that this creates a two-tier system of justice between the rich and poor in the county, saying that some of the county's poorest residents are shackled to the jail's walls and door handles or forced to sleep in closets with an inability to regularly access legal counsel before trial. The Hamblen County Sheriff himself described the facility as a \"cesspool of a dungeon\" in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/rural-jails.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 2019 New York Times article</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs made their claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 28 U.S.C. 2201. They claimed a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process rights to not be detained pre-trial based on their inability to access money, procedural due process, and the Sixth Amendment's right to access counsel. They sought class certification, a temporary restraining order releasing the named plaintiffs, injunctive relief from future pre-trial detention solely on the basis of wealth, attorney's fees, and costs.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Clifton L. Corker and is ongoing. A motion seeking a temporary restraining order was dismissed as moot on March 2, 2020, perhaps because the named plaintiffs were able to leave the jail for other reasons.</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the sheriff from detaining any criminal defendants who were detained without having had an individualizing hearing within a reasonable time after having their bail set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2021, the Court granted plaintiffs' revised motion for class certification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2024, Judge Corker issued a ruling on the matter by granting in part Defendant's motion for summary judgment. Judge Corker further permanently enjoined the defendants from bail practices which violate the detainees' Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process and Sixth Amendment right to counsel rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 28, 2024, the detainees filed a FRCP 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment due to a clear error of law in Judge Corker's granting of the defendants' second motion for summary judgment. The detainees claimed that the injunction should be amended to specifically describe the enjoined conduct and be limited to the sheriff rather than all defendants. The detainees further asked that the order should include a declaratory judgment applicable to all defendants. This motion is currently awaiting a ruling and, therefore, this matter is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

DOUGLAS COLLINS, et al., \n) \n \n  ) \n    Defendants.  ) \n     \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER   \n  This matter is before the Court to address Defendantsโ second Motion for Summary \nJudgment [Doc. 233].  On September 21, 2023, the Court ruled on Defendantsโ first motion for \nsummary judgment [Doc. 229], and on October 19, 2023, the Court granted Defendantsโ request \nto  file  a  second  motion  for  summary  judgment  regarding  pending  claims  and  requests  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief [Doc. 231, pg. 1].  These matters are ripe for resolution.  For the \nreasons that follow, Defendantโs Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 233] is GRANTED IN \nPART AND DENIED IN PART. \nI.  THE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs are a class of all individuals arrested on warrants out of Hamblen County General \nSessions Court (save for capital offenses) (1) who are, or will be, in the custody of the Hamblen \nCounty Sheriff, Chad Mullins; (2) whose bail amount was set in an ex parte fashion by the \nDefendants authorized by law to set bail for cases pending in Hamblen County General Sessions \nCourt; (3) who have not waived and have not received an individualized bail hearing within a \nreasonable period of time; and (4) who remain in custody for any amount of time [Doc. 116, pg. \n14].  \n1 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 1 of 12   PageID #:\n5668\n\nDefendants are a group of Hamblen County officials who operate and work with Hamblen \nCounty General Sessions Court in setting bail for arrestees [Doc. 216, ยถยถ 1โ2].  Specifically, \nDefendant the Honorable W. Douglas Collins (โJudge Collinsโ) serves as Hamblen County \nGeneral Sessions Judge, Defendant Teresa West serves as Hamblen County General Sessions and \nCircuit Court Clerk (โClerk Westโ), Defendants Katie West Moore, Nancy Phillips, and Kathy \nRobertson  serve  as  Judicial  Commissioners  of  Hamblen  County  General  Sessions  Court \n(collectively, โJudicial Commissionersโ), and Chad Mullins serves as Hamblen County Sheriff \nand is in charge of the Hamblen County Jail.  \nII.  BACKGROUND1  \nWhen an arrest warrant is issued in Hamblen County, Judge Collins, Clerk West, or one of \nthe Judicial Commissioners (collectively, โbail-settersโ) set bail by writing the specific form of \nbail on the arrest warrant [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 2, 4; 216, ยถยถ 2,4]].  Although bail-setters can issue \nrecognizance releases or set non-financial conditions of release, they impose secured financial \nconditions of release (โmoney bailโ) for the majority of arrestees in Hamblen County [Doc. 78-1, \nยถยถ 5, 6; Doc. 216, ยถ 5].  Bail-setters conduct this initial bail determination ex parte, outside the \npresence of the arrestee and before defense counsel is appointed [Doc. 78-1, at ยถ 3].2  \n \n1   Defendantsโ bail practices before the Courtโs November 30, 2020 preliminary injunction \nare controlling for purposes of summary judgment because those practices were the focus of the \nComplaint [Doc. 1]. Moreover, Defendants did not voluntarily change their bail practices and they \nmaintain that their pre-injunction practices were constitutional, showing that those practices \ncontinue to animate the dispute between the parties. See Walling v. Helmerich & Payne, 323 U.S. \n37, 43 (1944); LaPeer Cnty. Med. Care Facility v. Mich., No. 1:91-CV-333, 1992 WL 220917, at \n*6 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 4, 1992).   \n2   In a reply brief, Defendants assert that Court should adopt Defendantsโ statement of \nmaterial facts filed with their second motion for summary judgment [Doc. 237, pg. 1-2], which \nincludes primarily Defendantsโ post-injunction bail practices [Id. at pg. 2].  Plaintiffs argue that \nthe operative facts set forth in Plaintiffsโ Statement of Material Facts [Doc. 202].  For the reasons \nset out in footnote one, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs and will rely on undisputed facts set forth \nin this Courtโs previous opinion [Doc. 229, pgs. 2-6]. \n2 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 2 of 12   PageID #:\n5669\n\nBail-setters admittedly do not apply a particular burden of proof and do not follow any kind \nof schedule, rubric, or guidelines when determining the amount of money bail for a particular \narrestee, and they do not know whether an arrestee will be able to pay [Id. at ยถยถ 7โ9; Doc. 216, ยถยถ \n9, 10].  They also do not make findings on the record regarding the amount of bail [Doc. 78-1, at \nยถ 12; Doc. 216, ยถ 14].  Moreover, unless bail-setters are familiar with an arrestee because of prior \nrun-ins with the Hamblen County General Sessions Court, bail is set solely based on the arresteeโs \ncharges and criminal history; bail-setters do not know the arresteeโs employment status, financial \ncondition, family ties and relationships, or ties to the community [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 10, 11; Doc. 216, \nยถ 12]. \nThere are four ways in which an arrestee can pay money bail: (1) personal surety; (2) real \nestate; (3) commercial surety; or (4) cash [Doc. 78-1, ยถ 14].  Although bonding companies are \nallowed by law to charge up to 10 percent of the bond amount, Judge Collins has been told that \nthese companies sometimes accept a de minimus amount of the money bail that has been set [Id. \nat ยถยถ 15, 16].  Arrestees who can pay their bail are released, while those who cannot afford to pay \nremain in jail to await their initial appearance, which is held on the following Monday, Wednesday, \nor Friday, unless that day falls on a holiday [Id. at ยถยถ 18, 19; Doc. 216, ยถยถ 15-17].  \nJudge Collins or one of the Judicial Commissioners conducts the initial appearance via \nvideo conference between the jail and chambers [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 22, 23; Doc. 216, ยถ 19].  At the \ninitial appearance, the presiding judicial official advises the arrestee of his or her charges, bail, and \npreliminary hearing date, which is usually set up to 14 business days after the initial appearance \n[Doc. 78-1, ยถ 45; Doc. 216, ยถ 25].  The arrestee also fills out an affidavit of indigency if requesting \ncourt-appointed counsel [Doc. 78-1, ยถ 28; Doc. 216, ยถ 25].  However, counsel is rarely present at \nthe initial appearance [Doc. 78-1, ยถ 55; Doc. 216, ยถ 24].  Similar to the initial bail determination, \n3 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 3 of 12   PageID #:\n5670\n\nthe presiding judicial official possesses limited information about an arrestee, such as the arrest \nwarrant and information regarding their criminal history, and no findings are made on the record \nregarding the necessity of money bail [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 31, 33; Doc. 216, ยถยถ 26, 29-30].  Arrestees \nwho cannot pay their money bail are detained until their preliminary hearing or until a motion for \nbond modification is granted and bail is modified or reduced to an amount they can afford [Doc. \n78-1, ยถ 34].  \nAlthough Judge Collins will not consider requests for bond modification at an initial \nappearance for felony drug or theft charges, misdemeanor arrestees may informally request a \nmodification of their bail, and Judge Collins sometimes uses the affidavit of indigency to adjust \nbond without being asked [Id. at ยถยถ 36, 37, 51; Doc. 216, ยถ 33].  The Judicial Commissioners, \nhowever, are not authorized to modify the initial bail amount and must forward the request to \nJudge Collins for review [Doc 78-1, ยถยถ 38, 39].  The request is typically forwarded immediately \nafter the initial appearance, and Judge Collins evaluates it within a few minutes without an \nadditional hearing and without findings on the record for his decision [Id. at ยถยถ 39, 40, 42; Doc. \n216, ยถยถ 71, 73].  \nPublic defenders or court-appointed counsel may file written motions to modify bail after \nthey are notified of their appointment [Doc. 78-1, ยถ 58].  Similar to the process for informal \nrequests, Judge Collins does not hold a hearing on written motions unless defense counsel requests \nthat the Clerk put it on the docket [Id. at ยถ 59].  When considering written motions, Judge Collins \ndoes not make findings on the record and does not require the state to show why an individual \nshould be detained on a particular bail amount [Id. at ยถ 61].   He also has refused to consider bail \nmodification requests from counsel when the prosecutor does not agree with the request [Id. at ยถ \n60]. Judge Collinsโ denial of a motion for bond modification is appealable to the Hamblen County \n4 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 4 of 12   PageID #:\n5671\n\nCriminal Court, which has jurisdiction to hear a bond motion before a preliminary hearing as a \nwrit of certiorari or after a preliminary hearing and bind-over as a motion to reduce bond [Doc. \n212, ยถ 44].  \nEach of the named Plaintiffs in this action were arrested and booked into Hamblen County \nJail, had their bail initially set ex parte, did not receive an individualized determination regarding \ntheir conditions of release, and remained in custody because of their inability to afford the set bail \namount until a third-party organization paid their bail [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 77โ112; Doc. 216, ยถยถ 36-65]. \nPlaintiff Michelle Torres was arrested on felony drug charges, and Defendants set her bail at \n$75,000 [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 78โ79].  Plaintiff Robbie Johnson-Loveday was arrested for driving under \nthe influence, driving on a revoked license, and violation of implied consent and her bail was set \nat $6,000 with an additional requirement of an alcohol monitoring bracelet [Id. at ยถยถ 87โ88].   \nPlaintiff Amanda Cameron was arrested on drug and theft charges and her bail was set at $32,000 \n[Id. at ยถยถ 94โ95]. Plaintiff Bethany Edmond was arrested for drug possession and aggravated \ncriminal littering and her bail was set at $1,500 [Id. at ยถยถ 107โ108].  Plaintiffs Torres and Cameron \ninformed Judge Collins during their initial appearance that they could not afford the money bail \nset in their case and requested a bond modification [Doc. 71-7, pgs. 8, 13].  Judge Collins refused \nto modify their conditions of release without providing reasons on the record for his decision [Id.].  \nDefendants admit that the proceedings for Plaintiffs Torres and Cameron โwere typical of how \nJudge Collins conducts initial appearances.โ [Doc. 78-1, ยถ 36; Doc. 216, ยถ 66].  \nOn February 16, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the instant action against Defendants seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 [Doc. 1].  Specifically, Plaintiffs \nsought a declaration that Defendantsโ bail practices violate their rights under the Fourteenth and \nSixth Amendments [Id.].  Plaintiffs also sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against \n5 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 5 of 12   PageID #:\n5672\n\nthe Sheriff [Id.].  On November 30, 2020, the Court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the \nSheriff โfrom detaining any criminal defendant arrested on an arrest warrant who, after having bail \nset in an ex parte fashion . . . , [was] being detained without having had an individualized hearing \nwithin a reasonable period of time . . .โ [Doc. 90, pgs. 29โ30].  \nCurrently before the Court is Defendantsโ second motion for summary judgment [Doc. \n233].  Defendants argue that there are no genuine disputes of material fact concerning  the \nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims or the Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel \nclaims relating to initial appearances conducted separately from bail hearings alleged by named \nPlaintiffs [Id. at pg. 1].  Defendant also asserts that Plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory and \ninjunctive relief because they cannot show their injury is continuing and/or likely to happen again, \nnor can Plaintiffs show the other elements for a permanent injunction [Doc. 234, pg. 2].   \n   Plaintiffs persist in their entitlement to declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants \non their procedural due process claims [Doc. 236, pg. 1]; however, Plaintiffs state that they are not \nasserting a Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel claim related to initial appearances conducted \nseparately from bail hearings [Id. at pg. 14].  The motion is fully briefed and ripe for resolution. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is proper where โthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โ  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(c).  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the facts \ncontained in the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Natโl Satellite Sports, Inc. v. Eliadis Inc., \n253 F.3d 900, 907 (6th Cir. 2001).  The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating \n6 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 6 of 12   PageID #:\n5673\n\nthat no genuine issue of material facts exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  \nThe burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to โcome forward with significant probative \nevidence showing that a genuine issue exists for trial.โ McKinley v. Bowlen, 8 F. Appโx 488, 491 \n(6th Cir. 2001).  The nonmoving party โmay not rest upon mere allegations or denials of his \npleading but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.โ Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).  A mere scintilla of evidence is not enough; the \nCourt must determine whether a fair-minded jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving \nparty based on the record.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-252 (1986). \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Substantive Due Process \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ substantive due \nprocess claim [Doc. 234, pg. 5].  They argue that for the same reasons the Court denied Petitionersโ \nrequest for summary judgment as it relates to substantive due process, the Court should grant \nDefendantsโ motion for summary judgment on this issue [Id., at pg. 6].  Plaintiffs argue the \nimposition of โunattainable financial conditions of releaseโ operates as a de facto detention order \nwith substantive due process requiring such a detention decision to be narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling government interest [Doc. 236, pgs. 1-2].  Although the Court found at the preliminary \ninjunction stage that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of this claim, it is now clear \nthat it fails as a matter of law.  The Court agrees with Defendants on this issue and will rely on the \nanalysis of this Courtโs previous opinion [Doc. 229, pgs. 13-15]. \nFirst, pretrial detention as a result of the unequivocal denial of bail is wholly distinct from \npretrial detention due to the inability to pay bail.  When bail is denied, an arrestee cannot attain \npretrial release and, as a result, suffers a complete deprivation of liberty.  In contrast, when an \n7 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 7 of 12   PageID #:\n5674\n\narrestee is admitted to bail, their release is merely conditioned on the provision of adequate \nassurance that they will not flee before trial.  Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4 (1951).  While the \nformer, if not appropriately related to a government interest, may amount to a substantive due \nprocess violation, the latter falls within the realm of the Eighth Amendmentโthe conditions placed \non pretrial release must simply not be excessive.  \nThis does not mean that the imposition of unattainable bail will never operate as a de facto \ndetention order.  It has been recognized that โbecause the Tennessee constitution guarantees a right \nto bail, the Tennessee courts appear to use unattainable bail amounts as a proxy for denying bail \naltogether.โ Hill v. Hall, No. 3:19-CV-00452, 2019 WL 4928915, at *19 (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 7, \n2019).  Here, however, the parties have stipulated that Defendant bail-setters generally do not \nknow whether an arrestee will be able to pay the set amount and that it is not Judge Collinsโ intent \nthat arrestees remain in jail when he sets money bail [Doc. 78-1, ยถยถ 9, 13].   Without knowledge \nthat an arrestee would not be able to afford the set amount of bail, it cannot be said that Defendants \nimposed financial conditions of release with the goal of denying bail altogether. \nEven if the record reflected such an intent to use unaffordable bail as a proxy to deny bail, \nthe Court is hesitant to hold that substantive due process would be the proper method of analysis. \nThe Court must โexercise the utmost careโ when โasked to break new ground in [the] fieldโ of \nsubstantive due process. Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992).  Through \nselective incorporation, the Supreme Court has โsubstitutedโ the guarantees of various Bill of \nRights provisions โfor the more generalized language contained in the earlier cases construing the \nFourteenth Amendment[,]โ Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273 (1994), and โthe specific \nguaranteesโ of those provisions โare preferred over the, at times, more vague protections of the \nDue Process Clause.โ Mitchell v. Doherty, 37 F.4th 1277, 1283 (7th Cir. 2022).   Consequently, \n8 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 8 of 12   PageID #:\n5675\n\nโ[w]here a particular Amendment โprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protectionโ \nagainst a particular sort of government behavior, โthat Amendment, not the more generalized \nnotion of โsubstantive due process,โ must be the guide for analyzing [the] claims.โโ Albright, 510 \nU.S. at 273 (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989)).  \nThe intent of the Eighth Amendmentโs proscription of excessive bail has been said to \nโprevent the practical denial of bail by fixing the amount so unreasonably high that it cannot be \ngiven.โ United States v. Motlow, 10 F.2d 657, 659 (7th Cir. 1926). Thus, โthe Framers considered \nthe matterโ of using unaffordable bail as a proxy to deny bail โand drafted the [Eighth] Amendment \nto address it.โ See Albright, 510 U.S. at 274 (applying the same logic regarding the Fourth \nAmendment).    Because  the  Eighth  Amendment  โprovides  an  explicit  textual  source  of \nconstitutional protection . . . that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of โsubstantive due \nprocess,โ must be the guide for analyzing these claims.โ Graham, 490 U.S. 386.  \nPlaintiffs argue that unattainable bail must survive heightened scrutiny because it operates \nas the functional equivalent of an order of detention and Defendants do not have a compelling \nreason to do so [Doc. 236, pgs. 12-13].  However, in effect, this would render the Eighth \nAmendment superfluous.  Plaintiffsโ argument is, in reality, an excessive bail claim in substantive \ndue process clothing.  Because Plaintiffs do not assert a claim under the Eighth Amendment, the \nCourt, again, expresses no view as to whether such claim would succeed.  The Court simply \ndeclines  to  sidestep  the  Eighth  Amendment  and  analyze  Plaintiffsโ  claim  under  โthe  more \ngeneralized  notion  of  โsubstantive  due  process.โโ  Graham,  490  U.S.  at  395.  Accordingly, \nDefendantsโ Second Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and Plaintiffsโ substantive \ndue process claim is DISMISSED. \n \n9 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 9 of 12   PageID #:\n5676\n\nB.  Sixth Amendment \nDefendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment where initial appearances are held \nseparately from bail hearings [Doc. 234, pg. 2].  However, Plaintiffs specifically assert that \nโDefendants violate the Sixth Amendment by conducting critical pretrial release and detention \nproceedings without providing counselโ [Doc. 1 ยถ 123] (emphasis added). This Court agreed and \ngranted summary judgment upon finding that โhearings where a judicial officer will determine \nwhether to detain an arrestee prior to trial constitute a โcritical stageโโ implicating the right to \ncounsel [Doc. 229 at pg. 23].  The Court found that so long as Defendants conduct initial \nappearances in such a manner, those hearings will qualify as a โcritical stageโ [Id.].  In their \nresponse to Defendantsโ second motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs โdo not claim that they \nare entitled to counsel at initial appearance proceedings that do not affect pretrial detention or \nconditions of releaseโ [Doc. 236, pg. 15].  Accordingly, Defendants are not entitled to relief \nregarding this issue because it is MOOT. \nC.  Permanent Injunctive Relief \nPlaintiffs contend that they are entitled to permanent injunctive relief because they have \nsuffered irreparable harm, their harm requires equitable relief, their harm outweighs any potential \nharm to Defendants, and a permanent injunction is in the public interest [Doc. 201-1, pgs. 29-31]. \nIn their second motion for summary judgment, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to carry \ntheir burden for permanent injunctive relief [Doc. 234, pg. 13]. In support, Defendants rely on \nJudge Collinsโ declaration regarding modified courtroom practices [Doc. 215-3]].  Plaintiffs \nquestion the veracity of his โself-servingโ declaration and argue that Defendants are relying on \ntheir compliance with this Courtโs preliminary injunction order [Doc. 236, pg. 3].  Plaintiffs \n10 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 10 of 12   PageID #:\n5677\n\ncontend that even if Defendants have modified their practices, compliance with a preliminary \ninjunction is not reason to deny permanent relief [Doc. 236, pg. 2]. \n Because Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim is resolved and \nthere is no pending Sixth Amendment claim, final judgment is now appropriate.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will consider whether Plaintiffs have met their burden entitling them to injunctive relief.  \nInjunctive relief is โan extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that \nthe plaintiff is entitled to such relief.โ Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22, 129 \nS.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008); see Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, 117 S.Ct. 1865, \n138 L.Ed.2d 162 (1997) (per curiam) (applying this standard in the abortion context). To obtain a \npermanent injunction, plaintiffs must โestablish thatโ they have โsuffered a constitutional violation \nand will suffer โcontinuing irreparable injuryโ for which there is no adequate remedy at law.โ \nWomenโs Med. Pro. Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d 595, 602 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Kallstrom v. City \nof Columbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1067 (6th Cir. 1998)).  It is not sufficient for plaintiffs to show a \nโpossibilityโ of a constitutional violation or even a โlikelihoodโ of one; to obtain permanent \ninjunctive  relief,  the  plaintiffs  must  make  a  clear  showing  that  the  challenged  provisions \nโactual[ly]โ violate their patientsโ constitutional rights. See Winter, 555 U.S. at 21, 32 (quoting \nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 \n(1987)).  If they succeed in demonstrating an actual constitutional violation and continuing \nirreparable injury, the plaintiffs must also show โthat the public interest would not be disserved by \na permanent injunction.โ eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S.Ct. 1837, \n164 L.Ed.2d 641 (2006).  \nHere,  Plaintiffs  have  established  an  actual  constitutional  violation.  This  Court  has \npreviously determined that Defendantsโ bail practices violate Plaintiffsโ procedural due process \n11 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 241   Filed 09/30/24   Page 11 of 12   PageID #:\n5678\n\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment right to counsel. See [Doc. 229].  \nโWhen constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury is presumed. Michigan \nState A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Johnson, 833 F.3d 656, 669 (6th Cir. 2016).  And courts have \nfound that unconstitutional detention cannot be remedied after the fact.  See e.g., United States v. \nBogle, 855 F.2d 707, 710-11 (11th Cir. 1988) (โ[U]nnecessary deprivation of liberty clearly \nconstitutes irreparable harm.โ); Matacua v. Frank, 308 F. Supp. 3d 1019, 1025 (D. Minn. 2018) \n(โ[L]oss of liberty ... is perhaps the best example of irreparable harmโ); Cole v. City of Memphis, \n108 F. Supp. 3d 593, 607 (W.D. Tenn. 2015) (โ[B]ecause there is an ongoing risk of  the \ndeprivation of class membersโ fundamental rights, Plaintiffs have shown that legal remedies by \nthemselves are inadequate to resolve the Cityโs constitutional violations.โ).  Finally, โthe public \ninterest is served by preventing the violation of constitutional rights.โ Chabad of S. Ohio & \nCongregation Lubavitch v. City of Cincinnati, 363 F.3d 427, 436 (6th Cir. 2004).  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffsโ request for a permanent injunction regarding Defendantsโ bail practices is GRANTED. \nIV.  CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated herein, Defendantsโ Second Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. \n233] is  GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.   It is  further  ORDERED that \nDefendants are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from bail practices which violate Plaintiffsโ \nprocedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and their Sixth Amendment right \nto counsel consistent with this Courtโs previous memorandum opinion and order [Doc. 229].  A \nseparate judgment shall enter. \nSO ORDERED: \n \n  s/ Clifton L.

DOUGLAS  COLLINS,  in  his  official   \ncapacity as Hamblen County General Sessions  (Class Action) \nJudge,  \n \nTERESA WEST, in her official capacity as \nHamblen  County  General  Sessions  Circuit \nCourt Clerk, \n \nKATIE WEST MOORE, NANCY PHILLIPS, \nand KATHY ROBERTSON, in their official \ncapacities  as  Judicial  Commissioners  of \nHamblen County General Sessions Court, \n \nand  \n \nESCO R. JARNAGIN, in his official capacity \nas Hamblen County Sheriff, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nI.  Introduction  \n1.  Hamblen County operates a two-tier system of pretrial justice. In Hamblen County, \npeople arrested for a criminal offense who can pay their money bail1 are released from jail \n                                                        \n1 Throughout this Complaint, the terms โmoney bailโ and โsecured financial condition of \nreleaseโ are used interchangeably, and mean the same thing: a sum of money that an individual \ndetained pretrial must pay before she is released from jail. \n1 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 1 of 33   PageID #: 1\n\nimmediately.  Those who cannot pay remain in jail for weeks before they have any opportunity to \ncontest their pretrial detention or explain that they cannot pay.  How quicklyโor whetherโa \nperson is released from jail depends on her access to money.  As a consequence, the Hamblen \nCounty Jail operates at over 150 percent capacity, and some of the poorest residents of Hamblen \nCounty are kept unclothed, shackled to walls and door handles, or forced to sleep in storage closets, \nsimply because they are unable to pay for their release. \n2.  Plaintiffs  Michelle  Torres,  Robbie  Johnson-Loveday,  Amanda  Cameron,  and \nBethany Edmond (collectively, โNamed Plaintiffsโ) are currently incarcerated at the Hamblen \nCounty Jail solely because they are too poor to pay money bail. Defendants informed Named \nPlaintiffs that they are eligible for immediate release, but that they must first pay $75,000, $6,000, \n$30,000, and $1,500, respectively, as financial conditions of pretrial release.  In no case did \nDefendants consider their ability to pay or determine that pretrial detention serves any government \ninterest at the time the money bail amount was set. \n3.  Defendants are responsible for discriminatory practices that strip people of their \nfundamental constitutional rights to pretrial liberty and to freedom from being jailed solely because \nof their poverty. Moreover, Defendantsโ policies and practices that detain presumptively innocent \npeople prior to trial lack even the most basic procedural protections: a timely individualized \nhearing, notice of the issues to be determined, the opportunity to present and confront evidence \nand make arguments at a hearing with counsel, and findings on the record by clear and convincing \nevidence that the constitutional standard for pretrial detention has been met.  Defendants do not \nprovide any process for incarcerated individuals to contest their jailing until days or weeks have \npassed. Wealthier individuals who can pay money bail are released immediately. Those unable to \npay remain in the jail, at significant cost to taxpayers. \n2 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 2 of 33   PageID #: 2\n\n4.  Defendants violate Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection, substantive and procedural \ndue process, and representation by counsel.  \n5.  Defendantsโ unconstitutional policies and practices result in widespread pretrial \ndetention based on poverty. Of the more than 400 people locked in Hamblen County Jail on any \ngiven day in 2019, an average of approximately 50 percent were awaiting trial.   \n6.  Wealth-based pretrial detention exacts a heavy human toll.  The standard use of \nfinancial conditions of release in a county where one in five people live in poverty2 has resulted in \na human rights catastrophe in the largely underground Hamblen County Jail.  Detainees, shackled \nat the ankles, overflow from mold- and mildew-infested cells and some sleep nearly naked on the \nconcrete jail floor. Many human beings are chained to benches, door handles, poles, and their own \nwheelchairs. Medical care is extremely limited.  The jailโs disregard for the humanity of those \nconfined there is illustrated by a sign posted on the door that states the hours during which โthe \njail will be on lockdown for feeding.โ  See Declaration of Ethel Rhodes, Assistant Public Defender \nfor Tennesseeโs Third Judicial District (Rhodes Decl.), Ex. A ยถ 13. \n7.  In Defendant Sheriff Jarnaginโs own words, the Hamblen County Jail is a โcesspool \nof a dungeon,โ where people are forced to live in โhorrible conditions.โ3 These conditions flow \ndirectly from Defendantsโ unconstitutional pretrial-detention practices.   \n8.  The medical and mental health emergency at the jail is a result of Defendantsโ \nwealth-based detention practices. If Defendants employed constitutional bail practices, there \nwould be no jail overcrowding in Hamblen County. \n                                                        \n2 See U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder, Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months: \n2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, Table at 1 (Hamblen County, TN), \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF. \n3 Richard A. Oppel Jr., โA Cesspool of a Dungeonโ: The Surging Population in Rural Jails, \nN.Y. TIMES (Dec. 13, 2019), https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/rural-jails.html. \n3 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 3 of 33   PageID #: 3\n\n9.  Named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and as representatives \nof the class of individuals that includes all people who are or will be arrested and charged with \ncriminal offenses and who are or will be detained in the Hamblen County Jail because of \nDefendantsโ  bail  practices.  Each  Named  Plaintiff  is  already  suffering  unlawful  pretrial \nincarceration due to Defendantsโ actions. \n10.  On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Named Plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaration that Defendantsโ policies and practices violate Plaintiffsโ rights to equal protection, \nsubstantive due process, procedural due process, and representation by counsel. Plaintiffs further \nrequest that the Court issue appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief that will ensure that \nindividuals in Hamblen County do not remain in jail prior to trial solely because of their poverty, \nand without the substantive findings and procedural safeguards that the Constitution requires \nbefore the government may deprive an individual of pretrial liberty. \n11.  Plaintiffs further ask that this Court grant their Motions for Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Class-wide Preliminary Injunction and order Defendant Sheriff to cease enforcing \nunlawful orders to pay financial conditions of pretrial release against Plaintiffs unless Defendants \nJudge Collins, Judicial Commissioners, and Clerk West issue new conditions of release after \naffording Plaintiffs constitutionally compliant bail hearings. \n \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n12.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, et \nseq., and the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 \n(Declaratory Judgment Act).  \n4 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 4 of 33   PageID #: 4\n\n13.  Venue is proper in this judicial district and division pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \n \nIII.  Parties \n14.  Plaintiff Michelle Torres is a 50-year-old woman. She has been incarcerated in \nthe Hamblen County Jail for nearly three days solely because she cannot afford to pay the $75,000 \nmoney bail. \n15.  Plaintiff  Robbie  Johnson-Loveday  is  a  49-year-old  woman.  She  has  been \nincarcerated in the Hamblen County Jail for nearly six days solely because she cannot afford to \npay the $6,000 money bail.  \n16.   Plaintiff Amanda Cameron is a 36-year-old woman. She has been incarcerated \nin the Hamblen County Jail for more than two days solely because she cannot afford to pay the \n$30,000 money bail.  \n17.  Plaintiff Bethany Edmond, is a 36-year-old homeless woman. She has been \nincarcerated in the Hamblen County Jail for five days solely because she cannot afford to pay the \n$1,500 money bail.  \n18.  Defendant Sheriff Esco Jarnagin is the head of the Hamblen County Sheriffโs \nOffice and keeper of the Hamblen County Jail. Sheriff Jarnagin has custody over the individuals \nin the Jail during their booking and for the duration of their pretrial detention. The Sheriffโs Office \nenforces secured financial conditions of release by detaining people who have been arrested and \ncannot pay the secured money bail required by the General Sessions Court. Sheriff Esco Jarnagin \nis sued in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief. \n19.  Defendant Doug Collins is the Judge of the General Sessions Court in Hamblen \nCounty, which has jurisdiction over bail proceedings. Judge Collins, in his official capacity, \n5 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 5 of 33   PageID #: 5\n\nconducts initial-appearance hearings and is responsible for determining release conditions. See 9 \nTenn. Prac. Crim. Prac. & Procedure ยง 3:2; Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-4-101(6). When a person is \ncharged with a bailable offense, Judge Collins is authorized either to release that person on her \nown recognizance pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. ยงยง 40-11-115, or to admit that person to bail \npursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. ยงยง 40-11-117, - 118, and -122. Judge Collins retains authority to \ndetermine the conditions of bail โat any time prior to or at the time the defendant is bound over to \nthe  grand  jury.โ  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  ยง  40-11-104.  Judge  Collins  has  a  practice  of  requiring \nunattainable release conditions without any substantive findings or procedural safeguards, let alone \nthe constitutionally required ones. \n20.  Judge Collins has supervisory authority over judicial commissioners in Hamblen \nCounty. Cf. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-1-111(a)(1)(B)(iii). Alongside the other General Sessions judge \nin Hamblen County (who generally does not hear criminal matters), Judge Collins has authority to \nappoint  and  remove  judicial  commissioners  of  the  court.  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  ยง  40-5-204. \nAdditionally, under state law, Judge Collins maintains supervisory authority over the judicial \ncommissioners, including over how they determine conditions of release in the first instance. Tenn. \nCode Ann. ยง 40-1-111(a)(1)(A)(iv). Judge Collins is sued in his official capacity for declaratory \nrelief. \n21.  Defendant  Katie  West  Moore,  Nancy  Phillips,  and  Kathy  Robertson \n(collectively, โJudicial Commissionersโ) are judicial commissioners, whose duties include making \nprobable  cause  and  money  bail  determinations.  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  ยง  40-5-201(b).  Judicial \ncommissioners are authorized to make these bail determinations at the time of booking and at the \ninitial appearance. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-11-105(a). When determining financial conditions of \nrelease, Defendant Judicial Commissioners do not provide any notice or opportunity to be heard, \n6 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 6 of 33   PageID #: 6\n\nany opportunity to present or challenge evidence, or any findings by any legal or evidentiary \nstandard concerning arresteesโ ability to pay money bail or the necessity of pretrial detention, or \nan explanation of the reasons for their pretrial release and detention decisions on the record. They \nalso do not provide counsel at or before the proceeding. The Judicial Commissioners are sued in \ntheir official capacities for declaratory relief.  \n22.  Defendant Teresa West is the Circuit Court Clerk of the General Sessions Court \nin Hamblen County. As clerk, she is authorized to make pretrial release determinations when a \njudge is not present in court and the clerk reasonably believes he will not be present within three \nhours after the defendant is committed to jail. Tenn. Code Ann. ยง 40-11-105(a). Tenn. Code Ann. \nยง 40-11-105(b) sets forth the maximum amounts of money bail that a clerk may set given the \nbailable offense. Clerk West is sued in her official capacity for declaratory relief. \nIV.  Relevant Non-Party \n23.  John Dugger is the Criminal Court Judge for the Circuit Court for the Third \nJudicial District, which encompasses Greene, Hamblen, Hancock, and Hawkins Counties.  He sits \nin Hamblen County three terms a year.  Judge Dugger presides over all Third District jury trials in \ncriminal cases.  In addition, all grand jury proceedings take place in the Circuit Court.  Grand jury \nproceedings take place six times a year in Hamblen County. \nV.  Statement of Facts \nA. The Named Plaintiffs Are in Jail Because They Cannot Pay the Monetary Amount \nRequired For Their Pretrial Release \n \n24.  Plaintiff Michelle Torres is a 50-year-old woman who is currently detained in the \nHamblen County Jail. She would be able to leave the jail if she could pay a $75,000 money bail.  \n7 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 7 of 33   PageID #: 7\n\n25.  On February 14, 2020, Ms. Torres was arrested on various drug charges and \nbrought to the Hamblen County Jail late in the evening. She was not booked until the following \nmorning.  \n26.  At booking, a guard at the jail told her that she would have to pay a $75,000 money \nbail to be released. Ms. Torres has no idea how her money bail amount was determined, or why \nshe has to pay that sum of money in order to be released.  \n27.  Ms. Torres has not been before a judge or judicial commissioner. She has not told \nwhen she will have her initial appearance. \n28.  During previous incarceration terms in the Hamblen County Jail, Ms. Torres has \nhad  initial  appearances.  During  those  initial  appearances,  she  recalls  not  being  given  the \nopportunity to ask for an alternative condition of release or a lower money bail amount. \n29.  Neither Ms. Torres nor anyone else in her life could afford to pay the money bail \nor even lesser amount to a bondsman. She is unemployed and her disability check was cut off \nseveral months ago and has not yet been reinstated. She would be homeless if she were not able to \nstay at a friendโs house.  She struggles to meet the basic necessities of life. \n30.  Ms. Torres is suffering at the Hamblen County Jail. She has serious medical issues \nincluding cancer. At the jail, she does not expect to receive adequate medical care. The jail is also \nnot providing her with a liquid diet, as prescribed for her stomach cancer treatment. Ms. Torres is \nin an extraordinary amount of pain and discomfort.  \n31.  Ms. Torres is sleeping on the jail floor in an overcrowded pod, on a plastic cover \nwith a very thin strip of filling in it. She has no pillow.  \n8 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 8 of 33   PageID #: 8\n\n32.  Plaintiff  Robbie  Johnson-Loveday  is  a  49-year-old  woman  who  is  currently \ndetained in the Hamblen County jail. She would be able to leave the jail if she could pay a $6,000 \nmoney bail. \n33.  On  February  11,  2020,  Ms.  Johnson-Loveday  was  arrested  on  misdemeanor \ncharges related to driving under the influence and brought to the Hamblen County jail between 6 \nand 7 PM. She was not booked until the following evening on February 12, 2020.  \n34.  At booking, a corrections officer told Ms. Johnson-Loveday that her money bail \nwas set at $6,000. \n35.  On February 14, 2020, Ms. Johnson-Loveday had an initial appearance with a \nJudicial Commissioner via video conference from a room in the jail. She did not have a lawyer \nduring the proceeding. \n36.  The commissioner told Ms. Johnson-Loveday her charges and that she would need \nto pay her money bail in order to be released from jail.  \n37.  The  proceeding  before  the  commissioner  lasted  less  than  two  minutes.  The \ncommissioner did not ask Ms. Johnson-Loveday any questions about how much she should afford \nto pay, whether she had a job, or anything else about her financial resources. \n38.  Ms. Johnson-Loveday lives with her husband in a mobile home in Jefferson \nCounty, Tennessee.  \n39.  Ms. Johnson-Loveday is indigent. She and her husband have no disposable income \nafter paying their bills and child and spousal support, and buying food and other basic necessities.  \n40.  Ms.  Johnson-Loveday  works  at  a  book  factory  through  a  temporary  staffing \ncompany, making $8.10 per hour. If she stays in jail because she cannot pay the $6,000 money \n9 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 9 of 33   PageID #: 9\n\nbail, she will lose her job, which she has had for ten months. Losing her job would cause her \nfinancial ruin. \n41.  At the jail, Ms. Johnson-Loveday is sleeping on a very thin mat placed on the floor \nin a very overcrowded pod. Because she is disabled and only has one hand, it is very difficult for \nher to get up from the floor. \n42.  Ms. Johnson-Loveday is not receiving her daily medication while in jail and is \nfeeling unwell and cold as a result. \n43.  Ms. Johnson-Lovedayโs preliminary hearing in General Sessions Court is not until \nMarch 3, 2020โ21 days after she was taken into custody.  \n44.  Plaintiff Amanda Cameron is a 36-year-old woman who is currently detained in the \nHamblen County Jail. She would be able to leave the jail if she could pay a $30,000 money bail.  \n45.  On February 15, 2020, Ms. Cameron was arrested on various drug charges and \nbrought to the Hamblen County Jail. She was not booked for several hours.  \n46.  At booking, a guard told her that she would have to pay $30,000 money bail to be \nreleased. Ms. Cameron does not know why her money bail was set at this amount. \n47.  Ms. Cameron has not been before a judge or judicial commissioner. She was also \nnot told when she would have her initial appearance. \n48.  Ms. Cameron cannot afford to pay $30,000 for her release. She also cannot afford \nto pay a lesser amount to a bondsman. No one in her family would be able to scrape together \nenough money to get her out of jail. \n49.  Ms. Cameron is the sole caregiver to her one-year-old daughter. Her only income \nis from occasional jobs she gets to make flower arrangements, amounting to about $300 per week. \nShe relies on food stamps to feed herself and her daughter. \n10 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 10 of 33   PageID #: 10\n\n50.  Being in the jail has taken a significant toll on Ms. Cameronโs physical and mental \nhealth. She is agonizing over and anxious about being separated from her daughter. She also \nworried that she will not have access to any of her daily medications while in jail. Without these \nmedications, she is in pain and at risk of having seizures. \n51.  Ms. Cameron sleeps on the floor of the jail in a very overcrowded cell, on top of a \nthin strip of foam, without a pillow. \n52.  Plaintiff Bethany Edmond is a 36-year-old woman who is currently detained in the \nHamblen County jail. She would be able to leave the jail if she could pay a $1,500 money bail. \n53.  On February 12, 2020, in the morning, Ms. Edmond was arrested on misdemeanor \ncharges for alleged drug possession and littering, and brought to the Hamblen County Jail. She \nwas not booked until the early morning of the following day, February 13, 2020.  \n54.  Prior to booking, a jail guard told Ms. Edmond that her money bail was set at \n$1,500. \n55.  On February 14, 2020, Ms. Edmond had an initial appearance with a Judicial \nCommissioner via video conference from a room in the jail. She did not have a lawyer during the \nproceeding. \n56.  The commissioner read Ms. Edmond her charges and told her when her next court \ndate would be. The commissioner did not ask Ms. Edmond if she would be able to afford her bond. \n57.  The  proceeding  before  the  commissioner  lasted  less  than  two  minutes.  The \ncommissioner did not ask Ms. Edmond any questions about her financial resources. \n58.  Ms. Edmond is homeless. She and her husband live in a tent. Both she and her \nhusband have no money at all and no assets. At the time of her arrest, she recalls having only 36 \ncents in her pocket. \n11 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 11 of 33   PageID #: 11\n\n59.  Ms. Edmond has been unemployed for over a year, but she was scheduled to begin \norientation for a job at Koch Foods the week of her arrest and start working the following week. \nShe fears that she will no longer have that job opportunity when she is released from jail. \n60.  Ms. Edmond is devastated that she cannot see her two children while in jail โ she \nnormally sees them every day.  \n61.  Ms. Edmond is currently in tremendous pain because she has not received any of \nher prescribed medications since entering the jail. Because of this discomfort, she is not able to \nsleep or eat.  \n62.  Ms. Edmond sleeps on a thin mat on the floor of the jail without a pillow. Her pod \nis severely overcrowded, and there is mold growing in it. \nB.  Because Defendants Do Not Provide a Constitutional Pretrial Release Process People \nAre Incarcerated Solely Due to Their Poverty \n \n63.  As a matter of practice, Defendants require secured financial conditions of pretrial \nrelease for almost all people arrested in Hamblen County.  \nThe Pretrial Release and Detention Process in Hamblen County  \n64.  When an arrest warrant is issued prior to arrest, a police officer presents an affidavit \nof complaint to the clerk or deputy clerk, who finds probable cause and signs off on the arrest. \nAfter the warrant is approved, a judicial commissioner, Judge Collins, or Clerk West sets a \nfinancial condition of release on the warrant.  \n65.  In the case of warrantless arrests, after an individual is arrested and booked into the \nHamblen County Jail, the arresting officer procures from the Clerkโs office a post-arrest warrant \non which a financial condition of pretrial release is affixed using the same procedure as for a pre-\narrest warrant. Thus, all people arrested in Hamblen County have their conditions of release \n12 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 12 of 33   PageID #: 12\n\ninitially determinedโin their absenceโby either Defendant Judge Collins, one of the Defendant \nJudicial Commissioners, or Defendant Clerk West (collectively, โinitial bail-settersโ). \n66.  The initial bail-setters impose financial conditions of release without regard to the \nindividualโs ability to pay secured money bail, their ties to the community, or other constitutionally \nrelevant factors. Despite lacking any knowledge of an individualโs financial circumstances, the \ninitial bail-setters have a practice of requiring monetary conditions of release in the vast majority \nof cases. Thus, the initial bail-setters determine an amount of money bail based only on the charges \non which the arrested person has been booked and the nature of the allegations in the probable \ncause statement, and, when available, any prior convictions and jail-bookings in Hamblen County. \n67.  For people who cannot pay, the money bail order written on their warrant operates \nas a de facto detention order because they cannot obtain the amount of money required for their \nrelease.  \n68.  Individuals who cannot pay the amount of money bail required for their release \nremain in jail and await their โinitial appearance.โ4 In Hamblen County, a judicial commissioner \nor Judge Collins conducts the initial appearance, typically by video conference between the \njudicial officer in chambers and the arrested person in a converted bathroom in the jail. Initial \nappearances take place only on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Initial appearances are very \nbrief proceedings at which the judicial officer informs arrested persons of the charges against them, \ntheir conditions of release, and their next court date. Indigent individuals are not represented by \ncounsel at these proceedings and have no opportunity to raise any challenge to their ongoing \npretrial detention. \n                                                        \n4 This proceeding is sometimes referred to as an โarraignmentโ or โvideo arraignmentโ \neven though it does not take place in criminal court. See 9 Tenn. Prac. Crim. Prac. & Procedure ยง \n3:2 (differentiating between an โinitial appearanceโ before a magistrate and an โarraignmentโ \nbefore the criminal court following an indictment). \n13 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 13 of 33   PageID #: 13\n\n69.  At the initial appearance, Judicial Commissioners and Judge Collins reaffirm the \nde facto detention orders set at the warrant stage without making any finding that pretrial detention \nis required to serve a compelling government interest, as is constitutionally required.  And they do \nso without any meaningful process, let alone the detailed procedures required by the Due Process \nClause,  including:  a  timely  individualized  hearing;  notice  of  the  issues  to  be  determined; \nrepresentation by counsel; the opportunity to present and confront evidence and make arguments; \nfindings on the record explaining the basis for any condition of release imposed and the evidence \nrelied on; and, if such conditions will result in pretrial detention, a finding by clear and convincing \nevidence that pretrial incarceration is necessary because no alternative conditions or combination \nof conditions would reasonably ensure the individual's future court appearance or the safety of the \ncommunity.  As a result, the monetary conditions of release affixed at the warrant stage remain \nafter the initial appearance and, because the arrestee cannot afford to pay, continue to function as \nde facto orders of pretrial detention.  \n70.  Defendant Judicial Commissioners and Judge Collins do not provide at the initial \nappearance an opportunity to contest conditions of pretrial release, including money bail, and \nrefuse to hear requests from arrestees to change the conditions. If individuals attempt to request a \nchange to their conditions of release, they are not able to. Rather, they must wait for a public \ndefender to be appointed and to contact them, and then to request that their attorney file a motion \nfor review of their pretrial-release conditions. At the initial appearance, detainees are permitted to \nspeak only to inform the court whether they plan to retain counsel or would like a public defender \nto be appointed to represent them.  \n71.  If an individual requests and is appointed a public defender, the Clerk notifies the \nHamblen County Public Defender Office of the appointment. This process can take several days. \n14 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 14 of 33   PageID #: 14\n\nAlthough an individual may know she was approved for a public defender if informed by the \nJudicial Commissioner or Judge Collins at the initial appearance, she typically will not know who \nher public defender is until her first appearance in General Sessions court. \n72.  After the initial appearance, individuals who cannot pay their financial conditions \nof release remain detained while awaiting their first appearance before Judge Collins in General \nSessions Court. This preliminary hearing occurs as many as 14 business days from the initial \nappearance. This hearing is typically the first opportunity for indigent defendants to meet their \ncourt-appointed counsel. Because there is no mechanism in Hamblen County to request review of \nconditions of release until an individual meets with counsel, the preliminary hearing is also \ntypically the first opportunity for defendants to attempt to challenge a de facto order of pretrial \ndetention.  \n73.  Even whenโat or after the preliminary hearingโdefense counsel seeks to modify \nthe bail amount initially imposed at the warrant stage, Defendant Collins refuses to consider \nconstitutionally required factors, including ability to pay, or to provide the substantive findings \nand procedural safeguards required by the Constitution. \n74.  Defendants Judge Collins and Judicial Commissioners routinely require money bail \nin amounts unattainable to the either class members or the average resident of Hamblen County, \none-fifth of whom live below the poverty line.5 \n75.  Judge Dugger, the Criminal Court Judge for the Circuit Court for the Third Judicial \nCircuit, sits in Hamblen County itself only three terms a year, and grand juries are convened only \nsix times a year. As a result, individuals subject to de facto pretrial detention due to inability to \npay will typically wait months before their case has been indicted by a grand jury.  \n                                                        \n5 See U.S. Census Bureau, supra note 2. \n15 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 15 of 33   PageID #: 15\n\n76.  Individuals who have not yet been indicted by the grand jury are not entitled to \ndiscovery in their case as a matter of local practice and state law. Those who cannot purchase their \nrelease are routinely desperate to resolve their cases in order to escape the inhumane and dangerous \nconditions at the Hamblen County Jail. Thus, the vast majority of pretrial detainees in General \nSessions court in Hamblen County will plead guilty before their public defender has received any \ninformation about their case, done any investigation, received exculpatory evidence, or been able \nto evaluate the legal and factual defenses available. \n77.  As a result of Defendantsโ policies and practices, indigent individuals are subject \nto extended periods of wealth-based pretrial detention before being provided the hearing on their \nconditions of release that federal law requires. \nC. Hamblen Countyโs Unconstitutional Pretrial Policies and Practices Harm Individuals \nand Communities.  \n \n78.  Due to Defendantsโ unconstitutional policies and practices, presumptively innocent \nindividuals are detained in Hamblen County every day solely because they are too poor to pay the \nmonetary  release  conditions  imposed  without  any  hearing,  let  alone  a  hearing  that  meets \nconstitutional standards.   \n79.  Pretrial incarceration harms individualsโ lives beyond their loss of liberty and the \ndegrading and life-threatening conditions they endure in jail. Other consequences of pretrial \nincarceration include loss of income because individuals often lose their jobs while detained; loss \nof housing and missed payments on utilities and other bills because individuals cannot make rent \nand other payments when jailed; loss of physical and/or legal custody of children; an increase in \nmental illness because conditions in jail can put an individual under extreme stress and restrict \naccess to needed medications, exacerbating or even causing further trauma and mental illness; a \nhigh likelihood of assault, including sexual assault, especially in the first few days of incarceration; \n16 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 16 of 33   PageID #: 16\n\nexposure to communicable diseases; inability to exercise; deprivation of sunlight and fresh air; and \nforcible separation from children and family. \n80.  In addition, being detained pretrial has a significant impact on the legal outcome of \na personโs case. Detained individuals are more likely to plead guilty just to shorten their jail time, \neven if they are innocent.6 They have a harder time preparing a defense, gathering evidence and \nwitnesses, and meeting with their lawyers. Studies show that those detained pretrial face worse \noutcomes at trial and sentencing than those released pretrial, even when charged with the same \noffense and controlling for all other factors.7  Controlling for other factors, a person who is detained \npretrial is 13 percent more likely to be convicted and 25 percent more likely to plead guilty than a \nperson who is not detained.8 And those detained pretrial are more likely to receive longer jail \nsentences.9   A personโs pretrial detention thus has an irreparable impact on the outcome of a \ncriminal case, and on the personโs life for years afterward. \n81.  Thus,  Defendantsโ  practice  of  issuing  de  facto  detention  orders  by  requiring \nunattainable monetary conditions of pretrial release without substantive findings or procedural \n                                                        \n6  See Arpit Gupta, Christopher Hansman, & Ethan Frenchman, The Heavy Costs of High \nBail: Evidence from Judge Randomization 15, 18โ19 (May 2, 2016), https://goo.gl/OW5OzL \n(โCriminal defendants assessed bail amounts appear frequently unable to produce the required bail \namounts, and receive guilty outcomes as a result.  Entered guilty pleas by defendants unwilling to \nwait months prior to trial and unable to finance bail likely contribute to this result.โ). \n7  See  CHRISTOPHER  LOWENKAMP  ET  AL.,  INVESTIGATING  THE  IMPACT  OF  PRETRIAL \nDETENTION ON SENTENCING OUTCOMES, LAURA AND JOHN ARNOLD FOUNDATION 12, 14 (2013), \nhttps://university.pretrial.org/viewdocument/investigating-the-im (those detained for the entire \npretrial period are more likely to be sentenced to jail and prisonโand receive longer sentencesโ\nthan those who are released at some point before trial or case disposition); Megan T.

To take one extreme example, a man died this past summer at the Hamblen County Jail \nwhile waiting to be booked.10   \n82.  Wealth-based pretrial detention also makes the community less safe.  First, wealth-\nbased detention unnecessarily jails those who could be released safely into the community.  Several \nstudies have shown that just two or three days in pretrial detention increases the likelihood that an \nindividual will commit a crime in the future, and increases the future risk level of even low-risk \ndefendants.11  People who are detained for a few days following arrest are also more likely to miss \ncourt dates in the future, all because of the destabilizing effects of short periods in jail.12   In other \nwords, detention based on poverty for just a few days increases recidivism.  Second, wealth-based \npretrial systems release individuals based only on their ability to pay and without any assessment \nof their risk of flight or dangerousness.  Consequently, if the government believed that certain \nindividuals needed monitoring or supervision to mitigate their risk of flight or dangerousness, they \nwould receive neither if released by paying money bail.   \n                                                        \n10 Travis Dorman, Man Dies While Waiting to Be Booked into Hamblen County Jail, \nKnoxville  News  Sentinel  (Aug.  12,  2019), \nhttps://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2019/08/12/man-dies-while-waiting-booked-into-\nhamblen-county-jail/1993060001/. \n11 See Department of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, Fundamentals of Bail, 15-\n16 (2014),  https://goo.gl/jr7sMg (โ[D]efendants rated low risk and detained pretrial for longer \nthan one day before their pretrial release are more likely to commit a new crime once they are \nreleased, demonstrating that length of time until pretrial release has a direct impact on public \nsafety.โ); CHRISTOPHER T. LOWENKAMP ET AL., supra note at 7 (studying 153,407 defendants and \nfinding that โwhen held 2โ3 days, low risk defendants are almost 40 percent more likely to commit \nnew crimes before trial than equivalent defendants held no more than 24 hoursโ); Paul Heaton et \nal., supra note 9, at 768 (โWhile pretrial detention clearly exerts a protective effect in the short \nrun, for misdemeanor defendants it may ultimately service to compromise public safety,โ and \nfinding that in a representative group of 10,000 misdemeanor offenders, pretrial detention would \ncause an additional 600 misdemeanors and 400 felonies compared to if the same group had been \nreleased pretrial). \n12  See also Gupta et al., supra note 6, at 19. \n18 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 18 of 33   PageID #: 18\n\n83.  Other jurisdictions around the country do not detain people pretrial based on their \naccess to cash.  Instead of relying on money, these jurisdictions release arrestees with unsecured \nfinancial conditions, non-financial conditions, and pretrial supervision practices and procedures \nthat can help increase court attendance and public safety without requiring detention. Such non-\nmonetary  conditions  of  release  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  unsecured  bonds,  reporting \nobligations, phone and text message reminders of court dates, rides to court for those without \ntransportation or a stable address, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment, counseling, \nalcohol monitoring devices, stay-away orders, or, in extreme cases of particular individualized \nrisk, electronic monitoring, curfew, and home confinement. \n84.  Jurisdictions that rely on non-monetary conditions of release do not sacrifice public \nsafety or court attendance; they enhance it.  For example, the agency in charge of pretrial \nsupervision in Washington, D.C., found that โ[t]he high nonfinancial release rate has been \naccomplished without sacrificing the safety of the public or the appearance of people in court.โ13 \nSpecifically, โAgency data show that 90 percent of released people make all court appearances \nand that 91 percent complete the pretrial release period without any new arrests.โ14 \n85.  The federal system also prohibits wealth-based detention, expressly preventing a \njudicial officer from imposing a financial condition of release that results in pretrial detention. 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 3142(c)(3). It further creates a requirement that an arrested person be released upon \npersonal recognizance or execution of an unsecured appearance bond unless findings are made by \na judicial officer that other conditions are necessary to assure appearance and public safety. 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 3142(b).  Although pretrial detention is permitted, it may be imposed only after a hearing \n                                                        \n13 PRETRIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE, THE PRETRIAL SERVICES AGENCY FOR THE DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA:  LESSONS  FROM  FIVE  DECADES  OF  INNOVATION  AND  GROWTH  2  (2018), \nhttps://perma.cc/8KAD-TY5H. \n14 Id. \n19 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 19 of 33   PageID #: 19\n\nwith  rigorous  procedural  protections,  including  the  right  to  be  represented  by  counsel;  the \nopportunity to testify, present witnesses, and cross-examine witnesses; and a requirement that any \npretrial detention order be based on a finding on the record that no conditions would ensure the \npersonโs appearance and the safety of the community.  18 U.S.C. ยง 3142 (f). The federal practice \nhas not harmed court appearance rates or public safety.15 \n86.  Pretrial  detention  based  solely  on  wealth  is  consistently  more  expensive  to \nadminister than effective pretrial release programs.16 Without relying on a personโs ability to afford \ncash bail, pretrial release programs can save taxpayer expense while maintaining high public safety \nand court appearance rates associated with wealth-based practices like Defendantsโ, which rely \nsolely on access to money.   \nD. Defendantsโ  Wealth-Based  Detention  Practices  Have  Resulted  in  Deplorable \nConditions in the Hamblen County Jail. \n \n87.  The Hamblen County Jail is urgently overcrowded. Although it is certified for 255 \nindividuals,17 in December 2019, the most recent month for which data are available, 384 people \nwere detained in the jail on a given day.18  This means the Jail was operating at 150.6 percent \n                                                        \n15 See Thomas H.

The situation has been even worse in other months.  In July and August 2019, the Jail \ndetained more than 450 on a given day.19 \n88.  This overcrowding is inhumane. Rather than beds, many individuals sleep chained \nto benches, door handles, poles, and their own wheelchairs.  Converted storage closets are used as \nersatz housing units, where detained people sleep shoulder-to-shoulder on mattresses on the floor. \nThey lack adequate clothingโoften less than enough to be fully covered. Detainees, packed into \nsmall unsanitary spaces, suffer from poor ventilation and face high risks of getting sick from the \nmold and mildew in the jail, which is not adequately cleaned because of the severe overcrowding. \nLacking a dedicated meeting space, lawyers must speak to their clients in a converted supply \ncloset. The conditions in the Hamblen County Jail therefore make it difficult for detainees to mount \nan effective legal defense. \n                                                        \n19  TENN.

From 2010 to present, the Tennessee Corrections Instituteโthe state government \nbody responsible for establishing minimum standards for jailsโhas recommended the Hamblen \nCounty Jail for non-certification for failure to comply with its minimum standards.20  \n90.  Defendant  Sheriff  Jarnagin  has  acknowledged  that  the  jail  fails  to  meet  the \nminimum standards required by the TCI.21 He notes: โWeโre trying to keep the jail clean but itโs \ndifficult to keep a cell block clean when youโve got six beds and youโve got 35 inmates in there.โ22 \n91.  The extreme overcrowding in the jail is a direct consequence of Defendantsโ use of \nmoney bail to order the de facto detention of people accused of crimes. Few can afford to pay for \ntheir freedom, as one out of every five people in Hamblen County lives in poverty.23  Only 4.5 \npercent of the population over the age of 16 worked full-time year-round in 2017, the last year for \nwhich data is available.24 Over 26 percent of this population did not work at all in 2017.25   \n92.  Fifty percent of the population of the Hamblen County jail is detained pretrial.  The \nvast majority of that detained pretrial population is there solely because they cannot afford to pay \nfor their release.  Many pretrial detainees in the Hamblen County Jail are not only detained pretrial \nbut also pre-indictment.  Because grand juries convene only three times a year in Hamblen County, \n                                                        \n20 Memorandum Opinion and Order, Zackery Beck v.

To escape prolonged detention in the Hamblen County Jail and the outrageous \nconditions there, most pretrial detainees choose to plead guilty before their case has even been \nindicted by a grand jury or they have received discovery. \nVI.  Class Action Allegations \n94.  Named Plaintiffs bring the Claims in this action, on behalf of themselves and all \nothers similarly situated, as a class action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1)-(4) and \n23(b)(2). \n95.   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), certification of a class is appropriate \nwhere: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are \nquestions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n96.  Plaintiffs request that the Court certify a class composed of all people who are or \nwill be arrested and charged with criminal offenses and who are or will be detained in the Hamblen \nCounty Jail because of Defendantsโ bail practices \nA. Rule 23(a) \n97.  Numerosity. The precise size of the Class is unknown by Plaintiff because it is \nforward-looking, but it is substantial, given that hundreds of arrests are each made every year in \nthe Hamblen County District Court.  Joinder of these unknown future members is impracticable. \n25 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 25 of 33   PageID #: 25\n\n98.  Many of the class members are low-income individuals who will likely lack \nfinancial resources to bring an independent action or to be joined in this action. Joinder of every \nmember of the class would be impracticable.  \n99.  Commonality. The relief sought is common to all class members. Named Plaintiffs \nseek relief from Defendantsโ money bail policies, practices, and procedures, which violate the \nrights of the Class members. Named Plaintiffs also seek relief declaring that Defendantsโ policies, \npractices, and procedures regarding the setting of bail violate the Class membersโ constitutional \nrights. \n100.  Among the most important, but not the only, common questions of fact are:  \na.  Whether Defendants impose monetary conditions of release that result in detention \nwithout consideration of class membersโ ability to pay; \n \nb.  Whether Defendants require pretrial conditions of release that result in detention \nwithout any substantive findings that detention is necessary; \n \nc.  Whether, when, and how Defendants determine what conditions of pretrial release \nshould be and whether, for example, Defendants provide a timely individualized \nhearing; notice of the issues to be determined; representation by counsel; the \nopportunity to present and confront evidence and make arguments; findings on the \nrecord explaining the basis for any condition of release imposed and the evidence \nrelied on; and, if such conditions will result in pretrial detention, a finding by clear \nand convincing evidence that pretrial detention is necessary because no alternative \nconditions or combination of conditions would reasonably ensure the individual's \nfuture court appearance and the safety of the community; and \n  \nd.  How long individuals arrested must wait in jail after arrest before they have an \nopportunity to challenge pretrial release conditions, raise their inability to pay for \ntheir release or to request alternative, non-financial conditions. \n \n101.  Among the most important common question of law are: \na.  Whether Defendantsโ detention of poor arrestees without the substantive findings \nthe Constitution requires before a presumptively innocent person may be ordered \nWhether requiring an individual to pay money to secure release from pretrial \ndetention without an inquiry into or findings concerning the individualโs ability to \npay the amount required, and without meaningful consideration of and findings \n26 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 26 of 33   PageID #: 26\n\nconcerning less restrictive alternative conditions of release, violates the Fourteenth \nAmendmentโs Due Process and Equal Protection clauses; \n  \nb.  Whether it is lawful to impose a secured financial condition of release that operates \nas a de facto order of pretrial detention because of a personโs inability to pay \nwithout complying with the procedural safeguards, applying the correct legal \nstandard, and making the substantive findings required for an order of preventive \npretrial detention; and \n \nc.  Whether setting of pretrial release conditions without affording an individual \ncounsel violates the Sixth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due \nProcess Clause. \n \n102.  Typicality. Named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the other members \nof the Class, and they have the same interests in this case as all other Class members that they \nrepresent.  Each of them suffers injuries from the failure of Defendants to comply with the \nConstitution: they are each confined in jail because they could not pay their secured monetary \nbond amount.  Resolution of the constitutionality of Defendantsโ money bail practices will \ndetermine the claims of Named Plaintiffs and every other Class member. \n103.  If Named Plaintiffs succeed in the claim that Defendantsโ policies and practices \nconcerning wealth-based detention violate their constitutional rights, that ruling likewise will \nbenefit every other member of the Class.   \n104.  Adequacy.  Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe proposed Class they seek to represent. \n105.  Named Plaintiffs have no interests separate from or in conflict with those of the \nproposed Class they seek to represent as a whole and Named Plaintiffs seek no relief other than \nthe declaratory and injunctive relief, which is sought on behalf of the entire proposed Class they \nseek to represent. \n27 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 27 of 33   PageID #: 27\n\n106.  Class Counsel.  Named Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Civil Rights \nCorps and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, who have experience in \nlitigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the details \nof Defendantsโ practices and the relevant constitutional and statutory law.  Counsel have the \nresources, expertise, and experience to prosecute this action.   \nB.  Rule 23(b)(2)  \n107.  Class  certification  is  appropriate  because  Defendants  have  acted  in  the  same \nunconstitutional manner with respect to all class members: Defendants require all arrestees to pay \nfor their release. Those who can pay are released and those who cannot are detained.    \n108.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that Defendants violate \nthe Named Plaintiffsโ and Class membersโ rights under the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments by \nrequiring  secured  financial  conditions  of  release  without  prompt  and  individualized  release \nhearings  that  provide  appropriate  substantive  findings  and  adequate  procedural  protections.  \nBecause  the  putative  Class  challenges  Defendantsโ  practices  as  unconstitutional  through \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief that would apply the same relief to every member of the Class, \nRule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate and necessary.  \nC.  Rule 23(g)  \n109.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g) requires that the court appoint class counsel \nfor any class that is certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). Class counsel must โfairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of the class.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4).  \n110.  For reasons set forth in the contemporaneously filed Memorandum in Support of \nMotion for Class Certification, undersigned counsel meet the factors the court must consider under \nRule 23(g): (1) โthe work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential claims in the \n28 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 28 of 33   PageID #: 28\n\nactionโ; (2) โcounselโs experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types \nof claims asserted in the action;โ (3) โcounselโs knowledge of the applicable law;โ and (4) โthe \nresources that counsel will commit to representing the class.โ \nVII.  Claims for Relief \nCOUNT I  \nDefendants Violate Plaintiffsโ26 Fourteenth Amendment Rights to Equal Protection \nand Due Process through a Policy and Practice that Jails Individuals Prior to Trial Based \non their Access to Money   \n \n111.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n112.  Plaintiffs have a right to be free from wealth-based detention. The Fourteenth \nAmendmentโs  Equal  Protection  and  Due  Process  Clauses  forbid  the  government  to  detain \nindividuals prior to trial based solely on lack of access to money.  The constitutional principles \nthat forbid jailing a convicted defendant solely because the person is unable to make a payment, \nsee,  e.g.,  Bearden  v.  Georgia,  461  U.S.  660,  672  (1983)  (invalidating  state  practice  of \nautomatically revoking probation for failure to pay a fine or restitution, without considering \nprobationerโs  ability  to  pay  or  whether  other  alternative  measures  meet  stateโs  interest  in \npunishment and deterrence), apply with even greater force to an arrestee who is presumed innocent.  \nCOUNT II \nDefendants Violate Plaintiffsโ Fundamental Fourteenth Amendment  \n Due Process Right to Pretrial Liberty \n  \n113.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n                                                        \n26 For each claim, the term โPlaintiffsโ refers to both the Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe proposed class, unless otherwise specified. \n29 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 29 of 33   PageID #: 29\n\n114.  Freedom from imprisonment lies at the heart of the liberty that the Due Process \nClause protects. See, e.g., Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992) (โFreedom from bodily \nrestraint has always been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from \narbitrary government action.โ).  Pretrial detention infringes upon this right and may only be \nrequired if it is narrowly focused to serve compelling government interests.  \n115.  The stateโs interest at the pretrial stage is limited to ensuring the accused will appear \nfor trial and protecting the public from danger associated specifically with that individualโs release.  \n116.  Here, Plaintiffs have been detained on de facto detention orders and deprived of \npretrial  liberty  through  imposition  of  unattainable  financial  conditions  without  any  court \nconsidering Plaintiffsโ likelihood of appearing at future court appearances and whether Plaintiffs \npose any danger to the community, and without any court making a substantive finding that no \nalternatives to such de facto pretrial detention would serve the governmentโs interests.    \nCOUNT III \nDefendants Violate Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment  \nRight to Procedural Due Process  \n \n117.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n118.  Procedurally,  orders  of  pretrial  detention  may  be  entered  only  after  rigorous \nprocedures have been met.  See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). These procedures \ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to: a timely individualized hearing; notice of the issues to \nbe determined; representation by counsel; the opportunity to present and confront evidence and \nmake arguments; findings on the record explaining the basis for any condition of release imposed \nand the evidence relied on; and, if such conditions will result in pretrial detention, a finding by \nclear and convincing evidence that pretrial incarceration is necessary because no alternative \n30 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 30 of 33   PageID #: 30\n\nconditions or combination of conditions would reasonably ensure the individual's future court \nappearance and the safety of the community. Procedural due process requires procedures sufficient \nto protect Plaintiffsโ substantive rights to pretrial liberty and against wealth-based detention.  \n119.  Here, Plaintiffs were provided none of these constitutionally required procedures \nbefore being detained because they could not pay.  \n COUNT IV \nDefendants Violate Plaintiffsโ Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel \nby Not Providing Them with Counsel at Proceedings Resulting in Pretrial Detention \n \n120.   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n121.  The  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  guarantees  criminal \ndefendants the right to counsel at each post-attachment critical stage of the criminal process.  See, \ne.g., Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156, 165 (2012) (โThe Sixth Amendment requires effective \nassistance of counsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. . . . The constitutional guarantee \napplies to pretrial critical stages . . . .โ).  Bail determinations are post-attachment critical stages for \nwhich counsel must be provided.  \n122.  Defendantsโ failure to provide counsel at hearings that result in pretrial detention \nthat prejudices both Plaintiffsโ immediate liberty interests and the ultimate outcomes of their cases.  \n123.  Defendants violate the Sixth Amendment by conducting critical pretrial release and \ndetention proceedings without providing counsel. \nVIII.  Prayer for Relief \n124.   WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request the following relief: \na.  Certification of a class under Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, represented by Named Plaintiffs; \n \n31 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 31 of 33   PageID #: 31\n\nb.  A  declaration  that  Defendants  violate  Named  Plaintiffsโ  and  Class \nmembersโ  rights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  by  requiring  secured  financial \nconditions of release without inquiry into or findings concerning their ability to pay, or \nmeaningful consideration of and findings concerning whether alternative non-financial \nconditions of release serve the governmentโs interests; \n \nc.  A  declaration  that  Defendants  violate  Named  Plaintiffsโ  and  Class \nmembersโ due-process rights by imposing financial conditions of release that result in \ndetention  without  conducting  a  prompt  individualized  release  hearing  with  adequate \nprocedural safeguards including the following:  \n \nโ  Notice to the individual arrested of the critical factual and legal \nissues at stake in the proceeding; \n \nโ  If  a  financial  condition  of  release  is  being  considered,  a \ndetermination of each individualโs ability to pay money bail and the amount of \nmoney they can afford; \n \nโ  An opportunity for the individual arrested to be heard concerning \ntheir ability to afford money bail and what nonmonetary release conditions, if any, \nare necessary.  \n \nโ  An  opportunity  for  the  individual  arrested  to  present  evidence, \ncontest  the  governmentโs  evidence,  and  to  make  arguments  concerning  the \nimposition of conditions of release; \n \nโ  The  provision  of  counsel  if  the  individual  is  unable  to  afford \ncounsel; \n \nโ  Before  imposing  pretrial  detention,  substantive  findings  on  the \nrecord by clear and convincing evidence, including the evidence relied on and \nreasons for such findings, that detention is necessary because no less restrictive \nalternatives to detention address the stateโs compelling interests; \n \n  \nd.  A  declaration  that  Defendants  violate  Named  Plaintiffsโ  and  Class \nMembersโ right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment by failing to provide counsel to \nindigent people at pretrial release and detention hearings; \n \ne.  A  temporary  restraining  order  requiring  the  Sheriff  to  release  Named \nPlaintiffs unless they are provided the procedures stated above; \n \nf.  An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently enjoining the Sheriff \nfrom enforcing financial conditions that result in de facto pretrial detention without \nfindings that pretrial detention is necessary to meet a compelling government interest and \nwithout the procedural safeguards required for confidence in that substantive outcome; \n32 \n \nCase 2:20-cv-00026-DCLC-CRW   Document 1   Filed 02/16/20   Page 32 of 33   PageID #: 32\n\n \ng.  An  order  and  judgment  granting  reasonable  attorneysโ  fees  and  costs \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and \n \nh.
