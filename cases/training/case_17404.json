    "summary": "<p>This is a historic case about prisoner rights in New York prisons. It's part of the Clearinghouse's <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?special_collection=5701&amp;ordering=-last_updated_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collection</a> of several cases brought by prisoners rights activist (and prisoner) Martin Sostre, whose wikipedia biography is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sostre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 1973, Sostre filed this lawsuit, pro se, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. He sued New York State&rsquo;s Commissioner of Corrections and the Wardens of Auburn and Clinton Prisons under &sect;1983 a few days after he was allegedly beaten in the Segregation Unit at Clinton Prison, by a squad of seven or more officers, when he refused to bend over and spread his buttocks to exhibit his anus to them in the course of a strip search. The Complaint asserted seventeen separate causes of action, including wrongful punishment and indefinite confinement to segregation, wrongful application of the no-beard rule, wrongful imposition of the rectal search, wrongful denial of visits from attorneys, clergy and friends, interference with mail, and wrongful punitive transfer from Auburn to Clinton. Sostre sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and money damages.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 1973, Judge Edmund Port entered an order finding the complaint sufficient in law to permit the plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis. The case then lay dormant in the Northern District for sixteen months until Sostre was able to obtain counsel; starting February, 1975, he was represented by radical prisoners&rsquo; rights lawyers Michael Deutsch and Dennis Cunningham.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once Sostre obtained counsel, the Court agreed to hear his motion for preliminary relief, and entered an order directing that the plaintiff be brought into federal custody so he would not again have to face the forcible search and re-confinement to the Segregation Unit. On March 4 and 5, 1975, a hearing was held pertaining to Sostre&rsquo;s request for preliminary relief. That request included that the defendants be enjoined from (1) enforcing a rule or regulation prohibiting inmates at Clinton Correctional Facility from wearing a beard; (2) continuing to punish plaintiff for violating the no-beard rule or regulation; and (3) requiring the plaintiff to submit to a rectal search upon entering and leaving a Special Housing Unit at Clinton Correctional Facility.</p>\r\n<p>The district court denied preliminary relief, finding that plaintiff failed to show likely success on the merits and irreparable injury. Judge Port ordered Sostre returned to the custody of the Clinton Prison. However, this order was stayed, with the agreement of defendants, pending disposition of plaintiff's appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 1975, the appeals court reversed the district court's denial of preliminary relief and remanded the matter to the district court. In an opinion written by Judge Oakes, the Second Circuit concluded that it could not rule on the relief sought because the record did not establish what the \"no-beard\" and \"rectal search\" rules, if they were such, required. Without knowing what the rules said, the court determined it could not ascertain whether the rules had been properly applied. It remanded the case to the district court for record development and re-evaluation. The opinion, however, reaffirmed that prison inmates are entitled to certain fundamental rights, and stated that limitations on such rights \"must be supported by the legitimate and reasonable needs and exigencies of the institutional environment,\" and that these limitations must be narrowly tailored. The opinion also stated that the district court would not be amiss were it to continue the stay order in effect to keep plaintiff in federal custody. 519 F.2d 763</p>\r\n<p>By this time, Sostre had gained international news media attention and been labeled as a \"prisoner of conscience\" by Amnesty International. In December 1975, New York's governor Hugh Carey granted Sostre clemency, and he was released from custody. Presumably, this case was mooted as a result; federal records show that the case officially ended on Jan. 18, 1978.</p>",

At \n‘all  the*times  material  here,  the  Defendants, \nPreiser  and  Oswald,  wer  acting  as  or  were  former \nConmissioners  of  Correctional  Services  for  the \nState  of  New  York,  and  the  Defendant  Henderson \n‘and  the  Defendant  LaVallee  were  respectively  the \nSuperintendents  of  the  Auburn  Correctional  Facility \n10  and  the  Clinton  Correctional  Facility.  The  Plaintifé \nll  Martin  Sostre,  is  confined  presently  in  Clinton: \n12  Correctional  Facility  in  execution  of  a  sentence \n13  of  25  to  40  years  on  a  conviction  of  a  violation \nli     relating  to  narcotics  and  assault.  Pursuant  to \n15  that  judgment  of  conviction  and  execution  of  ee \n16  the  Plaintiff  has  been  confined  in  various  State \n  \n17  correctional  facilitieisn   New  York  since \n18  March  1968.  In  August  of  1972,  the  Plaintiff  was \n1S  transferred  to  the  Auburn  Correctional  Facility. \n20  Sons  the  Auburn  Correctional  Facility  he  was \n   21  transferred  to  Clinton  Correctional  Facility.

COURT REPORTERS \nraon \n  \n| \n  \nwas  as  a  result  of  charges  alleging  violations  of \nrules  and  regulations  of  the  institutions,  And \nexamination  of  the  Plaintiff's  record  within  the \ninstitutions  indicates  that  a  great  majority  of \n a his  confinement  s  in  Special  Housing  results  from \nactions  of  the  Adjustment  Committee  directing  that \nhe  be  confined  in  those  units  for  periods  of  seven. \n“days  at  es  Sik  be  the  majority  of  the  charges \nfor  which  the  Adjustment  Committee  ordered  his \n10 \n‘confinement  related  to  the  Plaintiff's  refusal  to \n1l \nremove  his  beard  when  requested  to  do  in  ae  sath  of \nwz \nthese week ly  sessions  with  the  Adjustment  Committee. \n13 \n   He  finds  the  requirement  concerning  the  linktation™ \n \n  \non  beards  and  mustaches  sinha be Cas  and \n15-  \nparticularly  as  applied  to  him.

The  mustache  and  beard  worn  by  the \nPlaintiff  has  been  described  as  a  goatee,  which  I \n24 \npersonally  don't  think  adequately  describes  it,  It \nis  a  beard  of  unusual  contour,  running  from  the  tips \n  U.d .
