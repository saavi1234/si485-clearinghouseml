    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expanded the types of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. In the fall of 2019, district court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule. But after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The District Court in this case issued a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the public charge rule and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction. On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule and the petitions for certiorari were voluntarily dismissed by the government. The Supreme Court initially decided to hear the appeal from a Ninth Circuit ruling about state intervenors, but later dismissed the case without ruling on it. The case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p><u>California, Maine, Oregon, Pennsylvania and D.C. Sue Over the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On August 16, 2019, the states of California, Maine, Oregon, and Pennsylvania along with the District of Columbia filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-17142/inadmissibility-on-public-charge- grounds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Final Rule</a> (the Rule) vacated due to violations of the APA and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a revised, final public charge rule, which defined personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increased the types of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is &ldquo;inadmissible.&rdquo; Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid, or is deemed likely to receive them in the future, could be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. According to a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/immigration-public-charge-injunction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">article</a>, the new standards would directly affect about 1.2 million applicants annually, primarily immigrants from Africa and Latin America. The rule was initially set to be implemented on October 15, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs claimed that the Rule was unlawful because it was enacted contrary to the meaning of statutory terms in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), the Rehabilitation Act, and the plaintiffs' statutory option to provide healthcare and nutrition benefits to the affected immigrants. The plaintiffs also asserted that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious because defendants \"relied on factors that Congress did not intend, failed to consider important aspects of the problem the agency is addressing, and has offered no explanation for the Rule that is consistent with the evidence that is before the agency.\" Finally, the plaintiffs contended that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it was \"motivated by improper discriminatory intent and bias against non-White immigrants\" and because defendants \"adopted it to harm a politically unpopular group and advance unconstitutional animus.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs further contended that the Rule would cause plaintiffs to lose federal funds as immigrants disenroll from affected programs. They also asserted that the Rule, by causing confusion and fear in immigrant communities, would impose significant administrative costs and disrupt health and social services systems. Lastly, the plaintiffs proclaimed that the negative health outcomes that would result from the Rule would ultimately be paid for by the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Plaintiffs Seek a Nationwide Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>On August 26, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking a nationwide injunction, or, alternatively, an injunction limited to the five plaintiff states and the District of Columbia, enjoining the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule. The plaintiffs argued that a preliminary injunction was appropriate because of their likely success on the merits and that absent an injunction, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm. The plaintiffs also asserted that a nationwide injunction was necessary, as a \"five-state injunction would compound confusion (and concomitant harms) for any immigrant who moves back and forth between Plaintiff States and other jurisdictions.\"</p>\r\n<p>The court issued an order on August 27, 2019, relating the current case with <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</a></em>, another case challenging the validity of the Rule under the APA. The case was reassigned to District Court Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton.</p>\r\n<p>In their opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction filed on September 13, 2019, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs had \"no basis for turning their abstract policy disagreement with the Executive Branch into a nationwide injunction.\" The defendants asserted that, in speculating that the Rule would result in economic harms, the plaintiffs had not met their burden in establishing standing. Furthermore, the defendants contended that the Rule was not unlawful, as it \"reflect[ed] Congress&rsquo;s delegation of broad authority to the Executive Branch concerning the meaning of 'public charge'\" and was \"the product of a well-reasoned process that considered the plain text of the statute, legislative intent, statistical evidence, and the substance of hundreds of thousands of comments submitted by the public.\"</p>\r\n<p><u>The District Court Grants a Preliminary Injunction</u></p>\r\n<p>Following a hearing on October 2, 2019, on October 11, 2019, Judge Hamilton issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. Judge Hamilton concluded that a preliminary injunction was appropriate because the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits and would be irreparably harmed absent an injunction. However, Judge Hamilton did not grant the plaintiffs' request to enjoin the implementation of the Rule nationwide. Because the plaintiffs did not establish \"the necessity of such relief,\" the scope of the injunction was limited to California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. 408 F.Supp.3d 1057.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion for stay of injunction pending appeal to the Ninth Circuit on October 25, 2019. Defendants argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal because the plaintiffs lacked standing and did not fall within the zone of interests of the relevant statute. Defendants also contended that, because they would be \"forced to grant lawful permanent residence (&ldquo;LPR&rdquo;) status to aliens likely to become public charges at any time under the Rule,\" they would suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay as their interest in \"ensuring that 'aliens be self-reliant'\" would be affected.</p>\r\n<p>On October 30, 2019, the defendants filed an appeal of the order for preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit. The appeal was docketed the next day (Docket No. 19-17214).</p>\r\n<p>In the Ninth Circuit, on November 15, 2019, the defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal. The defendants' arguments before the Ninth Circuit mirrored the arguments they put forth in their motion to stay in the district court.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Ninth Circuit Stays the Preliminary Injunction </u></p>\r\n<p>On December 5, 2019, a Ninth Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Jay Bybee, Sandra Ikuta, and John Owens) issued an order and opinion granting the defendants' emergency motion to stay the district court's injunction. 944 F.3d 773. The panel also granted a stay of a nationwide injunction enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule that was issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of Washington v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a>). The panel first concluded that the plaintiffs had standing and that the motion was not moot, despite nationwide injunctions put in place by district courts in Maryland and New York. Next, the panel found that the defendants demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the Rule's definition of public charge was consistent with the relevant statutes and not arbitrary or capricious. Finally, the panel determined that the defendants had adequately explained the reasons for the Rule, that they would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay, and that, despite potential harms to the plaintiffs, these factors weighed in favor of granting a stay.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Bybee concurred, and wrote a separate opinion to note that \"no one should mistake the court&rsquo;s judgments for its policy preferences\" and that it was time for Congress to weigh in on recent immigration debates instead of leaving them for the courts to decide.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Owens concurred with the majority's jurisdiction analysis but would have denied the defendants' motions to stay, in light of: \"(1) government&rsquo;s heavy burden due to the standard of review, (2) opaqueness of the legal questions before the court, (3) lack of irreparable harm to the government at this early stage, (4) likelihood of substantial injury to the plaintiffs, and (5) equities involved.\"</p>\r\n<p>In light of the Ninth Circuit's order, Judge Hamilton terminated the defendants' district court motion to stay the injunction on December 6, 2019.</p>\r\n<p>On December 19, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the Ninth Circuit's order granting stay of the preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Supreme Court Stays All Nationwide Injunctions Enjoining Implementation of the Public Charge Rule</u></p>\r\n<p>On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court, in <em>State of New York</em>, issued a stay on all nationwide injunctions enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. 140 S.Ct. 599. Following this decision, the defendants indicated that the Rule would be implemented and enforced starting February 24, 2020.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Plaintiffs Seek the Administrative Record</u></p>\r\n<p>Two days later the plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court seeking to compel the defendants to complete the administrative record (AR) and requesting leave to take discovery in support of their Equal Protection claims. The plaintiffs alleged that the AR provided by the defendants was inadequate, lacking key documents \"critical to the Court&rsquo;s evaluation of how the Rule departs from prior policy and practice.\"</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2020, the Ninth Circuit panel voted to deny the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Judge Bybee and Judge Ikuta voted to deny the motion and Judge Owens voted to grant the motion.</p>\r\n<p>On April 1, 2020, Judge Hamilton granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion to complete the AR and compel discovery on their equal protection claim. Judge Hamilton concluded that plaintiffs had rebutted the presumption of a complete AR and were thus entitled to documents concerning \"inter-agency communications providing comments to DHS\" about the Rule. Moreover, Judge Hamilton found that plaintiffs' constitutional claim existed outside of their APA claim, and thus discovery on the claim was appropriate. 2020 WL 1557424.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><u>District Court Grants in Part, Denies in Part Motion to Dismiss</u></p>\r\n<p>On April 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a plausible claim. Defendants asserted that the complaint should be dismissed in light of the Ninth Circuit's ruling that \"the Rule falls well within the Executive Branch&rsquo;s discretion to interpret and implement the public charge inadmissibility provision in the INA and is not arbitrary or capricious,\" because the plaintiffs lacked standing, and because the complaint included \"no well-pled allegation that DHS issued the Rule based on any improper discriminatory motive.\"</p>\r\n<p>On August 3, 2020 the district court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss. Judge Hamilton held that the plaintiffs had standing, but granted dismissal of the claims relating to the Rehabilitation Act, state healthcare discretion, and Fifth Amendment Equal Protection. The first and fourth claims of the complaint, relating to violation of the INA and allegations of being arbitrary and capricious, were deferred pending the ruling on the preliminary injunction in the Ninth Circuit. 476 F. Supp. 3d 994.</p>\r\n<p><u>Ninth Circuit Affirms the Preliminary Injunction, But the Order is Stayed</u></p>\r\n<p>On September 15, 2020, the Ninth Circuit heard arguments for the district court's stayed preliminary injunction with a new panel of judges (Circuit Judges Mary Schroeder, William Fletcher, and Lawrence VanDyke). On December 2, 2020, citing recent other circuit court decisions, it issued an order and a 2-1 opinion affirming the injunction, but vacated the nationwide application of the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>State of Washington v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a> injunction. 981 F.3d 742. Writing for the majority, Judge Schroeder first concluded that the plaintiffs had standing because they were suffering financial harm from immigrants shifting to state and local aid. Next, she found that the plaintiffs demonstrated a high likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the Rule's definition of public charge was inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of the statute and was arbitrary and capricious. She also found that the remaining preliminary injunction factors favored the plaintiffs. Finally, she determined that the nationwide injunction was not appropriate because identical injunctions had been and were still being litigated in other federal district and circuit courts.</p>\r\n<p>Judge VanDyke dissented from the majority's analysis for the same reasons as the December 5, 2019 decision, citing the Supreme Court's stays from January, a dissenting opinion from a similar ruling in the Seventh Circuit (962 F.3d 208), and a contrary ruling from the Fourth Circuit (971 F.3d 220).</p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2020, DHS requested a stay of the Ninth Circuit's affirming order pending the Supreme Court's disposition on petitions for review from the Second and Seventh Circuits. Since the other parties did not dispute it, Judge Hamilton granted the request on December 17, as did the Ninth Circuit panel on January 20, 2021. The new public charge rule was to remain in effect until the Supreme Court ruled on the petitions.</p>\r\n<p><u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u></p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule.</p>\r\n<p>On March 9, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>. The government voluntarily dismissed its appeal to the Seventh Circuit, lifting the stay of the Northern District of Illinois' November 2, 2020 decision vacating the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Cook County v. Wolf</em></a>). That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition for <em>Cook County</em>, as well as similar petitions for the Ninth (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>City and County of San Francisco v. USCIS</em></a>) and Second (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>New York v. DHS</em></a>) Circuits.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Ninth Circuit. They filed similar motions in the Seventh and Fourth Circuits, and a day later on March 11, they filed an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <em>Cook County</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 2021 the Ninth Circuit ruled 2-1 to deny the motion to intervene without an opinion. However, Judge Vandyke wrote a lengthy dissent, arguing that the Biden administration was now colluding with the plaintiffs in the Public Charge lawsuits, making their interests at odds with the interests of the states who were seeking to intervene. He explained that this case was clearly still worth pursuing, since it had sufficient merit to warrant Supreme Court review and the government was circumventing APA requirements. Moreover, he noted that even though the Rule had been vacated, there was still a chance the Supreme Court could reverse that decision, making this lawsuit not yet moot. 2021 WL 1310846.</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2021, Judge Hamilton stayed the cases.</p>\r\n<p>Later that year, on October 29, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the cases, but only in terms of whether the states should be able to intervene. On June 15 of the following year, however, the Supreme Court dismissed the case as &ldquo;improvidently granted,&rdquo; which is considered an unusual procedural move because it indicated that the court concluded it was wrong to have taken up the dispute in the first place. In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts explained that the Supreme Court should not hear the case because the intervention issue the court had decided to review had been complicated by various other issues in the case that the court was not reviewing, such as standing, mootness, and nationwide injunctions under the APA. 596 U.S. 763.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, on January 30, 2023, California voluntarily dismissed the case and it was terminated. The case is now closed.</p>",

The plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security's Final Public Charge Rule (the Rule), which added non-cash benefits to the factors considered in determining whether a person applying for legal permanent residence is likely to become a public charge. The plaintiffs alleged that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In October 2019 the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. After the government appealed the district court's order for preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit, a Ninth Circuit panel issued an order staying the injunction pending appeal. In August 2020, the District Court dismissed four of the six claims in the complaint, but deferred ruling on whether the Rule violated the INA or was arbitrary and capricious until the preliminary injunction was ruled on. The preliminary injunction was subsequently affirmed in December 2020. However, the order was stayed a few weeks later, leaving the stay of the preliminary injunction in effect. The Rule was abandoned by DHS on March 9, 2021 and vacated nationwide. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in October 2021, but dismissed the case the following year without ruling. The case is now closed.",

Owens, Circuit Judges.\nOrder;\nConcurrence by Judge Bybee;\nPartial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Owens\nSUMMARY*\nImmigration\nThe  panel  granted  the  Department  of  Homeland\nSecurity’s petitions for stays of two district court preliminary\ninjunctions against the implementation of the Department of\nHomeland  Security’s  redefinition  of  the  term,  “public\ncharge.”\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), any\nalien who, in the opinion of a relevant immigration officer, at\nthe time of application for admission or adjustment of status,\nis  likely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge,  is\ninadmissible.  In 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization\nService defined “public charge” as an “alien . . . who is likely\nto become . . . primarily dependent on the government for\nsubsistence” as demonstrated by either “institutionalization\nfor long-term care at government expense” or “receipt of\npublic cash assistance.”  In August 2019, the Department of\nHomeland Security (“DHS”) adopted a new rule, redefining\nthe term “public charge” to also require consideration of\n* This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.  It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 5 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 5\ncertain non-cash benefits.  Inadmissibility on Public Charge\nGrounds,  84  Fed.  Reg.  41,292  (Aug.  14,  2019)  (“Final\nRule”).\nVarious states, municipalities and organizations brought\nsuits in California and Washington seeking a preliminary\ninjunction against the Final Rule’s implementation.  The\nCalifornia and Washington district courts issued preliminary\ninjunctions  based  on  plaintiffs’  claims  under  the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  DHS then sought\nstays of both preliminary injunctions before this court.\nThe panel first concluded that the injuries plaintiffs (“the\nStates”)  alleged  –  loss  of  federal funds  and  increase in\noperational costs related to individuals disenrolling from\nbenefits – were sufficient for Article III standing.  The panel\nalso addressed mootness because district courts in Maryland\nand New York had issued nationwide injunctions of the Final\nRule.  The court concluded that, even if an injunction from\nanother  court  has  a  fully  nationwide  scope,  this  court\nnevertheless  retains  jurisdiction  under  the  exception  to\nmootness for cases capable of repetition, yet evading review.\nThe panel next concluded that DHS had demonstrated a\nstrong likelihood of success on the merits, explaining that the\nRule’s definition of “public charge” is consistent with the\nrelevant statutes, and DHS’s action was not arbitrary or\ncapricious.  In rejecting the States’ argument that the Final\nRule is contrary to the INA, the panel concluded that the new\ndefinition of “public charge” was entitled to deference under\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n837 (1984).  At Chevron step one, the panel explained that\nthe statute is ambiguous, noting that Congress chose not to\ndefine “public charge” and, instead, described various factors\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 6 of 76\n6 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nto be considered “at a minimum.”  The panel also concluded\nthat the history of the use of the term demonstrated that the\nterm does not have an unambiguous meaning.  Addressing the\nfact that Congress twice considered, but failed to enact, a\ndefinition of “public charge” that is similar to the definition\nadopted in the Final Rule, the panel explained that the failure\nof Congress to compel DHS to adopt a particular rule is not\nthe logical equivalent of forbidding DHS from adopting that\nrule.  The panel also rejected the States’ contention that DHS\nexceeded its authority by determining what makes a person\n“self-sufficient.”\nAt Chevron step two, the panel concluded that DHS’s\ninterpretation of “public charge” is a permissible construction\nof  the  statute,  explaining  that:  1)  the  INA  grants  DHS\nconsiderable discretion to determine if an alien is likely to\nbecome a public charge; 2) there is no statutory basis from\nwhich to conclude that addition of certain categories of in-\nkind benefits makes DHS’s interpretation untenable; and\n3) the receipt of non-cash public assistance is relevant to the\nself-sufficiency principle underlying U.S. immigration law. \nThe panel also rejected the States’ argument that the Final\nRule  is  inconsistent  with  the  Rehabilitation  Act,  which\nprovides that a qualified individual with a disability cannot,\nsolely  by  reason  of  that  disability,  be  excluded  from\nparticipation in Executive agency programs.\nIn rejecting the States’ argument that the Final Rule is\narbitrary and capricious, the panel concluded that DHS had\nadequately explained the reasons for the rule because it was\nsufficient for DHS to consider whether, in the long term, the\noverall benefits of its policy change would outweigh the costs\nof retaining the current policy and because DHS addressed\npublic health concerns.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 7 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 7\nThe panel noted that, were it reviewing the preliminary\ninjunctions  on  direct  review,  its  determination  on  the\nlikelihood of success on the merits would be sufficient to\nreverse the district court’s orders.  But because the panel was\naddressing DHS’s motion for a stay, it went on to consider\nthe additional factors of irreparable injury, balance of the\nequities  and  the  public  interest.    Addressing  irreparable\ninjury, the panel concluded that DHS had shown that it would\nbe  irreparably  injured  absent  a  stay,  explaining  that  the\npreliminary injunctions would force DHS to irrevocably grant\nstatus to those who are not legally entitled to it.\nNext, the panel explained that balancing the harms was\nparticularly difficult in this case because the harms are not\ncomparable and are also, to a degree, speculative.  The panel\nconcluded that it could not state with any confidence which\nset of harms was greater.  The panel explained that the public\ninterest in this case was likewise difficult to calculate with\nprecision.  In the end, the panel concluded that the “critical”\nfactors were that DHS had mustered a strong showing of\nlikelihood of success on the merits and some irreparable\nharm, and that those factors weighed in favor of granting a\nstay, despite the potential harms to the States.  For that\nreason, the panel concluded that the stay was in the public\ninterest.\nConcurring, perplexed and perturbed, Judge Bybee wrote\nseparately to note that: 1) even as the courts are embroiled in\nrecent immigration controversies, no one should mistake the\ncourt’s judgments for its policy preferences; 2) given the fact\nthat  the  courts  may  only  review  policy  decisions  for\narbitrariness and caprice, the courts are not the proper foil to\nthis or any other administration as it crafts immigration\npolicies; and 3) because Congress is no place to be found in\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 8 of 76\n8 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nrecent immigration debates, it is time for a feckless Congress\nto come to the table and grapple with these issues, instead of\nleaving the table and expecting the court to clean up.\nConcurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge Owens\nconcurred  with  the  majority’s  jurisdiction  analysis,  but\notherwise dissented.  In light of the: (1) government’s heavy\nburden due to the standard of review, 2) opaqueness of the\nlegal questions before the court, (3) lack of irreparable harm\nto  the  government  at  this  early  stage,  (4)  likelihood  of\nsubstantial injury to the plaintiffs, and (5) equities involved,\nJudge Owens would deny the government’s motions to stay\nand let these cases proceed in the ordinary course.\nCOUNSEL\nJoseph  H.

Although the precise formulation of this provision\nhas been amended regularly in the succeeding century and a\nquarter, the basic prohibition and the phrase “public charge”\nremains.  Most recently, in the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996  (IIRIRA),\nCongress  amended  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 13 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 13\n(INA) to provide that “[a]ny alien who, in the opinion of the\nconsular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the\nopinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for\nadmission or adjustment of status, is likely at any time to\nbecome  a  public  charge  is  inadmissible.”    8  U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  In making this determination, “the consular\nofficer or the Attorney General shall at a minimum” take five\nfactors  into  account:  age;  health;  family  status;  assets,\nresources, and financial status; and education and skills.  Id.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Under long-standing practice, consular\nofficers and the Attorney General consider these factors under\na “totality of the circumstances” test.\nIn  1999,  the  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service\n(INS),  providing  guidance  to  the  public  and  INS  field\nofficers, defined “public charge” as an “alien . . . who is\nlikely to become . . . primarily dependent on the government\nfor  subsistence”  as  demonstrated  by  either\n“institutionalization  for  long-term  care  at  government\nexpense” or “receipt of public cash assistance for income\nmaintenance.”    Field  Guidance  on  Deportability  and\nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg.\n28,689,  28,689  (May  26,  1999)  (1999  Field  Guidance)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Although INS determined\nthat the receipt of cash benefits received under a public\nprogram would be considered a factor in determining whether\nan alien was likely to become a public charge, it stated that\nnon-cash benefits would not be taken into account for public-\ncharge purposes.  Id.\nIn  August  2019,  following  notice  and  comment,  the\nDepartment  of  Homeland  Security  adopted  a  new  rule,\nredefining the term “public charge” to require a consideration\nof not only cash benefits, but also certain non-cash benefits. \n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 14 of 76\n14 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg.\n41,292, 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (Final Rule).  Under DHS’s\nFinal Rule a public charge is “an alien who receives one or\nmore public benefits . . .  for more than 12 months in the\naggregate within any 36-month period.”  Id. at 41,501.  In\nturn, DHS defined “public benefits.”  Consistent with the\n1999 Field Guidance, DHS still considers receipt of cash\nassistance  from  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI);\nTemporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF);  and\nfederal, state, or local general assistance programs to be\npublic benefits.  To that list, DHS added non-cash assistance\nreceived  through  the  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance\nProgram (SNAP), Section 8 housing assistance, Section 8\nproject-based  rental  assistance,  Medicaid  (with  certain\nexceptions), and Section 9 public housing.  Id.  DHS’s rule\nexempts public benefits received for emergency medical\nconditions,  benefits  received  under  the  Individuals  with\nDisabilities  Education Act, and school-based services or\nbenefits.  Id.  It also exempts those benefits received by aliens\nunder  21  years  of  age,  women  during  pregnancy,  and\nmembers of the armed forces and their families.  Id.  DHS\nrepeated that “[t]he determination of an alien’s likelihood of\nbecoming a public charge at any time in the future must be\nbased on the totality of the alien’s circumstances.”  Id.\nat 41,502.\nPrior to the Final Rule taking effect in October 2019,\nvarious states, municipalities, and organizations brought suits\nin  California  and  Washington  seeking  a  preliminary\ninjunction against the implementation of the rule.  In Nos.\n19-17213  and  19-17214,  California,  Maine,  Oregon,\nPennsylvania, and the District of Columbia; the City and\nCounty of San Francisco and the County of Santa Clara; and\nvarious organizations brought suit in the Northern District of\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 15 of 76\nCITY & CTY.

Nevertheless,  for  the  reasons  explained\nbelow, we will grant the stay.  DHS has shown a strong\nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  merits,  that  it  will  suffer\nirreparable harm, and that the balance of the equities and\npublic interest favor a stay.  See Nken v.

Statutory Framework\nThe INA requires all aliens who seek lawful admission to\nthe United States, or those already present but seeking to\nbecome lawful permanent residents (LPRs), to prove that they\nare  “not  inadmissible.”    8  U.S.C.  §  1361;  see  also  id.\n§§ 1225(a), 1255(a).  Section 212 of the INA lists the grounds\non  which  an  alien  may  be  adjudged  inadmissible.    Id.\n§ 1182(a)(1)–(10).  One of the grounds for inadmissibility is\na determination that the alien is likely to become a “public\ncharge.”  Id. § 1182(a)(4).  Section 212(a)(4) of the INA\nreads as follows:\n(4) PUBLIC CHARGE. —\n(A) IN GENERAL.—Any alien who, in the\nopinion of the consular officer at the time of\napplication for a visa, or in the opinion of the\nAttorney General at the time of application for\nadmission or adjustment of status, is likely at\nany  time  to  become  a  public  charge  is\ninadmissible.\n(B)  FACTORS  TO  BE  TAKEN  INTO\nACCOUNT.—\n(i)  In  determining  whether  an  alien  is\ninadmissible  under  this  paragraph,  the\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 17 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 17\nconsular officer or the Attorney General[2]\nshall at a minimum consider the alien’s—\n(I) age;\n(II) health;\n(III) family status;\n(IV) assets, resources, and financial\nstatus; and\n(V) education and skills.\n(ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i),\nthe consular officer or the Attorney General\nmay also consider any affidavit of support[3]\nunder section 1183a of this title for purposes\nof exclusion under this paragraph.\nId.\n2 The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred much of the\nAttorney General’s immigration authority to the newly created office of\nthe Secretary of Homeland Security.  See In re D-J-,  23 I. & N. Dec. 572,\n573–74 & n.2 (Op. Att’y Gen. 2003) (citing Homeland Security Act of\n2002, Pub. L. No. 108-7, 117 Stat. 531 (2003)).  Though the Attorney\nGeneral retains authority over the Executive Office for Immigration\nReview, id. n.3, the Secretary of Homeland Security is now responsible\nwith the general administration and enforcement of immigration law, id.\nn.2.\n3 An affidavit of support is a binding pledge, often made by an\nemployer or family member of the alien, to financially support the alien\nat 125 percent of the Federal poverty line.  8 U.S.C. § 1183.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 18 of 76\n18 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nThis provision is applied at different times by different\ngovernment agencies.  When an alien seeks a visa to travel to\nthe United States, a Department of State (DOS) consular\nofficer  must  make  an  admissibility  determination.    See\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 n.3.  When an alien arrives at a port of\nentry without a visa, DHS makes that determination.  Id.  An\nalien may also be deemed “inadmissible” even when the alien\nis already in the country.  For example, when an alien seeks\nan adjustment of status from non-immigrant to LPR, DHS\nmust determine that the alien is not inadmissible.  See id. \nAnd when an alien is processed in immigration court, the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) through immigration judges and\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) must determine\nwhether that alien is inadmissible.  Id.\nThough  §  212  of  the  INA  lays  out  the  factors  an\nimmigration official must consider “at a minimum” when\nmaking a public-charge determination, the INA does not\ndefine the term “public charge,” or restrict how officials are\nto consider age, health, family status, financial resources, and\neducation.  Indeed, as explained in more detail below, in the\ncontext of immigration law, the term “public charge” has had\nseveral meanings.  Since 1999, however, the term has been\ndefined according to guidelines issued by the INS Field\nGuidance on the matter.  See 1999 Field Guidance, 64 Fed.\nReg. at 28,689.  The 1999 Field Guidance defined a public\ncharge  as  an  alien  who  “is  likely  to  become  (for\nadmission/adjustment purposes) primarily dependent on the\ngovernment for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the\nreceipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or\n(ii) institutionalization for  long-term care at government\nexpense.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The 1999\nField Guidance did not permit immigration officers to “place\nany weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits,” id.,\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 19 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 19\nand allowed consideration of only cash-benefit programs like\nSSI, TANF, and “[s]tate and local cash assistance programs\nthat provide benefits for income maintenance,” id. at 28,692.\nB. The Proposed Rule\nOn  October  10,  2018,  DHS  published  a  Notice  of\nProposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM)  indicating  its  intent  to\nabandon the 1999 Field Guidance and redefine the term\n“public  charge.”    See  Inadmissibility  on  Public  Charge\nGrounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (proposed Oct. 10, 2018).4  It\ndid so acting under the authority vested in the Secretary of\nHomeland Security to establish immigration regulations and\nenforce immigration law.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3) (“[The\nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security]  shall  establish  such\nregulations . . . as he deems necessary for carrying out his\nauthority  under  the  provisions  of  this  chapter.”).    The\nproposed rule redefined the term “public charge” in two\nways.\nFirst, the proposed rule for the first time established a\nrequired length of time for which the alien would have to rely\non public benefits before being labeled a public charge.\nUnder the 1999 Field Guidance, a public charge was defined\nas  an  individual  “primarily  dependent”  on  government\nbenefits, but the 1999 Field Guidance prescribed no specific\ntime period for which this determination should be made.  See\n4 The proposed rule would not change the definition of public charge\nfor  removability  determinations,  only  for  determinations  of\ninadmissibility.  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,134.  And though the rule only applies\nto DHS, DHS is currently working with DOS and DOJ to ensure that all\nthree  agencies  apply  a  consistent  definition  of  the  term  in  their\nadmissibility inquiries.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 n.3.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 20 of 76\n20 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\n64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689, 28,692.  Under the new rule, an alien\nwould be considered a public charge if he or she “receives\none or more [designated] public benefits . . . for more than\n12 months in the aggregate within a 36-month period.”  83\nFed. Reg. at 51,157–58.  Moreover, the proposed rule counts\neach public benefit received, so that “receipt of two different\nnon-monetizable  benefits  in  one  month  counts  as  two\nmonths.”  Id. at 51,166.\nSecond,  the  proposed  rule  expanded  which  benefits\ncontributed to a public-charge determination.  The proposed\nrule still included those cash-benefit programs that were\nlisted in the 1999 Field Guidance, but now also includes\nvarious in-kind programs, such as:\n(A)  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance\nProgram  (SNAP,  formerly  called  ‘‘Food\nStamps’’), 7 U.S.C. 2011 to 2036c;\n(B) Section 8 Housing Assistance under the\nHousing  Choice  Voucher  Program,  as\nadministered by HUD under 24 CFR part 984;\n42 U.S.C. 1437f and 1437u;\n(C) Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance\n(including  Moderate  Rehabilitation)  under\n24 CFR parts 5, 402, 880 through 884 and\n886; and\n. . .\n(i) Medicaid, 42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., [with\nseveral exceptions, discussed below]\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 21 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 21\n. . .\n(iv)  Subsidized  Housing  under  the\nHousing Act of 1937, 42  U.S.C. 1437 et\nseq.\nId. at 51,290 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21).5\nAdditionally, the proposed rule added other factors for\nimmigration officers to consider when making a public-\ncharge determination.  The rule still required consideration of\nthe  alien’s  age,  health,  family  status,  financial  status,\neducation, and skills, as well as any affidavits of support the\nalien presents.  See 83 Fed Reg. 51,178 (to be codified at\n8 C.F.R. § 212.22).  But the proposed rule also laid out new\nfactors to be afforded extra weight.  Four factors weigh\nheavily against the alien in a public-charge determination:\n(1) a finding that the alien “is not a full-time student and is\nauthorized  to  work,”  but  cannot  demonstrate  “current\nemployment, employment history, or [a] reasonable prospect\nof  future  employment”;    (2)  a  previous  finding  of\ninadmissibility  on  public-charge  grounds;  (3)  a  medical\n5 DHS altered the Final Rule to make clear that certain benefits were\nexempt from consideration, including “Medicaid [collected] by aliens\nunder the age of 21[, Medicaid collected by] pregnant women during\npregnancy and during the 60-day period after pregnancy,” school-based\nservices, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) services,\nMedicare Part D Low-Income Subsidies, and emergency medical care. \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,296–97 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21).  Further, in\ncertain circumstances, the proposed rule excuses receipt of covered public\nbenefits.  See id. (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.21) (exempting public\nbenefits from consideration when the recipient has received certain\nhumanitarian relief, the recipient or his spouse was in the Armed Forces,\nor the recipient received a waiver).\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 22 of 76\n22 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\ndiagnosis  that  would  likely  require  extensive  medical\ntreatment or interfere with the alien’s ability to be self-\nsufficient; and (4) receipt of benefits for more than twelve\nmonths within a thirty-six month period.  Id. at 51,198–201\n(to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22).  Conversely, two factors\nwould weigh heavily in favor of the alien in a public-charge\ndetermination:  (1)  assets  or  household  income  over\n250 percent of the Federal poverty line, and (2) individual\nincome over 250 percent of the Federal poverty line.6  Id.\nat 51,292 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(c)(2)).\nDuring the sixty-day public comment period that followed\nthe NPRM, DHS collected 266,077 comments, “the vast\nmajority of which opposed the rule.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,297. \nOn August 14, 2019, DHS published the Final Rule in the\nFederal Register.  Id. at 41,292.  In its 216-page Final Rule,\nDHS made some changes to the proposed rule (which are not\nrelevant here) and addressed the comments it received.  The\nFinal Rule was scheduled to take effect on October 15, 2019,\nand  would  apply  to  anyone  applying  for  admission  or\nadjustment of status after that date.  Id.\nC. The Proceedings\n1. The Northern District of California Case\nOn  August  13,  2019,  the  City  and  County  of  San\nFrancisco  and  the  County  of  Santa  Clara  sued  several\ngovernment agencies and officials, including U.S. Citizenship\nand Immigration Services (USCIS), the Acting Director of\nUSCIS Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, DHS, and the then Acting\n6 The Final Rule added a third factor: private health insurance not\nsubsidized under the Affordable Care Act.  84 Fed.

They brought suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, claiming that the proposed rule violated the APA\non two grounds: (1) the rule was not made in accordance with\nthe law, and (2) the rule was arbitrary, capricious, and an\nabuse of discretion.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Three days later,\non  August  16,  2019,  California,  Maine,  Oregon,\nPennsylvania, and the District of Columbia, sued the same\ndefendants in the same court.  They claimed that (1) the\nproposed rule violated § 706 of the APA because (a) it was\nnot  made  in  accordance with  the  INA,  the  IIRIRA,  the\nRehabilitation Act, or state healthcare discretion, (b) it was\narbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and (2) the\nproposed rule violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause because it denied equal protection based on race and\nunconstitutional animus.\nEach set of plaintiffs filed a motion to preliminarily\nenjoin enforcement of the proposed rule.  On August 27,\n2019, the district court ordered the two cases consolidated.7\nThe district court heard oral argument on October 2,\n2019, and on October 11, granted the preliminary injunction. \nSee City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718 at *1,\n53.  The court first held that both the Counties and the States\nhad standing to sue because they showed imminent financial\ninjury.  Id. at *46–47.  It held that they were in the statute’s\nzone  of  interests  because,  in  enacting  the  public-charge\n7 Several legal and health-care organizations were also parties to the\nmotion for a preliminary injunction below.  The district court found that\nthey failed to establish that they were within the zone of interests.  City &\nCty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *53.  They are not parties to\nthis appeal.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 24 of 76\n24 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nprovision of the INA, “Congress intended to protect states\nand their political subdivisions’ coffers.”  Id. at *41.  On the\nmerits, the district court found that the States satisfied the\nfour-factor test for a preliminary injunction.  See Winter v.\nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The court\nheld that the States had a likelihood of success on the merits\nfor at least some of their claims.  It found the States were\nlikely  to  successfully  show  that  the  proposed  rule  was\ncontrary to law because it unreasonably defined the term\n“public  charge,”  and  thus  failed  the  second  step  of  the\nChevron analysis.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL\n5100718, at *28.  Alternatively, the court found that the\nStates had shown a serious question as to whether the INA\nunambiguously  foreclosed  the  proposed  change  to  the\ndefinition of public charge, thus causing the Final Rule to fail\nat Chevron step one.  Id.  The court also concluded that the\nStates  had  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the\narbitrary-and-capricious  claim  because  DHS  failed  to\nadequately consider the adverse economic and public health-\nrelated costs of the proposed rule.  Id. at *34, *37.\nFurther, the court found that the rule’s implementation\nwould irreparably harm the Counties and States by causing\nthem to lose millions of dollars in federal reimbursements and\nface increased operational costs.  Id. at *46–49.  Focusing on\nthe public’s interest in the continued provision of medical\nservices and the prevention of communicable diseases, the\ndistrict court found both the balance of the equities and the\npublic interest weighed in favor of granting an injunction.  Id.\nat *50–51.  However, because the court found that the States\nhad failed to show why a nationwide injunction would be\nnecessary, the court granted an injunction that applied only to\nthose persons living in plaintiff states or counties.  Id. at *53.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 25 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 25\nOn  October  25,  2019,  DHS  sought  a  stay  of  the\npreliminary injunction.  DHS informed the court that it would\nseek appellate relief if the court did not act by November 14.\n2.  The Eastern District of Washington Case\nOn August 14, 2019, Washington, Virginia, Colorado,\nDelaware,  Hawai‘i,  Illinois,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and the state\nattorney  general  on  behalf  of  Michigan  sued  USCIS,\nCuccinelli, DHS, and McAleenan in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Washington.  They alleged\nclaims similar to those presented in the California cases: \n(1) the proposed rule violated the APA because (a) it was not\nin accordance with immigration law or the Rehabilitation Act,\n(b) it exceeded DHS’s statutory jurisdiction or authority, and\n(c) it was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion,\nand (2) the proposed rule violated the Fifth Amendment’s\nDue Process Clause because it denied equal protection based\non race and unconstitutional animus.\nThe district court heard oral argument on October 3,\n2019, and on October 11, granted the preliminary injunction. \nSee Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *23.  The court’s\nconclusions largely mirrored those of the Northern District of\nCalifornia, though there were some differences.  Citing the\nStates’ anticipated economic, administrative,  and public-\nhealth costs, the court held that the States had standing and\nthat the matter was ripe.  Id. at *11.  Finding that the INA was\nenacted “to protect states from having to spend state money\nto  provide  for  immigrants  who  could  not  provide  for\nthemselves,” the court concluded that the States were within\nthe INA’s zone of interests.

USCIS\n On the merits, the court held that the States had shown a\nlikelihood  of  success  on  the  arbitrary-and-capriciousness\nclaim and the Chevron claim, though the Washington court\nwas less clear than the California court had been about at\nwhich step of the Chevron analysis the proposed rule would\nfail.    Id.  at  *13–17.    Unlike  the  California  court,  the\nWashington court also found that the States were likely to\nsucceed in proving that DHS had violated the Rehabilitation\nAct, and that DHS acted beyond its congressionally delegated\nauthority in defining self-sufficiency.  Id. at *17–18.  Noting\nthat “the Plaintiff States provide a strong basis for finding\nthat  disenrollment  from  non-cash  benefits  programs  is\npredictable, not speculative,” and that such disenrollment\nwould financially harm the States, the court found that the\nStates would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were\nnot issued.  Id. at *20–21.  On these same grounds, the court\nfound that the balance of the equities and public interest both\n“tip[ped] in favor” of granting a preliminary injunction.  Id.\nat *21.  However, unlike the California court, the Washington\ncourt found a geographically limited injunction untenable, in\npart because a limited injunction might give immigrants an\nincentive to move from unprotected states to protected states. \nAccordingly,  the  Washington  court  granted  the  States  a\nnationwide injunction.  Id. at *22–23.\nOn  October  25,  2019,  DHS  sought  a  stay  of  the\npreliminary injunction.  DHS informed the court that it would\nseek appellate relief if the court did not act by November 14.\n *          *          *\nBy November 14, neither district court responded to the\nrespective motions to stay.

USCIS 27\nfiled a motion in this court for an emergency stay of the\ninjunction.\nII. JURISDICTION\nDHS contends that the plaintiffs do not have Article III\nstanding to sue and that their claims do not fall within the\nzone  of  interests  protected  by  the  INA.    We  have  an\nobligation to ensure that jurisdiction exists before proceeding\nto the merits.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t,\n523 U.S. 83, 93–95 (1998).8  Additionally, although no party\nhas raised the issue, we must address whether DHS’s request\nfor a stay pending appeal is moot in light of the fact that two\ncourts  outside  our  circuit  have  also  issued  nationwide\ninjunctions, and any decision we issue here would not directly\naffect those orders.  We conclude that, at this preliminary\nstage of the proceedings, the States have sufficiently alleged\ngrounds for Article III standing and that DHS’s petition for a\nstay is not moot.\nA. Article III Standing\nArticle III of the Constitution limits the federal judicial\npower to the adjudication of “Cases” and “Controversies.” \nU.S. CONST. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  This fundamental limitation\n“is  founded  in  concern  about  the  proper—and  properly\nlimited—role  of  the  courts  in  a  democratic  society.” \n8 Both district courts also held that the States’ claims fall within the\nINA’s “zone of interests.”  See City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL\n5100718, at *41; Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *11.  For present\npurposes, because the issue is close and raises a prudential rather than\njurisdictional concern, see Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 137 S. Ct.\n1296, 1302 (2017), we will assume that the States’ claims satisfy the\nrequirement.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 28 of 76\n28 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V.

Ct.\n2392,  2416  (2018).    “[B]uilt  on  separation-of-powers\nprinciples,” standing ensures that litigants have “a personal\nstake in the outcome of the controversy as to justify the\nexercise of the court’s remedial powers on their behalf.” \nTown of Chester v.

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 29\nThe district courts concluded that the States had standing\nbased on their alleged loss of federal funds and increase in\noperational costs related to individuals disenrolling from the\nnon-cash public  benefits  at  issue.    DHS  challenges  this\nfinding, arguing that predictions of future financial harm are\nbased on an “‘attenuated chain of possibilities’ that does not\nshow ‘certainly impending’ injury.”9  DHS’s argument is\nunavailing for several reasons.\nFirst, the injuries alleged are not entirely speculative—at\nleast for standing purposes.  DHS acknowledges that one\nresult  of  the  Final  Rule  will  be  to  encourage  aliens  to\ndisenroll from public benefits.  It predicted a 2.5 percent\ndisenrollment rate when proposing the rule.  84 Fed. Reg.\nat 41,463.  This disenrollment, DHS predicted, would result\nin a reduction in Medicaid reimbursement payments to the\nStates of about $1.01 billion.  Id. at 41,301.  DHS also\nacknowledged  increased  administrative  costs  that  would\nresult from the Final Rule.  Id. at 41,389.  To be sure, the\npredicted result is premised on the actions of third parties, but\nthis type of “predictable effect of Government action on the\ndecisions of third parties” is sufficient to establish injury in\nfact.  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566\n(2019).\nMoreover, according to evidence supplied by the States,\nthe  predicted  results  have  already  started.    As  more\nindividuals disenroll from Medicaid, the States will no longer\nreceive reimbursements from the federal government for\ntreating them.  Similarly, the States have sufficiently alleged\nthat  they  are  facing  new  and  ongoing  operational  costs\n9 DHS raises no argument about the second and third elements of the\nstanding analysis.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 30 of 76\n30 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nresulting from the Final Rule.  See City & Cty. of San\nFrancisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *48.  These costs are\npredictable, likely, and imminent.  It is disingenuous for DHS\nto claim that they are too attenuated at this point when it\nacknowledged these costs in its own rulemaking process.\nFinally, DHS’s reliance on Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA,\n568 U.S. 398 (2013), is unfounded.  There, the Court found\nthat  various  human  rights,  labor,  legal,  and  media\norganizations  did  not  have  standing  to  challenge  the\nconstitutionality of a law authorizing governmental electronic\nsurveillance  of  communications  for  foreign  intelligence\npurposes.  Id. at 414.  The alleged injury was that the threat\nof surveillance would compel them to travel abroad to have\nin-person  conversations  with  sources  and  witnesses,  in\naddition to other costs related to protecting the confidentiality\nof sensitive communications.  Id. at 406–07.  The Court\nfound that the injury was not “certainly impending” because\nit was highly speculative whether the government would\nimminently target communications between the plaintiffs and\nforeign individuals.  Id. at 410–11.  The assumption that their\ncommunications  would  be  targeted  was  not  enough  to\ndemonstrate injury in fact.  Id. at 411–14.  Here, the States are\nnot making assumptions about their claimed injuries.  Unlike\nin Clapper, the States present evidence that the predicted\ndisenrollment and rising administrative costs are currently\nhappening.\nThus, based on the available evidence at this early stage\nof the proceedings, we conclude that the States have shown\nthat they have suffered and will suffer direct injuries traceable\nto the Final Rule and thus have standing to challenge its\nvalidity.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 31 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 31\nB. Mootness\nFinally, we raise on our own the question of whether we\ncan consider DHS’s request for a stay of the district court’s\npreliminary injunctions.  See Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d\n1020, 1025 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e have an independent duty\nto consider sua sponte whether a case is moot.”).  The stay\nwould, presumably, allow the Final Rule to go into effect\npending further proceedings in the district court and this\ncourt.    The  question  of  mootness  arises  because,\ncontemporaneous with the district courts’ orders here, district\ncourts in Maryland and New York also issued nationwide\ninjunctions.  Casa de Md., Inc. v. Trump, 2019 WL 5190689\n(D. Md. Oct. 14, 2019); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland\nSec., 2019 WL 5100372 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2019).10  Thus,\nunless a stay also issues in those cases, any stay we might\nissue would not allow the Final Rule to go into effect; the\nFinal Rule would still be barred by those injunctions.\nWe recently addressed this precise question in California\nv. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 941 F.3d\n410, 423 (9th Cir. 2019), and we concluded that even if an\ninjunction from another court “has a fully nationwide scope,\nwe nevertheless retain jurisdiction under the exception to\nmootness for cases capable of repetition, yet evading review.” \nSimilarly, we conclude that DHS’s petition is not moot, and\nwe proceed to the merits of its petition.\n10 In a third case out of the Northern District of Illinois, the district\ncourt issued an order enjoining enforcement of the Final Rule in Illinois\nonly.  Cook Cty. v. McAleenan, 2019 WL 5110267 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 14,\n2019).\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 32 of 76\n32 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nDHS requests that we stay the district courts’ preliminary\ninjunctions pending resolution of the consideration of the\nmerits of DHS’s appeals.  We have authority to do so under\nthe All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, which provides that the\ncourts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of\ntheir respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and\nprinciples of law.”  See Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC,\n316 U.S. 4, 9–10 (1942) (finding that a federal court may stay\njudgments  pending  appeal  “as  part  of  its  traditional\nequipment for the administration of justice”); In re McKenzie,\n180 U.S. 536, 551 (1901) (noting the “inherent power of the\nappellate court to stay . . . proceedings on appeal”); see also\nFed. R. Civ. P. 62(g).\nTwo standards affect our determination, the standard\napplicable to district courts for preliminary injunctions, and\nthe standard for appellate courts for stays pending appeal. \nThe district court must apply a four-factor standard:\nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction\nmust establish [1] that he is likely to succeed\non the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer\nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in\nhis favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the\npublic interest.\nWinter, 555 U.S. at 20.\nAlternatively, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and\na balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff\ncan support issuance of a preliminary injunction, so long as\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 33 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 33\nthe  plaintiff  also  shows  that  there  is  a  likelihood  of\nirreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public\ninterest.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127,\n1135 (9th Cir. 2011).\nGenerally, the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to\n“preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a\nfinal judgment issues in the cause.”  U.S. Philips Corp. v.\nKBC Bank N.V., 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing\nUniv. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981); Sierra\nOn-Line, Inc. v. Phoenix Software, Inc., 739 F.2d 1415, 1422\n(9th Cir. 1984)).  An injunction is “an extraordinary remedy\nthat may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the\nplaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  It\n“should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing,\ncarries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong,\n520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam) (citation omitted).\n The standard we apply to DHS’s request for a stay is\nsimilar, although the burden of proof is reversed.  “The party\nrequesting  a  stay  bears  the  burden  of  showing  that  the\ncircumstances justify an exercise of that discretion,” and our\nanalysis is guided by four factors:\n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a\nstrong showing that he is likely to succeed on\nthe merits; (2) whether the applicant will be\nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether\nissuance of the stay will substantially injure\nthe other parties interested in the proceeding;\nand (4) where the public interest lies.\nNken, 556 U.S. at 433–34 (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill,\n481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987)).  “The first two factors . . . are the\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 34 of 76\n34 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nmost  critical,”  and  the  “mere  possibility”  of  success  or\nirreparable injury is insufficient to satisfy them.  Id. at 434\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  At this stage of the\nproceedings, it is now DHS’s burden to make “a strong\nshowing that [it] is likely to” prevail against the States’\nclaims.  Lair v. Bullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1203 (9th Cir. 2012)\n(quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 426).  We consider the final two\nfactors “[o]nce an applicant satisfies the first two.”  Nken,\n556 U.S. at 435.\n“A stay is an ‘intrusion into the ordinary process of\nadministration and judicial review,’ and accordingly ‘is not\na matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise\nresult to the appellant.’”  Id. at 427 (citations omitted).  “It is\ninstead ‘an exercise of judicial discretion,’ and ‘the propriety\nof its  issue is  dependent upon the circumstances of the\nparticular case.’”  Id. at 433 (alteration omitted) (quoting\nVirginian Ry. Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 672–73\n(1926)).\nThere is significant overlap in these standards.  The first\nprong in both tests—likelihood of success on the merits—is\nthe same.  And the Supreme Court has made clear that\nsatisfaction  of  this  factor  is  the  irreducible  minimum\nrequirement  to  granting  any  equitable  and  extraordinary\nrelief.  Trump v. Hawai‘i, 138 S. Ct. at 2423.  The analysis\nends if the moving party fails to show a likelihood of success\non the merits of its claims.  Id.\nIV. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS\nAny “person suffering legal wrong . . . or adversely\naffected or aggrieved” by an agency’s final action may seek\njudicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The scope of our review is\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 35 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 35\ndetermined by the APA.  As a reviewing court, we must “set\naside” a final rule if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  Id.\n§ 706(2)(A).  In making this determination, we may “decide\nall  relevant  questions  of  law,  interpret  .  .  .  statutory\nprovisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the\nterms of an agency action.”  Id. § 706.\nDHS argues that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its\nappeal because, contrary to the conclusions of the district\ncourts, the Final Rule is neither contrary to law nor arbitrary\nand capricious.  We agree.  The Final Rule’s definition of\n“public charge” is consistent with the relevant statutes, and\nDHS’s action was not arbitrary or capricious.\nA. Contrary to Law\nThe States argue that the Final Rule is invalid under the\nAPA because the Final Rule’s definition of “public charge”\nis contrary to (1) the INA and (2) the Rehabilitation Act.  We\ndisagree  and  find  that  DHS  is  likely  to  succeed  in  its\nargument that the Final Rule is not contrary to law.11\n1. The INA and “Public Charge”\nWhen confronted with an argument that an agency’s\ninterpretation of a statute that it administers is wrong, we\n11 The States also brought claims in both courts under the equal\nprotection component of the Due Process Clause.  U.S. CONST. art. V. \nNeither district court reached this issue.  We also decline to reach this\nissue.  We will consider the likelihood of success on the merits only as to\nthose issues that formed the bases for the district courts’ injunctions.  In\nany further proceedings, the district courts are free to consider any issues\nfairly before them.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 36 of 76\n36 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nemploy the familiar Chevron two-step test.  First, we ask\n“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question\nat issue.”  Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984).  If it has, “that is the end of\nthe matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give\neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” \nId. at 842–43.  But if Congress has not spoken directly to the\nissue at hand, we proceed to the second step and ask “whether\nthe agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of\nthe statute.”  Id. at 843.\nWe must keep in mind why Chevron is an important rule\nof construction:\nChevron  is  rooted  in  a  background\npresumption of congressional intent: namely,\nthat Congress, when it left ambiguity in a\nstatute administered by an agency, understood\nthat the ambiguity would be resolved, first and\nforemost,  by  the  agency,  and  desired  the\nagency  (rather than  the  courts)  to  possess\nwhatever degree of discretion the ambiguity\nallows.    Chevron  thus  provides  a  stable\nbackground rule against which Congress can\nlegislate:    Statutory  ambiguities  will  be\nresolved,  within  the  bounds  of  reasonable\ninterpretation, not by the courts but by the\nadministering agency.  Congress knows to\nspeak  in  plain  terms  when  it  wishes  to\ncircumscribe, and in capacious terms when it\nwishes to enlarge, agency discretion.\nArlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 296 (2013) (quotation marks\nand citations omitted).\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 37 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 37\nThe district courts found that the Final Rule failed the\nChevron test at one or both steps because the Final Rule’s\ndefinition of “public charge” was an impermissible reading of\nthat phrase in the INA.  We will consider each step in turn.\na. Chevron Step 1\nAt Chevron’s first step, we determine whether Congress\nhas directly spoken to  the issue at  hand by “employing\ntraditional  tools  of  statutory  construction.”    Chevron,\n467 U.S. at 843 n.9.  That means we start with the text. \nAfewerki v. Anaya Law Grp., 868 F.3d 771, 778 (9th Cir.\n2017).  We will then examine the history of interpretation to\nsee if there has been a judicial construction of the term\n“public charge” that “follows from the unambiguous terms of\nthe statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.” \nNat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs.,\n545 U.S. 967, 982 (2005).  Finally, we will consider other\nfactors raised by the district courts and the States.\n(1) Text.  Under § 212 of the INA, an alien is inadmissible\nif, “in the opinion of” the immigration official, the alien “is\nlikely at any time to become a public charge.”  In making that\ndetermination, the immigration official must consider “at a\nminimum” the alien’s age, health, family status, financial\nresources, education, and skills.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A). \nCongress did not define these terms and placed no further\nrestrictions on what these officers may consider in the public-\ncharge assessment.  Nor did Congress prescribe how the\nofficers are to regard the five enumerated factors.\nWe have four quick observations.  First, the determination\nis entrusted to the “opinion” of the consular or immigration\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 38 of 76\n38 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nofficer.12  That is the language of discretion, and the officials\nare given broad leeway.  Depending on the context in which\nthe “opinion” is given, the decision may be nonreviewable. \nUnder the rule of consular nonreviewability, only the most\negregious abuses of discretion may be reviewed.  See Kerry\nv.  Din,  135  S.  Ct.  2128,  2140–41  (2015)  (Kennedy,  J.,\nconcurring); see also Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d\n1164,  1171–72  (9th  Cir.  2016)  (holding  that  Justice\nKennedy’s  concurring  opinion  in  Din  is  the  controlling\nopinion and summarizing the consular nonreviewability rule). \nIndeed, we have previously held that the phrase “in the\nopinion  of  the  Attorney  General”  in  a  now-repealed\nimmigration statute conferred “unreviewable” discretion to\nthe Executive Branch.  See Kalaw v. I.N.S., 133 F.3d 1147,\n1151–52 (9th Cir. 1997), superseded by statute on other\ngrounds.  And to the extent the federal courts may review\nsuch determinations, our review is narrow.  See Montero-\nMartinez v. Ashcroft, 277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(holding that judicial review of discretionary acts by the BIA\nis limited to “the purely legal and hence non-discretionary”\naspects of the BIA’s action); see also Allen v. Milas, 896 F.3d\n1094, 1106–07 (9th Cir. 2018) (noting that judicial review of\nvisa denials is “limited . . . to constitutional challenges” and\ndoes  not  extend  to  APA-based  challenges  (emphasis\nomitted)).\nSecond, the critical term “public charge” is not a term of\nart.  It is not self-defining.  That does not mean that officials\n12 The text of the INA does not mention immigration officers.  Rather,\nit commits the public-charge determination to the “opinion of the Attorney\nGeneral.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  As we explained above, Congress\nhas  since  transferred  the  authority  granted  by  the  INA  to  DHS’s\nimmigration officers.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 39 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 39\nmay pour any meaning into the term, but it does mean that\nthere is room for discretion as to what, precisely, being a\n“public charge” encompasses.  In a word, the phrase is\n“ambiguous” under Chevron; it is capable of a range of\nmeanings.  So long as the agency has defined the term within\nthat range of meanings, we have no grounds for second-\nguessing the agency, “even if the agency’s reading differs\nfrom what [we] believe[] is the best statutory interpretation.” \nBrand X, 545 U.S. at 980 (citing Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843–44\n& n.11).  It also means that an agency “must consider varying\ninterpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing\nbasis,”  including  “in  response  to  changed  factual\ncircumstances, or a change in administrations.”  Id. at 981\n(quotations marks and citations omitted).\nThird, Congress set out five factors to be taken into\naccount by immigration officials, but expressly did not limit\nthe discretion of officials to those factors.  Rather the factors\nare to be considered “at a minimum.”  Other factors may be\nconsidered as well, giving officials considerable discretion in\ntheir decisions.\nFourth,  Congress  granted  DHS  the  power  to  adopt\nregulations to enforce the provisions of the INA.  When\nCongress created DHS, Congress vested the Secretary of\nHomeland Security “with the administration and enforcement\nof  .  .  .  all  []  laws  relating  to  the  immigration  and\nnaturalization of aliens” and authorized the Secretary to\n“establish such regulations . . . as he deems necessary.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(1) & (3); see also 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(1)\n(authorizing the Secretary to “delegate any of the Secretary’s\nfunctions to any [DHS] officer, employee, or organizational\nunit”); Matter of D-J-, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 573–74.  By\ngranting regulatory authority to DHS, Congress intended that\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 40 of 76\n40 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nDHS would resolve any ambiguities in the INA.  See Encino\nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2125 (2016)\n(“A premise of Chevron is that when Congress grants an\nagency  the  authority  to  administer  a  statute  by  issuing\nregulations with the force of law, it presumes the agency will\nuse that authority to resolve ambiguities in the statutory\nscheme.”).  As we have already noted, the INA’s text is\nambiguous.  DHS has attempted to elucidate that ambiguity\nin the Final Rule.  In short, we do not read the text of the INA\nto unambiguously foreclose DHS’s action.\n(2) Historical Understanding.  Although the foregoing\nwould ordinarily be sufficient to end our inquiry, the current\nprovision, which was most recently rewritten in 1996 in\nIIRIRA,  is  merely  the  most  recent  iteration  of  federal\nimmigration law to deem an alien inadmissible if he or she is\nlikely to become a “public charge.”  There is a long history of\njudicial and administrative interpretations of this phrase in the\nimmigration context that predates the enactment of the INA. \nBecause  “Congress  is  presumed  to  be  aware  of  an\nadministrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to\nadopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without\nchange,” Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), we\nmust examine this history to determine if “public charge” has\na well-defined and congressionally understood meaning that\nlimits DHS’s discretion.\nThe history of the term “public charge” confirms that its\ndefinition has changed over time to adapt to the way in which\nfederal, state, and local governments have cared for our most\nvulnerable populations.  “Public charge” first appeared in this\ncountry’s immigration law in 1882.  That statute excluded a\nwould-be immigrant from the United States if the person was\na “convict, lunatic, idiot, or a[] person unable to take care of\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 41 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 41\nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge.”  Act of\nAug. 3, 1882 ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214.\nCongress did not define “public charge” in the 1882 act. \nWe thus ascribe to that phrase its commonly understood\nmeaning at the time, as evidenced by contemporary sources. \nSee Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc., 566 U.S. 624, 633–34\n& nn.6–8 (2012) (citing contemporary dictionary definitions\nto interpret statutory phrases).  An 1828 dictionary defined\n“charge” as “[t]hat which is enjoined, committed, entrusted\nor delivered to another, implying care, custody, oversight, or\nduty to be performed by the person entrusted,” or a “person\nor  thing  committed  to  anothers  [sic]  custody,  care  or\nmanagement.”    Charge,  WEBSTER’S  DICTIONARY  (1828\nOnline Edition), http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Diction\nary/charge; see also Stewart Rapaljb & Robert L. Lawrence,\nDICTIONARY  OF  AMERICAN  AND  ENGLISH  LAW,  WITH\nDEFINITIONS OF THE TECHNICAL TERMS OF THE CANON AND\nCIVIL LAWS 196 (Frederick D. Linn & Co. 1888) (defining\n“charge” as “an obligation or liability.  Thus we speak . . . of\na pauper being chargeable to the parish or town”).  That is a\nbroad,  common-sense  definition,  which  was  reflected in\nNineteenth-Century judicial opinions using the phrase.  See,\ne.g., In re Day, 27 F. 678, 681 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1886) (defining\na “public charge” as a person who “can neither take care of\nthemselves, nor are under the charge or protection of any\nother person”); State v. The S.S. “Constitution”, 42 Cal. 578,\n584–85 (1872) (noting that those who are “liable to become\na public charge” are “paupers, vagabonds, and criminals, or\nsick, diseased, infirm, and disabled persons”); City of Alton\nv. Madison Cty., 21 Ill. 115, 117 (1859) (noting that a person\nis not a “public charge” if the person has “ample means” of\nsupport).\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 42 of 76\n42 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nThe 1882 act did not consider an alien a “public charge”\nif the alien received merely some form of public assistance. \nThe act itself established an “immigrant fund” that was\ndesigned to provide “for the care of immigrants arriving in\nthe United States.”  Act of Mar. 26, 1910 ch. 376, § 1, 22\nStat.  214.    Congress  thus  accepted that  providing  some\nassistance  to  recent  immigrants  would  not  make  those\nimmigrants public charges.  But Congress did not draw that\nline with any precision.  Instead, we read “public charge” in\nthe 1882 act to refer generally to those who were unwilling or\nunable to care for themselves.  In context that often meant\nthat  they  were  housed  in  a  government  or  charitable\ninstitution, such as an almshouse, asylum, or penitentiary.\nThe term “public charge” endured through subsequent\namendments to the 1882 act.  In 1910, Congress enacted a\nstatute that deemed “paupers; persons likely to become a\npublic charge; professional beggars;” and similar  people\ninadmissible.  ch. 128, § 2, 36 Stat. 263 (1910).  Relying on\nthe placement of “public charge” between “paupers” and\n“professional beggars,” the Supreme Court held that a person\nis  likely  to  become  a  public  charge  if  that  person  has\n“permanent personal objections” to  finding employment. \nGegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3, 10 (1915).  In that case, the\npetitioners, Russian emigrees, arrived in the United States\nwith little cash and the intention of going to Portland, Oregon. \nThe immigration officials considered them likely to become\npublic charges because Portland had a high unemployment\nrate.  In a spare, three-page opinion by Justice Holmes, the\nCourt noted that the “single question” before the Court was\n“whether an alien can be declared likely to become a public\ncharge on the ground that the labor market in the city of his\nimmediate destination is overstocked.”  Id. at 9–10.

USCIS 43\ndetermination, immigration officers must consider an alien’s\n“personal” characteristics, not a localized job shortage.  Id.\nat 10.  The Court observed that  “public charge” should be\n“read as generically similar to the other[] [statutory terms]\nmentioned before and after” that phrase.  Id.  Five years later,\nwe followed the Supreme Court’s lead, holding that “the\nwords  ‘likely  to  become  a  public  charge’  are  meant  to\nexclude  only  those  persons  who  are  likely  to  become\noccupants of almshouses for want of means with which to\nsupport themselves in the future.”  Ng Fung Ho v. White,\n266 F. 765, 769 (9th Cir. 1920) (citing Howe v. United States,\n247 F. 292, 294 (2d Cir. 1917)), aff’d in part and rev’d in\npart on other grounds, 259 U.S. 276 (1922).13  Thus, as of\n1920, we considered the likelihood of being housed in a state\ninstitution  to  be the primary factor  in  the public-charge\nanalysis.\nBy the mid-Twentieth Century, the United States had\nlargely abandoned the poorhouse in favor of direct payments\nthrough social welfare legislation. At the federal level, the\ngovernment had created Social Security and Aid to Families\nWith  Dependent  Children  (AFDC).    At  the  state  level,\n13 In Ng Fung Ho, the petitioner had been admitted to the United\nStates, based partly on his holding a “certificate” that allowed him to be\na “merchant.”  Id. at 768.  Several years after his admission, he pleaded\nguilty to gambling.  Id. at 769.  It was then determined that the petitioner\nwas no longer a merchant.  The government argued that the petitioner was\ndeportable because he had been likely to become a public charge at the\ntime of his admission.  Because there was no evidence that the certificate\nhe had produced prior to admission had been fraudulent, we held that\nmerely pleading guilty to gambling and paying a $25 fine three years after\nbeing admitted did not “prove that the alien . . . was likely to become a\npublic charge” at the time of admission.  Id.  We thus rejected the\ngovernment’s assertion that the petitioner should be deported on that basis. \nId. at 770.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 44 of 76\n44 CITY & CTY.

USCIS\ngovernments supplemented family income through programs\nsuch as unemployment insurance and worker’s compensation. \nSimilar changes were being made in other programs such as\nmental health care, where we moved from institutionalizing\nthe mentally ill to a program of treatment with the end of\nreleasing them.  As Chief Justice Burger observed:\nHistorically, and for a considerable period of\ntime,  subsidized  custodial  care  in  private\nfoster homes or boarding houses was the most\nbenign form of care provided incompetent or\nmentally  ill  persons  for  whom  the  States\nassumed responsibility.  Until well into the\n19th century the vast majority of such persons\nwere  simply  restrained  in  poorhouses,\nalmshouses, or jails.\nO’Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 582 (1975) (Burger,\nC.J., concurring).  “[T]he idea that States may not confine the\nmentally ill except for the purpose of providing them with\ntreatment [was] of very recent origin.”  Id. (footnote omitted). \nThe way in which we regarded the poor and the mentally\ninfirm not only brought changes in the way we treated them,\nbut major changes in their legal rights as well.  See, e.g.,\nMcNeil v. Director, Patuxent Inst., 407 U.S. 245, 248–50\n(1972)  (requiring  a  hearing  before  a  person  who  has\ncompleted  his  criminal  sentence  can  be  committed  to\nindefinite confinement in a mental institution); cf.

OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 45\nThe movement towards social welfare was soon reflected\nin the definition of “public charge.”  In Matter of B-, 3 I. & N.\nDec. 323 (BIA 1948), the recently created BIA articulated a\nnew  definition  of  “public  charge.”    Permanent\ninstitutionalization would not be the sole measure of whether\nan alien was a public charge.  The BIA said it would also\nconsider whether an alien received temporary services from\nthe government.  At the same time, the BIA recognized that\nmere “acceptance by an alien of services provided by” the\ngovernment “does not in and of itself make the alien a public\ncharge.”  Id. at 324.  Instead, the BIA stated that an alien\nbecomes a public charge if three elements are met:  “(1) The\nState or other governing body must, by appropriate law,\nimpose a charge for the services rendered to the alien. . . . \n(2) The authorities must make demand for payment of the\ncharges . . . .  And (3) there must be a failure to pay for the\ncharges.”  Id. at 326.  In other words, the government benefit\nreceived by the alien must be monetized, a bill must be\npresented to the alien, and the alien must refuse to pay. \nUltimately, in Matter of B-, the BIA held that the petitioner\nhad not become a public charge, even though she had been\ninvoluntarily committed to a mental institution, because the\nstate of Illinois had not charged her or demanded payment. \nId. at 327.  The BIA’s order was subsequently affirmed by the\nAttorney General.  Id. at 337.\nFour  years  later,  Congress  substantially  revised  the\nimmigration laws in the Immigration and Nationality Act of\n1952.  The amended statute retained the term “public charge,”\nbut, for the first time, made clear that the decision was\ncommitted to the opinion of a consular officer or the Attorney\nGeneral.  The INA deemed inadmissible “[a]liens who, in the\nopinion of the consular officer at the time of application for\na visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 46 of 76\n46 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\napplication for admission, are likely at any time to become\npublic charges.”  Title 2, ch. 2, § 212, 66 Stat. 163, 183\n(1952).  Although Matter of B- was not mentioned in the\nlegislative history accompanying the 1952 act, it is notable\nthat  Congress  chose  to  insert  this  “opinion”  language\nfollowing  the  BIA’s  articulation  of  a  new  definition  of\n“public  charge”  that  departed  from  prior  judicial\ninterpretations of the term.\nIn 1974, the BIA altered course again.  The BIA limited\nMatter of B-’s three-part test to determining whether a person\nhad become a public charge after having been admitted to the\nUnited States.  See Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec.\n583, 585 (BIA 1974).  After noting that the phrase “public\ncharge” had been interpreted differently by various courts, the\nBIA held:\n[A]ny alien who is incapable of earning a\nlivelihood, who does not have sufficient funds\nin the United States for his support, and has\nno person in the United States willing and\nable to assure that he will not need public\nsupport is excludable as likely to become a\npublic  charge  whether  or  not  the  public\nsupport which will be available to him is\nreimbursable to the state.\nId. at 589–90.  The BIA thus  pegged the public-charge\ndetermination to whether the alien was likely to “need public\nsupport,” irrespective of whether the alien was likely to be\ninstitutionalized for any length of time and billed for the cost\nby the state.  Id. at 589.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 47 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 47\nThat  definition  of  “public  charge”  was  subsequently\namended by the INS.  In 1987, the INS issued a final rule that\ndeemed an applicant for adjustment of status to be a “public\ncharge” if the applicant had “received public cash assistance.” \nAdjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205,\n16,211 (May 1, 1987).  INS did not state how much “public\ncash assistance” an alien had to receive, but left the decision\nto officers who would judge the totality of the circumstances. \nSee id. at 16,211 (noting that “all [the] evidence produced by\nthe applicant will be judged”), 16,212 (“The weight given in\nconsidering applicability of the public charge provisions will\ndepend on many factors . . . .”).  INS did make clear that\n“public cash assistance” would not include the value of \n“assistance in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or\nother non-cash benefits,” including Medicare and Medicaid. \nId. at 16,209.\nIn 1996, through IIRIRA, Congress enacted the current\nlanguage  appearing  in  §  212  of  the  INA.    Omnibus\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, Title 5 § 531, 110 Stat.\n3009  (1996).    As  detailed  above,  Congress  added  a\nrequirement that an immigration officer consider an alien’s\n“age;”  “health;”  “family  status;”  “assets,  resources  and\nfinancial  status;”  and  “education  and  skills”  when\ndetermining if a person is likely to become a public charge. \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B).\nResponding to the 1996 act, INS published the 1999 Field\nGuidance  to  “establish  clear  standards  governing  a\ndetermination that an alien is inadmissible or ineligible to\nadjust status . . . on public charge grounds.”  64 Fed. Reg.\nat 28,689.  In the 1999 Field Guidance, INS defined “public\ncharge” as “an alien . . . who is  likely to  become (for\nadmission/adjustment purposes) primarily dependent on the\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 48 of 76\n48 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\ngovernment for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the\nreceipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or\n(ii)  institutionalization for long-term care at government\nexpense.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The 1999\nField  Guidance  made  clear  that  the  public-charge\ndetermination remained a “totality of the circumstances test.” \nId.  at  28,690.    Within  this  totality-of-the-circumstances\nassessment, only the receipt of “cash public assistance for\nincome maintenance” should be considered; “receipt of non-\ncash benefits or the receipt of special-purpose cash benefits\nnot  for  income  maintenance  should  not  be  taken  into\naccount.”    Id.    The  1999  Field  Guidance  thus  largely\nreaffirmed INS’s 1987 rule.  For the past twenty years, the\n1999 Field Guidance has governed, until it was replaced by\nthe Final Rule.\nSo what to make of this history?  Unlike the district\ncourts, we are unable to discern one fixed understanding of\n“public charge” that has endured since 1882.  If anything has\nbeen  consistent,  it  is  the  idea  that  a  totality-of-the-\ncircumstances test governs public-charge determinations.  But\ndifferent factors have been weighted more or less heavily at\ndifferent times, reflecting changes in the way in which we\nprovide assistance to the needy.  Initially, the likelihood of\nbeing housed in a government or charitable institution was\nmost important.  Then, the focus shifted in 1948 to whether\npublic benefits received by an immigrant could be monetized,\nand the immigrant refused to pay for them.  In 1974, it shifted\nagain to whether the immigrant was employable and self-\nsufficient.    That  was  subsequently  narrowed in  1987  to\nwhether the immigrant had received public cash assistance,\nwhich excluded in-kind benefits.  Congress then codified\nparticular factors immigration officers must consider, which\nwas followed by the 1999 Field Guidance’s definition of\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 49 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 49\n“public charge.”  In short, we find that the history of the use\nof “public charge” in federal immigration law demonstrates\nthat “public charge” does not have a fixed, unambiguous\nmeaning.    Rather,  the  phrase  is  subject  to  multiple\ninterpretations, it in fact has been interpreted differently, and\nthe Executive Branch has been afforded the discretion to\ninterpret it.\nCongress simply has not spoken to how “public charge”\nshould be defined.  We must presume that when Congress\nenacted the current version of the INA in 1996, it was aware\nof the varying historical interpretations of “public charge.” \nSee Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239–40\n(2009).  Yet Congress chose not to define “public charge”\nand, instead, described various factors to be considered “at a\nminimum,”  without  even  defining  those  factors.    It  is\napparent that Congress left DHS and other agencies enforcing\nour immigration laws the flexibility to adapt the definition of\n“public charge” as necessary.\n(3) Other Factors.  Both district courts found it significant\nthat  Congress  twice  considered,  but  failed  to  enact,  a\ndefinition of “public charge” that is similar to the definition\nadopted in the Final Rule. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019\nWL 5100718 at *27; Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17. \nDuring  the  debates  over  IIRIRA  in  1996,  Congress\nconsidered  whether  to  enact  the  following  definition  of\n“public charge”:  “the term ‘public charge’ includes any alien\nwho receives [certain means-tested] benefits . . . for an\naggregate period of at least 12 months or 36 months” in some\ncases.  142 Cong. Rec. 24,313, at 24,425 (1996).  Senator\nLeahy argued that this was “too quick to label people as\npublic charges for utilizing the same public assistance that\nmany Americans need to get on their feet,” and that the\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 50 of 76\n50 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nphrase  “means  tested”  was  “unnecessarily  uncertain.” \nS. Rep. No. 104-249, at 63–64 (1996).  Nevertheless, the\nSenate passed the bill containing the definition of “public\ncharge.”  Before the House considered the bill, however,\nPresident Clinton implicitly threatened to veto it because it\nwent “too far in denying legal immigrants access to vital\nsafety net programs which could jeopardize public health and\nsafety.”  Statement on Senate Action on the “Immigration\nControl  and  Financial  Responsibility  Act  of  1996,”\n32 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 783 (May 6, 1996).  Ultimately,\nCongress chose not to enact this “public charge” definition. \nIn 2013, the Senate rejected an amendment to the INA that\n“would have expanded the definition of ‘public charge’ such\nthat people who received non-cash health benefits could not\nbecome legal permanent residents.  This amendment would\nalso have denied entry to individuals whom the Department\nof Homeland Security determines are likely to receive these\ntypes of benefits in the future.”  S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 63\n(2013).\nThe district courts viewed these failed legislative efforts\nas  evidence  that  Congress  specifically  rejected  the\ninterpretation of “public charge” DHS articulated in the Final\nRule, and that the Final Rule is thus an impermissible reading\nof  the  INA.    City  &  Cty.  of  San  Francisco,  2019  WL\n5100718, at *27; Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17. \nWe  disagree.    If  this  legislative  history  is  probative  of\nanything, it is probative only of the fact that Congress chose\nnot to codify a particular interpretation of “public charge.”14 \n14 Sometimes it is appropriate to consider language Congress has\nrejected, primarily when Congress rejected language in favor of the statute\nadopted and under review.  See, e.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S.\n421, 441–42 (1987) (contrasting Congress’s decision to adopt the House\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 51 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 51\nSee Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 184 (1994) (“[F]ailed legislative\nproposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to\nrest an interpretation of a prior statute.” (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted)).  But the failure of Congress to compel\nDHS to adopt a particular rule is not the logical equivalent of\nforbidding DHS from adopting that rule.  The failure to adopt\na new rule is just that: no new rule.15  And no change to § 212\nmeans that consular officers, the Attorney General, and DHS\nretain all the discretion granted them in the INA.\nA second argument made by the States and relied upon by\nthe Eastern District of Washington is that DHS exceeded its\nauthority  by  determining  what  makes  a  person  “self-\nsufficient.”  Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *17–18.  This\nargument  is  refuted  by  the  statute  itself.    As  we  have\ndiscussed, the INA requires immigration officers to consider\nan alien’s “health,” “family status,” “assets, resources, []\nfinancial  status,”  “education  and  skills.”    8  U.S.C.\n§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(i)(II)–(V) .  The concept of self-sufficiency\nis subsumed within each of these factors.  And even if it were\nproposal over the Senate version).\n15 We can speculate as to the reasons that members of Congress\ndeclined to adopt these legislative proposals, but the speculation will not\nhelp us.  “A bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be\nrejected for just as many others.”  Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v.\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 170 (2001).  Although some\nmembers may have thought the rule too harsh, others may have thought\nit too lenient, while a third group may have thought the rule should be left\nflexible and in the hands of the immigration agencies.  If anything, this\nlegislative history proves only that Congress decided not to constrain the\ndiscretion of agencies in determining who is a public charge.  That\ndiscretion had long been vested in the agencies, and these failed legislative\nefforts did not alter that discretion.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 52 of 76\n52 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nnot, the statutory factors are not exhaustive; DHS may add to\nthem.  See id. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  Because DHS has been\n“charged with the administration and enforcement” of all\n“laws  relating  to  the  immigration  and  naturalization  of\naliens,”  Id. § 1103(a)(1); see also 6 U.S.C. § 112(b)(1),\ndetermining what constitutes self-sufficiency for purposes of\nthe  public-charge  assessment  is  well  within  DHS’s\nauthority.16\n*          *          *\nIn  short,  Congress  has  not  spoken  directly  to  the\ninterpretation of “public charge” in the INA.  Nor did it\nunambiguously foreclose the interpretation articulated in the\nFinal Rule.  Instead, the phrase “public charge” is ambiguous\nunder Chevron.  DHS has the authority to interpret it and\n“must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its\npolicy on a continuing basis.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 863–64. \n16 The Eastern District of Washington also held that, because the\nstates have a “central role in formulation and administration of health care\npolicy,” DHS “acted beyond its Congressionally delegated authority”\nwhen it adopted the Final Rule.  Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *18;\nsee also id. (“Congress cannot delegate authority that the Constitution\ndoes not allocate to the federal government in the first place . . . .”). \nCongress, of course, has plenary authority to regulate immigration and\nnaturalization.  U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 4.  Pursuant to that authority,\nCongress adopted the “public charge” rule, which no one has challenged\non constitutional grounds.  Further, Congress has authorized DHS to adopt\nregulations.  8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3).  DHS thus did not overstep its\nauthority by promulgating the Final Rule.  Indeed, under the district\ncourt’s analysis, even the 1999 Field Guidance might be unconstitutional. \nBut neither the district court nor the States question the lawfulness of the\n1999 Field Guidance.  We see no meaningful difference between INS’s\nauthority to promulgate the 1999 Field Guidance and DHS’s authority to\nadopt the Final Rule.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 53 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 53\nIndeed,  “the  fact  that  the  agency  has  adopted  different\ndefinitions in different contexts adds force to the argument\nthat  the  definition  itself  is  flexible,  particularly  since\nCongress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible\nreading of the statute.”  Id. at 864.  We thus proceed to the\nsecond step of the Chevron analysis.\nb. Chevron Step 2\nAt Chevron’s second step, we ask whether the agency’s\ninterpretation is “reasonable—or ‘rational and consistent with\nthe statute.’”  Diaz-Quirazco v. Barr, 931 F.3d 830, 840 (9th\nCir. 2019) (quoting Sullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 89\n(1990)).  If it is, we must defer to it, “even if the agency’s\nreading differs from what the court believes is  the best\nstatutory interpretation.”  Perez-Guzman v. Lynch, 835 F.3d\n1066, 1073–74 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting Brand X, 545 U.S.\nat 980).\nThe Final Rule easily satisfies this test.  As we have\nexplained, the INA grants DHS considerable discretion to\ndetermine if an alien is likely to become a public charge.  To\nbe sure, under the Final Rule, in-kind benefits (other than\ninstitutionalization) will for the first time be relevant to the\npublic-charge determination.  We see no statutory basis from\nwhich a court could conclude that the addition of certain\ncategories of in-kind benefits makes DHS’s interpretation\nuntenable.17  And whether the change in policy results from\n17 Cash benefits and in-kind benefits are often treated under the single\nrubric of a “direct subsidy.”  Witters v. Wash. Dep’t of the Servs. for the\nBlind, 474 U.S. 481, 487 (1986).  In certain contexts, such as settlement,\n“compensation in kind is worth less than cash of the same nominal value,”\nIn re Mex.

USCIS\nchanging circumstances or a change in administrations, the\nwisdom of the policy is not a question we can review.  See\nBrand X, 545 U.S. at 981.\nOur  conclusion  is  reinforced  by  the  Personal\nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of\n1996 (PRWORA), which Congress enacted contemporaneous\nwith IIRIRA.  PRWORA set forth our “national policy with\nrespect to welfare and immigration.”  8 U.S.C. § 1601.  In\nrelevant part, PRWORA provides, “Self-sufficiency has been\na basic principle of United States immigration law since this\ncountry’s earliest immigration statutes.”  Id. § 1601(1).  As a\nresult, “[i]t continues to be the immigration policy of the\nUnited States that . . . aliens within the Nation’s borders not\ndepend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather\nrely on their own capabilities and the resources of their\nfamilies,  their  sponsors,  and  private  organizations.”    Id.\n§ 1601(2).  Receipt of non-cash public assistance is surely\nrelevant to “self-sufficiency” and whether immigrants are\n“depend[ing] on public resources to meet their needs.”  See\nid. § 1601(1)–(2); see also Korab v. Fink, 797 F.3d 572, 580\n(9th Cir. 2014).  PRWORA thus lends support to DHS’s\ninterpretation of the INA.\nWe conclude that DHS’s interpretation of “public charge”\nis a permissible construction of the INA.\nRule does not deal with the valuation of such services.  It deals only with\nwhether in-kind benefits have been received under certain specified\nprograms.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 55 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 55\n2. The Rehabilitation Act\nThe States argue, and the Eastern District of Washington\nfound,  that  the  Final  Rule  is  inconsistent  with  the\nRehabilitation Act.  Washington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *18. \nThe Northern District of California rejected that argument. \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *29–30. \nThe Rehabilitation Act provides:  “No otherwise qualified\nindividual with a disability in the United States . . . shall,\nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity . . . conducted\nby any Executive agency.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  “Program or\nactivity” is defined as “all of the operations of . . . [an]\nagency.”  Id. § 794(b).\nThis argument need not detain us long.  First, under the\nINA,  immigration  officers  are  obligated  to  consider  an\nimmigrant’s  “health”  when  making  the  public-charge\ndetermination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i)(II).  To the extent\nthat inquiry may consider an alien’s disability, the officers\nhave been specifically directed by Congress to do so.  Indeed,\nCongress’s  express  direction  that  immigration  officers\nconsider an alien’s “health” came twenty-three years after the\nRehabilitation Act.  We cannot see how a general provision\nin one statute constrains an agency given a specific charge in\na  subsequent  law.    The  INA  does  not  violate  the\nRehabilitation  Act.    Second,  nothing  in  the  Final  Rule\nchanges DHS’s practice with respect to considering an alien’s\nhealth.  Nothing in the Final Rule suggests that aliens will be\ndenied admission or adjustment of status “solely by reason of\nher or his disability.”  Throughout the Final Rule, DHS\nconfirms that the public-charge determination is a totality-of-\nthe-circumstances test.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295, 41,368. \n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 56 of 76\n56 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nAnd DHS specifically addressed this argument in the Final\nRule:  “it is not the intent, nor is it the effect of this rule to\nfind a person a public charge solely based on his or her\ndisability.”    Id.  at  41,368.    DHS  has  shown  a  strong\nlikelihood  that  the  Final  Rule  does  not  violate  the\nRehabilitation Act.\n*          *          *\n In sum, DHS is likely to succeed in its argument that the\nFinal Rule should not be set aside as contrary to law.  We will\nnot minimize the practical impact of the Final Rule, but we\nwill observe that it is a short leap in logic for DHS to go from\nconsidering in-cash public assistance to considering both in-\ncash and in-kind public assistance.  DHS has shown that there\nis a strong likelihood that its decision to consider the receipt\nof in-kind government assistance as part of its totality-of-the-\ncircumstances test is a reasonable interpretation of the INA\nand does not violate the Rehabilitation Act.\nB. Arbitrary and Capricious\nArbitrary and capricious review under the APA addresses\nthe reasonableness of the agency’s decision.  The classic\nstatement  of  our  scope  of  review  is  Motor  Vehicle\nManufacturers Association of the United States v. State Farm\nMutual Automotive Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983):\n[T]he agency must examine the relevant data\nand articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\naction  including  a  rational  connection\nbetween the facts found and the choice made. \nIn  reviewing  that  explanation,  we  must\nconsider whether the decision was based on a\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 57 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 57\nconsideration  of  the  relevant  factors  and\nwhether  there  has  been  a  clear  error  of\njudgment.  Normally, an agency rule would be\narbitrary  and  capricious  if  the  agency  has\nrelied  on  factors  which  Congress  has  not\nintended  it  to  consider,  entirely  failed  to\nconsider an important aspect of the problem,\noffered an explanation for its decision that\nruns  counter  to  the  evidence  before  the\nagency, or is so implausible that could not be\nascribed to a difference in view of the product\nof agency expertise.\nId. at 43 (quotation marks and citations omitted); see Org.\nVill. of Kake v. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 966–67 (9th\nCir. 2015).  An agency’s failure to respond to any particular\ncomment or point put forward by a rule’s opponents is not a\nground for finding per se arbitrary-and-capricious action.  See\nSafari Aviation Inc. v. Garvey, 300 F.3d 1144, 1150–52 (9th\nCir. 2002) (explaining that there is no per se violation of the\nAPA when an agency fails to address comments); Thompson\nv. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“[The APA]\nhas never been interpreted to require the agency to respond to\nevery comment, or to analyse [sic] every issue or alternative\nraised by the comments, no matter how insubstantial.”).\nThe  fact  that  DHS  has  changed  policy  does  not\nsubstantially alter the burden in the challengers’ favor.  DHS\nmust, of course, “show that there are good reasons for the\nnew policy,” but, it\nneed not demonstrate to a court’s satisfaction\nthat the reasons for the new policy are better\nthan the reasons for the old one; it suffices\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 58 of 76\n58 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nthat the new policy is permissible under the\nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and\nthat the agency believes it to be better, which\nthe conscious change of course adequately\nindicates.\nFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515\n(2009).\nThe  district  courts  raised  two  objections  to  DHS’s\nconsideration that the district courts found made the Final\nRule arbitrary and capricious:  (1) DHS’s failure to properly\nweigh the costs to state and local governments and healthcare\nproviders, such as hospitals, resulting from disenrollment\nfrom public benefits programs; and (2) DHS’s inadequate\nconsideration of the Final Rule’s impact on public health. \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *31–35;\nWashington, 2019 WL 5100717, at *19.  We will consider\neach in turn.\n1. Costs of Disenrollment\nThe Northern District of California’s principal concern\nwas the higher costs that state and local governments will\nface as a result of “disenrollment [from] public benefits.” \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *31. \nSpecifically, the district court concluded that “DHS appears\nto have wholly failed to engage with [comments on the costs\nof the change].  DHS failed to grapple with the [Final] Rule’s\npredictable  effects  on  local  governments,  and  instead\nconcluded that the harms—whatever they may be—are an\nacceptable price to pay.”  Id. at *32.  The court further faulted\nDHS for “refus[ing] to consider the costs associated with\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 59 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 59\npredicted, likely disenrollment of those not subject to the\npublic charge determination.”  Id.\nWe begin with the observation that DHS addressed at\nlength the costs and benefits associated with the Final Rule. \nSee 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,300–03  (summarizing costs and\nbenefits); id. at 41,312–14 (estimating costs to health care\nproviders, states, and localities); id. at 41,463–81 (responding\nto  various  comments  on  costs  and  benefits);  id.\nat 41,485–41,489 (responding to Executive Orders requiring\nan  assessment  of  the  costs  and  benefits  of  regulatory\nalternatives).18  In addition, DHS prepared an “Economic\nAnalysis Supplemental Information for Analysis of Public\nBenefits Programs,” www.regulations.gov/document?D=U\nSCIS-2010-0012-63742.\nDHS’s analysis began by stating, “This rule will impose\nnew costs on this population applying to adjust status . . . that\nare subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility.” \n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,300.  It estimated the direct costs to the\nfederal government of the rule to be $35,202,698 annually. \nSome of these direct costs to the federal government would\nbe offset by “individuals who may choose to disenroll from\nor forego enrollment in a public benefits program.”  Id.  DHS\nestimated the reduction in federal transfer payments would be\nabout  $2.47  billion  annually.    Id.  at  41,301.    It  further\nestimated that there would be a reduction in state transfer\n18 Indeed, DHS’s notice is quite comprehensive.  In no fewer than\n216 pages (which DHS estimated would take sixteen to twenty hours to\nread), DHS explained the changes proposed, estimated costs and savings,\nand addressed scores of comments on topics ranging from potential\npublic-health concerns to whether DHS should consider immigrants’\ncredit scores.  See generally 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,292–508.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 60 of 76\n60 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\npayments of about $1.01 billion annually.  Id.  DHS also\nacknowledged that the Final Rule would impose direct and\nindirect costs on individuals and entities.  The first of these,\nit suggested, were “familiarization costs,” which was “a direct\ncost of the rule.”  Id.  Organizations that work with immigrant\ncommunities would similarly experience indirect costs of\nfamiliarization.  Id.\nElsewhere, DHS responded to comments claiming that the\nFinal Rule would cause aliens to disenroll from or forego\nenrollment in public benefit programs and that this “would be\ndetrimental  to  the  financial  stability  and  economy  of\ncommunities, States, local organizations, hospitals, safety net\nproviders,  foundations,  and  healthcare  centers.”    Id.\nat 41,312; see also id. (suggesting that the Final Rule would\nincrease  the  use  of  hospital  emergency  rooms).    DHS\nidentified three categories of aliens who might be affected by\nthe Final Rule.  First, there are aliens who are entitled to\npublic benefits and seek to immigrate or adjust status.  Their\nreceipt of some public benefits are simply not covered by the\nrule.  DHS noted, for example, that “emergency response,\nimmunization, education, or [certain] social services” are not\nincluded in its revised definition of “public benefits.”  Id.  On\nthe other hand, there are public benefits to which such an\nalien is entitled but which will be considered by DHS in its\ndetermination whether such alien is a “public charge.”  DHS\n“acknowledge[d] that individuals subject to this rule may\ndecline to enroll in, or may choose to disenroll from, public\nbenefits for which they may be eligible under PRWORA, in\norder to avoid negative consequences as a result of this final\nrule.”  Id.  DHS could not estimate how many aliens in this\ncategory would be affected by the Final Rule “because data\nlimitations provide neither a precise count nor reasonable\nestimate of the number of aliens who are both subject to the\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 61 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 61\npublic charge ground of inadmissibility and are eligible for\npublic benefits in the United States.”  Id. at 41,313.\nThe  second  category  of  aliens  are  those  who  are\nunlawfully in the United States.  These are “generally barred\nfrom receiving federal public benefits other than emergency\nassistance.”  Id. (footnote omitted).   Nevertheless, DHS\nannounced that it will not consider “for purposes of a public\ncharge inadmissibility determination whether applicants for\nadmission  or  adjustment  of  status  are  receiving  food\nassistance through other programs, such as exclusively state-\nfunded programs, food banks, and emergency services, nor\nwill  DHS  discourage  individuals  from  seeking  such\nassistance.”  Id.\nThird are those aliens and U.S. citizens who are not\nsubject to the Final Rule, but erroneously think they are and\ndisenroll from public benefits out of an abundance of caution. \nId.  Disenrollment by this category of persons should not be\ninfluenced by the Final Rule because their receipt of public\nbenefits will “not be counted against or made attributable to\nimmigrant family members who are subject to this rule.”  Id. \nDHS understood “the potential effects of confusion” over the\nscope of the Final Rule that might lead to over-disenrollment. \nDHS stated that it would “issue clear guidance that identifies\nthe groups of individuals who are not subject to the rule.”  Id.\nThe  Northern  District  of  California  pointed  out  that\nDHS’s response “fails to discuss costs being borne by the\nstates, hospitals, or others, other than to say DHS will issue\nguidance in an effort to mitigate confusion.”  City & Cty. of\nSan Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *34.  The court further\ncriticized DHS for “flatly refus[ing] to consider the costs\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 62 of 76\n62 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nassociated with predicted, likely disenrollment of those not\nsubject to the public charge determination.”  Id. at *35.\nWe think several points must be considered here.  First,\nthe costs that the states, localities, and various entities (such\nas healthcare providers) may suffer are indirect.  Nothing in\nthe  Final  Rule  imposes  costs  on  those  governments  or\nentities; the Final Rule does not regulate states, localities, and\nprivate entities.  Disenrollment will be the consequence of\neither (1) the free choice of aliens who wish to avoid any\nnegative repercussions for their immigration status that would\nresult from accepting public benefits, or (2) the mistaken\ndisenrollment of aliens or U.S. citizens who can receive\npublic benefits without any consequences for their residency\nstatus.  DHS addressed both groups.  DHS said it did not have\ndata to calculate the size of the first group (and, presumably,\nthe value of the benefits from which they will disenroll), and\nit had no way to estimate the second.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,313. \nDHS stated that it would try to compensate for the latter\ngroup’s error by publishing clear guidance, and it also noted\nthat other organizations, public and private, would have an\nincentive to provide accurate information to persons who\nmight mistakenly disenroll.  Id. at 41,486.\nSecond, DHS did acknowledge the indirect costs the Final\nRule might impose\ndownstream . . . on state and local economics,\nlarge and small businesses, and individuals. \nFor example, the rule might result in reduced\nrevenues  for  healthcare  providers\nparticipating  in  Medicaid,  companies  that\nmanufacture  medical  supplies  or\npharmaceuticals,  grocery  retailers\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 63 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 63\nparticipating in SNAP, agricultural producers\nwho grow foods that are eligible for purchase\nusing  SNAP  benefits,  or  landlords\nparticipating  in  federally  funded  housing\nprograms.\nId.    It  did  not  attempt  to  quantify  those  costs,  but  it\nrecognized the overall effect of the Final Rule, and that is\nsufficient.  See Irvine Med. Ctr. v. Thompson, 275 F.3d 823,\n835 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he Secretary acknowledged that\nsome Medicare beneficiaries would possibly have to shoulder\nan additional financial burden as a result of the repeal of the\ncarry-forward  provision.    This  acknowledgment  did  not\nrender the Secretary’s rulemaking statement or reliance upon\nit arbitrary, however.” (internal citation omitted)) .\nThird, DHS is not a regulatory agency like EPA, FCC, or\nOSHA.  Those agencies have broad mandates to regulate\ndirectly entire industries or practices, sometimes on no more\ninstruction  from  Congress  than  to  do  so  in  the  “public\nconvenience, interest or necessity,” 47 U.S.C. § 303 (FCC),\nor as “appropriate and necessary,” 42 U.S.C. § 7412(n)(1)(A)\n(EPA).  When Congress has vested such broad regulatory\nauthority in agencies, the Supreme Court has sometimes\ninsisted that the agencies perform some kind of a cost-benefit\nanalysis.  See, e.g., Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2707\n(2015) (EPA cannot “ignore cost when deciding whether to\nregulate power plants”); Indus. Union Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. Am.\nPetroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 644 (1980) (plurality opinion)\n(OSHA must “undertake some cost-benefit analysis before\n[it] promulgates any [safety and health] standard”).  But see\nAm. Textile Mfs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 510–11\n(1981) (“Congress uses specific language when intending that\nan agency engage in cost-benefit analysis.”).  By contrast,\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 64 of 76\n64 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nDHS  is  defining  a  simple  statutory  term—“public\ncharge”—to determine whether an alien is admissible.  Its\nonly mandate is to regulate immigration and naturalization,\nnot to secure transfer payments to state governments or\nensure the stability of the health care industry.  Any effects on\nthose entities are indirect and well beyond DHS’s charge and\nexpertise.  Even if it could estimate the costs to the states,\nlocalities, and healthcare providers, DHS has a mandate from\nCongress with respect to admitting aliens to the United States. \nAs DHS explained,\nDHS does not believe that it is sound policy to\nignore the longstanding self-sufficiency goals\nset forth by Congress or to admit or grant\nadjustment  of status  applications  of aliens\nwho  are  likely  to  receive  public  benefits\ndesignated in this rule to meet their basic\nliving needs in . . . hope that doing so might\nalleviate food and housing insecurity, improve\npublic health, decrease costs to states and\nlocalities,  or  better  guarantee  health  care\nprovider  reimbursements.    DHS  does  not\nbelieve that Congress intended for DHS to\nadminister [§ 212] in a manner that fails to\naccount for aliens’ receipt of food, medical,\nand  housing  benefits  so  as  to  help  aliens\nbecome self-sufficient.\n84 Fed. Reg. at 41,314.  Even had DHS been able to calculate\nthe  indirect  costs  that  states,  localities,  and  healthcare\nproviders might bear as a result of the Final Rule, it is not\nclear what DHS was supposed to balance.  Rather, it was\nsufficient—and not arbitrary and capricious—for DHS to\nconsider whether, in the long term, the overall benefits of its\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 65 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 65\npolicy change will outweigh the costs of retaining the current\npolicy.\n2. Public-Health Concerns\nThe Northern District of California also found that DHS\ndid not sufficiently respond to certain public-health concerns. \nCity & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019 WL 5100718, at *35–37. \nSpecifically, the court worried that by disenrolling from\npublic-health  benefits  like  Medicaid,  people  may  forgo\nvaccinations,  which  could  have  serious  public-health\nconsequences.  Id.  The district court also pointed out that the\n1999 Field Guidance declined to define “public charge” to\ninclude receipt of “health and nutrition benefits” out of fear\nof possible public-health ramifications.  Id. at *37 (citing 64\nFed. Reg. at 28,692).\nDHS  not  only  addressed  these  concerns  directly,  it\nchanged its Final Rule in response to the comments.  84 Fed.\nReg. at 41,297.  With respect to vaccines, DHS stated that it\n“does not intend to restrict the access of vaccines for children\nor adults or intend to discourage individuals from obtaining\nthe  necessary  vaccines  to  prevent  vaccine-preventable\ndiseases.”  Id. at 41,384.  The Final Rule “does not consider\nreceipt of Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a\nperson’s pregnancy, to constitute receipt of public benefits.” \nDHS said that would address “a substantial portion, though\nnot all, of the vaccinations issue.”  Id.  Accordingly, DHS\n“believes that vaccines would still be available for children\nand  adults  even  if  they  disenroll  from  Medicaid.”    Id.\nat 41,385.\nBoth the Northern District of California and the Eastern\nDistrict of Washington expressed concern that the Final Rule\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 66 of 76\n66 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nwas a departure from the 1999 Field Guidance, which raised\nthe vaccine issue, and that the 1999 Field Guidance had\n“engendered reliance.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 2019\nWL  5100718,  at  *37;  see  also  Washington,  2019  WL\n5100717, at *19.  The question is not whether an agency can\nchange a policy that people have come to rely on; clearly, it\ncan.    The  real  question  is  whether  the  agency  has\nacknowledged the change and explained the reasons for it. \nDHS knew well that it was adopting a change in policy; that\nwas the whole purpose of this rulemaking exercise.  See\nEncino  Motorcars,  136  S.  Ct.  at  2126  (holding  that  a\nDepartment of Labor regulation was “issued without . . .\nreasoned explanation” where there was “decades of industry\nreliance on the Department’s prior policy” and the new rule\nwas “offered [with] barely any explanation”); INS v. Yueh-\nShaio Yang, 519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996) (distinguishing “an\nirrational  departure  from  [established]  policy”  from  “an\navowed alteration of it”).  “[I]t suffices that the new policy is\npermissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for\nit, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the\nconscious  change  of  course  adequately  indicates.”    Fox\nTelevision Stations, 556 U.S. at 515.  Because DHS has\nadequately explained the reasons for the Final Rule, it has\ndemonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits.\nV. OTHER FACTORS\nWe have concluded that DHS is likely to succeed on the\nmerits.  Were we reviewing the preliminary injunctions on\ndirect review, this would be sufficient to reverse the district\ncourts’ orders.  See Trump v. Hawai‘i, 138 S. Ct. at 2423. \nBut because we are here on DHS’s motion for a stay, DHS\nbears the burden of satisfying three additional factors: that\nDHS will suffer some irreparable harm, that the balance of\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 67 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 67\nthe hardships favors a stay, and that the stay is in the public\ninterest.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.\nA. Irreparable Harm\nWe first consider whether DHS has shown that it “will be\nirreparably injured absent a stay.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434\n(quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776).  The claimed irreparable\ninjury  must  be  likely  to  occur;  “simply  showing  some\n‘possibility of irreparable injury’” is insufficient.  Id. (citation\nomitted).  DHS has carried its burden on this factor.\nDHS contends that as long as the Final Rule is enjoined,\nDHS  will  grant  lawful-permanent-resident\nstatus to aliens whom the Secretary would\notherwise  deem  likely  to  become  public\ncharges in the exercise of his discretion.  DHS\ncurrently has no practical means of revisiting\npublic-charge determinations once made, so\nthe injunctions will inevitably result in the\ngrant of LPR status to aliens who, under the\nSecretary’s interpretation of the statute, are\nlikely to become public charges.\nThe States do not deny that LPR status might be irrevocably\ngranted  to  some  aliens,  but  they  claim  that  DHS  has\n“exaggerate[d]  the  effect  of  the  injunction”  because  the\npublic-charge exclusion has “never played a significant role\nin immigration.  In contrast, in just 8 of the 14 Plaintiff States\n[in the Washington case] over 1.8 million lawfully present\nresidents may be driven from federal and state assistance\nprograms  if  the  injunction  is  lifted.”    They  argue  that\npreserving  the  status  quo  will  not  harm  DHS  pending\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 68 of 76\n68 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nadjudication on the merits, especially considering that the\nFinal Rule  replaces a policy that had been in  place for\ndecades.\nSeveral points emerge from the parties’ claims.  First, the\nStates appear to concede that decisions to grant adjustment of\nstatus to aliens who could otherwise not be eligible are not\nreversible.  Second, although the States argue that “public\ncharge” exclusions have not been an important component of\nour immigration scheme in the past, the whole point of\nDHS’s Final Rule is that “public charge” inadmissibility has\nbeen underenforced.\nMoreover, to the extent the States are contesting the\nmagnitude of the harm to DHS, the claim is irrelevant here. \nWe have said that this “analysis focuses on irreparability,\n‘irrespective of the magnitude of the injury.’”  California v.\nAzar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Simula, Inc.\nv. Autoliv, Inc., 175 F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999)).  But even\nif we look at the magnitude, the States’ own evidence is\ndouble-edged.  The States claim that they will suffer harm\nbecause millions of persons will disenroll to avoid potential\nimmigration consequences.  This seems to prove DHS’s\npoint.  If millions of “lawfully present residents” are currently\nreceiving public benefits and may choose to disenroll rather\nthan be found to be a “public charge” and inadmissible, the\nharm cited by DHS is not only irreparable, but significant.\nFinally, we think the tenability of DHS’s past practice is\nof no import here.  Congress has granted DHS the authority\nto enact and alter immigration regulations and DHS has done\nthat, and it has done so in a way that comports with its legal\nauthority.    Thus,  as  of  October 15,  2019,  DHS  had  an\nobligation to deny admission to those likely to become public\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 69 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 69\ncharge, as defined by the Final Rule.  This is true regardless\nof  DHS’s prior policy.  As a consequence, the preliminary\ninjunctions will force DHS to grant status to those not legally\nentitled  to  it.    DHS  has  satisfied  its  burden  to  show\nirreparable harm to the government absent a stay of the\ninjunctions.\nB. Balance of Hardships and Public Interest\nSince DHS has satisfied the first two factors, we proceed\nto the final two: balance of equities and the public interest. \nNken, 556 U.S. at 435. “Because the government is a party,\nwe consider [these two factors] together.”  California v. Azar,\n911 F.3d at 581.\nTo balance the equities, we consider the hardships each\nparty is likely to suffer if the other prevails.  N. Cheyenne\nTribe v. Norton, 503 F.3d 836, 843–44 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing\nAmoco Prod. Co. v. Vill. of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542\n(1987).  We have discussed above the irreparable, non-\nmonetary harm to the government.  On the other hand, the\nStates contend that they face financial, public-health, and\nadministrative  harms  if  the  Final  Rule  takes  effect  and\notherwise eligible individuals disenroll from public benefits. \nThese effects are indirect effects of the Final Rule and they\nare largely short-term, since they will only result during the\npendency of the proceedings in the district courts and any\nappeals  to  this  court  and  the  Supreme  Court.19    Those\nproceedings are likely to be conducted on an expedited basis,\nlimiting further any potential harm to be considered by this\n19 This is not to say that the States will not continue to incur harms\nafter the litigation terminates, but these potential harms are not relevant to\nthe question of a preliminary injunction or a stay.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 70 of 76\n70 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\ncourt.  DHS does not dispute that the States will incur some\nfinancial harm if the Final Rule is not stayed.  It cannot,\nbecause DHS repeatedly addressed the potential costs to the\nStates in its Final Rule.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reb. at 41,300,\n41,312–14,  41,385–85,  41,469–70,  41,474.    And  while\nordinarily,  we  do  not  consider  purely  economic  harm\nirreparable,  we  have  concluded  that  “such  harm  is\nirreparable” when “the states will not be able to recover\nmonetary damages.”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d at 581. \nYet the States’ financial concerns will be mitigated to some\nextent.  As DHS explained in the Final Rule, disenrollment\nfrom public benefits  means a reduction in federal and state\ntransfer payments, so the States will realize some savings in\nexpenditures.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,485–86.  Nevertheless, we\nconsider  the  harms  to  the  States,  even  if  not  readily\nquantifiable, significant.\nBalancing these harms is particularly difficult in this case. \nFirst, the harms are not comparable.  DHS’s harm is not\nmonetary, but programmatic.  The policy behind Congress’s\ndecision not to admit those who are likely to become a public\ncharge may have a fiscal component, but it is not the reason\nfor DHS’s Final Rule, nor has DHS argued financial harm as\na reason for seeking a stay.  By contrast, the States’ proffered\nharms are largely financial.  Second, both parties’ proffered\nharms are, to a degree, speculative.  We cannot say for certain\nhow many residents of the plaintiff states and counties will\ndisenroll from public benefits programs, nor how much any\nover-disenrollment will cost the States.  Nor can we say for\ncertain how many aliens might be found admissible during\nthe pendency of the preliminary injunction, and would have\nbeen found inadmissible under the Final Rule.  Given the\nlargely predictive nature of both parties’ alleged harms, we\ncannot state with any confidence which is greater.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 71 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 71\nFor the same reasons, the public interest in this case is\nlikewise difficult to calculate with precision.  DHS contends\nit is in the public’s interest not to grant immigration status to\npersons likely to become public charges.  The States contend\nthat  it  is  in  the  public’s  interest  to  avoid  increased\nadministrative  and  public-health  costs.    Both  of  these\ncontentions are likely true.  But on balance, we have few\nstandards for announcing which interest is greater.\nWe recently observed that “balancing the equities is not\nan exact science.”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 582.  Indeed, Justice\nFrankfurter once remarked that the balancing of the equities\nwas  merely  “lawyers’  jargon  for  choosing  between\nconflicting public interests.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.\nv.  Sawyer,  343  U.S.  579,  609  (1952)  (Frankfurter,  J.,\nconcurring).  Whether the stay is granted or denied, one\nparty’s costs will be incurred and the other avoided.  In the\nend, the “critical” factors are that DHS has mustered a strong\nshowing of likelihood of success on the merits and some\nirreparable harm.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  Those factors\nweigh in favor of granting a stay, despite the potential harms\nto the States.  And for that reason, the stay is in the public\ninterest.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction in\nNos. 19-17213 and 19-17214 is GRANTED.  The motion for\nstay  of  the  preliminary  injunction  in  No.  19-35914  is\nGRANTED.  The cases may proceed consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 72 of 76\n72 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge, concurring, perplexed and perturbed:\nI join the majority opinion in full.  I write separately to\nemphasize two points—points that I feel must be made, but\nare better said in a separate opinion.\nWe as a nation are engaged in titanic struggles over the\nfuture of immigration in the United States.  These are difficult\nconversations.  As a court, the Ninth Circuit in particular has\nfelt the effects of the recent surge in immigration.  As we\nobserved last year with respect to the asylum problem:\nWe have experienced a staggering increase in\nasylum  applications.    Ten  years  ago  we\nreceived about 5,000 applications for asylum. \nIn  fiscal  year  2018  we  received  about\n97,000—nearly a twenty-fold increase.  Our\nobligation to process these applications in a\ntimely manner, consistent with our statutes\nand regulations, is overburdened.  The current\nbacklog  of  asylum  cases  exceeds\n200,000—about  26%  of  the  immigration\ncourts’  total  backlog  of  nearly  800,000\nremoval  cases.    In  the  meantime,  while\napplications  are  processed,  thousands  of\napplicants  who  had  been  detained  by\nimmigration authorities have been released\ninto the United States.\nE. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 754 (9th\nCir. 2018) (citations omitted).  Because of our proximity to\nMexico, Central America, and East Asia, the brunt of these\ncases will find their way into our court.  And we are well\naware that we are only seeing the matters that find their way\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 73 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 73\ninto federal court, and that the burdens of the increase in\nimmigration are borne not only by our judges, but by the men\nand women in the executive branch charged with enforcing\nthe immigration laws.\nOur  court  has  faced  an  unprecedented  increase  in\nemergency petitions arising out of the administration’s efforts\nto administer the immigration laws and secure our borders. \nThese controversial efforts have met with mixed success in\nour court and the Supreme Court.  See, e.g., Sierra Club v.\nTrump, 929 F.3d 670 (9th Cir.) (construction of wall on the\nborder with Mexico), stay issued, 140 S. Ct. 1 (2019) (mem.);\nE. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742 (9th Cir.\n2018) (aliens entering outside a port of entry are ineligible for\nasylum); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland\nSec., 908 F.3d 476 (9th Cir. 2018) (DACA), cert. granted,\n139 S. Ct. 2779 (2019) (mem.); Trump v. Hawai‘i, 878 F.3d\n662 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (entry restrictions), rev’d,\n138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018); Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d 863 (9th\nCir. 2017) (treatment of detained alien minors under Flores\nagreement); Hawai‘i v. Trump, 859 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.) (per\ncuriam) (travel ban), vacated as moot, 138 S.

Ct. 448 (2017) (mem.).\nMy first point is that even as we are embroiled in these\ncontroversies, no one should mistake our judgments for our\npolicy preferences.  Whether “the iron fist [or an extended\nvelvet glove] would be the preferable policy. . . . our thoughts\non the efficacy of the one approach versus the other are\nbeside the point, since our  business is not to judge the\nwisdom of the National Government’s policy.”  Am. Ins.\nAss’n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 427 (2003); see Sale v.\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 74 of 76\n74 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nHaitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 165 (1993) (“The\nwisdom of the policy choices made by Presidents Reagan,\nBush, and Clinton is not a matter for our consideration.”); \nLochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 69 (1905) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting) (“Whether or not this be wise legislation it is not\nthe province of the court to inquire.  Under our systems of\ngovernment the courts are not concerned with the wisdom or\npolicy of legislation.”).\nOh, I am not so naive as to think that a simple declaration\nof  judicial  neutrality  will  quell  inquiry  into  judges’\nbackgrounds, prior writings, and opinions.  The battles over\njudicial nominations provide ample proof that our generation\nof lawyers bear a diverse set of assumptions about the nature\nof law, proper modes of constitutional interpretation, and the\nrole of the judiciary.  These are fair debates and they are\nlikely to continue for some time.  We can only hope that over\ntime our differences can be resolved by reason and persuasion\nrather than by politics by other means.  But I don’t know of\nany judge—at least not this judge—who can say that every\nopinion and judgment she issued was in accord with her\npreferred policy outcomes. “[I]n our private opinions, [we]\nneed not concur in Congress’ policies to hold its enactments\nconstitutional.  Judicially we must tolerate what personally\nwe may regard as a legislative mistake.”  Harisiades v.\nShaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 590 (1952).\nMy second point is less politic.  In this case, we are called\nupon to review the merits of DHS’s Final Rule through the\nlens of the judicial review provisions of the Administrative\nProcedure  Act,  5  U.S.C.  §  706.    Our  review  is  quite\ncircumscribed.   We  can  set  aside  agency  action  if  it  is\ncontrary to law, if it exceeds the agency’s jurisdiction or\nauthority, or if the agency failed to follow proper procedure. \n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 75 of 76\nCITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS 75\nId. § 706(2)(B)–(D).  Those are largely legal judgments,\nwhich we can address through the traditional tools judges\nhave long used.  With  respect to  the policy  behind the\nagency’s action, we are largely relegated to reviewing the\naction for arbitrariness and caprice.  Id. § 706(2)(A).  That is\nnot a very rigorous standard and, as a result, an agency has\nbroad discretion to administer the programs entrusted to it by\nCongress.  Cf. Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res.\nDef. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978) (“[F]undamental\npolicy questions appropriately resolved in Congress . . . are\nnot subject to reexamination in the federal courts under the\nguise of judicial review of agency action.”).\nIn the immigration context, whatever dialogue we have\nbeen having with the administration over its policies, we are\na poor conversant.  We are limited in what we can say and in\nour ability—even if anyone thought we were qualified to do\nso—to shape our immigration policies.  We lack the tools of\ninquiry, investigation, and fact-finding that a responsible\npolicymaker should have at its disposal.  In sum, the APA is\nthe meagerest of checks on the executive.  We are not the\nproper foil to this or any other administration as it crafts our\nimmigration policies.\nBy constitutional design, the branch that is qualified to\nestablish immigration policy and check any excesses in the\nimplementation of that policy is Congress.  See U.S. CONST.\nArt. I, § 8, cl. 4.  And, so far as we can tell from our modest\nperch in the Ninth Circuit, Congress is no place to be found\nin these debates.  We have seen case after case come through\nour courts, serious and earnest efforts, even as they are\ncontroversial, to address the nation’s immigration challenges. \nYet we have seen little engagement and no actual legislation\nfrom Congress.  It matters not to me as a judge whether\n\nCase: 19-35914, 12/05/2019, ID: 11523019, DktEntry: 25-1, Page 76 of 76\n76 CITY & CTY. OF SAN FRANCISCO V. USCIS\nCongress embraces or disapproves of the administration’s\nactions, but it is time for a feckless Congress to come to the\ntable and grapple with these issues.  Don’t leave the table and\nexpect us to clean up.\nOWENS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\nWhile I concur with the majority’s jurisdiction analysis,\nI  otherwise  respectfully  dissent.    In  light  of  the:\n(1) government’s heavy burden due to the standard of review,\n(2) opaqueness of the legal questions before us, (3) lack of\nirreparable  harm  to  the  government  at  this  early  stage,\n(4) likelihood of substantial  injury to  the plaintiffs, and\n(5) equities involved, I would deny the government’s motions\nto stay and let these cases proceed in the ordinary course.

Calculation: \n(Individuals adjusting status / Estimated foreign-born non-citizen population) *100 = Rate of disenrollment/foregone \nenrollment.  To estimate the population that could choose to disenroll/forego enrollment, DHS multiplied the population \nof members of households that include foreign-born non-citizens who may be receiving benefits or the number of \nhouseholds with at least 1 foreign-born non-citizen by 2.5 percent.  \n \nFinally, Table 5 shows the estimated  total reduction in transfer payments paid by the \nfederal government to the population of members of households that include foreign-born non-\ncitizens, or households with at least 1 foreign-born non-citizen, that are likely to disenroll from \nor forego enrollment in public benefits programs due to the provisions of the final rule.

State plaintiffs appeared through their \n3  counsel, Julia Mass and Anna Rich, and organization plaintiffs appears through their \n4  counsel, Mayra Joachin, Nicholas Espiritu, Tanya Broder, and Alvaro Harris.  Defendants \n5  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), Department of Homeland Security \n6  (“DHS” or the “Agency”), President Donald J. Trump, Chad Wolf,2 as Acting Secretary of \n7  DHS, and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS appeared through their \n8  counsel, Joshua Kolsky.  Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully \n9  considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, \n10  the court hereby rules as follows. \n11  BACKGROUND \n  12  On August 16, 2019, the State plaintiffs filed a complaint (“Compl.”) to enjoin \n a\ntruin\noro 13  enactment of regulations promulgated by DHS entitled Inadmissibility on Public Charge \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Grounds (the “Public Charge Rule” or “Rule”), 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019).  The \niD tc 15  Agency published the final rule in the Federal Register on August 14, 2019 with an \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  effective date of October 15, 2019.  Id. at 41,292.  State plaintiffs’ complaint asserts six \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  causes of action:  (1) Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  § 706—Contrary to Law, the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) and the Illegal \nN\n19  Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”); (2) Violation of APA, 5 \n20  U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; (3) Violation of \n21  APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, State Healthcare Discretion; (4) Violation of APA, \n22  5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; (5) Violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due \n23 \n \n24 \n1 Plaintiffs the City and County of San Francisco and County of Santa Clara (the “County \nplaintiffs”) in the related case City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and \n25 \nImmigration Services, No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, have not filed a motion to compel and have \nnot joined in either the State plaintiffs or organization plaintiffs’ motions. \n26 \n2 This action was originally brought against Kevin McAleenan in his official capacity as \nActing Secretary of Homeland Security.  Compl. ¶ 27.  As of November 13, 2019, Chad \n27 \nWolf is the acting secretary of DHS (see https://www.dhs.gov/person/chad-f-wolf) and, \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), an officer’s successor is automatically \n28 \nsubstituted as a party. \n2 \n\n \n1  Process clause requiring Equal Protection based on race; (6) Violation of the Fifth \n2  Amendment’s Due Process clause, based on a violation of Equal Protection principles \n3  based on unconstitutional animus.  Dkt. 1.3  The organization plaintiffs’ complaint, also \n4  filed August 16, 2019, asserts four causes of action:  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n5  § 706—Contrary to the Statutory Scheme; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—\n6  Arbitrary, Capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (3) Violation of the Fifth \n7  Amendment based on Equal Protection for discriminating against non-white immigrants; \n8  (4) under the Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking a determination that the Rule is invalid \n9  because it was issued by an unlawfully-appointed agency director.  No. 19-cv-04980-\n10  PJH, Dkt. 1. \n11  On August 26, 2019, plaintiffs (including the County plaintiffs) filed motions for \n  12  preliminary injunction (Dkt. 17), for which the court heard argument on October 2, 2019, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (Dkt. 109).  On October 11, 2019, the court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  defendants from applying the Rule to any person residing in the City and County of San \niD tc 15  Francisco, Santa Clara County, the States of California, Oregon, or Maine, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the District of Columbia.  Dkt. 120, at 92.  The court \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  also denied the organization plaintiffs’ motion on the basis that they do not fall within the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  challenged statute’s zone of interest such that they do not have prudential standing to \nN\n19  bring an APA claim.  Id. at 72, 92.  The court did not rule on plaintiffs’ constitutional \n20  claims as it was not within the scope of plaintiffs’ motion.  Id. at 12 n.5. \n21  Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction on October 30, 2019.  Dkt. 129.  A \n22  three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunctions issued within this \n23  circuit on December 5, 2019.4  Dkt. 141; see City & Cty. of San Francisco v. USCIS, 944 \n24 \n \n25 \n3 Unless otherwise specified, references to the docket are to State of California v. U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Case No. 19-cv-04975-PJH. \n26 \n4 The panel consolidated the three related cases before this court with a similar case from \nthe Eastern District of Washington.  That court issued a nationwide injunction of the Rule \n27 \non the same day as this court’s geographically limited preliminary injunction order.  \nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1224 (E.D. \n28 \nWash. 2019). \n3 \n\n \n1  F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2019).  Two district courts outside the Ninth Circuit also enjoined \n2  implementation of the Rule—a nationwide injunction and an injunction limited to the State \n3  of Illinois.  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 408 F. Supp. 3d 334 (S.D.N.Y. \n4  2019); Cook Cty., Illinois v. McAleenan, 417 F. Supp. 3d 1008 (N.D. Ill. 2019).  On \n5  January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court granted the federal government’s application for a \n6  stay pending appeal of the nationwide injunction of the Public Charge Rule issued by the \n7  District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Dep’t of Homeland Security v. New \n8  York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020).  On February 18, 2020, the Ninth Circuit panel voted to deny \n9  plaintiffs-appellees’ motions for reconsideration and motions for rehearing en banc.  Dkt. \n10  153.  Finally, on February 21, 2020, the Supreme Court granted an application from the \n11  federal government for a stay of the injunction issued by the District Court for the \n  12  Northern District of Illinois.  Wolf v. Cook Cty., Illinois, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  As relevant to the current motions, on November 25, 2019, defendants served the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  administrative record on plaintiffs via an online portal.  After several attempts to meet and \niD tc 15  confer to resolve their differences concerning the administrative record, plaintiffs contend \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  the record remains incomplete, resulting in the current motions.  They also seek \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  discovery on their constitutional claims. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  DISCUSSION \nN\n19  A.  Legal Standard \n20  The APA provides that a court’s arbitrary and capricious review shall be based on \n21  “the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party.”  5 U.S.C. § 706.  The whole \n22  administrative record “includes everything that was before the agency pertaining to the \n23  merits of its decision.”  Portland Audubon Soc’y v. Endangered Species Comm., 984 F.2d \n24  1534, 1548 (9th Cir. 1993).  Further, the whole record “consists of all documents and \n25  materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and includes \n26  evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d \n27  551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing Exxon Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 91 F.R.D. 26, 33 \n28  (N.D. Tex. 1981)).   \n4 \n\n \n1  The administrative record submitted by the federal government is entitled to a \n2  presumption of completeness, which is rebutted by clear evidence.  Id.  A court may only \n3  consider extra-record materials in the following circumstances:  “(1) if necessary to \n4  determine ‘whether the agency has considered all relevant factors and has explained its \n5  decision,’ (2) ‘when the agency has relied on documents not in the record,’ or (3) ‘when \n6  supplementing the record is necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject \n7  matter.’”  Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv., 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th \n8  Cir. 1996) (quoting Inland Empire Public Lands Council v. Glickman, 88 F.3d 697, 703–\n9  04 (9th Cir. 1996)).  The Ninth Circuit also permits extra-record documents when a \n10  plaintiff demonstrates bad faith by the agency.  Id. (citing Nat’l Audubon Soc. v. U.S. \n11  Forest Serv., 46 F.3d 1437, 1447 n.9 (9th Cir. 1993)).  These exceptions are narrowly \n  12  construed and applied.  Lands Council v. Powell, 395 F.3d 1019, 1030 (9th Cir. 2005) \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (citations omitted). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  B.  Analysis \niD tc 15  1.  Motions to Complete the Administrative Record \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Generally, plaintiffs identify the following categories of missing documents for \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  which they seek the court to order defendants to produce as part of the administrative \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  record:  (a) complete, unredacted copies of all policies, procedures, forms and guidance \nN\n19  related to the application of the public charge ground of inadmissibility or any other \n20  aspect of the Rule or previous drafts of the Rule; (b) the USCIS article, “Public Charge \n21  Provisions of Immigration Law: A Brief Historical Background,” dated August 14, 2019, \n22  and all data the article references, including Immigration and Naturalization Service, \n23  DHS, and Department of State consular processing statistics related to public charge \n24  determinations; (c) inter- and intra-agency communications and Agency communications \n25  with outside organizations related to the Rule, including records related to the Agency’s \n26  development of forms related to public charge determinations and estimates regarding \n27  the burdensomeness of forms; (d) White House communications to the Agency related to \n28 \n5 \n\n \n1  the Rule; and (e) missing comments from the public.5  The court addresses each \n2  category in turn. \n3  a.  Policy and Guidance Documents \n4  Plaintiffs argue that defendants did not provide policies, procedures, forms and \n5  guidance that were considered either directly or indirectly by the Agency during the \n6  rulemaking process, but not included in the record.  Mtn. at 5.  Alternatively, plaintiffs \n7  contend that these policies are relevant background information.  Defendants respond \n8  that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the policies in question were considered by the \n9  relevant decision-maker.  Opp. at 5–6.  Defendants also contend that adding document \n10  as background material is only appropriate for explanation or clarification of technical \n11  terms or subject matter.  Id. at 7.   \n  12  As an initial matter, defendants have agreed to produce a few policy documents as \n a\ntruin\noro 13  part of the record and some of plaintiffs’ requests are now moot.  In their motion, plaintiffs \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  seek inclusion of portions of the USCIS’s Adjudicator’s Field Manual (“AFM”) and \niD tc 15  Volumes 7 and 8 of the USCIS Policy Manual (the “Policy Manual”).  Mtn. at 5–6.  In their \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  opposition, defendants agree to add the full version of the following portions of the Policy \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Manual: Volume 7, Part B and Volume 8, Part B, Chapter 3.  Opp. at 7.  Defendants also \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  agree to add Chapter 10.8 of the AFM.  Finally, defendants agree to add internal versions \nN\n19  of those sections of the USCIS Policy Manual and the AFM that they have already \n20  provided for the record, with the exception of Volume 8, Part B, Chapter 3 of the Policy \n21  Manual because the Rule cited the public version of the document.  Id. \n22 \n \n23 \n5 Plaintiffs also identified two additional categories of missing materials:  (i) information \nand data related to legal permanent residents who may undergo a public charge \n24 \ninadmissibility determination upon return from trips abroad and (ii) correct, \ncontemporaneous copies of websites included in the record.  Mtn. at 3.  In a footnote, \n25 \nplaintiffs explain that, with respect to data on legal permanent residents, defendants \ninformed them that such data was not before the Agency during the decision-making \n26 \nprocess.  Id. at 4 n.1.  Plaintiffs also state that they are not moving for corrected copies of \nwebpages referenced in the Rule but reserve the right to do so.  Id. at 4 n.2.  Because \n27 \nplaintiffs do not specify these categories in any further detail and do not advance an \nargument as to why these categories should be included in the administrative record, the \n28 \ncourt does not address these issues. \n6 \n\n \n1  Despite these concessions, plaintiffs respond that there are other portions of the \n2  policy manual to which they still require access.  Specifically, they seek:  USCIS Policy \n3  Manual Vol. 2, Part A, chapter 42; USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 7, Part A, chapters 1, 4, 5, \n4  6, and 10; USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 7, Part R; USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 8, Parts A, G, \n5  and L; the remainder of USCIS Policy Manual Vol. 8, Part B; USCIS Policy Manual Vol. \n6  12, Part D, chapter 2; AFM, chapter 61.2; Chapter 12 of the Deportation Officer’s Field \n7  Manual; Chapter 45 of the Inspector’s Field Manual; and Standard Operating Procedures, \n8  Adjudicative Templates, and Appendices referenced in the above-listed policy documents \n9  and in the policy documents Defendants disclosed on February 12, 2020.  Reply at 5–6. \n10  Plaintiffs contend that the policy manuals should be considered under either the \n11  second or third Inland Empire exceptions, i.e., whether the agency considered \n  12  documents not in the record or whether the policy manuals constitute relevant \n a\ntruin\noro 13  background information.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  i.  Whether the Agency Considered Documents Not in the \niD tc 15  Record \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The second Inland Empire exception applies when an agency relied directly or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  indirectly on documents not in the record.  To meet this exception, the moving party must \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  “identify reasonable, non-speculative grounds for its belief that the documents were \nN\n19  considered by the agency and not included in the record.”  Pac. Shores Subdivision, Cal. \n20  Water Dist. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 448 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2006) (citation \n21  omitted).  The moving party “must do more than imply that the documents at issue were \n22  in the agency’s possession.”  Safari Club Int’l v. Jewell, No. CV-16094-TUC-JGZ, 2016 \n23  WL 7785452, at *2 (D. Ariz. July 7, 2016) (citing Sara Lee Corp. v. Am. Bakers Ass’n, \n24  252 F.R.D. 31, 34 (D.D.C. 2008)).  The question is whether plaintiffs have demonstrated \n25  that the document in question “‘was so heavily relied on in the recommendations [of \n26  subordinates] that the decision maker constructively considered it’ . . . even if there is no \n27  evidence that the decision maker read the [document].”  Sharks Sports & Entm’t LLC v. \n28  Fed. Transit Admin., No. 18-cv-04060-LHK, 2020 WL 511998, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, \n7 \n\n \n1  2020 (first alteration in original) (quoting Wildearth Guardians v. U.S. Forest Serv., 713 F. \n2  Supp. 2d 1243, 1256 (D. Colo. 2010)).   \n3  Plaintiffs argue that the Agency relied on knowledge of its policies in order to draft \n4  the Rule and that even materials that were indirectly considered should be included in the \n5  record.  Mtn. at 6.  Defendants contend that they should not be required to produce \n6  policies that are related to the general subject matter of the Rule and in the Agency’s \n7  possession but were not considered by the Agency’s decision-makers.  Opp. at 5.   \n8  After reviewing the Rule and the Cisneros Declaration, the court finds that plaintiffs \n9  have not carried their burden to demonstrate that the policy documents were “so heavily \n10  relied on” by the agency’s decision makers.  Plaintiffs attempt to draw comparisons \n11  between excerpts from the Rule and a corresponding policy manual section or chapter \n  12  that implicates, at a high level, the same topic as the excerpt.  For example, the Rule \n a\ntruin\noro 13  states that the Agency “reject[s] the assertion that the rule shifts emphasis away from the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  affidavit of support.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,439.  Plaintiffs contend that this sentence \niD tc 15  implicates Volume 7, Part A, which covers adjustment of status policies and procedures, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  including affidavits of support.  Cisneros Decl. ¶ 27.  As a second example, the Rule \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  states that it applies to legal permanent residents returning from a trip abroad that has \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  lasted for more than sixth months.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,326.  Plaintiffs argue this \nN\n19  reference implicates Volume 7, Part R, which addresses legal permanent residents who \n20  have been abroad for an extended period of time.  Cisneros Decl. ¶ 37.  As a final \n21  example, the introduction to the Rule creates a new public charge bond process.  84 Fed. \n22  Reg. at 41,295 (“This rule also revises DHS regulations governing the discretion . . . to \n23  accept a public charge bond . . . .:).  Plaintiffs suggest that this reference to the public \n24  charge bond process implicates AFM, chapter 61, as well as chapters cross-referenced \n25  in chapter 61, all of which deal with public charge bonds.  Cisneros Decl. ¶ 62. \n26  The inquiry here is necessarily one of degree.  On one end of the spectrum are \n27  documents that were not explicitly cited in the Rule but were so heavily relied on in the \n28  Rule that the underlying document was constructively considered by the decision maker.  \n8 \n\n \n1  On the other end of the spectrum are documents that the Agency has in its possession \n2  but were not heavily relied upon or considered in the Rule.  The excerpts and references \n3  cited by plaintiffs are not indicative of documents upon which a decision maker heavily \n4  relied.  Rather, the topics expressed in the excerpts and references are stated at a high \n5  level of generality such that comparing those excerpts and references to equally high-\n6  level policy manuals does not demonstrate the manuals were heavily relied upon. \n7  Plaintiffs also contend that the policies are relevant to understanding the scope \n8  and impact of the Rule’s policy changes.  Mtn. at 6.  In the supplemental Cisneros \n9  Declaration, plaintiffs explain that on February 5, 2020, USCIS issued a “Policy Alert,” \n10  which announced USCIS’s changes to portions of its Policy Manual to implement the \n11  Rule.  Dkt. 152-1, ¶ 31.  According to plaintiffs, they evaluated the new versions of \n  12  Volume 7, Part A, chapters 4 and 6 of the Policy Manual against the prior version of the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  policy manuals and determined that USCIS and DHS changed the policy manuals as a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  result of the Rule.  Plaintiffs renew their request to add the prior versions of the policy \niD tc 15  manuals in order to evaluate whether defendants’ stated basis for departing from these \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  policies is sufficient as a matter of law.  Reply at 3. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  While it is permissible for plaintiffs to argue that defendants have departed from \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  prior policies without reasonable explanation (see, e.g., Fed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Fox \nN\n19  Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)), they have not demonstrated that the \n20  policy manuals are the appropriate prior policies by which to evaluate whether the Rule \n21  departed from those prior policies.  Generally, the “prior policies” in question are not the \n22  policy manuals, but the prior public charge regulations.  Thus, this case is distinguishable \n23  from Grace v. Whittaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 113 (D.D.C. 2018), where the district court \n24  permitted the plaintiffs to submit “government training manuals, memoranda, and a \n25  governmental brief” as extra-record evidence.  This evidence of past policies was directly \n26  relevant to whether an Attorney General’s opinion and interim guidance implementing the \n27  opinion departed from past policies.  Here, because plaintiffs do not demonstrate that the \n28  Agency directly or indirectly relied on the policy manuals, they have not demonstrated \n9 \n\n \n1  that those policies are the relevant past policies that the court should consider. \n2  To reiterate a critical point, plaintiffs have the burden to rebut, with “clear \n3  evidence,” the presumption of completeness and, further, the exception is narrowly \n4  construed and applied.  Lands Council, 395 F.3d at 1030.  Several decades ago, in \n5  Action for Children’s Television v. FCC, 564 F.2d 458, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1977), the D.C. \n6  Circuit discussed whether “every informational input that may have entered into the \n7  decisionmaker’s deliberative process” should be produced in the administrative record.  \n8  The court opined  \n \n9  why not go further to require the decisionmaker to summarize \nand make available for public comment every status inquiry \n10  from  a  Congressman  or  any  germane  material  say  a \nnewspaper editorial that he or she reads or their evening-hour \n11  ruminations?  In the end, why not administer a lie-detector test \nto ascertain whether the required summary is an accurate and \n a  12  complete one?  The problem is obviously a matter of degree, \ntruin and the appropriate line must be drawn somewhere. \noro 13 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Id. (citation omitted).  Similar considerations are present here; the court must draw a line \niD tc 15  somewhere.  The record does not include “every scrap of paper that could or might have \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  been created” relating to the Rule.  Golden Gate Salmon Ass’n v. Ross, No. 17-cv-01172 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  LJO-EPG, 2018 WL 3129849, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Jun 22, 2018) (quoting TOMAC v. Norton, \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  193 F. Supp. 2d 182, 195 (D.D.C. 2002)).  In sum, plaintiffs have not met their burden to \nN\n19  demonstrate that the Agency relied on documents, here policy manuals, not in the record. \n20  ii.  Whether the Policies Constitute Relevant Background \n21  Information \n22  The third Inland Empire exception applies to policies that may be produced as \n23  relevant background information.  This exception pertains to cases “in which \n24  supplementation of the record through discovery is necessary to permit explanation or \n25  clarification of technical terms or subject matter involving the agency action under \n26  review.”  Public Power Council v. Johnson, 674 F.2d 791, 794 (9th Cir. 1982).  Plaintiffs \n27  contend that the policy manuals are also relevant background materials.  Mtn. at 6.  The \n28  parties disagree whether it is appropriate to consider non-technical, non-scientific \n10 \n\n \n1  background information as extra-record evidence.  Opp. at 7; Reply at 2. \n2  Generally, the appropriate basis to permit background material in the \n3  administrative record is to illuminate and explain technical subject matter.  Thus, the \n4  Ninth Circuit in Love v. Thomas stated that a “court may consider, particularly in highly \n5  technical areas, substantive evidence going to the merits of the agency’s action where \n6  such evidence is necessary as background to determine the sufficiency of the agency’s \n7  consideration.”  858 F.2d 1347, 1356 (9th Cir. 1988) (citing Asarco, Inc. v. U.S. Envtl. \n8  Prot. Agency, 616 F.2d 1153, 1160 (9th Cir. 1980)).  Likewise, in Bunker Hill Co. v. EPA, \n9  572 F.2d 1286, 1292 (9th Cir. 1977), cited by plaintiffs, the background information in that \n10  case dealt with sulfur dioxide emissions.  The court there characterized the background \n11  information as “clarification in dealing with a technical subject with respect to which [the \n  12  court was] not expert[].”  Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, the court permitted such \n a\ntruin\noro 13  background material because “courts are not straightjacketed to the original record in \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  trying to make sense of complex technical testimony.”  Id.; see also San Luis & Delta \niD tc 15  Mendota Water Authority v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 984 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1060 (E.D. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Cal. 2013) (discussing Bunker Hill and other relevant Ninth Circuit case law and \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  concluding that the cases all involve challenges to EPA regulatory actions that involved \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  scientific and technical determinations).   \nN\n19  Plaintiffs also cite Tenneco Oil Co. v. Department of Energy, 475 F. Supp. 299, \n20  317 (D. Del. 1979), where the district court stated that it “strain[ed] the Court’s \n21  imagination to assume that the administrative decision-makers reached their conclusions \n22  without reference to a variety of internal memoranda, guidelines, directives, and manuals, \n23  and without considering how arguments similar to [the plaintiff’s] were evaluated in prior \n24  decisions by the agency.”  The Tenneco Oil court’s reasoning does not support plaintiffs’ \n25  argument that internal policy manuals should be considered for background purposes.  \n26  Rather, this case speaks to the second Inland Empire exception concerning whether the \n27  decision maker directly or indirectly considered a document.  For the reasons explained \n28  above, (supra section B.1.a.i), plaintiffs have not demonstrated a sufficient basis for the \n11 \n\n \n1  court to apply reasoning similar to Tenneco Oil. \n2  Permitting background information is most appropriate when there are technical or \n3  scientific matters without which the court cannot determine whether the Agency \n4  considered all relevant factors.  Asarco, 616 F.2d at 1160.  The Public Charge Rule and \n5  immigration law generally does not deal with a highly technical area such that policy \n6  manuals are needed to inform nonexpert judges.  While there may be extenuating \n7  circumstances where non-technical background material is proper to add to the \n8  administrative record, plaintiffs have not demonstrated by clear evidence that such \n9  information is needed in this case.   \n10  iii.  Materials Related to Development of Forms \n11  In passing, plaintiffs request defendants to produce documents related to the \n  12  development of forms, specifically those related to Form I-944.  Mtn. at 9 n.8.  \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Defendants take the position that they do not need to produce any further documents \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  relating to the forms because the complaint does not raise any claims concerning Agency \niD tc 15  forms or the Paperwork Reduction Act.  Further, it is unclear what additional documents \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  plaintiffs request.  Opp. at 8.  Plaintiffs respond that their general arguments regarding \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the scope and impact of the Rule subsumes their arguments concerning any forms.  \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Reply at 9–10.  They seek inclusion of records related to the development of Form I-944.  \nN\n19  Id. at 10. \n20  Plaintiffs first raised the argument concerning calculations of administrative burden \n21  as part of their motion for preliminary injunction.  Dkt. 17 at 27–29.  They put forward this \n22  argument under the broader thesis that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  Id. at 19.  \n23  While plaintiffs did not list the administrative burden of forms as part of the complaint, \n24  their arbitrary and capricious argument is broad enough to encompass arguments related \n25  to these forms.   \n26  However, the only document that the plaintiffs identify with any particularity is the \n27  supporting statement submitted by DHS to OMB to justify the collection of information for \n28  Form I-944 (assuming such a document exists).  See Reply 9–10; Dkt. 152-1, ¶¶ 57–59.  \n12 \n\n \n1  Accordingly, the appropriate relief must be tailored to plaintiffs’ specific request. If such \n2  document (or documents) constituting a supporting statement for Form I-944 exists, then \n3  defendants must provide that as part of the record.   \n4  For the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motions with respect to \n5  the policies that defendants do not oppose (and have agreed to provide) and the \n6  supporting statement for Form I-944.  The court DENIES plaintiffs’ motions with respect \n7  to those policy manuals that they have requested beyond those policy manuals that \n8  defendants have agreed to provide. \n9  b.  Studies and Data Regarding Inadmissibility Decisions  \n10  Next, plaintiffs request an article titled “Public Charge Provisions of Immigration \n11  Law: A Brief Historical Background,” which was published by the Agency the same day \n  12  as the Rule.  Cisneros Decl. ¶ 67, Ex. 29.  Plaintiffs also ask for studies and data \n a\ntruin\noro 13  regarding inadmissibility decisions on public charge grounds that were referenced in the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  article.  Mtn. at 7.  In their opposition brief, defendants agree to provide the article and the \niD tc 15  materials cited by the article.  Opp. at 8.  They take issue with providing any sources that \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  plaintiffs think were omitted from the article but should have been included.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  After the hearing, the parties filed a joint status report in which they report that \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  defendants have provided the article, sources cited in the article, including excerpts of \nN\n19  books and immigration data cited in the article.  Dkt. 157 at 2.  Plaintiffs state that the \n20  article cites immigration data, but defendants did not produce data for the years 1920–65, \n21  1981–82, 1988, 1990, and 2018.  Defendants respond that USCIS did not consider such \n22  data with respect to the Rule or the article.  Id.  Plaintiffs make a similar request for \n23  Department of State visa approval data for fiscal years 1920–2018.  Id. at 3. \n24  As previously noted, the administrative record “consists of all documents and \n25  materials directly or indirectly considered by agency decision-makers and includes \n26  evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555 (emphasis and \n27  citation omitted).  The statistical data plaintiffs request not only was not cited in the Rule \n28  itself but was not cited in an article published the same day as the Rule.  This line of \n13 \n\n \n1  reasoning is too attenuated to demonstrate by clear evidence that defendants indirectly \n2  considered the requested statistical data when drafting the Rule. \n3  Because defendants do not oppose this request and have already provided much \n4  of the relevant material, the court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motions with respect to the article \n5  and materials directly cited in the article; however, defendants are not required to provide \n6  materials that are not directly cited in the article.  Further, defendants are not required to \n7  produce any book in its entirety unless such book is not publicly available.   \n8  c.  Intra- and Inter-Agency Communications \n9  Plaintiffs request various pre-decisional, deliberative materials including intra- and \n10  inter-agency communications, White House communications or agency communications \n11  with non-government third parties.  Mtn. at 9.  While plaintiffs have identified limited \n  12  material from FOIA requests (primarily relating to U.S. Department of Agriculture \n a\ntruin\noro 13  comments submitted to the Agency pertaining to the Rule), they generally do not put \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  forward a specific list of documents for defendants to provide.  Thus, they also request a \niD tc 15  privilege log in order to determine which communications, if any, should be added to the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  record.  Id. at 11.  For their part, defendants attempt to cut this line of argument off, ex \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ante, by arguing that deliberative communications should not be considered in APA \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  cases.  Opp. at 9.   \nN\n19  i.  Whether the Court Can Consider Any Deliberative \n20  Material \n21  Generally, judicial review under the APA is based on an agency’s stated reasons \n22  and an “inquiry into mental processes of administrative decisionmakers is usually to be \n23  avoided.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971) \n24  (citing United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 (1941)), abrogated on other grounds \n25  by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977).  Yet, there is an inherent tension \n26  between avoiding examination of a decisionmaker’s pre-decisional deliberative \n27  communications and the court’s duty to “consider whether the decision was based on a \n28  consideration of the relevant factors.”  Id. at 417.  As the Ninth Circuit has instructed, the \n14 \n\n \n1  administrative record consists “of all documents and materials directly or indirectly \n2  considered by agency decision-makers.”  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 555–56.   \n3  Reflecting the tension between the deliberative process and reviewing the “whole \n4  record,” district courts in the Ninth Circuit (as well as across the country) are divided over \n5  whether deliberative communications should be permitted at any time to complete the \n6  administrative record.  There is a clear trend in district courts of the Northern District \n7  permitting deliberative communications so long as plaintiffs rebut the presumption of \n8  completeness.  See, e.g., Ctr. for Env’tl Health v. Perdue, No. 18-cv-01763-RS, 2019 WL \n9  6114513, at *2–3 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2019); Sierra Club v. Zinke, No. 17-cv-07187-WHO, \n10  2018 WL 3126401, at *3 (N.D. Cal. June 26, 2018); Desert Survivors v. U.S. Dep’t of the \n11  Interior, 231 F. Supp. 3d 368, 381 (N.D. Cal. 2017); Inst. for Fisheries Res. v. Burwell, \n  12  No. 16-CV-01574-VC, 2017 WL 89003, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2017).   \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Conversely, there are cases in other districts such as ASSE International, Inc. v. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Kerry, No. SACV 14-00534-CJC(JPRx), 2018 WL 3326687, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 3, \niD tc 15  2018), where the court found that “privileged materials are not part of the administrative \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  record in the first instance.”  See also Comprehensive Cmty. Dev. Corp. v. Sebelius, 890 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  F. Supp. 2d 305, 312 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[C]ourts have consistently recognized that, for the \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  purpose of judicial review of agency action, deliberative materials antecedent to the \nN\n19  agency’s decision fall outside the administrative record.”).  There are two reasons cited \n20  for this standard.  First, a court’s APA review must be based on the agency’s stated \n21  reasons for the agency action, absent a showing of bad faith or improper behavior.  In re \n22  Subpoena Duces Tecum Served on Office of Comptroller of Currency, 156 F.3d 1279, \n23  1279 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).  Because a reviewing court should limit its \n24  review the agency’s stated behavior, then courts such as ASSE International interpret \n25  that rule as precluding any review of deliberative materials.  See also Nat’l Ass’n of Chain \n26  Drug Stores v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 631 F. Supp. 2d 23, 27 (D.D.C. \n27  2009) (“[I]nternal deliberative materials are not part of the administrative record.”).  \n28  Second, “excluding deliberative materials ‘prevent[s] injury to the quality of agency \n15 \n\n \n1  decisions’ by encouraging uninhibited and frank discussion of legal and policy matters.”  \n2  Tafas v. Dudas, 530 F. Supp. 2d 786, 794 (E.D. Va. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting \n3  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150–52 (1975)).  \n4  The Ninth Circuit has not directly addressed whether the federal government must \n5  produce a privilege log or whether the government may exclude deliberative documents \n6  from the administrative record altogether in an APA case.  In re United States, 875 F.3d \n7  1200, 1210 (9th Cir.), vacated by 138 S. Ct. 443, 445 (2017) (per curiam).  The Ninth \n8  Circuit indirectly addressed this issue in In re United States, which came before the court \n9  on a writ of mandamus petition filed by the federal government.  Id. at 1204.  In the \n10  mandamus context, the court reviewed for clear error a district court’s order requiring the \n11  government to produce a privilege log with in camera review of deliberative material.  Id. \n  12  at 1210.  The In re United States court cited the several district court opinions requiring a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  privilege log and in camera analysis of deliberative materials in APA cases.  Id. (citing, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  e.g., Ctr. for Food Safety v. Vilsack, No. 15-cv-01590, 2017 WL 1709318, at *5 (N.D. Cal. \niD tc 15  May 3, 2017)).  Because of the absence of controlling precedent and the deliberative \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  materials did not involve the mental processes of individual agency members, the court \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  found that the district court’s order was not clearly erroneous.  Id. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  The Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in part because portions of \nN\n19  the district court’s order were overly broad.  The Court noted that the district court did not \n20  resolve threshold arguments going to whether the agency action was committed to \n21  agency discretion or whether the INA deprived the court of jurisdiction.  In re United \n22  States, 138 S. Ct. at 445.  The Court, therefore, admonished the district court not to \n23  “compel the Government to disclose any document that the Government believes is \n24  privileged without first providing the Government with the opportunity to argue the issue.”  \n25  Id.   \n26  Reading the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit’s opinions together, a court may \n27  order a privilege log and include non-privileged deliberative documents in the record but \n28  only after providing the federal government the opportunity to argue the issue.  See \n16 \n\n \n1  Sierra Club, 2018 WL 3126401, at *3 (noting that the Supreme Court’s decision in In re \n2  United States “require[es] the resolution of facial challenges before addressing the \n3  administrative record”).  Further, such relief is only appropriate after plaintiffs rebut the \n4  presumption of completeness.  S.F. Bay Conservation & Dev. Comm’n v. U.S. Army \n5  Corps of Eng’rs, No. 16-cv-05420-RS, 2018 WL 3846002, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 13, 2018) \n6  (“Decisions from this district have consistently held that parties that intend to withhold \n7  documents based on the deliberative process privilege must produce a privilege log, at \n8  least where the presumption of completeness has been rebutted . . . .”).  In the absence \n9  of controlling Supreme Court or Ninth Circuit law to the contrary, the court is inclined to \n10  compel the inclusion extra-record pre-decisional deliberative documents, but only to the \n11  extent plaintiffs are able to rebut the presumption of completeness.6 \n  12  ii.  Whether Plaintiffs Rebut the Presumption of \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Completeness \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The predicate step before applying the deliberative process privilege is for \niD tc 15  plaintiffs to meet their burden to overcome the presumption of completeness.  See \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  People of State of Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., No. C05-03508 EDL, 2006 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  WL 708914, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 16, 2006) (“Plaintiffs rebutted the presumption of \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  completeness with a strong showing that the Senate Report and the supporting \nN\n19  documents were at a minimum indirectly considered by the Forest Service in its decision-\n20  making process for the [Rule at issue].”).   \n21  Sierra Club v. Zinke is helpful to understand what showing is required to \n22  demonstrate clear evidence in this context.  In Sierra Club, the plaintiffs sought to add to \n23  the administrative record documents produced by the federal government in response to \n24  the plaintiffs’ Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests.  2018 WL 3126401, at *4.  \n25  The court had previously determined that the plaintiffs challenged the rule on the ground \n26 \n \n27 \n6 The court notes that defendants have not advanced a facial challenge to judicial review \nsimilar to the arguments before the Supreme Court, i.e., that the Rule was committed to \n28 \nthe Agency’s discretion or that the INA strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Rule.   \n17 \n\n \n1  that “its stated rationales [were] not legitimate and its justifications [were] inconsistent \n2  with and not supported by the evidentiary record.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The court \n3  examined each FOIA document to determine whether they pertained to the plaintiffs’ \n4  basis to challenge the rule.  The FOIA documents were relevant to whether the rule was \n5  supported by good reasoning and, thus, rebutted the presumption of completeness.  Id.   \n6  Here, as the result of a FOIA request, plaintiffs produce several email \n7  conversations from officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in response \n8  to requests from the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for comments to the \n9  Rule.  Cisneros Decl. ¶ 86.  One email, dated April 12, 2018, indicates that USDA \n10  officials sent OMB officials some comments concerning the Rule, which had been \n11  requested by OMB officials as part of a broader request to federal agencies.  Id. ¶ 87, Ex. \n  12  37.  USDA’s comment was not included in the administrative record, nor were comments \n a\ntruin\noro 13  from other agencies.  See id., Ex. 1.  If OMB requested comments from various agencies \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  for this particular Rule and those agencies then provided those comments, the Agency \niD tc 15  either directly or indirectly considered these comments.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that if USDA submitted comments, then other agencies did so as well.  This situation is \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  similar to Sierra Club, where plaintiffs used the FOIA process to identify potential \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  documents not in the administrative record and the court determined that the documents \nN\n19  identified through FOIA rebutted the presumption of completeness. \n20  iii.  The Remedy to Which Plaintiffs Are Entitled \n21  While the court has determined that plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of \n22  completeness, this is not license for a broad mandate to sweep in any and every \n23  document, email, or memoranda that is conceivably related to the Rule.  The court’s \n24  finding is limited to the category of documents that plaintiffs were able to present clear \n25  evidence to rebut the presumption, i.e., inter-agency communications providing \n26  comments to DHS, and in DHS’s possession, concerning the Rule.  The district court in \n27  Golden Gate Salmon Association v. Ross, 2018 WL 3129849, at *4, aptly summarized \n28  the appropriate relief: \n18 \n\n \n \n1  Plaintiffs assert that the presumption is “lost” when a plaintiff \nidentifies  wrongly  omitted  materials  with  specificity,  and \n2  provides  reasonable  grounds  for  the  belief  that  those \ndocuments were considered by the agency.  This is true as to \n3  the  wrongly  omitted  materials,  but  to  the  extent  Plaintiffs \nsuggest that rebutting the presumption as to one document (or \n4  even an entire category of materials) changes how the Court \nmust review other materials . . . the Court does not agree. \n5 \n6  Other courts have taken a similar category-by-category or document-by-document \n7  approach to reviewing whether documents rebut the presumption of completeness.  See, \n8  e.g., Sharks Sports & Entm’t LLC v. Fed. Transit Admin., 2020 WL 511998, at *3; \n9  California v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., No. 18-cv-00521-HSG, 2019 WL 1455335, at*3 (N.D. \n10  Cal. Apr. 2, 2019); Sierra Club, 2018 WL 3126401, at *4, Desert Survivors, 231 F. Supp. \n11  3d at 372.  Because plaintiffs have only rebutted the presumption of completeness with \n  12  respect to inter-agency communications received by DHS relating to the Rule, the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  appropriate relief is to complete the record only with respect to those types of documents.  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Defendants contend that the deliberative process privilege shields from public \niD tc 15  disclosure confidential inter-agency memoranda on matters of law or policy.  Opp. at 16.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The question before the court is not whether the deliberative process privilege applies, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  but whether plaintiffs have rebutted the presumption of completeness with clear \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  evidence.  The cases cited by defendants stand for the proposition that the deliberative \nN\n19  process privilege can be asserted by the government in the context of inter-agency \n20  documents.  In National Wildlife Federation v. U.S. Forest Service, 861 F.2d 1114, 1116 \n21  (9th Cir. 1988), the Ninth Circuit noted, in the context of a FOIA exemption review, that \n22  the “‘deliberative process’ privilege . . . shields from public disclosure confidential inter-\n23  agency memoranda on matters of law or policy.”  However, the ultimate issue was \n24  whether the district court erred in determining whether certain documents, after an in \n25  camera review, should be released.  Similarly, Hunton & Williams LLP v. U.S. \n26  Environmental Protection Agency, 248 F. Supp. 3d 220, 247 (D.D.C. 2017), the district \n27  court, also while reviewing a FOIA exemption request, noted that the deliberative process \n28  privilege can apply between two agencies.  Whether the privilege can or does apply to \n19 \n\n \n1  any particular document are properly considered when the government produces the \n2  document and claims the privilege. \n3  Finally, the court notes that there are certain types of communications that are not \n4  appropriate to consider, even if they fall within the category of documents that defendants \n5  must produce.  The Ninth Circuit has held that it would not be permissible for the court to \n6  consider “the internal deliberative processes of the agency [or] the mental processes of \n7  individual agency members.”  Portland Audubon Soc., 984 F.2d at 1549; see also \n8  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 420 (1971) (“[S]uch \n9  inquiry into the mental processes of administrative decisionmakers is usually to be \n10  avoided.” (citation omitted)).  Thus, while it would be appropriate for defendants to \n11  provide items such as studies, data, and official memoranda, it would not be appropriate \n  12  to include communications codifying the internal deliberative processes of individual \n a\ntruin\noro 13  agency members.  See In re United States, 875 F.3d at 1210 (“Where . . . an agency is \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  headed by a multi-member board, the deliberations among those members are \niD tc 15  analogous to the internal mental processes of the sole head of an agency, and thus are \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  generally not within the scope of the administrative record.” (citing Portland Audubon, 984 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  F.2d at 1549)).  Thus, defendants are not required to submit the deliberative \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  communications of individual agency members.  This limiting instruction reduces the \nN\n19  burden on defendants while also recognizing plaintiffs have met their burden in a specific \n20  category of documents. \n21  For the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motions to complete the \n22  record with regard to inter-agency communications submitted to DHS and under DHS’s \n23  control, relating to the Rule, and not involving the mental processes of individual agency \n24  members. \n25  d.  White House Communications \n26  Defendants take issue with disclosing any communications related to the White \n27  House.  Opp. at 14.  They contend that White House communications raise “special \n28  considerations” due to the “Executive Branch’s interest in maintaining the autonomy of its \n20 \n\n \n1  office.”  Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 385.  Plaintiffs \n2  reply that Cheney does not apply because they do not request discovery against the \n3  President or Vice President.  Reply at 11 n.12. \n4  As an initial matter, it is not clear the extent to which White House communications \n5  is an issue requiring the court’s adjudication.  Plaintiffs have not directed the court to any \n6  specific White House communications that rebut the presumption of completeness.  It is \n7  conceivable, however, that the court’s finding regarding inter-agency communications \n8  could include communications from White House staff to DHS.  For this narrow category \n9  of documents, the court examines whether defendants must produce any White House \n10  communications that meet the relief outlined above. \n11  The parties cite Cheney v. U.S. District Court as the leading case on this question.  \n  12  Cheney involved whether a court of appeals could exercise the writ of mandamus to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  modify or dissolve discovery orders directing the Vice President and other senior \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Executive Branch officials to produce information about a task force.  542 U.S. at 372.  \niD tc 15  The Supreme Court cited long-standing separation-of-powers considerations why such a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  mandamus petition involving the President or Vice President would be treated differently \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  than other individuals.  See id. at 381–82.  The Court noted that the discovery order was \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  directed to the “Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the \nN\n19  [panel] to give advice and make recommendations to the President.”  Id. at 385.  The \n20  Court then stated that it has held on more than one occasion that, “[t]he high respect that \n21  is owed to the office of the Chief Executive . . . is a matter that should inform the conduct \n22  of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scope of discovery.”  Id. (alterations in \n23  original) (quoting Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 707 (1997)).   \n24  Thus, some deference in this area is certainly owed to the office of the Chief \n25  Executive.  Yet, several mitigating considerations are also relevant.  First, Cheney’s \n26  separation-of-power considerations were largely motivated by the inclusion of the Vice \n27  President in the discovery order.  Id. at 382 (“These separation-of-powers considerations \n28  should inform a court of appeals’ evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the \n21 \n\n \n1  President or Vice President.”).  That consideration is not present here.  Additionally, \n2  Cheney did not involve the APA’s requirements to provide a complete administrative \n3  record and, though the opinion was vacated on other grounds, In re United States \n4  interpreted Cheney as not “imposing a categorical bar against requiring DHS to either \n5  include White House documents in a properly-defined administrative record or assert \n6  privilege individually as to those documents.”  875 F.3d at 1209.  The final consideration \n7  is that the remedy identified by the court is not to order the White House to produce \n8  documents; rather, it is to order DHS to produce any communications meeting the court’s \n9  criteria that DHS has in its possession.  This solution is in accord with the Ninth Circuit’s \n10  dicta in In re United States finding no clear error for a district court to require DHS to \n11  produce White House documents considered by the DHS Secretary.  Id.  For the \n  12  foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS plaintiffs’ motions with respect to any White House \n a\ntruin\noro 13  communications in DHS’s possession and meeting the court’s criteria discussed above, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  supra, section B.1.c.  \niD tc 15  e.  Missing Comments from the Public \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In their reply brief, plaintiffs discuss the parties’ inability to resolve a discrepancy \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  between the number of public comments submitted during the rulemaking process and \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  the number of comments produced in the administrative record.  Reply at 6.  The \nN\n19  government’s website for comments, Regulations.gov, states that over 260,000 \n20  comments were submitted, but the administrative record includes only 213,959 separate \n21  documents.  Id.  Plaintiffs ask the court to order defendants to provide accurate \n22  accounting of the discrepancy.  Defendants state in their opposition brief; “[t]he parties \n23  are continuing to confer about public comments included in the administrative record to \n24  ensure that all 266,077 public comments are included.”  Opp. at 3 n.2.  At the hearing, \n25  defendants acknowledged the requirement to account for all comments and explained \n26  that multiple comments may be included in one document. \n27  Because defendants do not oppose this request, the court GRANTS plaintiffs’ \n28  motions with regard to the public comments.  Defendants are to account for any \n22 \n\n \n1  discrepancies between the comments submitted on the government’s website and those \n2  provided in the administrative record. \n3  2.  Discovery on Constitutional Claims \n4  Plaintiffs request discovery on their constitutional claims.  They contend that \n5  constitutional claims are reviewed independently of APA claims and, therefore, some civil \n6  discovery is appropriate.  Mtn. at 15.  Defendants argue that constitutional claims are \n7  subject to the terms and limitations of the APA and plaintiffs are entitled to nothing more \n8  than the administrative record.  Opp. at 16.   \n9  a.  Whether the APA Governs Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claims \n10  In addressing whether the APA governs plaintiffs’ discovery request, the court \n11  considers two predicate questions.  First, may plaintiffs bring an equitable cause of action \n  12  for violation of the Constitution against any agency action?  Second, if they have a cause \n a\ntruin\noro 13  of action for a constitutional claim, is that claim necessarily governed by the APA?  The \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d 670 (9th Cir. 2019), is controlling \niD tc 15  on both questions.  Sierra Club dealt with a challenge to the Department of Defense’s \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  use of funds that the President repurposed by proclamation to construct a border wall on \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the southern border of the United States.  Id. at 677–83.  The plaintiffs brought both a \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  constitutional claim, alleging a violation of the Appropriations Clause, and an APA claim.  \nN\n19  The federal government argued that the plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for either \n20  claim.  The court examined whether the plaintiffs could bring “an equitable action to \n21  enjoin unconstitutional official conduct, or under the judicial review provisions of the . . . \n22  APA, as a challenge to a final agency decision that is alleged to violate the Constitution, \n23  or both.”  Id. at 694 (citation omitted).  \n24  First, the court determined whether the plaintiffs could assert an equitable cause of \n25  action against federal officers for violations of the Appropriations Clause.  Beginning with \n26  the constitutional claim, the court recognized that “‘federal courts may in some \n27  circumstances grant injunctive relief against’ federal officials violating federal law.”  Id. at \n28  694 (quoting Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326 (2015)).  \n23 \n\n \n1  However, the court noted that Congress may revoke a federal court’s ability to enjoin \n2  federal officials where a statutory provision expressly provides a method of enforcing a \n3  substantive right or lacked a judicially administrable standard.  Id. (citing Armstrong, 575 \n4  U.S. at 328).  Barring clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent, the judicial \n5  review of administrative action is the rule.  See City of Chicago v. Int’l Coll. of Surgeons, \n6  522 U.S. 156, 183 (1997) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. \n7  99, 106–06 (1977)).  In Sierra Club, the court applied this rule to determine that Congress \n8  had not intended to foreclose equitable relief for violations of the Appropriations Clause.  \n9  929 F.3d at 697. \n10  Second, the court reviewed whether the plaintiffs had an APA cause of action, \n11  stating that 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) permits a federal court to “hold unlawful and set aside \n  12  agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \n a\ntruin\noro 13  immunity.  Id. at 698.  The court held that the plaintiffs could assert a cause of action \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  under the APA so long as Congress had not limited review through other statutes or \niD tc 15  committed the administrative decision to agency discretion.  Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  §§ 701(a), 704, 706; and Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175 (1997)).  Neither applied to \nt\nS \nn\n dere 17  the Sierra Club plaintiffs and they could bring a challenge under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Third, the Sierra Club court then dealt with the issue whether “the availability of an \nN\n19  APA cause of action precludes Plaintiffs’ equitable claim.”  Id. at 699.  The court noted \n20  that there is a basic presumption that APA provides for judicial review of agency action, \n21  but “this does not mean the APA forecloses other causes of action.”  Id. (citing \n22  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 139 S. Ct. 361, 370 (2018)).  In Navajo \n23  Nation, 876 F.3d at 1170 (citation omitted), the Ninth Circuit explained that “a court is \n24  foreclosed by [APA section] 704 from entertaining claims brought under the APA seeking \n25  review of non-final agency action (and not otherwise permitted by law),” but “no such \n26  limitation applies to other types of claims (like constitutional claims . . . ).’”  In \n27  Presbyterian Church v. United States, allowed constitutional claims to proceed without \n28  even deciding whether an APA cause of action was available.  Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at \n24 \n\n \n1  699 (citing Presbyterian Church, 870 F.2d 518 (9th Cir. 1989)).  Considering these two \n2  cases together, Sierra Club held that Navajo Nation and Presbyterian Church “clearly \n3  contemplate that claims challenging agency actions—particularly constitutional claims—\n4  may exist wholly apart from the APA.”  Id.  One other district court in this circuit has cited \n5  Sierra Club’s holding and then concluded that review of the plaintiffs’ “constitutional \n6  claims, independently of their APA claims, is appropriate.”  Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. \n7  McAleenan, 394 F. Supp. 3d 1168, 1217 (S.D. Cal. 2019). \n8  Applying Sierra Club here, to determine whether plaintiffs have a cause of action, \n9  the court examines whether Congress intended to displace an equitable constitutional \n10  claim against an agency action.  Plaintiffs bring causes of action for violations of the Due \n11  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which the Supreme Court has interpreted to \n  12  prohibit the federal government from denying equal protection of the laws.  Bolling v. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 500 (1954).  In Davis v. Passman, the Supreme Court explained \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  that    \niD s tcir 15  “it is established practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdiction \net of  federal  courts  to  issue  injunctions  to  protect  rights \ns\ntaiD 16  safeguarded by the Constitution and to restrain individual state \nt\nS \nn officers from doing what the 14th Amendment forbids the State \n dere 17  to do.”  Indeed, this Court has already settled that a cause of \nh\nt\nintr action  may  be  implied  directly  under  the  equal  protection \nUoN 18  component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment \nin favor of those who seek to enforce this constitutional right.   \n19 \n20  442 U.S. 228, 242 (1979) (citations omitted).  Thus, an equitable cause of action exists \n21  for equal protection violations of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.   \n22  This final agency action is not committed to DHS’s discretion and plaintiffs may \n23  also bring a cause of action under the APA against agency actions that are contrary to \n24  constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).  Because \n25  plaintiffs may bring either an equitable cause of action or an APA claim, Sierra Club’s \n26  holding controls whether the cause of action is necessarily governed by the APA.  \n27  Plaintiffs’ claim “may exist wholly apart from the APA.”  929 F.3d at 699.  It follows, \n28  therefore, that if plaintiffs have a constitutional claim that exists outside of the APA, then \n25 \n\n \n1  the APA’s administrative record requirement does not govern the availability of discovery. \n2  b.  District Courts Decline to Draw a Bright Line Rule \n3  Defendants cite several cases for the proposition that courts routinely reject \n4  attempts by plaintiffs to obtain discovery for constitutional claims against the government.  \n5  In reality, district courts have struggled to coalesce around a categorical rule and instead \n6  apply a fact-specific inquiry to reach outcomes that have rejected discovery for \n7  constitutional claims in some instances and permitted discovery in others.  Further, the \n8  cases cited by defendants presumed that the APA governed and did not have the benefit \n9  of controlling circuit law on the issue of whether a constitutional claim may be brought \n10  independent of the APA.   \n11  There are few appellate cases discussing this issue.  In Harkness v. Secretary of \n  12  Navy, 858 F.3d 437, 451 & n.9 (6th Cir. 2017), the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument that \n a\ntruin\noro 13  discovery was necessary because constitutional issues could not be decided on the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  administrative record for two reasons.  First, the court noted that 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B) \niD tc 15  permits review of constitutional claims under the APA using the administrative record.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Second, the plaintiff’s Establishment Clause claim was not a standalone claim because \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  10 U.S.C. § 14502 provided a particular mechanism to challenge constitutional error in \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  promotion boards.  Id. at 446 n.6.  Harkness does not require a different outcome than \nN\n19  Sierra Club; both cases examined whether the plaintiff(s) could bring a standalone \n20  constitutional claim.  The statutory scheme in Harkness precluded an Establishment \n21  Clause claim; the Appropriations Clause permitted a standalone challenge in Sierra Club. \n22  Several district courts have determined that constitutional claims are governed by \n23  the APA and, therefore, constitutional claims should be decided on the administrative \n24  record without further discovery.  See, e.g., Bellion Spirits, LLC v. United States, 335 F. \n25  Supp. 3d 32, 43 (D.D.C. 2018); Chiayu Chang v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., \n26  254 F. Supp. 3d 160, 161 (D.D.C. 2017) (collecting cases).  Those cases have noted the \n27  lack of applicable circuit law.  For example, in Northern Arapaho Tribe v. Ashe, 92 F. \n28  Supp. 3d 1160, 1171 (D. Wyo. 2015), the district court noted that “[w]hether a district \n26 \n\n \n1  court must limit its constitutional review of agency action to the administrative record is [a] \n2  question that has not been definitively answered by the Tenth Circuit or the Supreme \n3  Court.”   \n4  On the other hand, several courts recognize that discovery may be appropriate for \n5  a constitutional claim involving agency action.  Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. \n6  Trump, —F. Supp. 3d—, No. CV ELH-18-3636, 2019 WL 6970631, at *7 (D. Md. Dec. 19, \n7  2019) (collecting cases); New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 345 F. Supp. 3d 444, \n8  451–52 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Grill v. Quinn, No. 10-cv-0757 GEB GGH PS, 2013 WL \n9  3146803, at *6 n.8 (E.D. Cal. June 18, 2013).  As the district court in Baltimore pointed \n10  out, cases permitting discovery on constitutional claims are in accord “with the \n11  foundational tenet of constitutional adjudication that ‘where constitutional rights are in \n  12  issue,’ courts must ensure that ‘the controlling legal principles [are] applied to the actual \n a\ntruin\noro 13  facts of the case.’”  2019 WL 6970631, at *7 (alteration in original) (quoting Pickering v. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Bd. of Ed. of Twp. of High Sch. Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U.S. 563, 578 n.2 (1968) \niD tc 15  (Douglas, J., concurring)). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The broad spectrum of opinions demonstrates a tension and broad disagreement \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  in the reasoning and outcomes in these types of cases.  This is exacerbated by the lack \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  of controlling authority and usually results in a case-by-case approach to discovery.  Most \nN\n19  courts decline to draw a bright line or categorical rule and instead examine the particular \n20  facts of the claims involved and the discovery requested.  See, e.g., Almaklani v. Trump, \n21  —F. Supp. 3d—, No. 18-CV-398 (NGG) (CLP), 2020 WL 1282920, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. \n22  17, 2020) (agreeing “that there may be circumstances in which discovery to supplement \n23  the record may be necessary,” but declining to permit “broad ranging discovery under \n24  Rule 26”); Jiahao Kuang v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., No. 8-cv-03698-JST, 2019 WL 293379, at \n25  *2 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2019) (“[T]he welter of cases underlines the need for a flexible \n26  approach, tailored to the facts and claims of the case.”); Bellion Spirits, 335 F. Supp. 3d \n27  at 43 (“Given the dearth of caselaw on point in this circuit, the Court declines to adopt any \n28  bright line or categorical rule.”).  Given the lack of controlling authority, this approach is \n27 \n\n \n1  sensible and appropriately focuses on the facts and claims of individual cases. \n2  c.  Facts and Claims of Plaintiffs’ Complaints \n3  Accordingly, the court turns to an analysis of the particular facts and claims at \n4  issue here.  A few district courts faced with both APA and constitutional claims \n5  determined that the constitutional claims “fundamentally overlap” with the APA claims \n6  and thus discovery was unnecessary.  Ala.-Tombigbee Rivers Coal. v. Norton, No. CV \n7  01-S-0194-S, 2002 WL 227032, at *3-6 (N.D. Ala. Jan. 29, 2002); see also Bellion Spirits, \n8  335 F. Supp. 3d at 43-44; Chiayu Chang, 254 F. Supp. 3d at 162 (finding that the \n9  “plaintiffs’ constitutional claims here are fundamentally similar to their APA claims” and \n10  denying discovery).  Alternatively, some courts have permitted some discovery when the \n11  APA and constitutional claims diverge in some meaningful way.  For example, in Manker \n  12  v. Spencer, No. 18-cv-372, 2019 WL 5846828, at *19 (D. Conn. Nov. 7, 2019), the district \n a\ntruin\noro 13  court permitted discovery where the plaintiffs challenged the general course of conduct of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the Naval Discharge Review Board, but the agency sought to limit review to the \niD tc 15  administrative record pertaining only to the plaintiffs.  Thus, the court reasoned ““[w]here \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  a plaintiff challenges an agency’s general course of conduct rather than a discrete \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  adjudication, limited discovery . . . may be necessary where the administrative record \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  does not contain evidence of the challenged action.”  Id.   \nN\n19  In Vidal v. Duke, No. 16-cv-4756, 2017 WL 8773110, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, \n20  2017), the plaintiffs sought discovery in an action challenging the government’s decision \n21  to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program and also challenging \n22  collateral decisions affecting DACA beneficiaries on constitutional grounds.  The \n23  collateral decisions included a due process claim for failure to provide individualized \n24  notice to DACA recipients who were eligible to renew their deferred action and equitable \n25  estoppel claims against the government’s use of information from DACA applications for \n26  immigration enforcement purposes.  Id. at *2.  The court noted that the constitutional \n27  claim and equitable estoppel claims “do not challenge the decision to end the DACA \n28  program, but instead challenge how Defendants communicated that decision to DACA \n28 \n\n \n1  beneficiaries.”  Id.  The court then permitted discovery on the grounds that the \n2  administrative record was limited to the decision to end the DACA program and “sheds \n3  no light on why the Government allegedly made these collateral decisions.”  Id. \n4  This case falls somewhere in between cases like Vidal and Manker that permitted \n5  discovery due to the divergence of APA and constitutional claims and cases such as \n6  Alabama-Tombigbee Rivers Coalition and Chiayu Chang where the APA and \n7  constitutional claims fundamentally overlapped.  Reviewing plaintiffs’ complaints \n8  demonstrates that they are alleging different factual allegations between the APA claims \n9  and the constitutional claims.  While plaintiffs’ APA and constitutional claims challenge \n10  the same Rule and request the same relief (thus, this case is not squarely in line with \n11  Vidal and Manker), the claims do not fundamentally overlap.   \n  12  In the State plaintiffs’ complaint, paragraphs 111 through 126 discuss the State \n a\ntruin\noro 13  plaintiffs’ claims that the Rule is contrary to law and paragraphs 127 through 141 discuss \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the State plaintiffs’ claims that the Rule fails to offer adequate justification.  Beginning \niD tc 15  with paragraph 281, the State plaintiffs’ complaint7 sets forward allegations that the Rule \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  is motivated by racial and ethnic animus toward non-white, non-European immigrants.  \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  These allegations include numerous statements and actions by the President that \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  purportedly demonstrate improper racial animus.  See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 292.  The \nN\n19  allegations also involve senior administration leadership, including Acting USCIS Director \n20  Cuccinelli.  Id. ¶ 299.  The complaint also alleges that the White House, in particular \n21  senior advisor Stephen Miller, improperly manipulated the agency process.  Id. ¶¶ 302, \n22  306.  Similarly, the organization plaintiffs allege that “L. Francis Cissna was directed to \n23  step down as director of USCIS, in part because Stephen Miller had been ‘agitating for \n24  Mr. Cissna’s removal for months’ due to Mr. Miller’s stance that Mr. Cissna was ‘moving \n25  too slowly in implementing’ the Regulation.”  No. 19-cv-04980-PJH, Dkt. 1, ¶ 126 (citation \n26  omitted).  These allegations are different than plaintiffs’ APA allegations that the Agency \n27 \n \n7 The organization plaintiffs’ complaint contains similar allegations in paragraphs 119 \n28 \nthrough 127.  No. 19-cv-04980-PJH, Dkt. 1. \n29 \n\n \n1  promulgated a rule that was contrary to law or the procedure followed by the Agency was \n2  flawed.  Ultimately, these allegations demonstrate that the administrative record is limited \n3  to the Agency’s rulemaking process and sheds no light on actions taken by senior \n4  administration officials. \n5  Defendants, relying on Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392 (2018), also contend that \n6  the court should apply highly deferential constitutional standard of review and under a \n7  rational basis standard, discovery is inappropriate.  Opp. at 18–19.  Plaintiffs, citing \n8  Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation, 429 U.S. \n9  252 (1977), argue that the court should apply a more searching standard of review and \n10  accompanying sensitive inquiry into circumstantial and direct evidence of potential \n11  unconstitutional behavior.  Mtn. at 13.  It is entirely understandable why each party seeks \n  12  to establish a foothold regarding the appropriate constitutional standard of review in this \n a\ntruin\noro 13  case.  See Saget v. Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 366–67 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (discussing \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  applicability of Hawaii and Arlington Heights to Equal Protection claims against agency \niD tc 15  action).  Yet, the court declines to determine such a standard in the context of a motion to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  compel where the parties have not fully briefed this issue.  Cf. Baltimore, 2019 WL \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  6970631, at *9–12 (determining applicable standard of review and declining to permit \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  discovery based on rational basis review).  Moreover, defendants have not cited any \nN\n19  controlling case that prohibits discovery even in cases governed by rational basis review.  \n20  The court does not foreclose the possibility that discovery may not be appropriate if \n21  rational basis review applies to this case, but simply notes that it is premature to make \n22  such a finding at this stage when the court has not addressed the applicable standard of \n23  review.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ motions to take discovery on their constitutional claims is \n24  GRANTED. \n25  This brings the court to the appropriate remedy.  Plaintiffs oppose a stay pending \n26  defendants’ forthcoming motion to dismiss because they bring “a straightforward claim \n27  that Defendants were motivated by racial animus when advancing the Rule.”  Mtn. at 19.  \n28  Defendants contend that the court should defer discovery until resolution of defendants’ \n30 \n\n \n1  forthcoming motion to dismiss that may be dispositive of the complaint.  Opp. at 20.  The \n2  court agrees with defendants; permitting discovery prior to assessing viability of plaintiffs’ \n3  claims and directly addressing the appropriate standard of review and the implications of \n4  that standard would be premature.  As noted by a different court, “even where plaintiffs \n5  have asserted constitutional claims, ‘wide-ranging discovery is not blindly authorized at a \n6  stage in which such an administrative record is being reviewed.’”  Tafas, 530 F. Supp. 2d \n7  at 802 (quoting P.R. Public Housing Admin. v. U.S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Dev., 59 F. \n8  Supp. 2d 310, 327 (D.P.R. 1999)).   \n9  CONCLUSION \n10  For the foregoing reasons, the court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART \n11  plaintiffs’ motions to complete the record and GRANTS plaintiffs’ motions to compel \n  12  discovery.  However, the court STAYS discovery until resolution of defendants’ \n a\ntruin\noro 13  forthcoming motion to dismiss.  Should defendants choose not to file a motion to dismiss, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the parties may file an appropriate request to resolve the stay. \niD tc 15    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Dated: April 1, 2020 \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  /s/ Phyllis J.

Each of the plaintiffs in those actions moved for preliminary injunctive relief.  The \n27  motions came on for hearing before this court on October 2, 2019.   \n28  Plaintiff the City and County of San Francisco (“San Francisco”) appeared through \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 2 of 93\n \n1  its counsel, Matthew Goldberg, Sara Eisenberg, and Yvonne Mere.  Plaintiff the County \n2  of Santa Clara (“Santa Clara” and together with San Francisco, the “Counties”) appeared \n3  through its counsel, Ravi Rajendra, Laura Trice, and Luke Edwards.  Plaintiffs the State \n4  of California, District of Columbia, State of Maine, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and \n5  State of Oregon (together, including D.C., the “States”) appeared through their counsel, \n6  Anna Rich, Lisa Cisneros, and Brenda Ayon Verduzco.  Plaintiffs La Clinica De La Raza \n7  and California Primary Care Association (the two together are the “Healthcare \n8  Organizations”), Maternal and Child Health Access, Farmworker Justice, Council on \n9  American Islamic Relations-California, African Communities Together, Legal Aid Society \n10  of San Mateo County, Central American Resource Center, and Korean Resource Center \n11  (the “Legal Organizations”) (the Legal Organizations and the Healthcare Organizations \n  12  together are the “Organizations”) appeared through their counsel, Alvaro Huerta, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Nicholas Espiritu, Joanna Cuevas Ingram, Kevin Herrera, Tanya Broder, Max Wolsen, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and Mayra Joachin. \niD tc 15  Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), Department of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Homeland Security (“DHS”), Kevin McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS, Kenneth T. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS, and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  States appeared through their counsel, Ethan Davis, Eric Soskin, and Kuntal Cholera. \nN\n19  Additionally, papers submitted by numerous amici curiae were before the court.  \n20  Prior to the hearing, the court granted motions to file amicus briefs on behalf of the \n21  following non-parties, all of which the court considered in its analysis:  American Public \n22  Health Association, et al.; Asian Americans Advancing Justice, et al.; City of Los Angeles, \n23  et al.; Justice in Aging, et al.; and Members of Congress.  A number of other requests to \n24  file amici briefs were denied due to the court’s insufficient time to consider them on this \n25  particular motion, given the already-voluminous filings from the parties, the briefing \n26  schedule, and the time-sensitive nature of plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief. \n27  Having read the papers filed by the parties and carefully considered their \n28  arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, the court hereby \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 3 of 93\n \n1  GRANTS CERTAIN PLAINTIFFS’ MOTIONS AND ISSUES A PRELIMINARILY \n2  INJUNCTION, the scope of which is discussed below, for the following reasons. \n3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n4    In 1883, Emma Lazarus penned the now-famous sonnet, The New Colossus.  \n5  Later affixed to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, the poem has been \n6  incorporated into the national consciousness as a representation of the country’s promise \n7  to would-be immigrants: \n \n8 \nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame, \n9  With conquering limbs astride from land to land; \nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand \n10 \nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame \n11  Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name \nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand \n  12 \ntru ain Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command \noro 13  The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. \nCf\n tila  \ncC\nirts fo 14  \"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\" cries she \niD tc 15  With silent lips. \"Give me your tired, your poor, \n sir\net Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, \ns\ntaiD 16 \nt The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. \nS \nn\n dre 17  Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, \ne\nh\ntinrt I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" \nUo 18 \nN\n19  But whether one would prefer to see America’s borders opened wide and \n20  welcoming, or closed because the nation is full, laws—not poetry—govern who may \n21  enter.  And the year before Lazarus wrote The New Colossus, Congress had enacted its \n22  first comprehensive immigration law, barring entry to “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any \n23  person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge,” \n24  among others.  An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2. (1882).  \n25  Although various iterations of similar laws have since come and gone (the operative \n26  statute no longer refers to “lunatics” or “idiots”), since the very first immigration law in \n27  1882, this country has consistently excluded those who are likely to become a “public \n28  charge.” \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 4 of 93\n \n1  Although Congress has never authored an explicit definition of the term, courts \n2  and the executive branch have been considering its meaning as used in the statute for \n3  over one hundred and twenty years.  As interpretations from those two branches \n4  accreted toward a consistent understanding, Congress repeatedly enacted statutes \n5  adopting the identical phrase. \n6  In 1999, the executive branch reviewed its historical application of the term and \n7  issued formal guidance to executive employees, explaining that the public charge \n8  determination has historically, and should continue to, focus on whether an individual is \n9  primarily dependent on the government for subsistence. \n10  In 2018, DHS published a new rule (scheduled to take effect October 15, 2019) \n11  that proposed to dramatically expand the definition of “public charge.”  Rather than \n  12  include only those who primarily depend on the government for subsistence, DHS now \n a\ntruin\noro 13  proposes for the first time to categorize as a public charge every person who receives 12 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  months of public benefits (including many in-kind benefits, like Medicaid and SNAP/Food \niD tc 15  Stamps) over any 36-month period, regardless of how valuable those benefits are, or \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  how much they cost the government to provide (receiving two types of benefits in one \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  month would count as receiving benefits for two months).   \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Today, the court is presented with a challenge to DHS’s new definition.  The \nN\n19  plaintiffs seek to prevent defendants from implementing it before this court can consider \n20  this case on the merits.  The plaintiffs argue that the new definition will lead to \n21  widespread disenrollment1 from public benefits by those who fear being labeled a public \n22  charge (and by those confused that they may be swept up in the rule), which will cause \n23  plaintiffs to lose a substantial amount funding (for example, the federal government \n24  heavily subsidizes state expenses for those enrolled in Medicaid). \n25  The court finds that the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits, for numerous \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n1 When plaintiffs refer to harms caused by those who will disenroll from public benefits in \naddition to those who will forego enrollment.  This order considers the two categories \n28 \ntogether, and refers to them interchangeably. \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 5 of 93\n \n1  reasons.  DHS’s new definition of “public charge” is likely to be outside the bounds of a \n2  reasonable interpretation of the statute.  Moreover, plaintiffs are likely to prevail on their \n3  entirely independent arguments that defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously during \n4  the legally-required process to implement the changes they propose.  Because plaintiffs \n5  are likely to prevail and will be irreparably harmed if defendants are permitted to \n6  implement the rule as planned on October 15, this court will enjoin implementation of the \n7  rule in the plaintiff states until this case is resolved on the merits, as discussed in more \n8  detail below. \n9  BACKGROUND \n10  In each of the actions before the court, the plaintiffs challenge and seek to \n11  preliminarily enjoin implementation of a proposed rule entitled “Inadmissibility on Public \n  12  Charge Grounds,” proposed by DHS and published in the Federal Register on August 14, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  2019.  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (August 14, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  2019) (“the Rule”).  The Rule is scheduled to take effect nationwide on October 15, 2019. \niD tc 15  A.  The Three Actions \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In City and County of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, San Francisco and Santa Clara (together, the “Counties”) \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  filed a complaint naming as defendants USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of \nN\n19  DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director of USCIS.  The complaint asserts two causes of \n20  action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”):  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n21  § 706(2)(A)—Not in Accordance with Law; and (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n22  § 706(2)(A)—Arbitrary, Capricious, and Abuse of Discretion.  The Counties filed the \n23  present motion for preliminary injunction on August 28, 2019. \n24  In State of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Case No. 19-cv-\n25  04975-PJH, the States filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties:  \n26  USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting Director \n27  of USCIS.  The complaint asserts six causes of action:  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. \n28  § 706—Contrary to Law, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Illegal Immigration \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 6 of 93\n \n1  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary \n2  to Law, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the \n3  “Rehabilitation Act”); (3) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, State \n4  Healthcare Discretion; (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; \n5  (5) Violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause requiring Equal Protection \n6  based on race; (6) Violation of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause, based on a \n7  violation of Equal Protection principles based on unconstitutional animus.  The States \n8  filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on August 26, 2019.  On August 27, \n9  2019, this court ordered the action brought by the States related to the action brought by \n10  the Counties.   \n11  In La Clinica De La Raza v. Trump, Case No. 19-cv-04980-PJH, the Organizations \n  12  filed a complaint naming the same defendants as the Counties, and also added Donald J. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Trump:  USCIS; DHS; McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS; and Cuccinelli as Acting \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Director of USCIS; and Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States.  The \niD tc 15  complaint asserts four causes of action:  (1) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  to the Statutory Scheme; (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary, Capricious, or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  otherwise not in accordance with law; (3) Violation of the Fifth Amendment based on \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Equal Protection for discriminating against non-white immigrants; (4) under the \nN\n19  Declaratory Judgment Act, seeking a determination that the Rule is invalid because it \n20  was issued by an unlawfully-appointed agency director.  On August 30, 2019, this court \n21  ordered the action brought by the Organizations related to the action brought by the \n22  Counties.  The Organizations filed the present motion for preliminary injunction on \n23  September 4, 2019.   \n24  B.  The Dispute \n25  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq. (“INA”), requires \n26  that all noncitizens seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become \n27  lawful permanent residents (“LPRs”) prove they are not inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. § 1361; 8 \n28  U.S.C. § 1225(a).  A noncitizen may be deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 7 of 93\n \n1  including that they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. \n2  § 1182(a)(4)(A).   \n3  The specific INA provision relating to whether an alien is likely to become a “public \n4  charge” at issue in this litigation provides, in relevant part:   \n \n5  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, aliens who are \ninadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to \n6  receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the United States:   \n. . . .  \n7  (4) Public charge \n \n8  (A) In general \n \n9  Any  alien  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the  consular \nofficer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n10  the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of \napplication for admission or adjustment of status, \n11  is likely at any time to become a public charge is \ninadmissible. \n a  12   \ntruin (B) Factors to be taken into account \noCrof 13   \n tila (i)  In  determining  whether  an  alien  is \ncC\nirts fo 14  icnoandsmuliassr ibolfefi ceurn doer r ththei sA tptoarrnaegyr aGphe,n ethrael  \niD s tcir 15  shall at a minimum consider the alien’s— \net (I) age; \ns\ntaiD 16  (II) health; \nt\nS \nn (III) family status; \n dere 17  (IV) assets, resources, and \nh\nt\ninrt financial status; and \nUoN 18  (V) education and skills. \n \n19  (ii) In addition to the factors under clause \n(i),  the  consular  officer  or  the  Attorney \n20  General may also consider any affidavit of \nsupport under section 1183a[2] of this title \n21  for  purposes  of  exclusion  under  this \nparagraph. \n22   \n23  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4). \n24  The statute directs a “consular officer” or “the Attorney General” to form an opinion \n25  as to whether the applicant “is likely at any time to become a public charge.”  Id.  In \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n2 Section 1183a is titled “Requirements for sponsor’s affidavit of support” and sets forth \nthe requirements of an “affidavit of support . . . to establish that an alien is not excludable \n28 \nas a public charge under section 1182(a)(4) of this title[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1). \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 8 of 93\n \n1  forming that opinion, immigration officers must consider “at a minimum” five statutorily-\n2  defined factors:  (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and financial \n3  status; (5) education and skills.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).   \n4  An officer may additionally consider an affidavit of support, which is a legally-\n5  enforceable contract between the sponsor of the applicant and the Federal Government.  \n6  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a).  The sponsor pledges to accept \n7  financial responsibility for the applicant and to maintain the applicant at an income of “not \n8  less than 125 percent of the Federal poverty line during the period in which the affidavit is \n9  enforceable[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(A).   \n10  Certain groups of noncitizens, such as asylum seekers and refugees, are not \n11  subject to exclusion based on an assessment that they are likely to become a public \n  12  charge.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1157 (refugee); 8 U.S.C. § 1158 (asylum); 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c) \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (refugee). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  An alien found to be inadmissible as a public charge may “be admitted in the \niD tc 15  discretion of the Attorney General . . . upon the giving of a suitable and proper bond or \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  undertaking approved by the Attorney General, in such amount and containing such \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  conditions as he may prescribe . . . holding the United States and all States . . . harmless \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  against such alien becoming a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1183. \nN\n19  The public charge ground may arise when, inter alia, an alien seeks LPR status, or \n20  when noncitizens apply for visas.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).  Aliens “to \n21  whom a permit to enter the United States has been issued to enter the United States” are \n22  also subject to an inadmissibility determination by DHS at ports of entry when they enter \n23  and re-enter the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1185(d).   \n24  Immigrants with LPR status may also be subject to the public charge analysis.  For \n25  example, an LPR is considered to be “seeking admission” under various circumstances, \n26  for example when returning to the United States after being “absent from the United \n27  States for a continuous period in excess of 180 days” or after engaging in any “illegal \n28  activity after having departed the United States[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(ii)–(iii).  \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 9 of 93\n \n1  LPRs can also be denied citizenship and/or placed in removal proceedings if DHS \n2  determines retrospectively that they were inadmissible as a public charge at the time of \n3  their adjustment.  8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A); 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,328 & n.176 (discussing \n4  possible impact on naturalizations). \n5  Under a separate provision in the INA, an alien can be deported upon a \n6  determination that he has in fact become a public charge since his admission, from \n7  causes “not affirmatively shown to have arisen since entry[.]”  8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(5).3 \n8  On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rule-making process to create a new \n9  framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed \n10  Rulemaking.  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114 (Oct. \n11  10, 2018) (the notice of proposed rulemaking is the “NPRM”).  The NPRM provided a 60-\n  12  day public comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected.  See 84 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Fed. Reg. at 41,297.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Register.  Id. at 41,292.  It is set to become effective on October 15, 2019.  On October 2, \niD tc 15  2019—the morning of the hearing on the pending motions for preliminary injunction—\n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  DHS published a 25-page list of “corrections” to the proposed final rule.4  See Case No. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  19-cv-04717-PJH, Dkt. 106, Ex. A.  DHS stated that its October 2 amendments to the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  rule would not delay its planned implementation on October 15. \nN\n19  The Rule sets out what the parties have referred to as the “12/36 standard.”  That \n20  is, the Rule “redefines the term ‘public charge’ to mean an alien who receives one or \n21  more designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-\n22 \n                                            \n23 \n3 Confusingly, DHS’s Rule would use completely distinct definitions for the term “public \ncharge” when assessing whether an alien “has become a public charge” (8 U.S.C. \n24 \n1227(a)(5)) and whether an alien “is likely at any time to become a public charge” (8 \nU.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(A). \n25 \n4 Although defendants described the changes as fixes to “technical and typographical \n26 \nerrors” (Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, Dkt. 106, Ex. A at 2), the States argued at the \nhearing that upon their limited review of the corrections (a review that was necessarily \n27 \nlimited given the eleventh-hour disclosure of DHS’s changes to the rule), the \namendments mooted at least one issue underlying the States’ motion, regarding \n28 \ntreatment of military families. \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 10 of 93\n \n1  month period (such that, for instance, receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two \n2  months).  This Rule defines the term ‘public benefit’ to include cash benefits for income \n3  maintenance, SNAP, most forms of Medicaid, Section 8 Housing Assistance under the \n4  Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program, Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, \n5  and certain other forms of subsidized housing.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. \n6  Because the INS directs immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien “is \n7  likely at any time to become a public charge,” the Rule’s new definition requires \n8  immigration officers to opine as to whether an alien is likely to receive certain public \n9  benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any future 36-month period to \n10  determine whether he is likely to become a public charge.  The rule sets out a number of \n11  positive, negative, heavily-weighted, and normally-weighted factors to assist in making \n  12  that determination, and those factors are considered as part of a “totality of the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  circumstances” assessment of whether an alien is likely to use more than 12 months’ \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  worth of benefits in any future 36-month period. \niD tc 15  DISCUSSION \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  A.  Legal Standard \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 provides federal courts with the authority to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  issue preliminary injunctions.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a).  Generally, the purpose of a \nN\n19  preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a \n20  final judgment on the merits can be rendered.  See U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC Bank N.V., \n21  590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010). \n22  An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion and is “an extraordinary remedy \n23  that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  \n24  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008); see also Munaf v. Geren, \n25  553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008).  A preliminary injunction “should not be granted unless the \n26  movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, \n27  520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (per curiam).  \n28  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [1] he is likely to \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 11 of 93\n \n1  succeed on the merits, that [2] he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n2  preliminary relief, that [3] the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that [4] an \n3  injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \n4  Alternatively, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a hardship balance that \n5  tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other \n6  two elements of the Winter test are also met.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 \n7  F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th Cir. 2011).  “That is, ‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a \n8  balance of hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a \n9  preliminary injunction, so long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood of \n10  irreparable injury and that the injunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 1135; see also \n11  Disney Enterprises, Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 856 (9th Cir. 2017). \n  12  If a plaintiff satisfies its burden to demonstrate that a preliminary injunction should \n a\ntruin\noro 13  issue, “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 \niD tc 15  (1979). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Separately, the APA permits this court to “postpone the effective date of action . . . \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  pending judicial review.”  5 U.S.C. § 705;  Bakersfield City Sch. Dist. of Kern Cty. v. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Boyer, 610 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1979) (“The agency or the court may postpone or stay \nN\n19  agency action pending such judicial review.”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 705).  Any such \n20  postponement must be made “[o]n such conditions as may be required and to the extent \n21  necessary to prevent irreparable injury[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 705.  The factors considered when \n22  issuing such a stay substantially overlap with the Winter factors for a preliminary \n23  injunction.  See, e.g., Bauer v. DeVos, 325 F. Supp. 3d 74, 104–07 (D.D.C. 2018). \n24  B.  Analysis \n25  In considering plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunction, the court considers the \n26  Winter factors (and the alternative All. for the Wild Rockies) factors in turn.  First, the \n27  court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to succeed on the \n28  merits of their claims, or alternatively whether they have demonstrated serious questions \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 12 of 93\n \n1  going to the merits.  Because a plaintiff must be within a statute’s “zone of interest” to \n2  succeed on an APA challenge based on the underlying statute, the court considers \n3  whether each plaintiff is within the relevant statute’s zone of interests when assessing its \n4  likelihood of success on the merits.   \n5  Second, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to \n6  suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.  Because plaintiffs’ alleged \n7  irreparable harms are also their alleged bases for standing, the court considers whether \n8  each plaintiff has standing to bring a ripe claim when assessing its irreparable harms.   \n9  Third, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that the balance of \n10  equities tip in their favor, and whether the balance of hardships tip sharply in their favor.   \n11  Fourth, the court considers whether plaintiffs have demonstrated that an injunction \n  12  is in the public interest.   \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Fifth, the court addresses the scope of injunctive relief necessary and capable of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  providing complete relief to the harms plaintiffs have demonstrated they are likely to \niD tc 15  suffer prior to a determination on the merits, absent such relief. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  1.  The State and County Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  and Have Raised Serious Questions \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed on three of their causes of action, \nN\n19  each alleging a violation of the APA:  (1) that the Rule violates the APA because it is not \n20  in accordance with the term “public charge” as used in the INA; (2) that the Rule violates \n21  the APA because it is not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act § 504; and (3) that the \n22  Rule violates the APA because it is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.5 \n23  Under the APA, “the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, \n24  interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or \n25 \n                                            \n5 Although some of the arguments supporting these claims are likely to overlap with other \n26 \nclaims plaintiffs assert, plaintiffs have made clear that they are not moving for a \npreliminarily injunction based on any other claim, including, inter alia, the claim that the \n27 \nRule violates the APA because it is contrary to laws giving the States discretion with \nrespect to the provision of healthcare, the claim under the declaratory judgment act that \n28 \nCuccinelli was unlawfully appointed, or any of the asserted Constitutional claims. \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 13 of 93\n \n1  applicability of the terms of an agency action.

This principle is implemented by the two-step analysis set \n9  forth in Chevron.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2124 (2016) \n10  (citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def.

E.P.A., 135 \n20  S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015) (“Even under this deferential standard, however, agencies must \n21  operate within the bounds of reasonable interpretation.”) (internal quotation marks \n22  omitted).   \n23  The Chevron analysis calls upon the court to “employ[] traditional tools of statutory \n24  construction” to fulfill its role as “the final authority on issues of statutory construction[.]”  \n25  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9; accord Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1630 \n26  (2018). \n27  “Chevron deference, however, is not accorded merely because the statute is \n28  ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.  To begin with, the rule must be \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 14 of 93\n \n1  promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.”  Gonzales v. \n2  Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 258 (2006).  “The starting point for this inquiry is, of course, the \n3  language of the delegation provision itself.  In many cases authority is clear because the \n4  statute gives an agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.”  Id. (drawing \n5  a distinction between delegation of authority to carry out the act generally, and authority \n6  to execute the functions assigned to the agency). \n7  First, the court assesses whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims \n8  under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \n9  § 1182(a)(4).  Second, the court assesses whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their \n10  claims under the APA that the Rule is not in accordance with law, as provided in the \n11  Rehabilitation Act § 504.  Third, the court assess whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed \n  12  on their claims under the APA, that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious.  Fourth, the court \n a\ntruin\noro 13  assesses whether each plaintiff is within the relevant zone of interests, which is required \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  to succeed on an APA claim. \niD tc 15  a.  Not in Accordance with Law—8 U.S. Code § 1182(a)(4) \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Plaintiffs argue that the Rule is not in accordance with the definition of “public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge” as used in 8 U.S. Code § 1182(a)(4) for three reasons:  (1) DHS’s interpretation \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  should not be accorded any deference, and the Rule’s definition is inconsistent with the \nN\n19  statute; (2) even if the term is accorded deference, the term plainly and unambiguously \n20  means “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence,” and the Rule conflicts \n21  with that definition; and (3) the Rule’s definition of “public charge” is not reasonable or \n22  based on a permissible construction of the statute. \n23  The court did not understand plaintiffs to have raised the first argument in their \n24  moving papers, although the Counties may have raised it obliquely in their reply.  But the \n25  court and defendants were surprised to learn at the hearing that plaintiffs were advancing \n26  an argument that DHS’s promulgation of the Rule was wholly outside of Congressionally-\n27  delegated authority.  Cf. Counties’ Reply at 8–9 (“Counties do not contest DHS’s \n28  authority to issue rational regulations governing the case-by-case application of the \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 15 of 93\n \n1  statutory standard, so long as they do not misconstrue the term ‘public charge.’”); States’ \n2  Reply at 9–10 (“the States have never disputed the commonsense point that Congress in \n3  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A) assigned responsibility to Defendants to make individual public \n4  charge determinations”); Organizations’ Reply at 9 (“even if Defendants were correct, \n5  Congress could delegate to DHS the power only to adopt reasonable interpretations of \n6  the statute”).  Nevertheless, plaintiffs have not sufficiently supported, or even explained, \n7  their argument to satisfy their burden to show likelihood of success on the merits based \n8  on it.6  Accordingly, the court analyzes the Rule pursuant to the framework set out by \n9  Chevron.  \n10  The second and third arguments concern a challenge under Chevron’s framework \n11  to the meaning of “public charge” as used in § 1182(a)(4).  Plaintiffs’ second argument \n  12  requires the court to determine whether the Rule contravenes the statute’s unambiguous \n a\ntruin\noro 13  meaning, and their third argument requires the court to determine whether defendants’ \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  chosen definition is reasonable and based on a permissible construction of the statute.  \niD tc 15  Both questions require a discussion of the long usage of the term by Congress, as well \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  as the expansive evaluation of the term by courts and executive agencies.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  As preface to that discussion, a brief outline helps set the stage.  The phrase \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “public charge” was used in this country’s first-ever general immigration statute in 1882.  \nN\n19  The immigration statutes have been interpreted and modified many time since then, and \n20  although many other excluded categories of persons came and went, with each \n21  modification through today the phrase “public charge” remained intact.  As a result, the \n22  meaning that the persistent term had when first used is relevant to understanding the \n23  meaning Congress ascribed to it with each subsequent statutory revision, including the \n24  now-operative statute, which most recently saw changes to the relevant provisions in \n25  1990 and 1996.   \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n6 However, the court notes that whether DHS’s promulgation of the Rule falls within the \nrulemaking authority delegated to it by Congress may benefit from more attention in the \n28 \nparties’ future briefing on the merits.  See generally 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a). \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 16 of 93\n \n1  Ultimately, this dispute concerns the meaning of a statutory term passed in 1990—\n2  with clarifying language passed in 1996.  As such, the court considers the meaning \n3  ascribed to the term by Congress at that time, but in doing so it must afford due \n4  consideration to Congress’s understanding of the term given the long historical context it \n5  was operating within, which the court presently endeavors to describe.  See Forest Grove \n6  Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 239–40 (2009) (“Congress is presumed to be aware of \n7  an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation \n8  when it re-enacts a statute without change.”) (quoting Lorillard v.

See \n27  An Act to Regulate Immigration, 22 Stat. 214 (1882) (the “1882 Act”).  That statute \n28  provided, in part: \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 17 of 93\n \n \n1  That the Secretary of the Treasury . . . shall have power to . . . \nprovide for the support and relief of such immigrants therein \n2  landing as may fall into distress or need public aid . . . and it \nshall be the duty of such State . . . to examine into the condition \n3  of  passengers  arriving  at  the  ports  .  .  .  and  if  on  such \nexamination there shall be found among such passengers any \n4  convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of \nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge . . . such \n5  persons shall not be permitted to land. \n6  22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376 § 2. \n7  Legislative debate on the 1882 Act shows that at least one member of Congress \n8  sought to prevent foreign nations from “‘send[ing] to this country blind, crippled, lunatic, \n9  and other infirm paupers, who ultimately become life-long dependents on our public \n10  charities.’” 13 Cong. Rec. 5108-10 (June 19, 1882) (statement of Rep. Van Voorhis). \n11  The 1882 Act also imposed on each noncitizen who entered the United States a \n  12  50-cent head tax for the purpose of creating an “immigrant fund”: \n a\ntruin\noro 13   \nCf\n tila That there shall be levied, collected, and paid a duty of fifty \ncC\nirts fo 14  cSetanttess f owr heoa cshh aalnl dco emveer yb yp asstesaemng oerr  nsaoitl  av ecsitsizeel nf roofm th ae  fUorneitiegdn  \niD s tcir 15  port to any port within the United States. . . .

Robertson, 112 U.S. 580, 590–91 (1884) \n20  (“This act of congress is similar, in its essential features, to many statutes enacted by \n21  states of the Union for the protection of their own citizens, and for the good of the \n22  immigrants who land at sea-ports within their borders.

Thus the people of a parish are called the \n2  ministers charge.”  Charge, Webster’s Dictionary (1828 Online Edition), \n3  http://webstersdictionary1828.com/Dictionary/charge; Charge, Webster’s Dictionary \n4  (1886 Edition), https://archive.org/details/websterscomplete00webs/page/218 (“person or \n5  thing committed or intrusted [sic] to the care, custody, or management of another; a trust; \n6  as, to abandon a charge”).7   \n7  Another contemporary source defines charge “In its general sense, a charge is an \n8  obligation or liability.  Thus we speak of . . . a pauper being chargeable to the parish or \n9  town.”  Stewart; Lawrence Rapalje, Robert L., Dictionary of American and English Law, \n10  with Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws (1888), at 196.   \n11  Prior to the 1882 Act’s enactment, states had played a larger role in immigration \n  12  than they do today, and state governments had used and interpreted the term “public \n a\ntruin\noro 13  charge,” although of course not in relation to any Congressional act.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  For example, the New Jersey Supreme Court, when interpreting a statute \niD tc 15  concerning the procedures to remove an individual from a township in New Jersey, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  considered whether a pauper was “either chargeable, or likely to become chargeable, to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the township of Princeton.”  Overseers of Princeton Twp. v. Overseers of S. Brunswick \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Twp., 23 N.J.L. 169, 170 (Sup. Ct. 1851).  Although the case does not make clear what \nN\n19  precise relief is necessary to qualify as a public charge, it contemplated that one became \n20  a public charge upon seeking such relief from “the church wardens or overseers of the \n21  poor[.]”  Id. at 173.  The concurrence clarified that an “application for relief” is distinct from \n22  being “chargeable,” although “[t]he probability of his becoming chargeable is sufficiently \n23  shown by his application for relief.”  Id. at 179 (Carpenter, J. concurring).  The case does \n24 \n                                            \n7 Defendants cite Frederic Jesup Stimson, Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and \n25 \nMaxims of the Common Law (1881), but that source does not provide a relevant \ndefinition.  The first-listed definition is the most plausibly-relevant:  “A burden, \n26 \nincumbrance, or lien; as when land is charged with a debt.”  Id. at 56.  But that definition \nconcerns how the word charge relates to real property, which makes sense because at \n27 \nthe time, “[m]ore frequently, however, charge is applied to property” as “a general term[.]”  \nStewart; Lawrence Rapalje, Robert L., Dictionary of American and English Law, with \n28 \nDefinitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws (1888), at 196. \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 19 of 93\n \n1  not explain the type or quantum of relief necessary to constitute one’s status as a \n2  “charge.” \n3  Another state court opinion, People ex rel. Durfee v. Commissioners of Emigration, \n4  27 Barb. 562, 1858 WL 7084 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1858), addressed a statute which \n5  contemplated bonds being paid on behalf of immigrants, and required the commissioners \n6  of immigration who held those bonds to “indemnify so far as may be the several cities, \n7  towns and counties of the state, for any expense or charge which may be incurred for the \n8  maintenance and support of the” immigrants.  27 Barb. at 570.  The court held that the \n9  statute required indemnification of all expenses made on behalf of the immigrants—\n10  whether temporary or permanent—so long as the expenses were lawfully made.  Id.  \n11  However, the case did not draw a clean line holding that any expense spent on an \n  12  individual makes him a public charge.  Rather, an equally-plausible reading of the opinion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  is that the statute requires immunity of all expenses paid to support immigrants for whom \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  bonds have been paid, regardless of whether they are formally considered public \niD tc 15  charges.8 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  City of Bos. v. Capen, 61 Mass. 116, 121 (1851) concerned a statute which \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  required a bond for someone likely to become a public charge.  The court explained that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  the statute described various categories of people identified as being at risk of becoming \nN\n19  a public charge, and for whom bond may be required.  However, what assistance or \n20  payment qualified one as a \"public charge” was not addressed.9   \n21  As a whole, the statutory language and authority underlying the 1882 Act provide \n22 \n                                            \n8 The latter reading would be in accordance with the current interpretation of “public \n23 \ncharge” as used elsewhere in the INA, which requires an alien to be presented with a bill \nand prove unable or unwilling to pay it to be deemed a public charge.  E.g., Matter of B-, \n24 \n3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (A.G. 1948); Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999); 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. \n25 \n9 The opinion also suggested that those who were “paupers in a foreign land” must have \n26 \nbeen “a public charge in another country,” and then stated without explanation that “the \nword ‘paupers’ being used in this connection in its legal, technical sense.”  Capen, 61 \n27 \nMass. at 121.  Even looking past the confusion, the court might be interpreted as finding \nthat all paupers have been public charges, but from that the conclusion cannot be drawn \n28 \nthat all public charges must have been paupers. \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 20 of 93\n \n1  some clear guidance as to the definition of public charge.  For example, the 1882 Act \n2  contemplated that admitted aliens (not excluded on public charge grounds) would receive \n3  some assistance from the state.  That is made clear by the same statute’s establishment \n4  of a fund “for the care of immigrants arriving in the United States, for the relief of such as \n5  are in distress[.]”  22 Stat. 214, Chap. 376, § 1.  Although the quantum of state support \n6  necessary to render one a public charge is less clear, the 1882 Act did not consider an \n7  alien a public charge for simply receiving some assistance from the state.  Also, it \n8  appears that contemporary uses of the term would deem one a public charge after taking \n9  on a particular, chargeable debt from the state and failing to repay it. \n10  2.  1891 \n11  In 1891, Congress amended the 1882 Act.  That amended statute provided, in \n  12  part: \n a\ntruin  \noCrof 13  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \n tila admission into the United States . . . :  All idiots, insane persons, \ncC\nirts fo 14  psuafufepreinrsg  ofrro pme ras olonast hliskoemlye t oo rb ae cdoamngee aro puusb cloicn ctahgairogues,  dpiesresaosnes,  \niD s tcir 15  persons who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous \net crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polygamists, \ns\ntaiD 16  and . . . . \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  An Act in Amendment to the Various Acts Relative to Immigration and the Importation of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Aliens Under Contract or Agreement to Perform Labor, 26 Stat. 1084, Chap. 551 (“1891 \nN\n19  Act”) § 1 (1891). \n20  The 1891 amendment also provided that “any alien who becomes a public charge \n21  within one year after his arrival in the United States from causes existing prior to his \n22  landing therein shall be deemed to have come in violation of law and shall be returned” \n23  pursuant to the procedures outline in the statute regarding aliens entering unlawfully.  \n24  1891 Act § 11.  So, the 1891 Act set out the now-familiar practice of subjecting aliens to \n25  two “public charge” assessments—one in which the government is called on to make a \n26  forward-looking prediction, and another in which the government is called on to make a \n27  backward-looking assessment.  The first asks at the time of entry whether the alien is \n28  likely to become a public charge.  The second asks whether, after some period of time, \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 21 of 93\n \n1  the alien has in fact become a public charge due to causes existing before he arrived.  \n2  Although the relevant time periods of the assessments have grown, this scheme \n3  generally remains in place today. \n4  The 1891 Act made a notable change to the law by adding the category “pauper,” \n5  and including the term pauper with “persons likely to become a public charge” to form a \n6  single entry in an expanded list of excluded categories of people. \n7  An early case interpreting the act considered whether “the act of 1891 confers \n8  upon the inspection officer power to detain and send back an alien immigrant as being a \n9  person liable to become a public charge, in the absence of any evidence whatever \n10  tending to establish that fact.”  In re Feinknopf, 47 F. 447, 448 (E.D.N.Y. 1891).  Although \n11  it did not define the term “public charge” in the abstract, the court provided an explanation \n  12  given the facts before it that essentially laid out a totality-of-the-circumstances test.  It \n a\ntruin\noro 13  held that “[o]f course” the following facts, “if believed, would not warrant the conclusion \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  that the petitioner was a person likely to become a public charge,” and that the case is \niD tc 15  “devoid of any evidence whatever of any fact upon which to base a determination that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  petitioner is likely to become a public charge”: \nt\nS \nn  \n dere 17  the petitioner is 40 years old; that he is a native of Austria; that \nh\nt\ninrt he is a cabinet-maker by trade, and has exercised that trade for \nUoN 18  25 years; that he has no family; that he has baggage with him, \nworth $20, and 50 cents in cash; that he is a man who can find \n19  employment in his trade, and is willing to exercise the same. . . .  \n[I]n addition, that the immigrant has not been an inmate of an \n20  almshouse, and has not received public aid or support, and has \nnot been convicted of crime. \n21   \n22  Id. at 447–48.  A fair reading suggests that each of the enumerated facts could be \n23  relevant to predicting whether someone is likely to become a public charge. \n24  A subsequent court provided even more guidance.  In United States v. Lipkis, 56 \n25  F. 427 (S.D.N.Y. 1893), a man had arrived in America before his wife and child.  The wife \n26  and child were required to pay a bond because the superintendent of immigration \n27  deemed them “likely to become a public charge” based on “the poverty and character of \n28  the husband,” whose residence gave the appearance of “extreme poverty.”  Id. at 427.  \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 22 of 93\n \n1  However, that poverty alone did not mean he or the family was a public charge—rather, it \n2  meant the family was likely to become a public charge.  “About six months after the \n3  arrival of the mother she became insane, and was sent to the public insane asylum of the \n4  city under the direction of the commissioners of charities and correction, where only poor \n5  persons unable to pay for treatment are received, and she was there attended to for a \n6  considerable period at the expense of the municipality.”  Id. at 428.  Thus, the mother \n7  became a public charge only when she was committed to the public insane asylum with \n8  “no effort to provide for her at his [the husband’s] own expense[.]”  Id.   \n9  But the court did not require commitment to an institution to make one a public \n10  charge.  It reasoned in dicta that the family’s financial condition generally subjected the \n11  family to the risk of becoming “a public charge under the ordinary liabilities to sickness, or \n  12  as soon as any other additional charges arose beyond the barest needs of existence. . . .  \n a\ntruin\noro 13  The liability of his family to become a public charge through any of the ordinary \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  contingencies of life existed when the bond was taken, because of his poverty and \niD tc 15  inefficiency.”  Id.  So, a number of different financial shocks could have rendered the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  family a public charge. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  The court’s analysis drew a distinction between being a public charge (in this case, \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  someone committed to an insane asylum with no effort to cover the expense), and \nN\n19  someone likely to become a public charge (in this case, someone who can pay for “the \n20  barest needs of existence,” yet whom an extreme illness could ruin). \n21  The parties cite to state court decisions published during this time using the term \n22  public charge, which are informative of what the term generally meant at the time.  Those \n23  opinions address the duration of benefits that render one a public charge rather than the \n24  quantum, and they tend to suggest that temporary relief did not make one a public charge \n25  as the term was understood at the time.  However, they do not address whether longer-\n26  term receipt of a small amount of public benefits qualifies one as a public charge (as the \n27  Rule would do).  See Yeatman v. King, 2 N.D. 421 (1892) (state loaning seed grain to \n28  farmer using the general tax fund, with obligation of repayment, is designed to prevent \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 23 of 93\n \n1  farmers “from becoming a public charge by affording them temporary relief”); Cicero v. \n2  Falconberry, 14 Ind. App. 237 (1895) (“The mere fact that a person may occasionally \n3  obtain assistance from the county does not necessarily make such person a pauper or a \n4  public charge.”).10 \n5  Following the 1891 Act, two points are relatively clear.  First, reaffirming the best \n6  interpretation of the 1882 Act, the term was not used at the time to include short-term or \n7  temporary relief from the state, as the case law continued to demonstrate.  Second, \n8  Lipkis could be read to support either of two non-controversial points:  either state-funded \n9  institutionalization constitutes becoming a public charge, or state-funded \n10  institutionalization with “no effort” to pay the expense after being billed does so.  Simply \n11  being able to pay for the barest needs of existence and nothing more does not render \n  12  one a public charge (although it may make one likely to become a public charge).  A third \n a\ntruin\noro 13  point begins to materialize in the case law, which is that absent some particularly-\nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  identified negative factor, an employable individual is not a public charge.  E.g., In re \niD tc 15  Feinknopf, 47 F. at 447–48 (40-year-old man willing to exercise his trade); Lipkis, 56 F. at \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  428 (notwithstanding poverty, working man’s family is not a public charge until financial \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  calamity strikes); Yeatman, 2 N.D. at 421 (public aid to working farmer). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  3.  1903 \nN\n19  In 1903, Congress passed a revised version of the act.  That amended statute \n20  provided, in part: \n \n21  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States:  All idiots, insane persons, \n22  epileptics, and persons who have been insane within five years \nprevious; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity \n23  at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a \npublic charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with a \n24  loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease; persons \nwho  have  been  convicted  of  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \n25 \n                                            \n26 \n10 The parties also cite Edenburg Borough Poor Dist. v. Strattanville Borough Poor Dist., \n5 Pa. Super. 516, 528 (1897), but that case concerns an individual who appears to have \n27 \nformally registered as a pauper by seeking public assistance under state or local law.  It \ndoes not concern any immigration statutes, nor does the opinion use the word “charge” or \n28 \nthe phrase “public charge.” \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 24 of 93\n \nmisdemeanor  involving  moral  turpitude;  polygamists; \n1  anarchists, or . . . .” \n2  An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 32 Stat. 1213, \n3  Chap. 1012 § 2 (1903). \n4  This change separated out “paupers” from “persons likely to become a public \n5  charge,” which the previous act had grouped together as a single item in the list. \n6  The 1903 amendment also provided that any alien who “shall be found a public \n7  charge . . . from causes existing prior to landing, shall be deported . . . at any time within \n8  two years after arrival[.]”  Id. § 20. \n9  4.  1907  \n10  In 1907, Congress passed a revised version of the act.  That amended statute \n11  provided, in part: \n \n a  12  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \ntruin admission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\noCrof 13  minded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who \n tila have been insane within five years previous; persons who have \ncC\nirts fo 14  hpaadup tewrso;  orp emrsooren sa ttalikceksly  oft oin sabneictyo maet  anay  tpimubel icp revcihoaursgley;;  \niD s tcir 15  professional beggars; persons afflicted with tuberculosis or with \net a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not \ns\ntaiD 16  comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \nt\nS \nn who are . . . mentally or physically defective, such mental or \n dere 17  physical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of \nh\nt\ninrt such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted \nUoN 18  of  or  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \nmisdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . .” \n19 \nAn Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the United States, 34 Stat. 898, Chap. \n20 \n1134 § 2 (1907). \n21 \nNothing relevant to the present action appears to have been changed by this \n22 \nrevision.11 \n23 \n5.  1910 \n24 \nIn 1910, Congress amended the 1907 act.  The new statute provided, in part: \n25   \n26 \n                                            \n11 The only notable change is the introduction of an exclusion for individuals not otherwise \n27 \ncaptured by the categories who cannot earn a living based on mental or physical defect.  \nThat suggests that earlier-listed categories also include such people, but not all such \n28 \npeople. \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 25 of 93\n \nThat the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \n1  admission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\nminded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who \n2  have been insane within five years previous; persons who have \nhad two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; \n3  paupers;  persons  likely  to  become  a  public  charge; \nprofessional beggars; persons afflicted with tuberculosis or with \n4  a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not \ncomprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \n5  who are . . . mentally or physically defective, such mental or \nphysical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of \n6  such alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted \nof  or  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \n7  misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . .” \n8  An Act to Amend an Act entitled An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens Into the \n9  United States, 36 Stat. 263, Chap. 128 § 2 (1910). \n10    Nothing relevant to the present action appears to have been changed by this \n11  revision. \n  12  In 1915, the Supreme Court addressed the 1910 act in Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (1915).  “The single question” in that case was “whether an alien can be declared likely to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  become a public charge on the ground that the labor market in the city of his \niD tc 15  immediate destination is overstocked.”  Id. at 9–10.  The immigration commissioners in \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that action determined that the immigrants were “bound for Portland, Oregon, where the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  reports of industrial conditions show that it would be impossible for these aliens to obtain \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  employment[.]”  Id. at 8. \nN\n19  The court held that “[t]he statute deals with admission to the United States, not to \n20  Portland . . . .  It would be an amazing claim of power if commissioners decided not to \n21  admit aliens because the labor market of the United States was overstocked.”  Id. at 10.  \n22  Because the immigration authorities could not consider labor conditions in a single \n23  location to determine whether immigrants would be able to obtain employment, the \n24  factual findings that the immigrants could not find work in Portland was insufficient to \n25  support a determination that they were likely to become public charges. \n26  The court also reasoned that, because the “public charge” ground for exclusion \n27  was “mentioned between paupers and professional beggars, and along with idiots, \n28  persons dangerously diseased, persons certified by the examining surgeon to have a \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 26 of 93\n \n1  mental or physical defect of a nature to affect their ability to earn a living,” the term should \n2  be construed as similar with the rest.  Id.  Under that construction, the court held that \n3  those likely to become public charges “are to be excluded on the ground of permanent \n4  personal objections accompanying them irrespective of local conditions[.]”  Id.12  That \n5  is, the court focused on an alien’s general ability and willingness to work and earn a \n6  living, rather than the particular wages or labor conditions that existed in the alien’s \n7  destination. \n8  A court in 1916 considered “whether the fact that petitioner entered the United \n9  States as a gambler, and as one having no other permanent means of support, actual or \n10  contemplated, makes him a person ‘likely to become a public charge’ within the meaning \n11  of the Immigration Act.”  Lam Fung Yen v. Frick, 233 F. 393, 396 (6th Cir. 1916): \n \n a  12  It seems clear that the term ‘persons likely to become a public \ntruin charge’ is not limited to paupers or those liable to become such; \noCrof 13  ‘paupers‘ are mentioned as in a separate class.  In United \n tila States v. Williams (D.C.) 175 Fed. 274, 275, the term ‘persons \ncC\nirts fo 14  loiknellyy  ttoh obesceo mpeer sao pnusb liwc hchoa rtghero‘ ius gcho nmstrisufeodr tausn ien clcuadninngo, t‘ nboet  \niD s tcir 15  self-supporting,  but  also  those  who  will  not  undertake \net honest pursuits, and who are likely to become periodically \ns\ntaiD 16  the  inmates  of  prisons.’    We  think  this  a  reasonable \nt\nS \nn construction. . . .  Inmates of jails and prisons are for the time \n dere 17  being public charges, and we think it open to conclusion by \nh\nt\ninrt reasonable minds that those who will not work for a living, but \nUoN 18  rely  for  that  purpose  upon  gambling,  are  more  likely  than \ncitizens following the ordinary pursuits of industry to become, \n19  at least intermittently, public charges.   \n20  Id. at 396–97 (emphasis added). \n21  The court reasoned that because the alien was a gambler and gambling is \n22  regarded “within the domain of police supervision and public security,” the petitioner is \n23  reasonably likely to become periodically an inmate of a prison.  Id. at 397.  Under the \n24  court’s reasoning, someone in a prison is a public charge, akin to someone in an \n25  almshouse or insane asylum.  Id.; see also United States v. Williams, 175 F. 274, 275 \n26 \n                                            \n12 The Gegiow opinion was subject to some skepticism following a later amendment to \n27 \nthe statute, but the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that its reasoning remained \ncontrolling.  See Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913 (9th Cir. 1922); see also Ex \n28 \nparte Mitchell, 256 F. 229 (N.D.N.Y. 1919). \n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 27 of 93\n \n1  (S.D.N.Y. 1910) (“They are surely public charges, at least during the term of their \n2  incarceration.”).   \n3  In 1917, the Second Circuit relied on Gegiow’s statutory analysis when deciding a \n4  case under the 1910 statute.  Howe v. United States, 247 F. 292 (2d Cir. 1917).  In \n5  Howe, a Canadian who had allegedly “drawn a check . . . which proved bad,” among \n6  other things, entered the United States, and an immigration inspector “believed him guilty \n7  of dishonest practice in Canada.”  Id. at 293–94.  Because the plaintiff had not admitted \n8  to or been convicted of a felony, the provision excluding criminals did not apply to him.  \n9  The court reasoned that (1) the term “public charge” needed to be read in context of its \n10  position in the statute’s list, and (2) it cannot be interpreted to overlap with other items in \n11  the list (e.g., idiots, imbeciles, insane persons, criminals).  As such, “[i]f the words \n  12  covered jails, hospitals, and insane asylums, several of the other categories of exclusion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  would seem to be unnecessary.”  Id. at 294.  Instead, “Congress meant the act to exclude \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  persons who were likely to become occupants of almshouses for want of means with \niD tc 15  which to support themselves in the future.”  Id.  The Howe court provided a very specific, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  restrictive, and clear definition of the term.  This also demonstrates an early split in the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  case law as to whether prison inmates are considered public charges. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  By 1917, the Supreme Court, the Second Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit had all \nN\n19  published opinions construing the term as used in the 1910 act.  These are precisely the \n20  sorts of constructions Congress is presumed knowledgeable of when reenacting statutory \n21  language.  See Forest Grove, 557 U.S. at 239–40.  The Supreme Court held that \n22  predicting whether someone will become a public charge requires consideration of \n23  “permanent personal objections accompanying them irrespective of local conditions[.]”  \n24  Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10.  The two Circuit decisions are more difficult to reconcile.  First, \n25  they directly contradicted one another with respect to whether jail inmates were public \n26  charges.  Second, Howe broke with the weight of prior authority in holding that the term \n27  was limited to those occupying almshouses for want of a means of support. \n28  6.  1917 \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 28 of 93\n \n1  In 1917, Congress amended the Act.  That amended statute provided, in part: \n \n2  That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from \nadmission into the United States:  All idiots, imbeciles, feeble-\n3  minded persons, epileptics, insane persons; persons who have \nhad one or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; \n4  persons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority; persons with \nchronic alcoholism; paupers; professional beggars; vagrants; \n5  persons  afflicted  with  tuberculosis  in  any  form  or  with  a \nloathsome  or  dangerous  contagious  disease;  persons  not \n6  comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes \nwho are . . . mentally or physically defective, such physical \n7  defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of such \nalien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted of or \n8  admit  having  committed  a  felony  or  other  crime  or \nmisdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or . . . . ; \n9  persons likely to become a public charge . . . .” \n10  An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens to, and the Residence of Aliens in, the \n11  United States, 39 Stat. 874, Chap. 29 § 3 (1917). \n  12    The statute also provided for the deportability of “any alien who within five years \n a\ntruin\noro 13  after entry becomes a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  subsequent to landing[.]”  Id. § 19. \niD tc 15  The “public charge” language remains unchanged, although moved within the list.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The Congressional Record suggests that Congress intentionally moved the category of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  “persons likely to become a public charge” later in the list in response to Gegiow.  See 70 \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Cong. Rec. 3560 (1929) (“persons likely to become a public charge (this clause excluding \nN\n19  aliens on the ground likely to become a public charge has been shifted from its position in \n20  section 2 of the immigration act of 1907 to its present position in section 3 of this act in \n21  order to indicate the intention of Congress that aliens shall be excluded upon said ground \n22  for economic as well as other reasons and with a view to overcoming the decision of the \n23  Supreme Court in Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U. S. 3”); see also 80 Cong. Rec. 5829 (1936) \n24  (same). \n25  A district court in 1919 reasoned that although the exact same phrase was shifted \n26  within the list, “I am unable to see that this change of location of these words in the act \n27  changes the meaning that is to be given them.  A ‘person likely to become a public \n28  charge’ is one who for some cause or reason appears to be about to become a charge \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 29 of 93\n \n1  on the public, one who is to be supported at public expense, by reason of poverty, \n2  insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, idiocy and poverty, or, it might be, by reason \n3  of having committed a crime which, on conviction, would be followed by imprisonment.”  \n4  Ex parte Mitchell, 256 F. 229, 230 (N.D.N.Y. 1919).  In that case, there was “no evidence \n5  whatever that the alien at any time has relied in any degree on the charity of others,” but \n6  rather the alien “is able to earn her own living and always has done so[.]”  Id.  \n7  The court then stated that mere speculation about the possibility of becoming a \n8  public charge does not make one likely to become a public charge:  “The alien may \n9  become sick; she may lose her house by fire; she may lose her personal property by bad \n10  investments.  All this is possible, but not probable.  There is no claim that this alien is \n11  suffering, or that she has suffered at any time, from any mental or physical defect.  It is \n  12  not claimed this alien has been convicted, or even charged with the commission, of any \n a\ntruin\noro 13  crime, or that she came to the United States, or is in the United States, for any immoral or \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  improper purpose.”  Id. at 231. \niD tc 15  The Ninth Circuit agreed in 1922, holding that the 1917 Amendment’s movement \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  of the “public charge” exclusion “does not change the meaning that should be given” the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  exclusion.  Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. 913, 916 (9th Cir. 1922).  The court \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  recognized the legislative change and that Gegiow’s reliance on the phrase’s relative \nN\n19  position in the statute was compromised, yet it held: \n \n20  Although  in  the  act  of  February  5,  1917,  under  which  the \npresent case is to be determined, the location of the words \n21  ‘persons likely to become a public charge‘ is changed, we agree \nwith Judge Ray in Ex parte Mitchell (D.C.) 256 Fed. 229, that \n22  this  change  of  location  of  the  words  does  not  change  the \nmeaning that should be given them, and that it is still to be held \n23  that a person ‘likely to become a public charge’ is one who, \nby reason of poverty, insanity, or disease or disability, will \n24  probably become a charge on the public. \n25  Id. (emphasis added).13 \n26 \n                                            \n13 In 1923 a district court in Washington state did not cite these precedents and held \n27 \ninstead that Congress’s shift was an effective modification in response to Gegiow.  Ex \nparte Horn, 292 F. 455 (W.D. Wash. 1923).  Interpreting the phrase anew based on its \n28 \nplain meaning, the court reasoned that “a public charge” is “a person committed to the \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 30 of 93\n \n1  A 1921 Second Circuit opinion relying on Howe and Ex parte Mitchell held that “A \n2  person likely to become a public charge is one whom it may be necessary to support at \n3  public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, idiocy \n4  and poverty.  We think that the finding by the administrative authorities, showing a \n5  physical defect of a nature that may affect the ability of the relator and appellee to earn a \n6  living, is sufficient ground for exclusion.  His physical condition, together with his financial \n7  condition, having but $100 with him, justified the conclusion of the administrative \n8  authorities in finding that he and his children were aliens likely to become public \n9  charges.”  Wallis v. U.S. ex rel. Mannara, 273 F. 509, 511 (2d Cir. 1921) (citation \n10  omitted). \n11  A number of courts around this time also held that imprisonment was one way to \n  12  become a public charge.  E.g., Ex parte Fragoso, 11 F.2d 988, 989 (S.D. Cal. 1926) \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (“The fact is this petitioner did become a public charge. He was confined in a jail for a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  period of nine months.”); U.S. ex rel. Lehtola v. Magie, 47 F.2d 768, 770 (D.

Wash. 1923). \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  In 1933, the third edition of Black’s Law Dictionary was the first to define “public \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  charge.”  The definition relied upon many of the above-cited cases, so for that reason it is \nN\n19  derivative of and less probative than those cases themselves.  Nevertheless, the \n20  definition is instructive.  It defined the term as:  “A person whom it is necessary to support \n21  at public expense by reason of poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or \n22  idiocy and poverty. . . .  As used in [the 1917 Act], one who produces a money charge on, \n23  or an expense to, the public for support and care.”  See Black’s Law Dictionary 311 (3d \n24  Ed. 1933).  The term includes paupers as well as those who will not undertake honest \n25  pursuits or who are likely to go to prison. \n26  In 1948, the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) issued an order, which the \n27 \n                                            \ncustody of a department of the government by due course of law,” and that committing \n28 \nsomeone to prison makes him a public charge.  Id. at 457. \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 31 of 93\n \n1  acting Attorney General thereafter issued an order approving.  The order set out a very \n2  explicit test for the term “public charge” as used elsewhere in the act, which concerned \n3  deportation proceedings of aliens who are later determined to have actually become a \n4  public charge during their time in the country.  Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323 (A.G. \n5  1948). \n6  When interpreting the term as used in the deportation context, the BIA set out a 3-\n7  part test requiring (1) an individualized bill for charges incurred, that is (2) presented to \n8  the alien (or a family member) by the government, and (3) which the alien (or family \n9  member) fails to pay.   \n \n10  the following test must be applied to determine whether an alien \nhas become a public charge within the reach of the 1917 act:  \n11  (1) The State or other governing body must, by appropriate law, \nimpose a charge for the services rendered to the alien.  In other \n a  12  words, the State must have a cause of action in contract against \ntruin either the person taking advantage of the State services or \noCrof 13  other  designated  relatives  or friends.  If  there  is  no  charge \n tila made, and if the State does not have a cause of action, the \ncC\nirts fo 14  amliuesnt  cmaankneo t dbeem saanidd  tofo rb ep aay pmuebnlitc  ocfh athrgee c. h (a2r)g Tesh eu apuotnh othriotisees  \niD s tcir 15  persons made liable under State law.  And (3) there must be a \net failure to pay for the charges. If there is a failure to pay either \ns\ntaiD 16  because of lack of demand or because the State authorities do \nt\nS \nn not perform their duty to collect the charges, the alien cannot \n dere 17  be said to have become a public charge. \nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Id. at 326 (footnote omitted). \nN\n19  The BIA also reasoned that the same definition would apply to the identical term \n20  used earlier in the statute with respect to predicting whether an alien is likely to become a \n21  public charge—i.e., the provision at issue in the present action: \n \n22  First, we wish to make the following preliminary observation for \nthe purpose of clarifying the issue.  The acceptance by an alien \n23  of services provided by a State or by a subdivision of a State to \nits residents, services for which no specific charge is made, \n24  does not in and of itself make the alien a public charge within \nthe  meaning  of  the  1917  act.    To  illustrate,  an  alien  who \n25  participates, without cost to him, in an adult education program \nsponsored by the State does not become a public charge.  \n26  Similiarly [sic] with respect to an alien child who attends public \nschool, or alien child who takes advantage of the free-lunch \n27  program  offered  by  schools.    We  could  go  on ad \ninfinitum setting  forth  the  countless  municipal  and  State \n28  services which are provided to all residents, alien and citizen \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 32 of 93\n \nalike, without specific charge of the municipality or the State, \n1  and which are paid out of the general tax fund.  The fact that \nthe State or the municipality pays for the services accepted by \n2  the alien is not, then, by itself, the test of whether the alien has \nbecome a public charge. . . .  [I]f it were to be held that all aliens \n3  became public charges by accepting such services, such a \nholding  would  necessarily  result  in  making  aliens  seeking \n4  admission to the United States excludable under that clause of \nsection 3 of the act of February 5, 1917, which bars aliens likely \n5  to become public charges from entering the United States, \nprovided  it  were  shown  the  alien  would  accept  the  free \n6  municipal and State services. \n7  Id. at 324–25 & n.1. \n8  District courts had independently adopted the same meaning under the 1917 Act.  \n9  E.g., Ex parte Orzechowska, 23 F. Supp. 428, 429 (D. Or. 1938) (individual not a public \n10  charge so long as they will “pay the full amount of the cost of keeping the girl at the \n11  Oregon State Hospital”); Ex parte Kichmiriantz, 283 F. 697, 698 (N.D. Cal. 1922) (same). \n  12  This three-part test is still used for determining whether to deport those who in fact \n a\ntruin\noro 13  become public charges currently, and DHS proposes to continue doing is in the Rule.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14    Prior to the 1952 Act’s passage, at least one principle had seemingly coalesced in \niD tc 15  the case law.  The reasoning in Gegiow was reaffirmed, and multiple circuits (also \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  recognized by Black’s Law Dictionary) agreed that someone likely to become a public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge is one whom it may be necessary to support at public expense by reason of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  poverty, insanity and poverty, disease and poverty, or idiocy and poverty.  Although that \nN\n19  oft-used definition (or a close derivative) is not particularly descriptive as to what quantum \n20  of support qualifies as “necessary to support” someone at public expense, it reaffirms the \n21  principle expressed in Gegiow and prior cases that the inquiry is focused on the \n22  individual’s inherent ability to support himself.  This definition also accords with prior \n23  interpretations generally finding that, absent some particularly-identified negative factor, \n24  those who appear generally capable and willing to work are not likely to become public \n25  charges.  And unlike the Howe case, it allows reading the definition of public charge in \n26  light of the surrounding categories of excluded persons, such that someone who is \n27  excluded due to his disease alone may also be excluded because his disease, in \n28  combination with another factor like poverty, is likely to render him a public charge.  This \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 33 of 93\n \n1  remains in line with other historically-supported, consistent principles described above, \n2  namely that temporary assistance does not render one a public charge and that actual \n3  incursion of debt to the state and refusal to pay could render one a public charge. \n4    The Attorney General’s order in 1948 for the first time offered a single, clear \n5  definition of the term “public charge” to be applied consistently throughout the Act.  And it \n6  also specifically ruled that acceptance of publicly-funded services “for which no specific \n7  charge is made” does not make one a public charge.  The three-part test requiring \n8  presentation of a bill and inability or refusal to pay was certainly in accordance with a line \n9  of precedential caselaw, but it was by no means the only or even dominant line at that \n10  time.  Nevertheless, this Attorney-General-issued order was controlling as administrative \n11  law between its issuance in 1948 and at least Congress’s next codification of the \n  12  immigration statutes in 1952. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  7.  1952 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In 1952, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised \niD tc 15  statute provided, in part: \n sir\net  \ns\ntaiD 16  Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the following classes \nt\nS \nn of  aliens  shall  be  ineligible  to  receive  visas  and  shall  be \n dere 17  excluded from admission into the United States: \nh\nt\ninrt (1) Aliens who are feeble-minded; \nUoN 18  (2) Aliens who are insane; \n(3) Aliens who have had one or more attacks of insanity; \n19  . . . \n(7)  Aliens  not  comprehended  within  any  of  the  foregoing \n20  classes . . . having a physical defect, disease, or disability . . . \nto be of such a nature that it may affect the ability of the alien \n21  to earn a living, unless the alien affirmatively establishes that \nhe will not have to earn a living; \n22  (8) Aliens who are paupers, professional beggars, or vagrants;  \n. . . \n23  (15) Aliens who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time \nof  application  for  a  visa,  or  in  the  opinion  of  the  Attorney \n24  General at the time of application for admission, are likely at \nany time to become public charges” \n25   \n26  An Act to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality; and \n27  for Other Purposes, 66 Stat. 163, 183, Title 2, Chap. 2 (“1952 Act”) § 212 (1952). \n28  The 1952 Act also provided for deportation of any alien who, “in the opinion of the \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 34 of 93\n \n1  Attorney General, has within five years after entry become a public charge from causes \n2  not affirmatively shown to have arisen after entry[.]”  Id., Chap. 5  § 241(a)(8). \n3  The changes appear to be relatively minor for the purposes of this dispute.  \n4  Notably, Congress added the phrase “at any time” to specify the scope of time the public \n5  charge determination is meant to consider.  But no alteration to the phrase “public \n6  charge” appears in the statute. \n7  The 1951 edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, like the 3rd edition in 1933, assembled \n8  its definition based on precedent discussed above: \n \n9  A person whom it is necessary to support at public expense by \nreason of poverty, insanity and poverty, or idiocy and poverty.  \n10  As used in [the 1917 Act] . . ., one who produces a money \ncharge on, or an expense to, the public for support and care.  \n11  As so used, the term is not limited to paupers or those liable to \nbecome such, but includes those who will not undertake honest \n a  12  pursuits, or who are likely to become periodically the inmates \ntruin of prison.   \noCrof 13   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Charge, Public Charge, Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) (citations omitted). \niD tc 15  BIA dispositions following the passage of the 1952 Act addressed the term.  One \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  such disposition surveyed caselaw interpreting the term and held “the statute requires \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will require public support.  Some \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  specific circumstance, such as mental or physical disability, advanced age, or other fact \nN\n19  reasonably tending to show that the burden of supporting the alien is likely to be cast on \n20  the public, must be present.  A healthy person in the prime of life cannot ordinarily \n21  be considered likely to become a public charge, especially where he has friends or \n22  relatives in the United States who have indicated their ability and willingness to \n23  come to his assistance in case of emergency.”  Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. \n24  Dec. 409, 421–22 (BIA 1962) (emphasis added) (collecting cases). \n25  In that case, the agency held that the individual at issue was not likely to become a \n26  public charge given his characteristics, which essentially showed he was able to perform \n27  honest work: \n \n28  When respondent applied for a visa he was 22 years of age. \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 35 of 93\n \nHe was sound of body and had about ten years of farming \n1  experience. He had no specialized training, but had five years \nof schooling and apparently planned to seek work for which he \n2  was qualified. He spoke no English, but this was no handicap \nfor he would work among people who spoke Spanish. He had \n3  about $50 in assets. He had a brother gainfully employed in the \nUnited  States  and  he  had  other  close  relations  who  were \n4  interested in his welfare and who worked to bring him to the \nUnited  States.  The  brother  was  making  $85  a  week  in \n5  permanent  employment;  he  was  unmarried;  he  had  been \nsending money to his family in Mexico, and he was interested \n6  in helping his brother. Respondent had previous experience in \nthe United States, having spent about three months here as a \n7  contract worker. At that time he worked both in the fields and in \na cannery. His services appear to have been satisfactory for he \n8  was  retained  here  until  his  contract  was  completed. \nRespondent had no criminal record. \n9   \n10  Id. at 411. \n11  A 1974 BIA decision emphasized that the public charge determination must \n  12  consider the totality of the circumstances, and that prior welfare use alone cannot be \n a\ntruin\noro 13  determinative.  Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1974) (“The respondent's \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  reliance on welfare for support is a condition which she herself can remedy.”). \niD tc 15  Another 1974 BIA decision confused matters.  Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Dec. 583, 584 (BIA 1974).  The decision outlined “[t]he stages in decisional \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interpretations of the deportation statute, culminating in Matter of B-\": \ne\nh\nt\ninrt  \nUoN 18  1. The words “public charge” had their ordinary meaning, that \nis to say, a money charge upon or an expense to the public for \n19  support and care, the alien being destitute. \n \n20  2. The alien had not yet become a public charge, even though \nhe personally was destitute and his care and support were \n21  being paid for by public funds, if there existed close relatives, \nready,  willing  and  able  to  pay  the  bill,  but  the  appropriate \n22  government agency had failed to submit any bill. \n \n23  3. The alien had not become a public charge where the alien's \nmother had offered to make reimbursement, but under state \n24  law  payment  could  not  be  accepted  for  maintenance  and \ntreatment of the institutionalized alien. \n25   \n4.  The  alien  had  not  become  a  public  charge  where  the \n26  circumstances were like those described in 3, above, except \nthat no one had offered reimbursement. \n27   \n28  Id. at 586 (citations omitted). \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 36 of 93\n \n1  However, it reasoned that the Attorney General’s opinion in Matter of B- “is not \n2  necessarily controlling in relation to the provisions for exclusion.”  Id. at 585.  The BIA \n3  reasoned that “[w]hile it may normally be assumed that identical words used in different \n4  parts of the same statute are intended to have an identical meaning, this assumption \n5  readily yields when the legislative intent requires variant meanings in different contexts.”  \n6  Id. at 586.  The BIA then discussed legislative history in search of congressional intent.  \n7  Id.  The decision notes that the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed that courts had \n8  given different definitions to the term, and ultimately it decided not to define the term, “but \n9  rather [decided] to establish the specific qualification that the determination of whether an \n10  alien falls into that category rests within the discretion of the consular officers or the \n11  Commissioner.”  Id. at 588 (citing S. Rep. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., April 20, 1950, p. \n  12  349). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  The BIA stated that the phrase “public charge” must be “strictly construed” in the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  deportation context, but not in the exclusion context.  Id.  It then reasoned that the old-\niD tc 15  age benefits at issue in the case were “individualized public support to the needy, as \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  distinguished from essentially supplementary benefits, directed to the general welfare of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  the public as a whole.”  Id. at 589.  Even though the state would never ask for repayment \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  of those old-age benefits—and therefore they could not constitute assistance qualifying \nN\n19  one as a public charge under the Matter of B- test—the court reasoned that it would not \n20  consider “the element of reimbursement” when determining whether someone is likely to \n21  become a public charge.  Id. \n22  So, the BIA rejected the Matter of B- test and constructed alternate definitions for \n23  the same term depending on whether the executive is predicting whether someone is \n24  likely to become a public charge or deciding whether someone has already become a \n25  public charge.  “Therefore, in our opinion any alien who is incapable of earning a \n26  livelihood, who does not have sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and \n27  has no person in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not need public \n28  support is excludable as likely to become a public charge whether or not the public \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 37 of 93\n \n1  support which will be available to him is reimbursable to the state.”  Id. at 589–90. \n2  These BIA decisions are useful to understand the administrative practices and \n3  interpretations operating when Congress reenacted the same language.  Although this \n4  period saw confusion within the agency about the proper way to interpret the phrase as \n5  used in different contexts, each of the discussed decisions support the now-consistent \n6  theme that a healthy person in the prime of life who can work cannot be considered likely \n7  to become a public charge, absent some particularly-identified circumstance evaluated \n8  under a totality of the circumstances.  E.g., Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I. & N. Dec. at \n9  422 (collecting cases); Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. at 589 (“alien who is \n10  incapable of earning a livelihood”); Matter of Perez, 15 I. & N. Dec. at 137 (totality of \n11  circumstances). \n  12  8.  1987 \n a\ntruin\noro 13  In 1987, the INS issued a final rule, effective May 1, 1987, following notice and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  comment.  See Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 Fed. Reg. 16,205 (May 1, \niD tc 15  1987).  The rule implemented section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act as \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  amended by section 201 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  Id. at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  16,205.  So, the 1987 rule concerned the term “public charge” as used elsewhere in the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  INA, specifically for aliens adjusting their status to that of aliens lawfully admitted for \nN\n19  temporary residence.  The “key issues” subject to comments “were the public charge and \n20  special rule for determination of public charge[.]”  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,206.   \n21  That rule provided:  “An applicant . . . is subject to the provisions of section \n22  212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to become public charges \n23  unless the applicant demonstrates a history of employment in the United States \n24  evidencing self-support without receipt of public cash assistance. . . .  If the alien's \n25  period(s) of residence in the United States include significant gaps in employment or if \n26  there is reason to believe that the alien may have received public assistance while \n27  employed, the alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received \n28  public cash assistance.”  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,211.   \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 38 of 93\n \n1  Essentially, this provision exempted aliens who had been working domestically \n2  from the normal public charge analysis, so long as they could prove a work history and \n3  that they had not relied on public cash assistance.  The rule defined cash assistance to \n4  exclude in-kind benefits.  52 Fed. Reg. at 16,209 (“‘Public cash assistance’ means \n5  income or needs-based monetary assistance, to include but not limited to supplemental \n6  security income, received by the alien or his or her immediate family members through \n7  federal, state, or local programs designed to meet subsistence levels.  It does not include \n8  assistance in kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits, nor \n9  does it include work-related compensation or certain types of medical assistance \n10  (Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or children \n11  under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public health).”). \n  12  This use of the term is somewhat of an aberration given that it essentially \n a\ntruin\noro 13  concerned an exception to the statute at issue here—and it did not define the term.  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  However, it did reinforce the long-standing principle underlying the construction of the \niD tc 15  term that, when considering whether someone should be admitted to the country, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  concept of “public charge” concerns primarily the prospect of gainful employment or \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  some other private source of support. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  9.  1990 \nN\n19  In 1990, Congress revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised statute \n20  provided, in part: \n \n21  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Act,  the  following \ndescribes classes of excludable aliens who are ineligible to \n22  receive visas and who shall be excluded from admission into \nthe United States: \n23   \n(1) Health-Related Grounds \n24  . . . \n(2) Criminal and Related Grounds \n25  . . .  \n(3) Security and Related Grounds \n26  . . .  \n(4) Public  Charge.—Any  alien  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the \n27  consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the \nopinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for \n28  admission  or  adjustment  of  status,  is  likely  at  any  time  to \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 39 of 93\n \nbecome a public charge is excludable. \n1   \n2  Immigration Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 4978, Title 6 § 601 (1990). \n3  This version of the bill removed language referring to the feeble-minded, paupers, \n4  professional beggars, and vagrants.  There is a suggestion in the Congressional Record \n5  that the removed terms were meant to be consolidated within the public charge category: \n \n6  The  bill  removes  some  of  the  antiquated  and  unused \nexclusions that have been in our law since the early 1900's, \n7  such as the exclusions based on illiteracy, and the exclusions \nfor  aliens  who  are  \"paupers,  professional  beggars,  or \n8  vagrants.\" These relics have been replaced by one generic \nstandard which exclude aliens who are \"likely to become a \n9  public charge.\"   \n10  136 Cong. Rec. 36797, 36844 (1990). \n11  In 1990, Black’s Law Dictionary defined “public charge” as “an indigent.  A person \n  12  whom it is necessary to support at public expense by reason of poverty alone or illness \n a\ntruin\noro 13  and poverty.”  Charge, Public Charge, Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Although a statutory term is not defined by reference to one preferred \niD tc 15  interpretation memorialized in the Congressional Record, that interpretation is consistent \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  with the courts’ and executive’s general treatment of the term since Gegiow.  That is, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  following Gegiow and later cases applying it to the 1917 Act, courts had read the term \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  public charge in context of those surrounding terms rather than in exclusion of them, and \nN\n19  focused on the alien’s ability to work or otherwise provide for himself, which each of the \n20  omitted surrounding terms also ultimately spoke to.  But see Howe, 247 F. at 294. \n21  10.  1996 \n22  In 1996, Congress again revised the laws relating to immigration.  That revised \n23  statute provided, in part: \n \n24  (4) PUBLIC CHARGE.— \n \n25  (A) IN GENERAL.—Any alien who, in the opinion of the \nconsular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in \n26  the  opinion  of  the  Attorney  General  at  the  time  of \napplication  for  admission  or  adjustment  of  status,  is \n27  likely  at  any  time  to  become  a  public  charge  is \nexcludable. \n28   \n39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 40 of 93\n \n(B) FACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.— \n1   \n(i) In determining whether an alien is excludable \n2  under this paragraph, the consular officer or the \nAttorney General shall at a minimum consider the \n3  alien's— \n \n4  (I) age; \n(II) health; \n5  (III) family status; \n(IV)  assets,  resources,  and  financial \n6  status; and \n(V) education and skills. \n7   \n(ii) In addition to the factors under clause (i), the \n8  consular officer or the Attorney General may also \nconsider any affidavit of support under section \n9  213A  for  purposes  of  exclusion  under  this \nparagraph. \n10   \n11  Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 110 Stat. 3009, Title 5 § 531 (1996).  This act \n  12  is often referred to as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (“IIRIRA”).  Elsewhere, the Act provided that “Any alien who, within five years after the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  date of entry, has become a public charge from causes not affirmatively shown to have \niD tc 15  arisen since entry is deportable.”  8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(5) (effective April 24, 1996). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The revised law used the same relevant language as all previous versions—public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  charge.  However, the statute then listed five factors that Congress instructed must be \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  considered when determining whether an alien is likely to become a public charge, and it \nN\n19  identified another factor that “may also” be considered. \n20  Contemporaneously, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n21  Reconciliation Act (“PRWORA”), Pub. L. 104-193, restricted most aliens from accessing \n22  many public support programs for a period of time. \n23  During legislative efforts that ultimately resulted in the IIRIRA, a group of \n24  legislators proposed to define “public charge” with particularity in the statute to include \n25  “any alien who receives benefits described in subparagraph (D) for an aggregate period \n26  of at least 12 months” (or 36 months in the case of a battered spouse or child).  142 \n27  Cong. Rec. 24313, 24425 (1996).  The benefits listed in subparagraph D (that would \n28  qualify an alien as a public charge) included “means-tested public benefits,” but it’s not \n40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 41 of 93\n \n1  entirely clear what specific benefits that section refers to.14  That definition was not \n2  enacted into law. \n3  11.  1999 \n4  The INS attempted in 1999 to engage in rulemaking to guide immigration officers, \n5  aliens, and the public in understanding the public charge determinations.  No final rule \n6  was ever issued.  Instead, the agency published Field Guidance addressing the issue.  \n7  See Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 \n8  Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999) (the “1999 Field Guidance”).  \n9  The notice was published prior to final rulemaking because it was deemed \n10  “necessary to help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of the term ‘public charge’ \n11  in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, State, and local public \n  12  benefits.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  “The Department decided to publish a proposed rule \n a\ntruin\noro 13  defining ‘public charge’ in order to reduce the negative public health consequences \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  generated by the existing confusion and to provide aliens with better guidance as to the \niD tc 15  types of public benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  determinations.”  Id.  The notice “both summarizes longstanding law with respect to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  public charge and provides new guidance on public charge determinations in light of the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  recent changes in law,” notably the “Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nN\n19  Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) and welfare reform laws.”  Id. \n20  The notice proposed “that ‘public charge’ means an alien who has become (for \n21  deportation purposes) or who is likely to become (for admission/adjustment purposes) \n22  ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the \n23  receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for \n24  long-term care at government expense.’  Institutionalization for short periods of \n25  rehabilitation does not constitute such primary dependence.”  Id. \n26 \n                                            \n14 The record refers to Section 213A(e)(1), which appears to have been codified at 8 \n27 \nU.S.C § 1183a(e), but that does not describe means-tested benefits.  The currently-\noperative version of 8 U.S. Code § 1183a(a)(1)(B) also appears to errantly refer to \n28 \nsubsection (e) for a list of means-tested benefits, so this error is not unique. \n41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 42 of 93\n \n1  Following the implementation of that interpretation, “officers should not place any \n2  weight on the receipt of non-cash public benefits (other than institutionalization) or the \n3  receipt of cash benefits for purposes other than for income maintenance with respect to \n4  determinations of admissibility or eligibility for adjustment on public charge grounds.”  Id. \n5  Summarizing current agency practice, the memo explained: \n \n6  The  standard  for  adjudicating  inadmissibility  under  section \n212(a)(4) has been developed in several Service, BIA, and \n7  Attorney  General  decisions  and  has  been  codified  in  the \nService regulations implementing the legalization provisions of \n8  the  Immigration  Reform  and  Control  Act  of  1986.  These \ndecisions and regulations, and section 212(a)(4) itself, create a \n9  “totality of the circumstances” test. \n \n10  In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public \ncharge,  Service  officers  should  assess  the  financial \n11  responsibility of the alien by examining the “totality of the alien's \ncircumstances at the time of his or her application * * * The \n a  12  existence or absence of a particular factor should never be the \ntruin sole criterion for determining if an alien is likely to become a \noCrof 13  public  charge.  The  determination  of  financial  responsibility \n tila should be a prospective evaluation based on the alien's age, \ncC\nirts fo 14  heedaulctha,t iofanm, ailny ds tsaktiullss,,  aamssoentsg,  orethseoru fraccetso rasn. d  Afnin aanliceina l msatayt ubse,  \niD s tcir 15  considered likely to become a public charge even if there is no \net legal obligation to reimburse the benefit-granting agency for the \ns\ntaiD 16  benefits or services received, in contrast to the standards for \nt\nS \nn deportation, discussed below. \n dere 17   \nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Id. at 28,690 (footnotes omitted). \nN\n19  The 1999 Field Guidance then explained that the three-part test for paying back \n20  public debt continues to apply, but only as an additional test on top of the totality of the \n21  circumstances test for deportation decisions: \n \n22  Repayment  is  relevant  to  the  public  charge  inadmissibility \ndetermination only in very limited circumstances.  If at the time \n23  of application for admission or adjustment of status the alien is \ndeportable on public charge grounds under section 237(a)(5) \n24  of the INA due to an outstanding public debt for a cash benefit \nor the costs of institutionalization, then the alien is inadmissible.  \n25  Only a debt that satisfies the three-part [Matter of B-] test under \nsection  237(a)(5),  described  below,  will  render  an  alien \n26  deportable  as  a  public  charge  and  therefore  ineligible  for \nadmission or adjustment. If the debt is paid, then the alien will \n27  no longer be inadmissible based on the debt, and the usual \ntotality of the circumstances test would apply. \n28   \n42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 43 of 93\n \n1  Id. \n2  The Feld Guidance explained that a compelling reason to limit the public charge \n3  definition to those receiving cash is that “certain federal, state, and local benefits are \n4  increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, \n5  reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general public health and \n6  nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of \n7  becoming self-sufficient.  Thus, participation in such non-cash programs is not evidence \n8  of poverty or dependence.”  Id. at 28,692 \n9  12.  2013 \n10  In 2013, the Senate voted down two amendments to a never-passed bill regarding \n11  immigration.  The first amendment proposed “expanding the criteria for ‘public charge,’ \n  12  such that applicants would have to show they were not likely to qualify even for non-cash \n a\ntruin\noro 13  employment supports such as Medicaid, the SNAP program, or the Children's Health \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Insurance Program (CHIP). . . .  [T]he amendment was rejected by voice vote.”  S. Rep. \niD tc 15  No. 113-40, at 42 (2013). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The second amendment “would have expanded the definition of ‘public charge’ \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  such that people who received non-cash health benefits could not become legal \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  permanent residents.  This amendment would also have denied entry to individuals \nN\n19  whom the Department of Homeland Security determines are likely to receive these types \n20  of benefits in the future.  The amendment was not agreed to by a voice vote.”  S. Rep. \n21  No. 113-40, at 63 (2013). \n22  13.  2019—The Rule \n23  On October 10, 2018, DHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the \n24  Federal Register.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114.  The NPRM provided a 60-day public \n25  comment period, during which 266,077 comments were collected.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at \n26  41,297.  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal Register. \n27  The Rule supersedes the 1999 Field Guidance’s definition of “public charge,” \n28  establishing a new definition based on a minimum time threshold for the receipt of public \n43 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 44 of 93\n \n1  benefits.  Under the newly-proposed “12/36 standard,” a public charge is defined as an \n2  individual who receives designated public benefits for more than 12 months in the \n3  aggregate within a 36-month period, although a single month where multiple types of \n4  benefits are received is counted as multiple months of receiving aid.  84 Fed. Reg. at \n5  41,295.  The “public benefits” included are extended by the Rule to include many non-\n6  cash benefits, for example Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”), Section \n7  8 Housing Programs, Medicaid, and Public Housing.  Id. at 41,501.  Receipt of two \n8  categories of benefits in the same months counts as two months of receipt for benefits, \n9  so some will qualify as public charges without receiving benefits for 12 months.  \n10  Moreover, the rule is agnostic to the value (or cost to the government) of the benefits.  To \n11  take a plausible example, someone receiving $182 over 36 months—or an average of \n  12  less than 17 cents a day—in SNAP benefits is a public charge under the Rule.  See \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Shing Decl. ¶ 17. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The Rule does not change the definition of public charge in the context of \niD tc 15  deportability, described elsewhere in the INA.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295 (“This rule does \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  not interpret or change DHS’s implementation of the public charge ground of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  deportability.”).  Rather, DHS will continue to enforce the 1999 Field Guidance in the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  deportation context.  Id. at 41,304 (“DHS currently makes public charge determinations in \nN\n19  accordance with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance. . . .  This guidance explains how the \n20  agency determines . . . whether a person has become a public charge within five years of \n21  entry”).  The 1999 Field Guidance, which will continue to govern, provided that “the \n22  definition of public charge is the same for both admission/adjustment and deportation,” \n23  although “the standards applied to public charge adjudications in each context are \n24  significantly different” because one is forward-looking and one is backward-looking.  64 \n25  Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  As such, following the implementation of the Rule, “public charge” \n26  will continue to be defined in the deportation context as “an alien who has become . . . \n27  ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either (i) the \n28  receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for \n44 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 45 of 93\n \n1  long-term care at government expense.’”  Id.  To assess whether an alien qualifies under \n2  that definition in the deportability context, the 1999 Field Guidance prescribes the 3-part \n3  test established in Matter of B-, 3 I. & N. Dec. 323. \n4  So, the Rule proposes to simultaneously apply multiple definitions for the term \n5  public charge.  First, its new definition will be used to predict whether an alien is likely at \n6  any time to become a public charge.  Second, the 1999 Field Guidance’s “primary \n7  dependence” definition is left unaltered in the deportation context, and it is evaluated \n8  pursuant to the well-known 3-part Matter of B- test. \n9  Each step in the Chevron analysis requires the court to consider the terms of the \n10  statute in context.  The court first looks to the statutory text, in light of prior agency and \n11  judicial interpretation—as explained at length above, although the court notes that judicial \n  12  and agency interpretation following the most-recent 1996 revision is not particularly \n a\ntruin\noro 13  relevant to understanding the meaning of the text as enacted in 1996.  Cf. Sec'y of the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 375 n.36 (1984) (the “view of a subsequent Congress \niD tc 15  . . . is not without persuasive value”). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The analysis is also informed to some degree by what Congress decided not to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  pass, in addition to what it specifically rejected.  “Congress does not intend sub silentio to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other language.”  \nN\n19  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 442–43; Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U.S. at 414 n.8 \n20  (rejecting construction of statute that would implement provision Conference Committee \n21  rejected); Bob Jones Univ., 461 U.S. at 600–01 (interpretation of statute informed by the \n22  fact that Congress had a “prolonged and acute awareness” of an established agency \n23  interpretation of a statute, considered the precise issue, and rejected bills to overturn the \n24  prevailing interpretation); see also Merrill Lynch, 456 U.S. at 381–82 (interpretation of \n25  statute informed by the fact that Congress amended large portions of statute, but not \n26  provision at issue). \n27  Of particular relevance here, parts of Congress have explicitly and repeatedly \n28  rejected efforts to define “public charge” to include those who receive certain in-kind \n45 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 46 of 93\n \n1  benefits for a period of 12 months—efforts that are strikingly similar to the definition now \n2  adopted for the first time by the executive in the Rule.  E.g., 142 Cong. Rec. 24313, \n3  24425 (1996); S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 42 (2013); S. Rep. No. 113-40, at 63 (2013).  \n4  Congress’s rejection in 1996 is particularly instructive.  As described above, Congress at \n5  that time considered a scheme similar to the Rule, wherein use of means-tested benefits \n6  for 12 months would qualify one as a public charge.  On September 24, 1996, the \n7  conference committee recommended passage of a version of the bill with that definition.  \n8  See 142 Cong. Rec. 24389 (conference committee recommendation), 24425 (public \n9  charge definition).  President Clinton had previously praised the legislation generally, but \n10  specifically criticized that bill’s disincentive to obtain public benefits.  He called for \n11  revision of the statute.  He said “it still goes too far in denying legal immigrants access to \n  12  vital safety net programs which could jeopardize public health and safety.  Some work \n a\ntruin\noro 13  still needs to be done.  I urge the Congress to move quickly to finalize and send me this \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  key legislation.”  Statement on Senate Action on the “Immigration Control and Financial \niD tc 15  Responsibility Act of 1996”, President William J. Clinton, Weekly Compilation of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Presidential Documents Volume 32, Issue 18 (May 6, 1996) at p. 783.  On September 30, \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  1996, the bill was signed into law, following the removal of the definition of public charge \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  that included use of means-tested public benefits.  This exchange, which deals with the \nN\n19  precise issue presented by this litigation, is particularly instructive not because of the \n20  president’s words but because of Congress’s response to those words—it intentionally \n21  considered and rejected a definition similar to what the Rule now proposes.  Afterall it is \n22  Congress, not the President, who is responsible for writing legislation. \n23  Given the term’s long-standing focus on the individual’s ability and willingness to \n24  work or otherwise support himself, and its longstanding allowance for short-term aid, and \n25  the legislative history of the 1996 revision, it is likely that the Rule’s interpretation defining \n26  anyone who receives any quantity of benefits for 12 months (or fewer) out of a floating \n27  36-month window as a public charge is not a permissible or reasonable construction of \n28  the statute.  For example, defendants do not contest that someone receiving less than 50 \n46 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 47 of 93\n \n1  cents per day—which is a standard SNAP benefit amount for recipients at the higher end \n2  of income eligibility, Shing Decl. ¶ 17—would be deemed a public charge under the Rule.  \n3  That could also be calculated as $182 over 36 months—or an average of less than 17 \n4  cents a day.  At no point over the long history described above could that have qualified \n5  one as a public charge, unless the bill for those charges was presented to the recipient \n6  and he refused to pay.  Moreover, the Rule’s double-counting of months where multiple \n7  benefits are received raises serious questions with respect to whether the Rule \n8  impermissibly considers temporary or short-term relief, receipt of which has never been \n9  sufficient to qualify someone as a public charge (absent repayment, following \n10  presentation of an invoice). \n11  Deciding otherwise would put this court at odds with persuasive Supreme Court \n  12  and Ninth Circuit precedent.  The Supreme Court has defined the term to allow exclusion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  only “on the ground of permanent personal objections accompanying them [the excluded \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  aliens] irrespective of local conditions[.]”  Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10.  In that case, “the \niD tc 15  aliens came from a remote province of Russia. They knew no trade. They knew no \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  language but their own. Only one could read or write in his own language. They had \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  sums aggregating slightly more than $25 each. They were not employed, and had no \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  promise of employment. They were ticketed through to Portland, Or., where, owing to \nN\n19  depressed labor conditions, the prospect of their obtaining work ‘was most unfavorable.’”  \n20  Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, 277 F. at 916 (citing Gegiow, 239 U.S. at 10).  Still, they \n21  were not likely to become public charges within the meaning of the statute.  The Ninth \n22  Circuit reaffirmed that definition following reorganization of the statute.  Id. (“change of \n23  location of the words does not change the meaning that should be given them”).  Since \n24  Gegiow and Ex parte Hosaye Sakaguchi, Congress has not altered the term “public \n25  charge,” which the Ninth Circuit has defined standing alone, irrespective of its placement \n26  or context within the list of excluded persons in the statute.  The court therefore sees no \n27  good reason to depart from those precedential opinions, which suggest that an able-\n28  bodied, working-age individual who is willing to engage in honest work is not excludable \n47 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 48 of 93\n \n1  based on a prediction that he will become a public charge unless a particular reason can \n2  be articulated to exclude him.  This reasoning does not allow for exclusion based on the \n3  increasing generosity of society’s public assistance to provide for more than the barest \n4  requirements of subsistence.  Gegiow, in fact, explicitly precludes consideration of local \n5  labor conditions.  \n6  The likely unreasonableness of the rule is further demonstrated by just how \n7  expansive the definition is.  The history of the term, evidenced by its repeated verbatim \n8  reenactment, excluded those who were likely to become public charges based on \n9  poverty, or idiocy and poverty, or disease and poverty, etc.  But plaintiffs demonstrate \n10  that in a single year, roughly a quarter U.S.-born citizens receive one or more benefits \n11  used to define who is a public charge under the Rule.  And plaintiffs demonstrate that, \n  12  over the course of their lifetimes, about 40% of U.S.-born citizens are expected to receive \n a\ntruin\noro 13  one or more of those benefits.  Although these figures do not indicate what percent of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  U.S.-born citizens would actually be deemed public charges under the Rule (that would \niD tc 15  require determining how many individuals receive multiple benefits per month, in addition \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  to how many months benefits are received over any 3-year period), it suggests that the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Rule is substantially outside the bounds of a reasonable interpretation of the statute. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  With regard to plaintiffs’ claim that the Rule is not in accordance with law, for the \nN\n19  foregoing reasons, and given the above discussion of the term’s long-standing use and \n20  evolution in the immigration statutes, this court finds that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on \n21  the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule’s definition of public charge is \n22  unreasonable and not based on a permissible construction of the statute, under the \n23  second prong of the Chevron analysis.15  Alternatively, plaintiffs have raised at least \n24  serious questions with respect to whether “the statute, read in context, unambiguously \n25  forecloses” the precise question at issue, namely DHS’s expansive interpretation of the \n26  term to include individuals willing and able work productively in the national economy, \n27 \n                                            \n15 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this question, they have \n28 \nundoubtedly raised serious questions with respect to it. \n48 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 49 of 93\n \n1  under the first prong of the Chevron analysis.  See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 137 S. \n2  Ct. 1562, 1572 (2017); see also Whitman v. Am. Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457, \n3  471 (2001) (finding a particular construction “unambiguously bar[red]” when “interpreted \n4  in its statutory and historical context”). \n5  b.  Not in Accordance with Law—Rehabilitation Act \n6  The Rehabilitation Act prohibits “any program or activity receiving federal financial \n7  assistance” or “any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency,” from \n8  excluding, denying benefits to, or discriminating against persons with disabilities.  29 \n9  U.S.C. § 794(a).   \n10  “To establish a violation of § 504 of the RA [Rehabilitation Act], a plaintiff must \n11  show that (1) she is handicapped within the meaning of the RA; (2) she is otherwise \n  12  qualified for the benefit or services sought; (3) she was denied the benefit or services \n a\ntruin\noro 13  solely by reason of her handicap; and (4) the program providing the benefit or services \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  receives federal financial assistance.”  Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 (9th Cir. \niD tc 15  2002); 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  solely by reason of her or his disability, be . . . subjected to discrimination under . . . any \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  program or activity conducted by any Executive agency”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  The States argue that the Rule will exclude some individuals solely based on \nN\n19  disability because a disability will predictably be responsible for a number of negative \n20  factors in some individuals:  (1) a negative health factor because the Rule adopts a \n21  definition of “health” that strongly overlaps with disability; (2) a negative factor if the \n22  applicant lacks private insurance; and (3) a negative factor if the applicant has received \n23  Medicaid for 12 of the last 36 months, even though use of Medicaid is common for the \n24  disabled because it covers services that no other insurer provides. \n25  Defendants first argue that the Rule’s multi-factor test means the Rehabilitation \n26  Act is not violated because disability cannot be the “sole” determinative factor.  Second, \n27  they argue that even if the statutes are in conflict, a specific, later statutory command—\n28  such as the INA’s requirement that the agency consider health—supersedes section \n49 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 50 of 93\n \n1  504’s general proscription. \n2  First, the Rehabilitation Act requires that a plaintiff show that a disabled person \n3  was denied services “solely” by reason of her disability.  The Rule does not deny any \n4  alien admission into the United States, or adjustment of status, “solely by reason of” \n5  disability.  All covered aliens, disabled or not, are subject to the same inquiry:  whether \n6  they are likely to use one or more covered federal benefits for the specified period of \n7  time.  Even though a disability is likely to be an underlying cause of some individuals \n8  qualifying for additional negative factors, it will not be the sole cause.  As such, disability \n9  is one non-dispositive factor.16   \n10  Second, the INA explicitly lists “health” as a factor that an officer “shall . . . \n11  consider” in making a public charge determination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  “Health” \n  12  includes an alien’s disability and whatever impact the disability may have on the alien’s \n a\ntruin\noro 13  expenses and ability to work.  Congress, not the Rule, requires DHS to take this factor \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  into account, and the caselaw has long considered this factor.  See, e.g., Knutzen v. \niD tc 15  Eben Ezer Lutheran Hous. Ctr., 815 F.2d 1343, 1353 (10th Cir. 1987) (section 504 may \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  not “revoke or repeal . . . a much more specific statute . . . absent express language by \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Congress”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  As such, plaintiffs have not demonstrated even serious questions going the merits \nN\n19  with respect to this claim. \n20  c.  Arbitrary and Capricious \n \n21  Section 4 of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553, prescribes a three-step \nprocedure  for  so-called  “notice-and-comment  rulemaking.”  \n22  First, the agency must issue a “[g]eneral notice of proposed rule \nmaking,”  ordinarily  by  publication  in  the  Federal \n23  Register.  § 553(b).  Second, if “notice [is] required,” the agency \nmust “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in \n24 \n                                            \n25 \n16 Plaintiffs’ citation to Lovell is unavailing.  They claim the case found a multi-factor test \nviolated the Act, “notwithstanding other factors” unrelated to disability.  But in Lovell, \n26 \ndefendants asked the court to look at a multifactored system, but the court declined and \ninstead looked at treatment of the disabled under a single program.  It was “undisputed \n27 \nthat disabled people who, but for their disability, were eligible for healthcare benefits from \nthe State under” that single program “were denied coverage because of the categorical \n28 \nexclusion of the disabled from” that program.

An agency must consider and respond \nto significant comments received during the period for public \n2  comment.  Third, when the agency promulgates the final rule, \nit must include in the rule's text “a concise general statement of \n3  [its] basis and purpose.”  § 553(c).  Rules issued through the \nnotice-and-comment  process  are  often  referred  to  as \n4  “legislative rules” because they have the “force and effect of \nlaw.”  Chrysler Corp. v.

A rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency has \noro 13 \nCf\n tila “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for \ncC\nirts fo 14  its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that \niD tc 15 \n seirt it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”  Id. \ns\ntaiD 16 \nt\nS n Agencies are required to “reflect upon the information contained in the record and \n dre 17 \ne\nh\ntinrt grapple with contrary evidence.”  Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v.

EPA, 890 F.3d 304, 311–12 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  And where an \n21 \nagency is uncertain about the effects of agency action, it may not rely on “‘substantial \n22 \nuncertainty’ as a justification for its actions.”  Greater Yellowstone Coal., Inc. v. Servheen, \n23 \n665 F.3d 1015, 1028 (9th Cir. 2011).  Instead, it must “rationally explain why the \n24 \nuncertainty” supports the chosen approach.  Id.

Citizen, Inc. v. FAA, 988 F.2d 186, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \n11  Rule changes face a higher burden when departing from prior policy:  \n \n a  12  Agencies are free to change their existing policies as long as \ntruin they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.  When an \noCrof 13  agency changes its existing position, it need not always provide \n tila a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new \ncC\nirts fo 14  pdoislpiclya yc raewaateredn oens sa  tbhlaatn kit  sisla cteh.a  nBguint gth peo asgiteionnc ya nmdu ssth oawt l ethaastt  \niD s tcir 15  there are good reasons for the new policy.  In explaining its \net changed  position,  an  agency  must  also  be  cognizant  that \ns\ntaiD 16  longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance \nt\nS \nn interests that must be taken into account.  In such cases it is \n dere 17  not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of \nh\nt\ninrt policy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed for \nUoN 18  disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were \nengendered by the prior policy.  It follows that an unexplained \n19  inconsistency  in  agency  policy  is  a  reason  for  holding  an \ninterpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from \n20  agency practice.  An arbitrary and capricious regulation of this \nsort is itself unlawful and receives no Chevron deference.  \n21   \n22  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125–26 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); \n23  accord F.C.C. v.

The court addresses \n52 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 53 of 93\n \n1  them in two general categories.  First, the court considers plaintiffs arguments that DHS \n2  failed to adequately consider and address the Rule’s costs and benefits.  Second, the \n3  court considers plaintiffs’ remaining procedural challenges. \n4  i.  DHS Failed to Adequately Consider Costs and Benefits \n5  Plaintiffs argue that DHS failed to consider costs and benefits in three ways.  First, \n6  DHS failed to adequately consider significant costs to local and state governments raised \n7  in comments, as well as the related issue of DHS’s failure to consider evidence when \n8  estimating disenrollment figures.  Second, DHS failed to consider concerns about health \n9  effects like disease outbreaks.  Third, DHS acted impermissibly with respect to the \n10  burden the I-944 form would impose. \n11  Based on plaintiffs’ first and second arguments, discussed presently, this court \n  12  finds that they are likely to succeed on the merits with respect to their claim that the Rule \n a\ntruin\noro 13  is arbitrary and capricious.17   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  A.  Local and State Government Costs and \niD tc 15  Disenrollment Rates \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Plaintiffs argue that commenters documented the dangers to individuals and public \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  health generally that stem from disenrollment in public benefits, and explained that local \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  and state governments will face higher costs because of this disenrollment.  See 84 Fed. \nN\n19  Reg. at 41,310-12 (explaining that “[m]any commenters particularly emphasized that \n20  disenrollment or foregoing enrollment would be detrimental to the financial stability and \n21  economy of communities, States, local organizations, hospitals, safety net providers, \n22  foundations, and healthcare centers”); id. at 41,469–70; Case No. 19-cv-04717-PJH, \n23  Dkt. 44, Exs. C–E (letters submitted in response to NPRM).  Numerous comments \n24  included specific cost calculations.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,475 (citing specific cost \n25  estimates from comments); Cho Decl., Ex. C at 22–23 (estimating losses to California at \n26  $1.76 billion in revenue from federal government and 17,700 jobs), Ex. J at 11 \n27 \n                                            \n17 For the same reasons that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this claim, they have \n28 \nundoubtedly raised serious questions with respect to it. \n53 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 54 of 93\n \n1  (estimating that the Rule would cost hospitals more than $17 billion in uncompensated \n2  care), Ex. K at 5–7 (detailing expected costs to hospitals). \n3  Plaintiffs relatedly argue that DHS under-estimated disenrollment figures and the \n4  accompanying effects, including the effects on state and local governments.18  For \n5  example, despite its concession that the Rule will cause members of mixed-status \n6  households (i.e., those including U.S. citizens) to disenroll from benefits, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n7  41,300, DHS refused to consider the costs associated with such disenrollment, stating:  \n8  “DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens exempt from \n9  public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or forego \n10  enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule.  \n11  DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.”  Id. at 41,313.  \n  12  Defendants correctly argue that they are not required to quantify every potential \n a\ntruin\noro 13  cost and benefit and precisely weigh them out.  They respond to these challenges both in \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  the Rule and before the court with three essential points.  First, DHS read the comments, \niD tc 15  but the forward-looking economic impact to states, cities, hospitals, and others was too \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  difficult to assess.  Second, with respect to the disenrollment of those who will not be \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  subject to a public charge assessment in the future, the Rule’s effect was too difficult to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  assess.  Third, even if DHS had assessed those costs, they would be outweighed by the \nN\n19  benefits of excluding aliens who would rely on public assistance, and of promoting self-\n20  sufficiency of aliens already in the United States.  Those benefits are in line with \n21  Congressional statements of policy. \n22  DHS was required to a certain extent to grapple with estimates and credible data \n23 \n                                            \n24 \n18 DHS argues that it’s 2.5% figure is not part of the regulatory analysis and cannot be \nchallenged because it was calculated pursuant to an executive order.  The court \n25 \ndisagrees.  See Council of Parent Attorneys & Advocates, Inc. v. DeVos, 365 F. Supp. 3d \n28, 54 n.11 (D.D.C. 2019) (“The government contended . . . that because its regulatory \n26 \nimpact analysis was conducted pursuant to Executive Orders, it is not subject to judicial \nreview. . . .  These arguments are contrary to D.C. Circuit precedent.  Because the \n27 \ngovernment relied on its cost-benefit analysis . . . a flaw in that analysis can render the \nregulation arbitrary and capricious.”).  \n28 \n \n54 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 55 of 93\n \n1  explained in the comments, and in turn explain why DHS chose not to credit them.  See \n2  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Zinke, 900 F.3d 1053, 1068–69 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding \n3  agency action arbitrary and capricious where the agency did not explain why it did not \n4  credit available data that did not support its action).  Defendants are correct that DHS \n5  was not required to parse costs and benefits precisely.  But to the extent the exact harms \n6  are unknown or difficult to predict, that does not justify “disregarding the effect entirely.” \n7  Pub. Citizen v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., 374 F.3d 1209, 1219 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \n8  Here, even under the deferential APA analysis, DHS appears to have wholly failed \n9  to engage with this entire category of comments.  DHS failed to grapple with the Rule’s \n10  predictable effects on local governments, and instead concluded that the harms—\n11  whatever they may be—are an acceptable price to pay.  At minimum, the APA requires \n  12  more than reading public comments and responding with a general statement that, \n a\ntruin\noro 13  however correct the comments may be, the agency declines to consider the issues and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  costs identified because doing so would contravene the government’s favored policy. \niD tc 15  For example, under the heading “Increased Costs to Health Care Providers, \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  States, and Localities,” the government summarized the comments it was responding to:   \nt\nS \nn  \n dere 17  Many commenters particularly emphasized that disenrollment \nh\nt\ninrt or foregoing enrollment would be detrimental to the financial \nUoN 18  stability  and  economy  of  communities,  States,  local \norganizations, hospitals, safety net providers, foundations, and \n19  healthcare  centers.  Commenters  offering  estimates  on  the \nnumber of people who would disenroll from Medicaid under the \n20  proposed  rule  warned  that  the  costs  associated  with  the \nresultant rise in uncompensated care would be borne by health \n21  systems, hospitals, and insured patients. \n22  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312.   \n23  The government’s response, in part, was: \n \n24  Response: With respect to the rule's potential “chilling effects” \nor  disenrollment  impacts,  DHS  notes  that  (1)  the  rule's \n25  overriding consideration, i.e., the Government's interest as set \nforth in PRWORA, is a sufficient basis to move forward; (2) it is \n26  difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts with respect \nto the regulated population, although DHS has attempted to do \n27  so in the accompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis; and \n(3) it is also difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment impacts \n28  with  respect  to  people  who  are  not  regulated  by  this rule, \n55 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 56 of 93\n \nalthough,  again,  DHS  has  attempted  to  do  so  in  the \n1  accompanying Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. \n \n2  First, as discussed above, this rule is rationally related to the \nGovernment's  interest,  as  set  forth  in  PRWORA,  to:  (1) \n3  Minimize the incentive of aliens who attempt to immigrate to, or \nadjust status in the United States due to the availability of public \n4  benefits; and (2) Promote the self-sufficiency of aliens within \nthe United States.  DHS has defined public benefits by focusing \n5  on cash assistance programs for income maintenance, and an \nexhaustive  list  of  non-cash  food,  housing,  and  healthcare, \n6  designed to meet basic living needs. This definition does not \ninclude benefits related exclusively to emergency response, \n7  immunization, education, or social services, nor does it include \nexclusively  state  and  local  non-cash  aid  programs.  DHS \n8  acknowledges that individuals subject to this rule may decline \nto enroll in, or may choose to disenroll from, public benefits for \n9  which they may be eligible under PRWORA, in order to avoid \nnegative consequences as a result of this final rule.  However, \n10  DHS has authority to take past, current, and likely future receipt \nof public benefits into account, even where it may ultimately \n11  result in discouraging aliens from receiving public benefits. \n \n a  12  Although  individuals  may  reconsider  their  receipt  of  public \ntruin benefits as defined by this rule in light of future immigration \noCrof 13  consequences,  this  rule  does  not  prohibit  an  alien  from \n tila obtaining a public benefit for which he or she is eligible. DHS \ncC\nirts fo 14  enxopneimctms itghraatn at lsietantsu sse ienk tihneg  Ulanwitfeudl p Setramteasn ewniltl  rmesaikdee nptu srtpaotusse fourl  \niD s tcir 15  and  well-informed  decisions  commensurate  with  the \net immigration  status  they  are  seeking.  But  regardless, DHS \ns\ntaiD 16  declines  to  limit  the  effect  of  the  rulemaking  to  avoid  the \nt\nS \nn possibility that individuals subject to this rule may disenroll or \n dere 17  choose not to enroll, as self-sufficiency is the rule's ultimate \nh\nt\ninrt aim. \nUoN 18   \nSecond, DHS finds it difficult to predict how this rule will affect \n19  aliens subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility, \nbecause data limitations provide neither a precise count nor \n20  reasonable estimate of the number of aliens who are both \nsubject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and are \n21  eligible for public benefits in the United States.  This difficulty is \ncompounded by the fact that most applicants subject to the \n22  public charge ground of inadmissibility and therefore this rule \nare  generally  unlikely  to  suffer  negative  consequences \n23  resulting from past receipt of public benefits because they will \nhave been residing outside of the United States and therefore, \n24  ineligible to have ever received public benefits. \n \n25  . . . .  \n \n26  Third, DHS finds it difficult to predict the rule's disenrollment \nimpacts with respect to people who are not regulated by this \n27  rule, such as people who erroneously believe themselves to be \naffected. . . . This rule does not prohibit or otherwise discourage \n28  individuals  who  are  not  subject  to  the  public  charge \n56 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 57 of 93\n \ninadmissibility from receiving any public benefits for which they \n1  are eligible. \n \n2  . . . .  \n \n3  Because DHS will not consider the receipt of public benefits by \nU.S.  citizens  and  aliens  not  subject  to  public  charge \n4  inadmissibility,  the  receipt  of  public  benefits  by  these \nindividuals will not be counted against or made attributable to \n5  immigrant  family  members  who  are  subject  to  this  rule. \nAccordingly, DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for \n6  U.S.  citizens  and  aliens  exempt  from  public  charge \ninadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or \n7  forego enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals \nare not subject to this rule. DHS will not alter this rule to account \n8  for such unwarranted choices. \n \n9  DHS appreciates the potential effects of confusion regarding \nthe rule's scope and effect, as well as the potential nexus \n10  between  public  benefit  enrollment  reduction  and  food \ninsecurity,  housing  scarcity,  public health and  vaccinations, \n11  education  health-based  services,  reimbursement  to  health \nproviders,  and  increased  costs  to  states  and  localities.  In \n a  12  response to comments, DHS will also issue clear guidance that \ntruin identifies the groups of individuals who are not subject to this \noCrof 13  rule,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  U.S.  citizens,  lawful \n tila permanent residents returning from a trip abroad who are not \ncC\nirts fo 14  c onsidered applicants for admission, and refugees. \niD s tcir 15  . . . .  \net  \ns\ntaiD 16  In sum, DHS does not believe that it is sound policy to ignore \nt\nS \nn the longstanding self-sufficiency goals set forth by Congress or \n dere 17  to admit or grant adjustment of status applications of aliens who \nh\nt\ninrt are likely to receive public benefits designated in this rule to \nUoN 18  meet their basic living needs in an [sic] the hope that doing so \nmight  alleviate food and  housing  insecurity,  improve  public \n19  health,  decrease  costs  to  states  and  localities,  or  better \nguarantee health care provider reimbursements. . . .  DHS \n20  believes that it will ultimately strengthen public safety, health, \nand  nutrition  through  this  rule  by  denying  admission  or \n21  adjustment of status to aliens who are not likely to be self-\nsufficient. \n22   \n23  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,312–14 (footnotes omitted). \n24  That answer entirely fails to discuss costs being borne by the states, hospitals, or \n25  others, other than to say DHS will issue guidance in an effort to mitigate confusion.  The \n26  answer discusses disenrollment rates being difficult to measure, but flatly refuses to \n27  account for certain types of disenrollment (for example those who “erroneously believe \n28  themselves to be affected” and make “unwarranted choices”).  DHS’s response \n57 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 58 of 93\n \n1  constitutes a thinly-veiled abdication of the responsibility to consider the issue.  Rather \n2  than engage, the response simply elides the issue that the APA requires consideration of. \n3  Ending the analysis with the conclusion that “DHS believes that it will ultimately \n4  strengthen public safety, health, and nutrition through this rule” fails to show that DHS \n5  “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action \n6  including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Encino \n7  Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2125 (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 43); \n8  Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. F.C.C., 755 F.3d 702, 708 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“Though an \n9  agency’s predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule are entitled to \n10  deference, deference to such judgments must be based on some logic and evidence, not \n11  sheer speculation.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  DHS fails to explain \n  12  how those benefits will come about with any evidentiary support.  In fact, ample evidence \n a\ntruin\noro 13  cited in the comments shows exactly the opposite—that use of public benefits improves \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  public health and welfare.  DHS’s bare assertion to the contrary simply is not enough to \niD tc 15  satisfy its obligations.  Even ignoring the fact that the conclusion lacks a reasoned \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  explanation of how it was reached, DHS also fails to address why the supposed benefits \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  will outweigh the likely costs (DHS had at this point already declined to discuss what the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  likely costs are in fact are).  Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that, with respect to \nN\n19  consideration of costs imposed on states and localities by the Rule, DHS offers no “path \n20  [that] may reasonably be discerned” in its reasoning.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n, 463 U.S. \n21  at 43. \n22  Moreover, DHS may not discount an undisputed impact of the Rule simply \n23  because DHS believes it is “unwarranted.”  See Michigan, 135 S. Ct. at 2707 \n24  (“reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the \n25  disadvantages of agency decisions”).  DHS flatly refused to consider the costs associated \n26  with predicted, likely disenrollment of those not subject to the public charge determination \n27  by stating:  “DHS believes that it would be unwarranted for U.S. citizens and aliens \n28  exempt from public charge inadmissibility to disenroll from a public benefit program or \n58 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 59 of 93\n \n1  forgo enrollment in response to this rule when such individuals are not subject to this rule.  \n2  DHS will not alter this rule to account for such unwarranted choices.”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n3  41,313.  But DHS’s disagreement with the source of a cost does not make it go away, \n4  and it does not discharge DHS’s obligation to consider it.  DHS must consider the costs \n5  of widespread disenrollment that it anticipates—it cannot ignore costs by calling their \n6  causes “unwarranted.”  Plaintiffs have shown it is likely that DHS understood that \n7  individuals would disenroll even though they are not subject to the public charge \n8  determination, yet DHS refused to consider that cost entirely.  Doing so would have been \n9  arbitrary and capricious.  Michigan, 135 S. Ct. at 2707 (“‘cost’ includes more than the \n10  expense of complying with regulations; any disadvantage could be termed a cost. . . .  \n11  Consideration of cost reflects the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily \n  12  requires paying attention to the advantages and the disadvantages of agency \n a\ntruin\noro 13  decisions.”); accord Metlife, Inc. v.

Health Effects \n22  Plaintiffs argue that DHS ignored comments describing how loss of benefits would \n23  trigger negative health consequences, including the spread of disease and aggravation of \n24  chronic illness.  DHS received ample commentary regarding this issue.  See, e.g., 84 \n25  Fed. Reg. at 41,384 (summarizing certain comments); Cho Decl., Ex. M at 4 (Kaiser \n26  Permanente comment linking the rule’s impacts on prescription adherence with increased \n27  chance of outbreaks of communicable disease), Ex. N at 9 (Pub. Health Inst. Comment:  \n28  “We cannot achieve universally agreed upon public health goals, such as reducing \n59 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 60 of 93\n \n1  chronic diseases throughout the U.S., when we directly or indirectly deny large segments \n2  of our population the very building blocks they need for good health”), Ex. O at 4 (Nat’l \n3  Assoc. Ped. Nurse Practitioners comment discussing “worse health outcomes”), P at 7 \n4  (Children’s HealthWatch comment warning of “increased prevalence of communicable \n5  diseases”). \n6  Defendants offer the same general defenses in response.  First, DHS read the \n7  comments, but the forward-looking impact to health was too difficult to assess.  Second, \n8  even if DHS had assessed those costs, they would be outweighed by the benefits of \n9  excluding aliens who would rely on public benefits and promoting self-sufficiency of aliens \n10  already in the United States.  Those benefits are in line with Congressional statements of \n11  policy. \n  12  Relevantly here, similar negative health outcomes were a key rationale for prior \n a\ntruin\noro 13  agency action.  When issuing the 1999 guidance, INS described its primary motivation “to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  reduce the negative public health consequences generated by the existing confusion.”  \niD tc 15  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,689; see also id. at 28,692 (adopting regulation on an interim basis \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  because “confusion . . . has deterred eligible [immigrants] and their families, including \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits,” and that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, \nN\n19  but on public health and the general welfare”).  In reversing the 1999 guidance, \n20  defendants must “‘display awareness that it is changing position’ and ‘show that there are \n21  good reasons for the new policy.’”  Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (quoting FCC v. \n22  Fox, 556 U.S. at 515).  Moreover, where the prior policy engendered reliance, “a \n23  reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay \n24  or were engendered by the prior policy.”  Id. \n25  Under the heading “Vaccinations,” the government summarized the comments it \n26  was responding to:   \n \n27  Commenters indicated that the public charge rule would make \nimmigrant  families  afraid  to  seek  health-care,  including \n28  vaccinations against communicable diseases, and therefore, \n60 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 61 of 93\n \nendanger the U.S. population. . . . .  The commenter indicated \n1  that engaging  with the public health system was critical to \nensuring robust immunization to protect the population overall; \n2  if a subset of the community were fearful to access government \nhealthcare services, regardless of whether a specific type of \n3  service  qualified  for  a  narrow  exception,  it  would  have  a \nsignificant impact on the country's ability to protect and promote \n4  the public health.  Another commenter indicated that its health \ndepartment anticipated that promulgation of the rule, as written \n5  in the NPRM, will result in decreased utilization of children's \nhealthcare, including vaccinations, which will increase the risk \n6  for vaccine preventable diseases . . . increasing the likelihood \nof an outbreak.   \n7   \nSome commenters stated that since many immigrants live in \n8  communities  alongside  people  of  the  same  national  origin, \nreduced vaccinations could result in unvaccinated or under-\n9  vaccinated clusters of individuals.  Commenters warned that \nresearch shows that uninsured individuals are much less likely \n10  to be vaccinated.  One commenter stated that a recent study \nfound that even a five percent reduction in vaccine coverage \n11  could trigger a significant measles outbreak. . . .  Another \ncommenter stated that the rule would increase the incidence of \n a  12  childhood  diseases  like  chickenpox,  measles,  mumps  and \ntruin rubella and deter parents from vaccinating their children. \noCrof 13   \n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384. \niD tc 15  The government’s response was: \n sir\net  \ns\ntaiD 16  With this rulemaking, DHS does not intend to restrict the access \nt\nS \nn of  vaccines  for  children  or  adults  or  intend  to  discourage \n dere 17  individuals from obtaining the necessary vaccines to prevent \nh\nt\ninrt vaccine-preventable diseases.  The purpose of this rulemaking \nUoN 18  is to ensure that those seeking admission to the United States \nare self-sufficient and rely on themselves or family and friends \n19  for  support  instead  of  relying  on  the  government  for \nsubsistence.  As noted above, this final rule does not consider \n20  receipt of Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a person's \npregnancy, to constitute receipt of public benefits.  This should \n21  address a substantial portion, though not all, of the vaccinations \nissue. \n22   \nVaccinations obtained through public benefits programs are not \n23  considered public benefits under 8 CFR 212.21(b), although if \nan  alien  enrolls  in  Medicaid  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining \n24  vaccines, the Medicaid itself qualifies as a public benefit.  DHS \nalso  notes  that  free  or  low  cost  vaccines  are  available  to \n25  children  who  are  not  insured  or  underinsured  through  the \nVaccines for Children (VFC) Program.  In addition, local health \n26  centers  and  state  health  departments  provide  preventive \nservices that include vaccines that may be offered on a sliding \n27  scale fee based on income.  Therefore, DHS believes that \nvaccines would still be available for children and adults even if \n28  they disenroll from Medicaid. \n61 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 62 of 93\n \n1  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,384–85 (footnotes omitted). \n2  DHS’s response to the comments was essentially that it understood that fewer \n3  people would get vaccines following the Rule, which would present a risk, but there are \n4  ways to get vaccines without Medicaid.  As a result, DHS acknowledged that fewer \n5  people will get vaccines, but it failed engage at all in the consequences of that fact.   \n6  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success based upon this argument.  \n7  This change departs from a longstanding prior policy, as explained in the 1999 Field \n8  Guidance, that is likely to have engendered reliance.  That guide explained that certain \n9  rules were needed because uncertainty had “deterred eligible aliens and their families, \n10  including U.S. citizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits[, \n11  which] . . . has an adverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but on public \n  12  health and the general welfare.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28,692 (emphasis added).  Given that \n a\ntruin\noro 13  the 1999 Field Guidance was both longstanding precedent and specifically concerned \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  benefits supporting general public health (not simple health of the aliens—e.g., vaccines), \niD tc 15  DHS must provide “a reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding facts and circumstances \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.”  FCC v. Fox, 556 U.S. at 515–16; \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  accord Encino Motorcars, 136 S. Ct. at 2126 (“an unexplained inconsistency in agency \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  policy is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change \nN\n19  from agency practice”) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n20  Although DHS acknowledged departure from the 1999 Field Guidance as a \n21  general matter (e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,307–08), DHS simply declined to engage with \n22  certain, identified public-health consequences of the Rule.  It made no attempt, \n23  whatsoever, to investigate the type or magnitude of harm that would flow from the reality \n24  which it admittedly recognized would result—fewer people would be vaccinated.  Instead, \n25  and just as with its refusal to consider “unwarranted” choices to disenroll from Medicaid \n26  discussed above, DHS responded only that it “believes that vaccines would still be \n27  available” through some other channels.  The response is devoid of rationale, but \n28  additionally it fails entirely to provide a reasoned explanation for disregarding the facts \n62 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 63 of 93\n \n1  and circumstances underlying the prior policy. \n2  C.  Form I-944 \n3  Plaintiffs argue that defendants’ estimate of the time and cost burden that the new \n4  Form I-944, entitled Declaration of Self Sufficiency, will have on applicants is implausible.  \n5  They argue that the Rule provides too-low of an estimate for the time required to fill out \n6  the form, based on its estimate about the time it takes to fill out another related form.  \n7  They argue that DHS did not adequately consider the differences between the forms \n8  when arriving at their estimate.  Yet DHS considered and responded to comments \n9  regarding the time commitment required by Form I-944.  In response DHS modified the \n10  form, removed some duplicative questions, and explained that it is important to be filed \n11  separately because it is filed by the immigrant himself.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,484.  Plaintiffs \n  12  have not demonstrated a likelihood of success or serious questions with respect to this \n a\ntruin\noro 13  argument. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  ii.  Other Challenges \niD tc 15  Plaintiffs raise a number of other procedural challenges under the APA.  The court \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  finds that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits or serious \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  questions with respect to any, and it will address some of them briefly. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs argue that the Rule stops treating sponsors’ affidavits of support as \nN\n19  sufficient assurance that immigrant applicants will not become overly dependent on \n20  public benefits, yet Congress specified in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii) that the executive \n21  simply “may also” consider such affidavits.  Although plaintiffs argue that in practice \n22  USCIS has accepted affidavits of support as conclusive, the controlling statute and 1999 \n23  Field Guidance make clear that this is not a change in policy.  See 64 Fed. Reg. at \n24  28,690 (“Where such an AOS has been filed on an alien's behalf, it should be considered \n25  along with the statutory factors in the public charge determination.”). \n26  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because DHS included an exemption for \n27  individuals under the age of 21 who receive Medicaid benefits, but did not include a \n28  similar exemption for individuals under the age of 21 who receive SNAP benefits.  DHS \n63 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 64 of 93\n \n1  considered this issue and provided a reasoned explanation for providing Medicaid to \n2  children, including that it can provide funding for “in-school health services and serve as \n3  an important way to ensure that children receive the vaccines needed to protect public \n4  health and welfare.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,380.   \n5  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because the statute requires consideration \n6  of “education and skills” and “health,” but the Rule requires a much more searching \n7  inquiry into health than education and skills.  For example, the Rule considers details \n8  about an individual’s health insurance, benefits receipt, and financial status of household \n9  members, but inconsistently fails to take into account admission or attendance in a \n10  college or trade school.  But the Rule in fact allows for consideration of admission or \n11  attendance in a college or trade school, and DHS adequately addressed these issues in \n  12  response to comments.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,436 (“the exact nature of the education \n a\ntruin\noro 13  (or lack thereof) and employment would have to be considered”). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because it considers past immigration-\niD tc 15  related fee waivers, which may be submitted before a noncitizen is legally eligible to work \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  and as a result punish that individual for applying to work legally.  DHS adequately \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  responded, noting that “[s]ince fee waivers are based on an inability to pay, seeking or \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  obtaining a fee waiver for an immigration benefit suggests an inability to be self-\nN\n19  sufficient.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,424–25. \n20  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is inconsistent because Medicaid use by pregnant women \n21  or children (who are not penalized for using Medicaid under the rule) is counted against \n22  them, because Medicaid is not counted as an asset that could offset the negative factor \n23  of their illness that Medicaid is paying to treat.  Plaintiffs argue that is not consistent, \n24  because private insurance is considered an asset.  Defendants argue that the Rule does \n25  not count a severe medical condition as a heavily weighed negative factor if the alien has \n26  “the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs related to such \n27  medical condition,” and such “financial resources” can include Medicaid benefits for those \n28  pregnant or under 21.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,504 (“resources . . . to pay for reasonably \n64 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 65 of 93\n \n1  foreseeable medical costs” includes “health insurance not designated as a public benefit \n2  under 8 CFR 212.21(b)”). \n3  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because an income of 125% of the federal \n4  poverty guideline rate counts as a positive factor, yet individuals whose incomes exceed \n5  that qualify for non-cash benefits considered under the Rule.  But not all factors in a \n6  multifactor test are required to align in outcome to be rational. \n7  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because while it considers large family size as \n8  a negative factor in a public charge assessment, DHS’s own data indicates that non-cash \n9  benefit is higher among families of three than families of four, and that noncitizens’ use of \n10  cash benefits decreases as family size grows.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,395.  The parties \n11  appear to disagree about which studies are “good studies” here, but DHS’s response \n  12  explained its interpretation of the studies and concluded that “the data properly reflects \n a\ntruin\noro 13  that receipt of noncash benefits generally increases with an increase in family size.”  Id. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it considers the mere application for \niD tc 15  benefits in the public charge determination.  Plaintiffs argue that an application for \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  benefits does not indicate a noncitizen is actually financially and otherwise eligible for the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  benefit or will decide to use the benefit.  DHS reasonably explained that an “application \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  for a public benefit is not the same as receipt but is indicative of an alien's intent to \nN\n19  receive such a benefit.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,422.   \n20  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because it is ultimately a vague and entirely \n21  unpredictable framework for weighing the statutorily-authorized and newly-added factors, \n22  which results in limitless discretion.  The precise nature of the procedural challenge is \n23  unclear here, but the underlying statute requires consideration of “at minimum” five \n24  factors, and then specifically mentions another factor that “may” be considered.  \n25  Moreover, the statute specifically targets those who are likely to be a public charge “in the \n26  opinion of the Attorney General,” who as DHS recognized has long been given discretion \n27  to make such determinations under the statute.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,398 (“DHS notes that \n28  officer discretion is not a new concept in USCIS immigration benefits adjudications.”). \n65 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 66 of 93\n \n1  Plaintiffs argue the Rule is irrational because some factors are actually \n2  determinative, and impossible to overcome because the factors significantly overlap.  As \n3  a result, the Rule funnels officials’ decision-making towards favoring high-income \n4  individuals at the expense of the poor and other marginalized groups.  To the extent \n5  plaintiffs challenge the Rule favoring admission of the wealthy over the poor, the plaintiffs’ \n6  appropriate target is the underlying statute rather than the Rule implementing it.  The \n7  statute itself calls for consideration of a number of factors, ultimately aimed at excluding \n8  from the country a group comprised of those who are more likely to be poor than rich. \n9  d.  Zone of Interests \n10  In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of \n11  the statute that forms the basis of their challenge.  The zone of interests analysis asks \n  12  “whether Congress created a private cause of action in legislation” (Organized Vill. of \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Kake v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015)), such that “this particular \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute” (Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. \niD tc 15  Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014)).  It is “not a question of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Article III standing” (Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964), but rather is more \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  appropriately assessed with plaintiffs’ likelihood of success.19   \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  “[A] person suing under the APA must satisfy not only Article III's standing \nN\n19  requirements, but an additional test:  The interest he asserts must be ‘arguably within the \n20  zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute’ that he says was \n21  violated.”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v.

In the APA context, “[t]he ‘zone of interest’ test is a \n24  guide for deciding whether, in view of Congress’ evident intent [when enacting the APA] \n25  to make agency action presumptively reviewable, a particular plaintiff should be heard to \n26 \n                                            \n19 The “zone of interests” requirement was formerly referred to as an assessment of \n27 \n“prudential standing,” but “prudential standing is a misnomer as applied to the zone-of-\ninterests analysis[.]”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord \n28 \nOrganized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964 (9th Cir. 2015). \n66 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 67 of 93\n \n1  complain of a particular agency decision.

Pena, 17 F.3d 1478, 1484 (D.C. \n2  Cir. 1994). \n3  “Whether a plaintiff's interest is ‘arguably ... protected ... by the statute’ within the \n4  meaning of the zone-of-interests test is to be determined not by reference to the overall \n5  purpose of the Act in question (here [in the context of the Endangered Species Act], \n6  species preservation), but by reference to the particular provision of law upon which the \n7  plaintiff relies.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997).  Put differently, “the \n8  plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of ... falls within the ‘zone of interests' \n9  sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for \n10  his complaint.”  Id. at 176 (quoting Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990)) \n11  (citing Air Courier Conference v. Postal Workers, 498 U.S. 517, 523–24 (1991)).  For \n  12  example, an allegation that § 4 of the Bank Service Corporation Act was violated \n a\ntruin\noro 13  considers whether plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of § 4 itself, not “the overall \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  purpose of the Bank Service Corporation Act of 1962[.]”  Id.

Bay Sanctuary \n20  Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 768 n.9 (9th Cir. 2018) (“E. Bay Sanctuary I”) (“‘[W]e \n21  are not limited to considering the [specific] statute under which [plaintiffs] sued, but may \n22  consider any provision that helps us to understand Congress' overall purposes in the \n23  [INA].’”) (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401). \n24  Although the relevant statute “is the statute whose violation is the gravamen of the \n25  complaint” and not the entire act, the court may also look to provisions that “have any \n26  integral relationship” with the relevant statute.  Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529–\n27  30 (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 886) (citing Clarke, 479 U.S. at 388).  For example, when \n28  the challenged statutory section operates as an enumerated exception to another \n68 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 69 of 93\n \n1  section, the court may consider both sections when determining whether a plaintiff falls \n2  within the zone of interests of the challenged section.  Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401 \n3  (considering related statutory section to which challenged statute was an exception); \n4  accord Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529 (recognizing the exception in Clarke as \n5  limited:  “This statement [that the court may look beyond the specific challenged section], \n6  like all others in our opinions, must be taken in the context in which it was made.  In the \n7  next paragraph of the opinion, the Court pointed out that 12 U.S.C. § 36, which the \n8  plaintiffs in that case claimed had been misinterpreted by the Comptroller, was itself ‘a \n9  limited exception to the otherwise applicable requirement of [12 U.S.C.] § 81,’ . . . .  Thus \n10  the zone-of-interests test was to be applied not merely in the light of § 36, which was the \n11  basis of the plaintiffs' claim on the merits, but also in the light of § 81, to which § 36 was \n  12  an exception.”). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  i.  The County and State Plaintiffs \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The County and State plaintiffs’ interests are squarely within the challenged \niD tc 15  statute’s zone of interests.  For example, that statute allows the Attorney General to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  consider an affidavit of support under 8 U.S. Code § 1183a when determining whether to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  exclude an alien as a likely public charge.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii).  Although \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  distinct, Section 1183a is specifically referred to and incorporated into the public charge \nN\n19  analysis set out in the challenged statute.  As a result, § 1183a has an integral \n20  relationship with § 1182(a)(4), such that it should be considered when determining \n21  whether plaintiffs are within the zone of interests of the challenged statute. \n22  Section 1183a explains that someone can sponsor an alien by guaranteeing to \n23  financially support him, and thereby alleviate the concern that he may become a public \n24  charge.  That statute also provides that any such sponsorship can only be considered in \n25  the public charge analysis if it is supported by an affidavit that is “legally enforceable \n26  against the sponsor by . . . any State (or any political subdivision of such State), or by any \n27  other entity that provides any means-tested public benefit[.]”  § 1183a(a)(1)(B); see also \n28  § 1183a(b)(1)(A) (“Upon notification that a sponsored alien has received any means-\n69 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 70 of 93\n \n1  tested public benefit, the . . .  appropriate entity of the Federal Government, a State, or \n2  any political subdivision of a State shall request reimbursement by the sponsor in an \n3  amount which is equal to the unreimbursed costs of such benefit.”).  Moreover, the \n4  sponsor must agree to submit to jurisdiction in state courts for actions to compel \n5  reimbursement of benefits those states paid to the alien.  §§ 1183a(a)(1)(C), (e)(2). \n6  By recognizing that states (and political subdivisions of states) would be paying \n7  means-tested public benefits to those subject to a public charge analysis, requiring that \n8  states and their subdivisions have legally-enforceable rights to recover those expenses \n9  when an alien is admitted based on consideration of an affidavit of support, and \n10  guaranteeing state-court jurisdiction for such enforcement actions, Congress clearly \n11  intended to protect states and their political subdivisions with the challenged statute.   \n  12  Moreover, given the attention paid to states’ rights to recover payment of “any \n a\ntruin\noro 13  means-tested public benefit” from affiants in § 1183a, it is also more than arguable that \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Congress intended to protect states and their political subdivisions’ coffers when \niD tc 15  providing for the exclusion of any alien “likely at any time to become a public charge” in \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  the first place.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  So, the State and County plaintiffs’ financial \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interests are also at least arguably protected by the statute for this independent reason. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Therefore, the States’ and Counties’ interests are more than arguably related to \nN\n19  the challenged statute’s purpose, and they satisfy the zone-of-interests requirement.  \n20  ii.  The Organizations \n21  The Organizations move for an injunction based on one claim that the Rule \n22  violates the APA because it is substantively contrary to the term “public charge” as used \n23  in 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), and a related procedural APA claim based on the same \n24  underlying statute.  As such, the Organizations must be within that statute’s zone of \n25  interest. \n26  Their papers argue that they are within the statute’s zone of interests for three \n27  reasons.  First, the Rule itself counts health care providers and nonprofit organizations \n28  among those who will be affected by it.  Second, plaintiffs’ interests in serving low-\n70 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 71 of 93\n \n1  income, immigrant communities by providing medical or legal services and advice are \n2  related to and consistent with the statute’s purpose to provide procedures and policies for \n3  immigration relief.  Third, and relatedly, the Ninth Circuit has recently held that similar \n4  plaintiffs are within the INA’s zone of interests. \n5  First, the Organizations argue the Rule itself contemplates that organizations like \n6  them will be adversely affected by it.  But being negatively affected by a rule \n7  implementing a statute is not sufficient to establish that the statute conferred a cause of \n8  action encompassing that plaintiff’s claim.  The Organizations’ argument that they will be \n9  hurt by the Rule speaks to their standing to challenge it, rather than whether they are \n10  within the statute’s zone of interest.  See Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 524 (“injury \n11  in fact does not necessarily mean one is within the zone of interests to be protected by a \n  12  given statute”); see also Lujan, 497 U.S. at 883 (“for example, the failure of an agency to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  comply with a statutory provision requiring ‘on the record’ hearings would assuredly have \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  an adverse effect upon the company that has the contract to record and transcribe the \niD tc 15  agency's proceedings; but since the provision was obviously enacted to protect the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  interests of the parties to the proceedings and not those of the reporters, that company \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would not be ‘adversely affected within the meaning’ of the statute”). \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Second, the Organizations argue that their interests align with the statute.  Yet \nN\n19  their briefing failed to identify or explain what statutory provisions support their argument.  \n20  That failure is fatal given the Supreme Court’s direction that the zone of interests analysis \n21  “requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a \n22  legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.”  \n23  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 127.  When asked at the hearing what specific statutory provisions \n24  they are relying upon, the Organizations for the first time identified 8 U.S.C. § 1611.  That \n25  section outlines the federal public benefits for which aliens are eligible.  But the \n26  Organizations do not assert a challenge based on a violation of § 1611, and it is not at all \n27  clear that § 1611 has “any integral relationship with” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4) such that it is \n28  proper for the court to consider it in the zone of interests inquiry.  See Air Courier \n71 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 72 of 93\n \n1  Conference, 498 U.S. at 529 (without a particular reason to suggest otherwise, sections \n2  within the same act are not sufficiently related); cf. Clarke, 479 U.S. at 401 (considering \n3  related statutory section to which challenged statute was an exception).   \n4  Even if the court were to consider § 1611, the Organizations leave the court to \n5  guess at what connection those statutory provisions share, much less how 8 U.S.C. \n6  § 1182(a)(4) is related to the Organizations’ purposes in light of § 1611.  Finally, the \n7  Organizations do not even explain how their interests are more than marginally related to \n8  § 1611 itself—which does not even “give institutions like the Organizations a role[.]”  E. \n9  Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 769.   \n10  At this stage of litigation, the Organizations have not met their burden to \n11  demonstrate that there are serious questions concerning whether they are within the \n  12  challenged statute’s zone of interest, and certainly they have failed to demonstrate a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  likelihood that they are able to bring the APA actions underlying their present motion. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Taking a step back, the Organizations simply fail to explain how their interests \niD tc 15  relate to § 1182(a)(4)’s purpose of excluding immigrants likely to become public charges.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  This may be because the Organizations identify, without explanation, the statute’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  purpose as providing “procedures and policies for immigration relief.”  That may be based \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  on an argument about the INA’s overall statutory purpose, untethered to the statutory \nN\n19  challenge underlying this motion.  In support of that argument, the Organizations rely on \n20  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771.  But the statute at issue in that action concerned \n21  asylum seekers, and the very statute underlying that challenge contained a provision \n22  requiring the Attorney General to refer asylum seekers to pro bono legal aid \n23  organizations, such as the plaintiff entities in that action.  The court identified specific \n24  references to the role of pro bono legal organizations within the challenged statute itself, \n25  and it found that was sufficient.  That is very different from the facts presented here.  See \n26  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 (“Within the asylum statute [underlying the \n27  preliminary injunction, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)], Congress took steps to ensure that pro \n28  bono legal services of the type that the Organizations provide are available to asylum \n72 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 73 of 93\n \n1  seekers.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A)–(B)”).20   \n2  2.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm \n3  The three distinct issues of (i) standing, (ii) ripeness, and (iii) irreparable harm in \n4  the absence of an injunction are supported by the same factual analysis for each plaintiff.  \n5  Although each of the three requirements is independent for plaintiffs to succeed on this \n6  motion, a finding that plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an \n7  injunction here is sufficient to establish standing and ripeness.  For the Organizations, the \n8  court assesses only standing and ripeness. \n9  The court first addresses the legal standards, and then assesses each plaintiff’s \n10  demonstrated harms. \n11  a.  Legal Standards \n  12  i.  Standing \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, see U.S. Const. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Art. III, § 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the law ought to be or \niD tc 15  affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937).  Article III's “standing” requirements limit the court’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  subject matter jurisdiction.  See Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  2004).  The burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the claim.  \nN\n19  Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991).   \n20  The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.  First, \n21  the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected \n22  interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not \n23  conjectural or hypothetical.  Second, there must be a causal connection between the \n24  injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be fairly traceable to the \n25 \n                                            \n20 To the extent the Organizations argue that E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 771 allows \n26 \nthis court to look to unrelated provisions in the INA for a section justifying their interest in \nthe action, the court is at a loss as how to how reconcile that interpretation with Bennett, \n27 \n520 U.S. at 175–76, Air Courier Conference, 498 U.S. at 529, and Pit River Tribe, 793 \nF.3d at 1157.  Absent clarity from an en banc determination of this issue, the court hews \n28 \nto Supreme Court and prior panel authority on the question. \n73 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 74 of 93\n \n1  challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some \n2  third party not before the court.  Third, it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, \n3  that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n4  U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also \n5  Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). \n6  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief \n7  requested, and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with \n8  the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \n9  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 763–64 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n10  At this preliminary stage, plaintiffs “may rely on the allegations in their Complaint and \n11  whatever other evidence they submitted in support of their” motion to meet their \n  12  burden.  Id. at 764.  They “need only establish a risk or threat of injury to satisfy the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  actual injury requirement.”  Id. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Organizations can establish standing two different ways. \niD tc 15  First, “Organizations can demonstrate organizational standing by showing that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  challenged ‘practices have perceptibly impaired [their] ability to provide the services [they \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  were] formed to provide.’”  Id. at 765.  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  establish organizational standing for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, \nN\n19  independent of the litigation, the challenged policy frustrates the organization's goals and \n20  requires the organization to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise \n21  would spend in other ways.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (citing \n22  inter alia, Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d \n23  936, 943 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (advocacy groups had organizational standing to \n24  challenge an anti-solicitation ordinance that targeted day laborers based on the \n25  resources spent by the groups in assisting day laborers during their arrests and meetings \n26  with workers about the status of the ordinance); Nat'l Council of La Raza v. Cegavske, \n27  800 F.3d 1032, 1039–40 (9th Cir. 2015) (civil rights groups had organizational standing to \n28  challenge alleged voter registration violations where the groups had to “expend additional \n74 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 75 of 93\n \n1  resources” to counteract those violations that “they would have spent on some other \n2  aspect of their organizational purpose”); El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Office of \n3  Immigration Review, 959 F.2d 742, 748 (9th Cir. 1991) (legal services groups had \n4  organizational standing to challenge a policy of providing only partial interpretation of \n5  immigration court proceedings, noting that the policy “frustrate[d]” the group's “efforts to \n6  obtain asylum and withholding of deportation in immigration court proceedings” and \n7  required them “to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in \n8  other ways.”); Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1018 (9th Cir. 2013) (finding \n9  organizational standing where the plaintiffs “had to divert resources to educational \n10  programs to address its members’ and volunteers’ concerns about the [challenged] law's \n11  effect”)). \n  12  In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs established \n a\ntruin\noro 13  organizational standing by declaring that enforcement of a regulation “frustrated their \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  mission of providing legal aid” to asylum applicants by “significantly discourage[ing] a \niD tc 15  large number of those individuals from seeking asylum given their ineligibility.”  932 F.3d \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  at 766.  That regulation would require plaintiffs “to partially convert their affirmative \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  asylum practice into a removal defense program, an overhaul that would require \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  ‘developing new training materials’ and ‘significant training of existing staff.’”  Id.  “Finally, \nN\n19  the [plaintiff] Organizations have each undertaken, and will continue to undertake, \n20  education and outreach initiatives regarding the new rule, efforts that require the \n21  diversion of resources away from other efforts to provide legal services to their local \n22  immigrant communities.”  Id. \n23  Second, “Organizations can demonstrate organizational standing by showing that \n24  the Rule will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding.  For standing purposes, \n25  a loss of even a small amount of money is ordinarily an ‘injury.’  We have held that an \n26  organization that suffers a decreased amount of business and lost revenues due to a \n27  government policy easily satisfies the ‘injury in fact’ standing requirement.”  Id. at 766–67 \n28  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n75 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 76 of 93\n \n1  In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs established \n2  organizational standing by declaring that they received a large portion of their funding \n3  based on the number of asylum applications they pursue, and that if their prospective \n4  clients “became categorically ineligible for asylum, East Bay would lose a significant \n5  amount of business and suffer a concomitant loss of funding.”  Id. at 767. \n6  ii.  Ripeness \n7    “Ripeness is an Article III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live \n8  cases or controversies and do not ‘issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in \n9  hypothetical cases.’  A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential \n10  component.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty., 863 F.3d 1144, 1153 (9th Cir. 2017) \n11  (citations omitted).   \n  12  “For a case to be ripe, it must present issues that are definite and concrete, not \n a\ntruin\noro 13  hypothetical or abstract.  Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  standing because ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”  Id. \niD tc 15  (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Comm'n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138–39 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Sorting out where standing ends and \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . .  .  [I]n ‘measuring whether the litigant has \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather than speculative and hypothetical, the \nN\n19  ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with standing.’”).  Allegations that a “threat” to \n20  a “concrete interest is actual and imminent” are sufficient to allege “an injury in fact that \n21  meets the requirements of constitutional ripeness.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe, 863 F.3d at \n22  1154.  Therefore, if plaintiffs satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. \n23  Defs. of Wildlife, addressed above, the action here is ripe.  In this case, the analysis for \n24  both requirements is the same.  See, e.g., Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 (“Whether the \n25  question is viewed as one of standing or ripeness, the Constitution mandates that prior to \n26  our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or controversy,’ that the \n27  issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract.’ . . .  We need \n28  not delve into the nuances of the distinction between the injury in fact prong of standing \n76 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 77 of 93\n \n1  and the constitutional component of ripeness:  in this case, the analysis is the same.”). \n2  “In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, our analysis is guided by two \n3  overarching considerations:  ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n4  hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1141.  \n5  When the question presented “is ‘a purely legal one’” that “constitutes ‘final agency \n6  action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA,” that suggests the issue is fit for judicial \n7  decision.  Nat'l Park Hosp. Ass'n v. Dep't of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 812 (2003).  However, \n8  an issue may not be ripe for review if “further factual development would ‘significantly \n9  advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented.’”  Id. \n10  iii.  Irreparable Harm \n11  “A plaintiff seeking preliminary relief must ‘demonstrate that irreparable injury is \n  12  likely in the absence of an injunction.’”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 581 (9th Cir. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  2018) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22); Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp., 822 F.3d 1011, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  1023 (9th Cir. 2016) (“A threat of irreparable harm is sufficiently immediate to warrant \niD tc 15  preliminary injunctive relief if the plaintiff ‘is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  decision on the merits can be rendered.’”) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 22)).   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  “There must be a ‘sufficient causal connection’ between the alleged irreparable \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  harm and the activity to be enjoined, and showing that ‘the requested injunction would \nN\n19  forestall’ the irreparable harm qualifies as such a connection.”  Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l \n20  Marine Fisheries Serv., 886 F.3d 803, 819 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Perfect 10, Inc. v. \n21  Google, Inc., 653 F.3d 976, 981–82 (9th Cir. 2011)).  “However, a plaintiff ‘need not \n22  further show that the action sought to be enjoined is the exclusive cause of the injury.’” Id. \n23  (quoting M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 728 (9th Cir. 2012)). \n24  The irreparable harm “analysis focuses on irreparability, ‘irrespective of the \n25  magnitude of the injury.’”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (quoting Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., 175 \n26  F.3d 716, 725 (9th Cir. 1999)).  “[T]he temporary loss of income, ultimately to be \n27  recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury.”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. \n28  61, 90 (1974).  But the general rule that “[e]conomic harm is not normally considered \n77 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 78 of 93\n \n1  irreparable” does not apply where there is no adequate remedy to recover those \n2  damages, such as in APA cases.  Azar, 911 F.3d at 581 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702). \n3  b.  The Plaintiffs’ Harms \n4    First, the court assesses the Counties’ and States’ standing, the ripeness of their \n5  claims, and whether they have demonstrated irreparable harm in absence of an \n6  injunction.  Second, the court assesses the Organizations’ standing and the ripeness of \n7  their claims. \n8  i.  The States and Counties \n9  The States and Counties argue that they will suffer five categories of irreparable \n10  harm:  (A) loss of federal funds, mostly in Medicaid reimbursement; (B) increased \n11  operational costs; (C) increased costs to their own healthcare operations  (D) public \n  12  health problems and resulting increased costs; and (E) reduced economic activity due to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  a decrease in federal funds in the community. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  A.  Loss of Federal Funds \niD tc 15  The Counties argue that they will lose millions of dollars in federal Medicaid \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  reimbursement funds.  Each provides a broad array of health services to low-income \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  residents, many of which are at least partially reimbursed with federal Medicaid dollars.  \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  DHS itself estimates that 2.5% of individuals in households with a noncitizen will disenroll \nN\n19  from Medicaid, which would translate to a roughly $7.5 million loss in Medicaid \n20  reimbursement funds.   \n21  The States similarly argue that DHS itself estimates that the Rule will cause a \n22  reduction in payments from the federal government due to disenrollment or foregone \n23  enrollment by eligible individuals to be over $1.5 billion, nationwide.  83 Fed. Reg. at \n24  51,267–69. \n25  Defendants argue the harm is too speculative, caused only by third-party actions, \n26  and not imminent because the merits can be resolved quickly on summary judgment.  \n27  Defendants argue that even assuming a 2.5% rate of disenrollment, plaintiffs fail to show \n28  that the States and Counties will be harmed, rather than individuals residing within their \n78 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 79 of 93\n \n1  boundaries.  Defendants argue that harm individual citizens will suffer cannot support the \n2  States and Counties claims of irreparable harm.  Finally, defendants argue that any \n3  financial harms the States and Counties identify are not sufficiently large to establish \n4  irreparable harm.   \n5  First, regarding the speculative nature of the harm, defendants themselves predict \n6  a 2.5% disenrollment rate when assessing the Rule, subject to the procedural \n7  requirements of the APA.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463.  The Rule itself also estimated that it \n8  will cause a reduction in payments from the federal government due to disenrollment or \n9  foregone enrollment by eligible individuals of over $1.5 billion.  83 Fed. Reg. at 51,267–\n10  69; see also Cisneros Decl. A at 98-99, Table 18 (annual estimates of $1.46 billion to \n11  $4.37 billion in reduced payments).  Those figures, which underlie DHS’s analysis in \n  12  support of the Rule pursuant to the APA’s requirements, are not speculative conjectures \n a\ntruin\noro 13  as to what might possibly occur.  They are meant to be serious efforts by an agency to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  assess the impact of a proposed rule, and it is difficult to fathom how defendants can \niD tc 15  argue otherwise.  And plaintiffs offer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that disenrollment \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  or non-enrollments will reach at least that level.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463; Wong Decl. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ¶¶ 18-45; Shing Decl. ¶ 30; Weisberg Decl. ¶12; Ponce Decl. ¶¶ 4–11, 25.  This type of \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  predictable result from a broad policy, although not precise to the level of the individual \nN\n19  actor, is sufficiently-specific to allege irreparable harm.  See Dep’t of Commerce v. New \n20  York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019).  Moreover, plaintiffs offer evidence showing that \n21  disenrollment due to the public charge rulemaking has already begun.  See, e.g., Cody \n22  Decl. ¶ 8; Newstrom Decl. ¶ 43; Weisberg Decl. ¶¶ 12–14; Shing Decl. ¶¶ 23–24; Chawla \n23  Decl. ¶ 13; Fanelli Decl. ¶ 38; Neville-Morgan Decl. ¶ 16; Ruiz Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12; Kofman \n24  Decl. ¶ 6; Medina Decl. ¶¶ 18–22.  Plaintiffs offer strong evidence that disenrollment is \n25  likely to continue between now and the resolution of this issue on the merits, absent an \n26  injunction. \n27  Plaintiffs also adequately demonstrate that the loss of Medicaid reimbursement is \n28  sure to be immediate, once individuals disenroll.  That is apparent from the very \n79 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 80 of 93\n \n1  mechanics of the harm.  Today, the States and Counties are partially reimbursed by the \n2  federal government for care provided to Medicaid enrollees.  As individuals disenroll, the \n3  plaintiffs will no longer be reimbursed for treating them.  This will have obvious adverse \n4  budgetary consequences.  For one, there will indisputably be fewer individuals covered \n5  by Medicaid seeking treatment.  So, the States and Counties will not be reimbursed for \n6  treating those disenrolled individuals (whether they treat them or not).  The States and \n7  Counties would experience this terminated revenue stream even if they turned away \n8  patients without medical insurance (which they will not).  Put differently, there will be \n9  fewer people on Medicaid to treat and get reimbursed for.  \n10  To the extent defendants argue that the mechanics will work out as a budgetary \n11  boon to plaintiffs, the argument is not plausible in the context of this preliminary injunction \n  12  motion.  Although it could potentially work out as a total budgetary savings for the plaintiff \n a\ntruin\noro 13  entities if they reconfigured their operations, reduced staff, reduced provision of services, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  and undertook other cost-savings measures, such savings could not plausibly be realized \niD tc 15  prior to the determination of this action’s merits.  See, e.g., Lorenz Decl. ¶¶ 19–22.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Instead, the plaintiffs will be continuing to operate with most of the costs and expectations \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  associated with the status quo, with one change—no reimbursements. \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Second, the States and Counties’ argument regarding loss of Medicaid funding \nN\n19  does not rely on harms to their citizens.  Rather, the arguments concern the plaintiffs’ \n20  own loss of funds. \n21  Third, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm, but \n22  they need not establish a particular quantum of harm to satisfy the requirement.  Azar, \n23  911 F.3d at 581 (irreparable harm “analysis focuses on irreparability, ‘irrespective of the \n24  magnitude of the injury’”).  Nor do defendants explain why San Francisco’s likely loss of \n25  $7.5 million in Medicaid reimbursements (based on a 2.5% disenrollment rate) is not \n26  sufficiently large even under their theory of the requirement.  See Wagner Decl. ¶ 5.  \n27  Santa Clara similarly estimates $4.6 million in foregone Medicaid funds due to more \n28  conservative 1.9% decline in enrollment.  Shing Decl. ¶ 32 (estimating $4.6 million in \n80 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 81 of 93\n \n1  Medicaid fund losses due to 1.9% decline in enrollment).  The States similarly \n2  demonstrate the harms they are likely to suffer from the loss of Medicaid \n3  reimbursements.  See Cantwell Decl. ¶¶ 6, 14 (2.5 million noncitizen Medicaid \n4  beneficiaries in California); Ferrer Decl. ¶ 19 (predicted disenrollment figures in L.A. \n5  County); Lucia Decl. ¶ 23 (estimates of $957 million in lost funding in California, \n6  assuming 15% disenrollment rate); Buhrig I Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8, 10, 27 (330,000 Pennsylvania \n7  Medicaid beneficiaries are part of a household with a noncitizen); Allen Decl. ¶¶ 10, 18, \n8  36-40 (63,000 noncitizens participate in the Oregon Health Plan system, a federal/state \n9  partnership program; other participants are citizen children part of a household with a \n10  noncitizen); Byrd Decl. ¶¶ 18–20 & Ex. A at 2, 4 (16,000 children in the District of \n11  Columbia receive Medicaid assistance, and 28% of the District’s children are part of a \n  12  household with a noncitizen; 9,800 immigrants enrolled in Medicaid reside in the District); \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Probert Decl. ¶¶ 4–8, 15 (13,918 noncitizens enrolled in Medicaid in Maine). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  B.  Increased Operational Costs \niD tc 15  The States argue that the Rule will impose burdens on their ongoing operations.  \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Defendants argue that such costs are self-imposed and not cognizable.   \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Governmental administrative costs caused by changes in federal policy are \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  cognizable injuries.  See Cal. v. Trump, 267 F. Supp. 3d 1119, 1126 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \nN\n19  (states’ “administrative costs” caused by a disruption to healthcare exchanges they \n20  administer were sufficient to demonstrate standing) (collecting cases); see also Azar, 911 \n21  F.3d at 573–74.21 \n22  The Counties have submitted evidence of cognizable, irreparable costs.  Santa \n23  Clara explains that they have already spent over 1,000 hours answering questions about \n24  the Rule, processing disenrollment, analyzing the impact of the rule on their services and \n25  undertaking community education and outreach—and these activities are likely to \n26 \n                                            \n21 The government relies on inapposite case law, most notably Crane v. Johnson, 783 \n27 \nF.3d 244, 253-54 (5th Cir. 2015), which addressed individual public employee claims (not \nclaims by the public entity itself) that they might have to change their job practices \n28 \nbecause of a policy change. \n81 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 82 of 93\n \n1  continue to be necessary.  E.g., Shing Decl. ¶¶ 8, 11–12; see also Lorenz Decl. ¶ 19; \n2  Márquez Decl. ¶¶ 9–10.  San Francisco has submitted evidence of similar measures it \n3  has already taken and will continue to take in direct response to the Rule.  See Pon Decl. \n4  ¶¶ 13–16; Rhorer Decl. ¶ 11; Smith Decl. ¶¶ 4–9.  California and Oregon have submitted \n5  evidence showing they are likely to imminently suffer similar harms absent an injunction.  \n6  Ruiz Decl. ¶ 19 (California); Fernandez Decl. ¶¶ 34–36 (California); Fanelli Decl. ¶ 40 \n7  (California); Salazar Decl. ¶ 37 (Oregon).  Other states submit declarations regarding \n8  these issues, but they are too vague or speculative to support issuance of an injunction.  \n9  E.g., Byrd Decl. ¶¶ 22–23 (discussing past efforts in D.C., and stating the District will \n10  generally “need to train staff” on the issue); Probert Decl. ¶ 16 (speculation concerning \n11  costs Maine may face). \n  12  Additionally, certain plaintiff states use Medicaid and SNAP enrollment to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  automatically certify children into school lunch programs, meaning that those states \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  would face higher administrative costs to certify student eligibility for free lunch following \niD tc 15  disenrollment caused by the Rule.  To the extent states’ administrative costs increase to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  assess eligibility for free lunch as children disenroll from the federal programs (as \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  opposed to merely an increased burden on the applicants), that administrative cost \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  increase is cognizable harm.  California and D.C. submit competent evidence \nN\n19  demonstrating that their costs in administering school lunch programs will increase.  See \n20  Palmer Decl. ¶ 16 (declaring D.C.’s costs would go up to process school lunch \n21  applications); Fernandez Decl. ¶ 30 (declaring California’s “administrative streamlining \n22  and efficiency” will suffer when enrolling students for free lunch); see generally Neville-\n23  Morgan Decl. ¶ 22 (in California, “paperwork is more burdensome for those without an \n24  automatic qualification through Medi-Cal or SNAP, and immigrant eligible families are \n25  less likely to obtain school lunch benefits in this way”). \n26  These costs that the States and Counties have identified are predictable, likely, \n27  and imminent.  In fact, DHS specifically contemplated certain of these costs when \n28  formulating the Rule.  E.g., 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,260 (“The primary sources of the \n82 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 83 of 93\n \n1  consequences and indirect impacts of the proposed rule would be costs to various \n2  entities that the rule does not directly regulate, such as hospital systems, state agencies, \n3  and other organizations that provide public assistance to aliens and their households. \n4  Indirect costs associated with this rule include familiarization with the rule for those \n5  entities that are not directly regulated but still want to understand the changes in federal \n6  and state transfer payments due to this rule.”) (emphasis added); see also 84 Fed. Reg. \n7  at 41,389 (“DHS agrees that some entities, such as State and local governments or other \n8  businesses and organizations would incur costs related to the changes commenters \n9  identify.”). \n10  Because the States and Counties have each demonstrated sufficient likely \n11  irreparable injury in the form of loss of federal funds to support a preliminary injunction, \n  12  and the Counties, California, D.C., and Oregon have demonstrated additional irreparable \n a\ntruin\noro 13  injury in the form of operational costs, the court need not address the remaining three \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  categories of irreparable harm plaintiffs argue they will imminently suffer. \niD tc 15  ii.  The Organizations \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “[C]ourts have an ‘independent obligation’ to police their own subject matter \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  jurisdiction, including the parties' standing.  Accordingly, we must assure ourselves that \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  Plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and \nN\n19  likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Animal Legal Def. Fund v. United \n20  States Dep't of Agric., 935 F.3d 858, 866 (9th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). \n21  “[A] diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to establish organizational standing \n22  for purposes of Article III if the organization shows that, independent of the litigation, the \n23  challenged policy frustrates the organization's goals and requires the organization to \n24  expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways.”  E. \n25  Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 765 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n26  Defendants argue that the Organizations fail to identify any injury they will suffer if \n27  they do not divert resources towards addressing their concerns, apart from harm to the \n28  health care they are able to provide to low income communities.  For example, if they \n83 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 84 of 93\n \n1  failed to divert resources, they would not face staff shortages or provide worse health \n2  services. \n3  In E. Bay Sanctuary I, the court found standing based on an organization partially \n4  converting an asylum practice into a removal defense program, a prediction that \n5  applications filed on behalf of the organizations’ clients would become more difficult and \n6  reduce available funds for other activities, and education and outreach initiatives \n7  regarding the new rule.  932 F.3d at 766; see also, e.g., El Rescate Legal Services, 959 \n8  F.2d at 748 (standing where legal services groups had expended “resources in \n9  representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways”); Fair Hous.

Roommate.com, LLC, 666 F.3d 1216, 1219 (9th Cir. 2012) \n11  (finding organizational standing where the plaintiff responded to allegations of \n  12  discrimination by “start[ing] new education and outreach campaigns targeted at \n a\ntruin\noro 13  discriminatory roommate advertising”). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  The Healthcare Organizations’ missions are to provide high quality health care to \niD tc 15  low-income and immigrant communities.

García Decl. ¶ 18; see also Ku \n23  Decl. ¶ 65 (estimating nationwide community health center staffing losses of 3,400 to \n24  6,100 employees). \n25  The Legal Organizations’ missions are to provide advocacy and/or legal services \n26  to their clients and members, including obtaining immigration relief and helping to secure \n27  public benefits.

The Rule plainly \n5  hinders their clients’ ability to obtain immigration relief and/or public benefits. \n6  Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged that they will have to divert funding \n7  because those who may still be eligible for relief or choose to apply for benefits will \n8  require additional time and resources from plaintiffs to address the effects of the Rule, \n9  and this additional time and rising ineligibility or disenrollment means that plaintiffs will be \n10  able to file fewer cases and help fewer clients.

Here, it is enough for plaintiffs to allege that their goals of providing healthcare \n25  and legal services to low-income immigrants are frustrated, and that the challenged \n26  policy has stimulated the organizations into spending money on things they would not \n27  otherwise have spent money on.  Plaintiffs’ public education efforts, changes to their \n28  programs, increased costs of assisting clients, and other diversions of resources qualify \n85 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 86 of 93\n \n1  under the Ninth Circuit’s requirements.22   \n2  3.  The Balance of Equities and Hardships Tip Sharply in Plaintiffs’ Favor \n3  “A court must ‘balance the interests of all parties and weigh the damage to each’ in \n4  determining the balance of the equities.”  CTIA - The Wireless Ass'n v. City of Berkeley, \n5  928 F.3d 832, 852 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, \n6  1138 (9th Cir. 2009)). \n7  There is little question that the balance of equities and hardships tip sharply in \n8  favor of the States and Counties.  Defendants have been operating under a consistent \n9  definition of “public charge” since at least 1999, when the INS issued Field Guidance \n10  specifying “that ‘public charge’ means an alien . . .  who is likely to become (for \n11  admission/adjustment purposes) ‘primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, \n  12  as demonstrated by either (i) the receipt of public cash assistance for income \n a\ntruin\noro 13  maintenance or (ii) institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.’”  64 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Fed. Reg. at 28,689.  That standard is specific and workable, and defendants have been \niD tc 15  administering it for decades.  In fact, defendants conceded that do not argue that they \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  would suffer any hardship in the face of an injunction prohibiting them from replacing \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  those standards with the new Rule until resolution of this case on the merits.  Defendants’ \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  only argument with respect to the balance of equities or hardships and the public interest \nN\n19  is that Congress has made a policy judgment that aliens should be self-sufficient, and the \n20  executive should not be prevented from implementing a rule that advances that policy. \n21  On the other hand, implementing the change defendants propose would upend \n22  state and local governments’ operations as they support immigrants while determining \n23  how to adjust to the new Rule and provide services that the federal government once \n24  predictably assisted with.  To the extent this factor is merged with the public interest and \n25  considers the effects on non-parties, the most severely affected individuals are the aliens \n26 \n                                            \n27 \n22 As the issue was not meaningfully addressed by the parties, the court does not decide \nat this time whether California Primary Care Association satisfies the requirements for \n28 \nassociational standing. \n86 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 87 of 93\n \n1  seeking LPR status themselves, who would face uncertainty regarding their access to \n2  healthcare and subsidized nutrition as they learn to adapt to and attempt to navigate the \n3  Rule’s deterrents. \n4  In short, implementing the Rule after decades of a consistent policy prior to a \n5  determination of this action on the merits—which defendants argue will be accomplished \n6  in short order—does little to advance the defendants’ interests, and it would entirely \n7  upend the plaintiffs’ (and the non-party aliens’) interests.   \n8  4.  An Injunction Is in the Public’s Interest \n9  “When the government is a party, the last two factors merge.”  Azar, 911 F.3d at \n10  575.  Therefore, the public interest analysis is subsumed in the balance of equities and \n11  hardships, addressed above, and the public interest therefore favors and injunction. \n  12  Even though the public’s interest generally merges with the balance of equities, it \n a\ntruin\noro 13  can be “appropriate to consider the factors separately,” for example when intervenors \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  present distinct interests.  League of Wilderness Defs./Blue Mountains Biodiversity \niD tc 15  Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014).  In those instances, “[t]he \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  public interest inquiry primarily addresses impact on non-parties rather than parties.”  Id. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Here, the public interest cuts sharply in favor of an injunction.  Specifically, the \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  public interest supports continuing the provision of medical services through Medicaid to \nN\n19  those who would predictably disenroll absent an injunction, for numerous reasons.  \n20  Although the court has not reached the issue as to whether plaintiffs’ arguments \n21  regarding the impacts on public health support their argument for imminent harm, the \n22  parties and numerous amici have explained that the predictable disenrollment from \n23  Medicaid absent an injunction would have adverse health consequences not only to \n24  those who disenroll, but to the entire populations of the plaintiff states, for example, in the \n25  form of decreased vaccination rates.  The public certainly has an interest in decreasing \n26  the risk of preventable contagion. \n27  As such, the public interest supports preserving the long-standing status quo \n28  pending final, coherent resolution on the merits. \n87 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 88 of 93\n \n1  5.  Scope of the Injunction Necessary to Redress Plaintiffs’ Imminent \n2  Harms \n3  a.  Legal Standard \n4  When a plaintiff satisfies its burden to demonstrate that a preliminary injunction \n5  should issue, “injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \n6  necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Califano, 442 U.S. at 702; accord \n7  L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc. v. Sebelius, 638 F.3d 644, 664 (9th Cir. 2011) (injunction \n8  “should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \n9  relief to the plaintiffs before the court”) (internal quotation mark omitted); Lamb-Weston, \n10  Inc. v. McCain Foods, Ltd., 941 F.2d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 1991) (“Injunctive relief . . . must \n11  be tailored to remedy the specific harm alleged.”).  “‘The purpose of such interim \n  12  equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties but to balance the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  equities as the litigation moves forward.’”  Azar, 911 F.3d at 582. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  But “[t]here is no general requirement that an injunction affect only the parties in \niD tc 15  the suit.”  Bresgal v.

Ct. 2779 (2019). \n22  With respect to immigration matters in particular, the Ninth Circuit has “consistently \n23  recognized the authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a universal basis.”  \n24  E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 779 (citing Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 908 F.3d at \n25  511; Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 (9th Cir. 2017), rev'd on other grounds and \n26  remanded, 138 S.

That is because, even though courts have the \n4  authority to issue nationwide preliminarily injunctions, doing so still requires “an \n5  articulated connection to a plaintiff’s particular harm[.]”  Id. (“nationwide injunction is [not] \n6  appropriate simply because this case presents a rule that applies nationwide”); see also \n7  Azar, 911 F.3d at 582–84.  That requirement is not lifted in the immigration context.  E.g., \n8  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029 (“Under our case law, however, all injunctions—\n9  even ones involving national policies—must be ‘narrowly tailored to remedy the specific \n10  harm shown.’”); E. Bay Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 779 (nationwide scope appropriate \n11  where it “is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress” and district \n  12  court could not “have crafted a narrower remedy that would have provided complete relief \n a\ntruin\noro 13  to the [plaintiffs]”) (quoting Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 908 F.3d at 512) (internal \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  quotation mark omitted).23 \niD tc 15  The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that any preliminary injunction must be \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  supported by evidence in the record identifying the likely effect the enjoined conduct \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would have on the particular plaintiffs.  E.g., San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244 \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  (the “record is not sufficient to support a nationwide injunction” where “the Counties' \nN\n19  tendered evidence is limited to the effect of the Order on their governments and the State \n20  of California. . . .  However, the record is not sufficiently developed on the nationwide \n21  impact of the Executive Order.”); Azar, 911 F.3d at 584 (“On the present record, an \n22 \n                                            \n23 The Ninth Circuit requires an articulated connection to a plaintiff’s particular harms \n23 \nnotwithstanding “the need for uniformity in immigration policy.”  See Regents of the Univ. \nof Cal., 908 F.3d at 511 (“Allowing uneven application of nationwide immigration policy \n24 \nflies in the face of these requirements.”); Hawaii v.

Trump, 897 F.3d at \n1244 (“These exceptional cases are consistent with our general rule that ‘[w]here relief \n26 \ncan be structured on an individual basis, it must be narrowly tailored to remedy the \nspecific harm shown’—'an injunction is not necessarily made overbroad by extending \n27 \nbenefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit ... if such \nbreadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.’”) \n28 \n(quoting Bresgal, 843 F.2d at 1170–71). \n89 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 90 of 93\n \n1  injunction that applies only to the plaintiff states would provide complete relief to them.  It \n2  would prevent the economic harm extensively detailed in the record.  Indeed, while the \n3  record before the district court was voluminous on the harm to the plaintiffs, it was not \n4  developed as to the economic impact on other states.”).  “District judges must require a \n5  showing of nationwide impact or sufficient similarity to the plaintiff states to foreclose \n6  litigation in other districts, from Alaska to Puerto Rico to Maine to Guam.”  Azar, 911 F.3d \n7  at 584. \n8  Finally, although the scope of the injunction in this action is governed by the \n9  controlling Ninth Circuit law explained above, the court notes that the Ninth Circuit and \n10  the Supreme Court have both credited prudential considerations supporting their \n11  admonition that nationwide preliminary injunctions are appropriate only in “exceptional \n  12  cases.”  See San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244; E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at \n a\ntruin\noro 13  1029.  First, nationwide injunctions unconnected to a plaintiff’s particular harm \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  “unnecessarily ‘stymie novel legal challenges and robust debate’ arising in different \niD tc 15  judicial districts.”  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029; see also Azar, 911 F.3d at 583 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  (“The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that nationwide injunctions have \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  detrimental consequences to the development of law and deprive appellate courts of a \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  wider range of perspectives.”).  That consideration is relevant here, where actions raising \nN\n19  similar changes are also currently pending in district courts in New York, Maryland, and \n20  Washington, and perhaps more.  Second, nationwide injunctions may fail to adequately \n21  recognize “the equities of non-parties who are deprived the right to litigate in other \n22  forums,” who “are essentially deprived of their ability to participate[.]”  Azar, 911 F.3d at \n23  583.  Third, “[n]ationwide injunctions are also associated with forum shopping, which \n24  hinders the equitable administration of laws.”  Id. \n25  b.  Analysis \n26  Here, the Counties and the States have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable \n27  harm based on their loss of Medicaid funding from the federal government and increased \n28 \n90 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 91 of 93\n \n1  operational costs they are likely to carry.24  Those harms stem directly from disenrollment \n2  of individuals seeking medical care in their jurisdictions, residing in their jurisdictions, and \n3  enrolling in certain other public benefits in their jurisdictions (for example, school lunch \n4  programs).  Those harms, and the supporting record, are discussed in detail above.  In \n5  order to preserve the status quo pending resolution on the merits and to prevent certain \n6  of these irreparable harms, it is necessary to enjoin implementation of the Rule with \n7  respect to those who reside in the States and Counties any time following the date of this \n8  order, until this action is resolved on the merits.  Moreover, defendants must be \n9  additionally enjoined from applying the Rule to any individual who is part of a household \n10  (as defined in the Rule, 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(d)) that includes a person who has resided in a \n11  plaintiff State or County any time following the date of this order, until this action is \n  12  resolved on the merits. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Defendants may, of course, continue to process applications and otherwise \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  operate pursuant to the standards employed prior to October 15, 2019—that is, pursuant \niD tc 15  to the status quo. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  The plaintiffs request a nationwide injunction based primarily on what they argue \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  would be the inadministrability of an immigration policy that is not administered uniformly \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  nationally.  But a nationwide injunction is not “appropriate simply because this case \nN\n19  presents a rule that applies nationwide.”  E. Bay Sanctuary II, 934 F.3d at 1029; accord \n20  San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d at 1244 (record must also be independently \n21  “developed on the nationwide impact” and the statewide impact). \n22  Plaintiffs also argue that a nationwide injunction is necessary to provide certainty \n23  to the public and quell confusion about the implementation of the Rule.  They argue that \n24  general, nationwide confusion will cause disenrollment even in the States and Counties, \n25 \n                                            \n26 \n24 Because the Organizations have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on—or \nserious questions going to—the merits of their APA causes of action (the only claims \n27 \nunderlying their motion for preliminary injunction), they have not demonstrated that an \ninjunction should issue to prevent the harms they are likely to suffer, so the court does \n28 \nnot consider their alleged harms in determining the scope of the injunction. \n91 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 120   Filed 10/11/19   Page 92 of 93\n \n1  causing the above-discussed harms.  Plaintiffs have certainly demonstrated that \n2  confusion about the nation’s immigration policies is a cause of disenrollment, even for \n3  those who will not be subject to the public charge assessment.  However, plaintiffs have \n4  not demonstrated the marginal effect a nationwide injunction would have on curing that \n5  confusion for their residents over and above an injunction limited to their own borders.  \n6  Although it is conceivable that a nationwide injunction pending resolution on the merits \n7  would lead to less disenrollment due to confusion within California than this injunction \n8  covering all of California (and the other States), it is plaintiffs’ obligation to demonstrate \n9  the necessity of such relief.  This court does not suggest that no evidence could support \n10  such an injunction.  Nor does the court suggest that the record evidence is necessarily \n11  insufficient.  Rather plaintiffs, by devoting only a few cursory paragraphs in their briefs to \n  12  the scope the injunction, have failed to sufficiently tie that evidence to the need for an \n a\ntruin\noro 13  injunction beyond their borders in order to remedy the specific harms alleged and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  accepted by the court as likely, imminent, and irreparable. \niD tc 15  CONCLUSION \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16    For the foregoing reasons, the States and Counties’ motion for a preliminary \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  injunction is GRANTED, as explained above.  The Organizations’ motion is DENIED, \ne\nh\nt\ninrt\nUo 18  because they do not fall within the zone of interests of the statute forming the basis of \nN\n19  their APA claims. \n20  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n21  Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of Homeland \n22  Security, Kevin McAleenen as Acting Secretary of DHS, Kenneth T.

The State of California, the District of Columbia, the State of Maine, the \n3 \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the State of Oregon (hereinafter, Plaintiffs) bring this action \n4 \nto challenge unlawful regulations promulgated by Defendants, the U.S. Department of Homeland \n5 \nSecurity (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Acting Secretary of DHS \n6 \nKevin McAleenan, and Acting Director of USCIS Kenneth Cuccinelli.  Inadmissibility on Public \n7 \nCharge Grounds, RIN 1615-AA22, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“Public Charge Rule” \n8 \nor “Rule”).  In the Rule, Defendants illegally expand the circumstances in which DHS may deny \n9 \nindividuals’ admission to the United States on “public charge” grounds, when seeking an \n10 \nextension of stay, change of visa category, or lawful permanent resident status.  The Rule stacks \n11 \nthe deck against marginalized populations, such as children, students, individuals with \n12 \ndisabilities, older adults, and low-wage working families.  The Rule uproots the understanding of \n13 \npublic charge as primary dependence on the government, creating new bars that have not been \n14 \nauthorized by Congress, such as making a low income a “heavily weighted” negative factor in \n15 \nadmissibility.  The Rule also penalizes immigrants who use common, non-cash federal public \n16 \nbenefit programs—community (i.e. non-institutional) Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition \n17 \nAssistance Program (SNAP), Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, Section 8 Project-\n18 \nBased Rental Assistance, and Section 9 Public Housing—for which they are legally eligible.   \n19 \n2.  Overall, the Rule represents a radical departure in the treatment of low- and \n20 \nmoderate-income immigrants, whom the United States has historically welcomed.  “Public \n21 \ncharge” is a legal term used first by Congress to exclude “any person unable to take care of \n22 \nhimself or herself without becoming a public charge” alongside “convict[s], lunatic[s], and \n23 \nidiot[s].”  An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, 22 Stat. 214, 47th Cong. (1882).  For \n24 \ngenerations, the term has applied to exclude only individuals who are primarily dependent on the \n25 \ngovernment for subsistence, such as by receiving public cash assistance for income maintenance \n26 \nor institutionalization at government expense.   \n27 \n28 \n \n  1   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 3 of 63\n \n1  3.  With the Public Charge Rule, Defendants have expanded the law to block vast swaths \n2  of our nation’s foreign-born residents from making critical changes in their immigration status, \n3  just because they are not wealthy.  Indeed, the Rule is so draconian that a substantial proportion \n4  of all U.S. citizens could, if subjected to the Rule, be deemed a “public charge.”   \n5  4.  As Defendants themselves acknowledged, the Rule will cause grievous harm to \n6  immigrants and their communities.  It will increase the prevalence of disease, drive up the costs \n7  of medical care, and increase poverty.  It will encourage immigrants to disenroll from federal \n8  healthcare, supplemental nutrition assistance, and housing programs for which they are otherwise \n9  eligible.  And it will chill the participation of immigrants and families with mixed immigration-\n10  status in public benefit programs generally, even for individuals not directly subject to a public \n11  charge test, and even with respect to benefits and services that are not enumerated in the Rule.   \n12  5.  The interests of Plaintiffs will suffer as a result.  Plaintiffs will lose federal funds as \n13  immigrants disenroll from affected programs.  Responding to the Rule will impose substantial \n14  administrative costs for Plaintiffs’ agencies that respond to the confusion and fear it will \n15  engender, and disrupt health and social services systems that serve as safety nets for Plaintiffs’ \n16  residents.  The negative public health repercussions of reduced access to healthcare and housing \n17  and poorer nutrition will ultimately be paid for by Plaintiffs.   \n18  6.  The Rule does not comport with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure \n19  Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701, et seq.  It is contrary to established law regarding what it means to \n20  be a public charge.  Defendants’ primary purported rationale for the rule—encouraging self-\n21  sufficiency—is directly undermined by the Rule itself.  The Rule’s new income thresholds target \n22  low-and moderate-income individuals and families who have never used public benefits.  In \n23  addition, the Rule discourages use of publicly funded benefits that are critical to furthering the \n24  self-sufficiency of vast numbers of working families—immigrant and native-born U.S. citizens \n25  alike.       \n26  7.  Defendants’ true motivations are not difficult to discern.  The Rule will \n27  disproportionately impact non-White, non-European immigrants from Asia, Latin America, the \n28  Caribbean, and Africa, as well as prevent more immigrants of color from changing or extending \n \n  2   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 4 of 63\n \n1  their visas or becoming lawful permanent residents and, ultimately, citizens.  The Rule was \n2  motivated by intentional race- and national origin-based animus against individuals from what \n3  President Trump has referred to as “shit-hole countries.”  For this reason, the Rule violates the \n4  equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. \n5  8.  More than any other jurisdiction, California will bear the brunt of this illegal Rule.  \n6  California has the largest immigrant population in the United States and is home to more than 10 \n7  million immigrants from around the world.  In fact, nearly 25 percent of the 43.7 million foreign-\n8  born immigrants in the U.S. live in California, and almost half of California children have at least \n9  one immigrant parent.  Of these children, over 4 million are U.S. citizens.  Defendants’ Public \n10  Charge Rule will disrupt California’s statutory and regulatory interests, cause harm to millions of \n11  its residents, and damage its economy. \n12  9.  The District of Columbia is home to people from more than 170 nations.  More than \n13  95,000 District residents, who make up approximately 15 percent of the District’s population, \n14  were born in another country.  Another 10 percent of District residents are native-born U.S. \n15  citizens with at least one immigrant parent.  Immigrants make up almost a quarter of the District’s \n16  civilian workforce.  The Public Charge Rule will impair the District’s statutory and regulatory \n17  interests, cause harm to thousands of its residents, and damage its economy.  \n18  10.  The State of Oregon is home to approximately 400,000 immigrants, who make up \n19  over 14% of the population.  Approximately 12 percent of the U.S.-citizen children residing in \n20  Oregon have at least one immigrant parent.  Nearly 90,000 U.S. citizens living in Oregon have at \n21  least one family member who is undocumented.  Most importantly, Oregon has more than 10,000 \n22  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.  Finally, approximately 260,000 \n23  workers in Oregon are immigrants, comprising over 12 percent of the workforce generally.  The \n24  Public Charge Rule will disrupt Oregon’s statutory and regulatory interests, cause harm to \n25  thousands of its residents, and damage its economy. \n26  11.  In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, almost 900,000 residents were born in \n27  another country, representing seven percent of Pennsylvania’s population.  Almost half of these \n28  immigrants have not yet become naturalized citizens.  Immigrants are an integral part of \n \n  3   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 5 of 63\n \n1  Pennsylvania’s economy: almost half a million immigrant workers contributed to Pennsylvania \n2  communities in 2015.  Immigrant-led households in Pennsylvania paid $5 billion in federal taxes \n3  and $2.1 billion in state and local taxes in 2014.  In addition, more than 342,000 children in \n4  Pennsylvania have at least one immigrant parent.  Of these children, almost 288,000 are U.S. \n5  citizens, over 143,000 are in low-income families, and over 113,000 are under the age of six.  As \n6  of 2016, nearly 5,000 DACA recipients live in Pennsylvania.  The Public Charge Rule will \n7  disrupt Pennsylvania’s statutory and regulatory interests, cause harm to thousands of its residents, \n8  and damage its economy. \n9  12.  Therefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court declare that the Public Charge \n10  Rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706, because it is contrary to law, \n11  exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority, is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and \n12  because it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \n13  Constitution.  Plaintiffs further request that this Court enjoin Defendants from implementing or \n14  enforcing the Rule. \n15  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n16  13.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201(a). \n17  14.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and 1391(e)(1).  \n18  A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this district, \n19  Plaintiff State of California resides in this district, and no real property is involved in the action.  \n20  This is a civil action in which Defendants are agencies of the United States or officers of such an \n21  agency. \n22  15.  Intradistrict assignment is proper in San Francisco or Oakland pursuant to Local \n23  Rules 3-2(c) and (d) because a substantial part of the events or omissions which give rise to the \n24  claim occurred in the counties of San Francisco and Alameda.    \n25  PARTIES \n26  PLAINTIFFS \n27  16.  Plaintiff the State of California, by and through Attorney General Xavier Becerra, \n28  brings this action.  As California’s Chief Law Officer, the Attorney General has the authority to \n \n  4   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 6 of 63\n \n1  file civil actions to protect public rights and interests and promote the health and welfare of \n2  Californians.  Cal. Const. art V, § 13.  This challenge is brought pursuant to the Attorney \n3  General’s independent constitutional, statutory, and common law authority to represent the public \n4  interest.   \n5  17.  Plaintiff the District of Columbia (the District) is a municipal corporation empowered \n6  to sue and be sued, and is the local government for the territory constituting the permanent seat of \n7  the federal government.  The District brings this case through Karl Racine, the Attorney General \n8  for the District of Columbia, who is the Chief Legal Officer for the District and possesses all \n9  powers afforded the Attorney General by the common and statutory law of the District.  The \n10  Attorney General is responsible for upholding the public interest and has the authority to file civil \n11  actions in order to protect the public interest.  D.C. Code § 1-301.81.  \n12  18.  Plaintiff the State of Maine, represented by and through its Attorney General Aaron \n13  Frey, is a sovereign state of the United State of America.  The Attorney General of Maine is a \n14  constitutional officer with the authority to represent the State of Maine in all matters and serves as \n15  its chief legal officer with general charge, supervision, and direction of the State’s legal business.  \n16  Me. Const. art. IX, Sec. 11; Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 5, §§ 191 et seq.  The Attorney General’s powers \n17  and duties include acting on behalf of the State and the people of Maine in the federal courts on \n18  matters of public interest.  The Attorney General has the authority to file suit to challenge action \n19  by the federal government that threatens the public interest and welfare of Maine residents as a \n20  matter of constitutional, statutory, and common law authority.  \n21  19.  Plaintiff the State of Oregon is a sovereign state of the United States of America.  \n22  Plaintiff the State of Oregon, by and through its Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, brings this \n23  action.  Attorney General Rosenblum, is the Chief Law Officer of Oregon and is empowered to \n24  bring this action on behalf of the State of Oregon and the affected state agencies.  Or. Rev. Stat. \n25  §§ 180.060, 180.210, 180.220. \n26  20.  Plaintiff the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is a sovereign state of the United States \n27  of America.  This action is brought on behalf of the Commonwealth by Attorney General Josh \n28  Shapiro, the “chief law officer of the Commonwealth.”  Pa. Const. art. IV, § 4.1.  Attorney \n \n  5   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 7 of 63\n \n1  General Shapiro brings this action on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to his statutory \n2  authority.  71 Pa. Stat. § 732-204. \n3  21.  Plaintiffs are aggrieved by the actions of Defendants and have standing to bring this \n4  action because of the injuries to their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and/or proprietary interests \n5  caused by the Public Charge Rule.   \n6  22.  By making receipt of healthcare, nutrition, and housing assistance negative factors in \n7  admissibility determinations, the Rule threatens Plaintiffs’ interests in protecting the health, \n8  safety, and well-being of its residents, regardless of immigration status.  See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code \n9  § 3339(a); Cal. Gov’t. Code § 7285(a); Cal. Health & Safety Code § 24000(a); Cal. Lab. Code \n10  § 1171.5(a); D.C. Code §§ 2-1402.01, et seq; Or. Rev. Stat. § 180.805-810; Or. Rev. Stat. \n11  § 181A.820; Or. Rev. Stat. § 414.231(3). \n12  23.  By disproportionately targeting immigrant communities of color, the Rule further \n13  threatens Plaintiffs’ interest in prohibiting discrimination and preventing the denial of equal \n14  protection on the basis of race, color, national origin, and immigration status.  See, e.g., Cal. \n15  Const. art. I, §§ 7, 8, 31; D.C. Code §§ 2-1402.01, et seq; Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.006; 43 P.S. \n16  §§ 951–963. \n17  24.  By placing new barriers to full economic and social participation for low-wage \n18  workers and their families, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, the Rule threatens Plaintiffs’ \n19  economies, in which more than 7.4 million immigrant workers comprise a substantial proportion \n20  of the labor force.   \n21  DEFENDANTS \n22  25.  Defendant DHS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing and \n23  enforcing key aspects of immigration law.  DHS is a Department of the Executive Branch of the \n24  United States Government, and is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \n25  26.  Defendant USCIS is a component agency of DHS.  USCIS has primary responsibility \n26  implementing, administering, and enforcing federal immigration laws and policies, including \n27  processing applications by foreign nationals in the United States for immigrant and nonimmigrant \n28 \n \n  6   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 8 of 63\n \n1  visas, extension or change of visa, and adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident status. \n2  The Final Rule identifies USCIS as the agency that will implement the Final Rule. \n3  27.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.  He is \n4  responsible for implementing and enforcing immigration laws, and oversees DHS.  He is sued in \n5  his official capacity. \n6  28.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is the Acting Director of USCIS.  He is responsible \n7  for overseeing USCIS and its administration, implementation, and enforcement of federal \n8  immigration law and policy.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n9  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n10  I.  BACKGROUND ON PUBLIC CHARGE AND RELATED FEDERAL LAWS \n11  29.  Noncitizens seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States must establish that \n12  they are not inadmissible.  Inadmissibility is determined by Section 212 of the Immigration and \n13  Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), which contains several categories of \n14  inadmissibility, including inadmissibility on the public charge ground.   \n15  30.  The public charge ground of inadmissibility is applicable to noncitizens when \n16  applying for a nonimmigrant visa or adjusting to lawful permanent resident status (“LPRs,” \n17  commonly known as “green card” holders).  Even with a valid visa, such as a student visa, visa \n18  holders are subject to an inadmissibility determination by Customs and Border Protection every \n19  time they enter the United States at the port of entry.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,331.  Under certain \n20  circumstances, green card holders returning to the United States after brief trips abroad of more \n21  than six months can be considered to be seeking admission.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C).   \n22  31.  A green card holder can be denied citizenship as well as removed from the United \n23  States if the DHS establishes that they were inadmissible at the time of their original entry or \n24  adjustment of status under the law existing at the time of their adjustment.  8 U.S.C. \n25  § 1227(a)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. § 1429.   \n26  32.  Immigration officers evaluating a noncitizen’s admissibility make a public charge \n27  determination based on the totality of the circumstances, weighing five categories of statutorily \n28  defined factors.  These factors are:  (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) assets, resources, and \n \n  7   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 9 of 63\n \n1  financial status; (5) education and skills, and in some circumstances, whether the noncitizen has \n2  provided an affidavit of support from a qualifying sponsor.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4).   \n3  A.  History of Public Charge Law \n4  33.  In immigration law, the term “public charge” has been used for more than 100 years \n5  to refer to a person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.  Congress first \n6  used the term to provide for the exclusion of “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to \n7  take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge.”  An Act to Regulate \n8  Immigration, ch. 376, 22 Stat. 214, 47th Cong. (1882).  The primary purpose of this and similar \n9  public charge laws lay in preventing recently-arrived individuals from becoming primarily \n10  dependent on accommodations in institutions, such as almshouses, asylums, or charitable \n11  hospitals. \n12  34.  During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, over twenty-four million \n13  people immigrated to the United States—most destined for low-wage jobs.  During this time, a \n14  handful of immigration laws were approved that provided grounds for exclusion or deportation on \n15  the basis of poverty, mental and physical health, morality, or political beliefs.  While “paupers” \n16  and “persons likely to become a public charge” accounted for the majority of exclusions and \n17  deportations, the numbers of people excluded on these grounds remained sparingly low relative to \n18  the number of immigrants admitted.  The vast majority of immigrants, though poor, were \n19  welcome. \n20  35.  In 1952, Congress enacted the INA, collecting various federal provisions and \n21  reorganizing them into the modern, codified structure of immigration law.  The INA formalized \n22  numerous “nonimmigrant” categories of individuals entering the United States on a temporary \n23  basis, and enabled some to apply for legal permanent residency (i.e., adjustment of status) without \n24  having to leave the country and apply through a U.S. consulate abroad.   \n25  36.  In considering the INA, a congressional subcommittee tasked with investigating the \n26  existing immigration system recognized that “the elements constituting the likelihood of \n27  becoming a public charge are varied.”  Congress ultimately decided to include “public charge” as \n28  a basis for inadmissibility in section 212(a)(4) of the INA.   \n \n  8   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 10 of 63\n \n1  37.  In 1965, Congress did away with quotas that had severely limited the number of \n2  immigrants allowed entry from certain nations of origin, and repudiated the legacy of racial \n3  discrimination rooted in enactments such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the \n4  Immigration Act of 1924.  Congress put in place the system of immigrant admissions that the \n5  United States has largely continued to the present.  Congress weighted the system in favor of \n6  family reunification, allocating 74 percent of all permanent visas granted annually for family \n7  reunification categories, and the other 26 percent for employment-based categories.   \n8  38.  Congress began to impose additional restrictions on benefits eligibility for lawful \n9  permanent residents in the 1980s.  In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) \n10  prohibited immigrants with newly gained temporary lawful residency status under the specific \n11  “legalization” provisions of that law from receiving public benefits for the first five years.  The \n12  IRCA provided that an immigrant’s inadmissibility on public charge grounds under Section \n13  212(a)(4) could be waived so long as they demonstrated a history of employment in the United \n14  States evidencing self-sufficiency without receipt of “public cash assistance.”  8 U.S.C. \n15  § 1255a(d)(2)(B)(iii).  The implementing regulations defined “public cash assistance” as “income \n16  or needs-based monetary assistance…received…through federal, state or local programs designed \n17  to meet subsistence levels,” and specifically excluded “assistance in kind such as food stamps, \n18  public housing, and other non-cash benefits,” including Medicaid.  8 C.F.R. § 245a.1(i).   \n19  B.  1996 Welfare Reform Law and Codification of the Public Charge Test \n20  39.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n21  Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), setting new limitations on immigrant access to public benefits, \n22  and delegating responsibility for implementation of benefits to a greater degree to state \n23  governments through block grants.  The PRWORA imposed new restrictions on immigrants’ \n24  eligibility for federal means-tested public benefits.  The law created two categories of \n25  immigrants: “qualified” and “non-qualified.”  Qualified immigrants include, for example, lawful \n26  permanent residents, refugees, and asylees.  Non-qualified individuals include temporary visitors \n27  and undocumented immigrants.  Eligibility for federal benefits largely hinged on the category to \n28 \n \n  9   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 11 of 63\n \n1  which an immigrant was assigned, whether the individual arrived before or after the PRWORA’s \n2  enactment, and whether a five-year waiting period applied.   \n3  40.  Congress continued to make certain services available to all people regardless of \n4  immigration status, including: emergency medical care, public health programs (immunizations \n5  and treatment for communicable diseases); school breakfast and lunch programs; public education \n6  for kindergarten through twelfth grade; the Women, Infant and Children nutrition (WIC) \n7  program; and short-term, non-cash emergency disaster assistance.   \n8  41.  The PRWORA also preserved states’ authority to extend certain benefits to certain \n9  immigrants.  States were given the option to use federal funds to extend Medicaid and Temporary \n10  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits to qualified immigrants who arrived before the \n11  PRWORA was enacted.  States also retained authority to create state-funded programs for \n12  immigrants who were no longer eligible for federal benefits under the PRWORA.   \n13  42.  One month after the PRWORA was enacted through bipartisan agreement, Congress \n14  approved the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and \n15  codified a “totality of the circumstances” test for determining inadmissibility based on the public \n16  charge ground.       \n17  43.  Nothing in the PRWORA or the IIRIRA suggested that Congress intended to subject \n18  immigrants eligible for state or federally funded non-cash assistance to a public charge \n19  determination based on application for or receipt of such congressionally authorized benefits.  In \n20  fact, Congress considered and rejected a public charge definition that would have included food, \n21  healthcare, and housing assistance.  IIRIRA, H.R. 104-828 at 138 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). \n22  C.  Additional Public Charge Guidance and Related Laws \n23  44.  The 1996 changes in law caused widespread confusion and fear, resulting in serious \n24  chilling effects, in which many immigrants declined to apply for or disenrolled from public \n25  benefits for which they were legally eligible under federal and state law.  \n26  45.  In order to alleviate the harms caused by immigrants not having healthcare coverage, \n27  food assistance, or other work supports, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \n28  proposed a rule confirming long-standing understanding of the term “public charge.”  In a Notice \n \n  10   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 12 of 63\n \n1  of Proposed Rulemaking, the agency confirmed that “public charge” meant only those “likely to \n2  become […] primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either \n3  the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term \n4  care at Government expense.”  Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 \n5  Fed. Reg. 28,676, 28,677 (May 26, 1999).     \n6  46.  While this proposed rule was never finalized, its substance was confirmed in the \n7  agency’s Field Guidance issued at the same time as the proposed rule and effective on that date, \n8  and used by the agencies responsible for assessing inadmissibility on public charge grounds, \n9  including Defendants, for more than 20 years.  Field Guidance on Deportability and \n10  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 Fed. Reg. 28,689 (May 26, 1999).  The Field \n11  Guidance was intended to “help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of the term ‘public \n12  charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, State, and local public \n13  benefits” and to “provide aliens with better guidance as to the types of public benefits that will \n14  and will not be considered in public charge determinations.”  Id. at 28692.  The INS explained \n15  that “federal, state, and local benefits are increasingly being made available to families” and that \n16  “participation in such non-cash programs is not evidence of poverty or dependence.”  Id. \n17  47.  The IIRIRA established that immigration officials must rely on affidavits of support \n18  submitted by sponsors in deciding whether an individual is inadmissible on the public charge \n19  ground.  Affidavits of support are legally enforceable as contracts, in which the sponsor agrees to \n20  support the immigrant financially.  8 U.S.C. § 1183a.   \n21  48.  For decades, DHS considered an affidavit of support as strong evidence that an \n22  immigrant will not become primarily dependent on the government.  Affidavits of support \n23  became a well established, straightforward and efficient process for adjudicators and immigrants \n24  to evaluate the public charge ground.   \n25  49.  In addition to sponsor affidavits, the standard surety bond for an individual deemed \n26  likely to become a public charge is $1,000.  8 U.S.C. § 1183; 8 C.F.R. § 213.1.     \n27 \n28 \n \n  11   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 13 of 63\n \n1  D.  Congress and States Create New Opportunities for Access to Public Benefit \nPrograms to Promote Public Health and Welfare  \n2 \n50.  Since the PRWORA, Congress has approved amendments to rollback certain \n3 \nrestrictions on federal public benefits for immigrants, particularly pregnant women and children, \n4 \nand all states have exercised their authority to varying degrees to make public benefits available \n5 \nto these immigrant populations.  Plaintiffs, in particular, have created robust safety nets that rely \n6 \nupon this public benefits framework to extend program services to immigrant residents as \n7 \nauthorized by federal law.   \n8 \n51.  For example, Medicaid is an essential source of health insurance for underserved \n9 \npopulation groups, including children, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and seniors.  \n10 \nEvery state except for Wyoming has extended Medicaid to certain noncitizens who arrived before \n11 \nthe PRWORA.     \n12 \n52.  Since 1997, states have had the option to provide 12 months of continuous Medicaid \n13 \nand Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) eligibility for noncitizen children, guaranteeing \n14 \na full year of coverage regardless of changes in family circumstances, such as income or \n15 \nhousehold size.  Guaranteeing ongoing coverage ensures that children and families access critical \n16 \ncare needed for healthy child development, supports the development of patient-provider \n17 \nrelationships, and reduces the state’s administrative burden.   \n18 \n53.  Plaintiffs California, Oregon, and the District of Columbia have selected the option \n19 \nprovided by federal law for twelve-month continuous certification periods for Medicaid, allowing \n20 \nthe states and District to maintain low uninsured rates and healthier communities.   Plaintiff \n21 \nPennsylvania covers children under Medicaid in continuous eligibility up to age three, regardless \n22 \nof citizenship status. \n23 \n54.  Medicaid enables states to provide a wide range of federally mandated healthcare \n24 \nservices, in addition to various optional services as determined by each state, to individuals who \n25 \nqualify for program eligibility.   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  12   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 14 of 63\n \n1  1.  California \n2  55.  California has exercised its authority to expand its Medicaid program (known as \n3  Medi-Cal) and SNAP (known as CalFresh) programs to include a broader range of services and \n4  beneficiaries.  \n5  56.  In 1998, recognizing the contributions of immigrants to the strength of our economy \n6  and communities, and the fundamental importance of nutrition to individual and community \n7  wellbeing, California established the California Food Assistance Program.  Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n8  Code §§ 18930, et seq.  The program was established to provide state-funded nutrition services \n9  for qualified noncitizens who are not eligible for federal benefits.  In doing so, California \n10  exercised its discretion and authority as provided for under federal law. \n11  57.  California has also taken advantage of a number of options for offering additional \n12  healthcare services.  For example, Medi-Cal’s 250% Working Disabled Program allows certain \n13  working individuals with disabilities to become eligible for Medi-Cal by paying low monthly \n14  premiums based on their net income.   \n15  58.  California also supports individuals with disabilities through In-Home Supportive \n16  Services (IHSS), a Medi-Cal program that provides assistance with activities of daily living for \n17  individuals with disabilities who are otherwise at risk of institutionalization.   \n18  59.  In 2014, California implemented Medicaid expansion, made available under the \n19  Affordable Care Act (ACA), to extend Medi-Cal eligibility to adults without children as well as \n20  parent and caretaker relatives.   \n21  60.  California has significantly invested in outreach and enrollment for affordable health \n22  programs.  As part of its implementation of the ACA, California established a single, statewide \n23  accessible application for all of its affordable health programs.  This application is used by all \n24  California entities authorized to make eligibility determinations, and all California residents are \n25  encouraged to apply.  A single automated system, the California Healthcare Eligibility, \n26  Enrollment, and Retention System (CalHEERS), serves as a consolidated system support for all \n27  eligibility, enrollment, and retention in Covered California (the state’s health insurance exchange) \n28  and Medi-Cal.   \n \n  13   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 15 of 63\n \n1  61.  To better address the needs of the state’s uninsured population, in 2015, California \n2  expanded full-scope Medi-Cal coverage to all low-income children through age 18, including \n3  immigrants, consistent with federal law.  Building on this expansion and its positive health \n4  outcomes, in 2019, California expanded full scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals from age 19 \n5  to 25 who meet all other eligibility criteria, including income standards, across all immigration \n6  and citizenship categories.   \n7  2.  District of Columbia \n8  62.  The District of Columbia has implemented programs to ensure that all residents have \n9  access to health coverage, regardless of their income, health status, or immigration status.  The \n10  District’s Medicaid programs fund health care to over 250,000 residents who meet income \n11  thresholds established by the District in accordance with federal guidelines. \n12  63.  In addition, the District makes health care coverage available to DC residents \n13  regardless of immigration status through the DC Healthcare Alliance Program, the Immigrant \n14  Children’s Program, and Cover All DC. \n15  64.  The DC Healthcare Alliance Program is a managed care health plan that provides \n16  medical assistance to low-income District residents who have no other health insurance and are \n17  not eligible for either Medicaid or Medicare.  This program is sponsored and paid for by the \n18  District government funds.   \n19  65.  The Immigrant Children’s Program (ICP) is a health coverage program that is offered \n20  to children under age 21 who are not eligible for Medicaid due to citizenship or immigration \n21  status.  The ICP provides coverage for residents of the District of Columbia who have no other \n22  health insurance and meet a certain income threshold. Services covered under the Immigrant \n23  Children Program are very similar to the services covered under Medicaid for children under age \n24  twenty-one (21).  It is sponsored and paid for by District government funds. \n25  66.  Cover All DC allows District residents who do not meet the income eligibility \n26  requirements for the Alliance and who are also ineligible to purchase private insurance on the DC \n27  Health Link (the District’s state health insurance exchange) to enroll in private health insurance. \n28 \n \n  14   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 16 of 63\n \n1  67.  The District’s Medicaid program and its locally-funded programs have helped reduce \n2  the uninsured rate among District residents, including in its immigrant communities. \n3  3.  Oregon \n4  68.  Oregon has also exercised various options to expand its Medicaid program (known as \n5  the Oregon Health Plan) to include a broad range of services and beneficiaries.  \n6  69.  In 2014, Oregon implemented Medicaid expansion, as authorized under the ACA, to \n7  extend Medicaid eligibility to adults without children as well as parent and caretaker relatives.     \n8  70.  As part of its implementation of the ACA, Oregon established a single, statewide \n9  accessible application for all affordable health programs.  This application is used by all Oregon \n10  entities authorized to make eligibility determinations, and all Oregon residents are encouraged to \n11  apply.  A single automated system, serves as a consolidated system support for all eligibility, \n12  enrollment, and retention in the state’s health insurance exchange and in numerous public benefit \n13  programs.    \n14  71.  To better address the needs of the state’s uninsured population, Oregon expanded \n15  full-scope coverage to all low-income children, including undocumented immigrants. \n16  4.  Pennsylvania \n17  72.  The Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (PADHS) administers the \n18  Commonwealth’s Medicaid program (known as Medical Assistance).  Pennsylvania has \n19  maximized the provision of Medical Assistance at the federal level, including implementing the \n20  ACA’s Medicaid expansion in 2015.  In March 2019, more than 2.8 million Pennsylvania \n21  residents received essential health coverage under Medical Assistance, including more than 1.2 \n22  million children under the age of 21.  Of these, approximately 174,580 individuals were non-\n23  citizens. \n24  73.  Pennsylvania provides Medical Assistance to its immigrant residents to the full extent \n25  allowed under federal law.  For example, non-citizen residents who are pregnant or children \n26  under age 21 are eligible for federally funded Medical Assistance if they meet other eligibility \n27  requirements. \n28 \n \n  15   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 17 of 63\n \n1  74.  Pennsylvania also provides state-funded Medical Assistance to certain groups of \n2  immigrants who do not otherwise qualify.  For example, non-citizen residents—both permanent \n3  and temporary—who are not pregnant, are not children under age 21, or have not resided in the \n4  U.S. for at least five years are eligible for state-funded Medical Assistance if they meet state \n5  criteria. \n6  75.  Pennsylvania residents cannot apply for state-funded Medical Assistance without also \n7  applying for federally funded Medical Assistance.  \n8  76.  PADHS also administers Pennsylvania’s SNAP program, which distributed \n9  approximately $218 million in food assistance benefits in May 2019 alone.  SNAP currently \n10  provides essential food assistance to more than 1.75 million Pennsylvanians, including almost \n11  80,000 immigrants.  Qualified immigrants are eligible for SNAP in Pennsylvania after five years. \n12  Some immigrants are exempt from the five-year bar, including immigrants under age 18 and \n13  immigrants who are blind or have another disability.  Pennsylvania also provides a Special \n14  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  WIC is available to \n15  pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women and to infants and children under five who have \n16  an income below 185% of the federal poverty limit and who have a medical or nutritional risk.  \n17  WIC provides nutrition services, breastfeeding support, health care and social service referrals, \n18  and healthy foods.  Residents who are eligible for TANF, Medical Assistance, and SNAP are \n19  categorically eligible for WIC, but participation in these other programs is not a prerequisite.  \n20  77.  PADHS also administers the Pennsylvania Housing Assistance Program, which \n21  provides grants to Pennsylvania counties.  These grants are then distributed to Pennsylvania \n22  residents to prevent homelessness and assist them in securing permanent housing.  Qualified \n23  immigrants under the PRWORA are eligible to receive housing assistance.  The Pennsylvania \n24  Housing Assistance Program is funded by state and federal dollars; for state fiscal year 2019-\n25  2020, Pennsylvania has budgeted more than $24 million in grant monies.  \n26  5.  Maine \n27  78.  The State of Maine has implemented state-funded health service programs to give \n28  certain health benefits to individuals who are not eligible for federal programs. \n \n  16   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 18 of 63\n \n1  79.   The Maine Health Insurance Purchase Option provides health benefits similar to the \n2  federal CHIP program to certain children who are not eligible for CHIP.  22 M.R.S.A. § 3174-\n3  T(2)(E). \n4  80.  Maine provides state-funded SNAP, a food supplement program for legal aliens.  22 \n5  M.R.S. § 3104-A. \n6  81.  Maine has also exercised various options to expand its Medicaid program (known as \n7  “MaineCare”) to include a broad range of services and beneficiaries.  \n8  82.  Maine implemented Medicaid expansion, effective July 2018, pursuant to the ACA, \n9  to extend MaineCare eligibility to adults without children as well as parent and caretaker \n10  relatives. \n11  83.  In the midsummer of 2019, hundreds of noncitizens arrived in Portland, Maine.  \n12  These noncitizens are eligible for the following state and municipal benefits:  Municipal General \n13  Assistance (Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 22, § 4301(3)); food banks; free vaccines provided through a \n14  Maine Centers for Disease Control (CDC) program; education; emergency MaineCare only; and \n15  general healthcare provided by Greater Portland Health, a health care entity.  Once a noncitizen \n16  applies for asylum or become paroled, they become eligible for state-funded SNAP and \n17  MaineCare if they are pregnant or under age 22.  \n18  II.  THE NEW PUBLIC CHARGE RULE  \n19  A.  Summary of the New Public Charge Rule \n20  84.  Defendants’ August 14, 2019 Public Charge Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292, represents a \n21  sweeping change in federal immigration policy that transforms a traditionally narrow ground of \n22  inadmissibility into a major barrier for thousands of low- and moderate-income immigrants \n23  present in the United States, limiting their ability to continue working or attending school, reunite \n24  with family, and become lawful permanent residents—thereby impeding their path to citizenship.   \n25  85.  The Public Charge Rule creates a new weighted evaluation system with a multitude \n26  of new positive and negative factors.  Multiple components of the evaluation system are \n27  significant departures from the federal government’s long-standing public charge test.  For \n28  example, under the Rule, a household income above the 250 percent income threshold, $30,350 \n \n  17   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 19 of 63\n \n1  for an individual or $62,750 for a family of four, is a heavily weighted positive factor, while a \n2  household income at the 125 percent income threshold (currently $15,613 for an individual or \n3  $32,188 for a family of four) is a negative factor.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,503-41,504; 8 C.F.R. \n4  § 212.22(c).  Other negative factors include being neither employed nor enrolled in school, not \n5  speaking English well or at all, not having a high school diploma, being either under age 18 or \n6  over age 61, and having any financial liabilities or a poor credit score.  Id.   \n7  86.  The Rule states that when evaluating an immigrant’s health, DHS will consider \n8  whether the individual “has any physical or mental condition that […] is significant enough to \n9  interfere with the person’s ability to care for himself or herself or to attend school or work, or that \n10  is likely to require extensive medical treatment.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,407.  But the Rule additionally \n11  includes a “heavily weighted negative factor” that gives significant consideration in a public \n12  charge determination to whether the immigrant is “uninsured and has neither the prospect of \n13  obtaining private health insurance, or the financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable \n14  medical costs related to the medical condition.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,504; 8 C.F.R. §212.22(c)(1)(iii).   \n15  87.  The Rule also imposes two major changes regarding the treatment of public benefits.  \n16  First, it expands the list of public benefits programs considered in the public charge \n17  determination.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,501; 8 C.F.R. §212.21.  Previous DHS policy considered only \n18  cash assistance for subsistence and institutionalization at public expense to be negative factors.  \n19  The Rule dramatically expands the types of public benefits considered in the public charge \n20  determination to include almost all federally-funded Medicaid healthcare coverage, food \n21  assistance through SNAP (known in California as CalFresh, and in Oregon as the Oregon Trail \n22  Card), and various types of housing assistance.  Second, immigration officials must now consider \n23  any current or likely use of these benefits as a “heavily weighted” negative factor, even if the \n24  value of the benefit reflects only small share of the immigrant’s total income, if the applicant \n25  received any of the enumerated benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within a 36-\n26  month period (receipt of two benefits in one month counts as two months).  84 Fed. Reg. 41,501; \n27  8 C.F.R. §212.21(a).    \n28 \n \n  18   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 20 of 63\n \n1  88.  For the first time in the history of the public charge doctrine, the Rule makes low \n2  wages alone a potential basis for a public charge determination.  Having a family income below \n3  $15,613 for an individual or $32,188 for a family of four—i.e. an income above the official \n4  poverty level—is now a negative factor in the public charge determination.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,503; \n5  8 C.F.R. §212.22(b)(4).  This income threshold is entirely independent from the individual’s past \n6  use of—or even application for—public benefits (itself a separate heavily negative factor, as \n7  described in the paragraph above).  Thus, immigrants who meet the Rule’s ostensible goal of \n8  “self-sufficiency” by foregoing public assistance can still be deemed inadmissible on public \n9  charge grounds simply because they earn less than an arbitrary amount selected by Defendants.   \n10  89.  The Rule mandates use of household size as a factor in the calculation of household \n11  income.  The significance the Rule gives household size disfavors families that live together and \n12  share resources, compared to single individuals.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,501-41,502; 8 C.F.R. \n13  §212.21(d).  This negative weight associated with family size is another first in the history of the \n14  public charge doctrine and illustrates the Rule’s profound shift in orientation toward negative \n15  treatment of immigrant families and the value of family unity. \n16  90.  The Rule substantially increases the minimum surety bond that an immigrant seeking \n17  a green card who is found to be inadmissible on public charge grounds (but is not otherwise \n18  inadmissible) may be permitted to submit.  Under the current policy, the minimum bond is \n19  $1,000.  The Rule multiplies this by a factor of eight to a minimum of $8,100.  This significant \n20  upfront cost imposes a much greater burden than the contractual obligations that immigrants, their \n21  families, and sponsors have traditionally agreed to when signing affidavits of support on behalf of \n22  intending immigrants.  The Rule also severely limits the use of public charge bonds, stating that \n23  they “generally will not” be allowed if an immigrant “has one or more heavily weighted negative \n24  factors” under the Rule.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,451.   \n25  91.  In a final major break from historic policy, the Rule calls for a new “condition” on the \n26  approval of applications to change or extend visas by requiring applicants to establish that they \n27  did not receive public benefits for more than 12 months in the aggregate within any 36-month \n28  period from the time they received their visas.  This condition creates new circumstances for visa \n \n  19   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 21 of 63\n \n1  holders to be found a public charge and makes the process for extensions and changes in \n2  categories more onerous.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,507; cf. 8 C.F.R. §214.1(a)(3)(iv). \n3  92.  Altogether, these changes reject the long-standing “primary dependency” test for \n4  inadmissibility on public charge grounds.  In the words of Acting USCIS Director Ken \n5  Cuccinelli, this Rule will rewrite the Emma Lazarus poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty to read, \n6  “give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and will not become a \n7  public charge.”   \n8  B.  Broad Scope and Disparate Impacts of the Rule \n9  93.  The Rule applies to several categories of people.  Individuals currently living and \n10  working in the U.S. who seek to adjust status to legal permanent residency, extend their legal \n11  status, or change their visa category to reflect relevant life transitions, will potentially be subject \n12  to the Rule.  People in these scenarios include graduating students, temporary workers, or \n13  undocumented persons who have married a U.S. citizen.  This includes a vast number of people—\n14  already living in the country—who have been waiting patiently in line for a visa through a \n15  family-based immigration petition.             \n16  94.  In 2017, approximately 380,000 individuals adjusted to legal permanent resident \n17  status through a pathway that likely would have subjected them to a public charge determination \n18  under the new Rule.  Similarly situated immigrants will now be at risk of being found to be \n19  inadmissible under the new Rule.   \n20  95.  The new, bright-line thresholds for income alone will result in DHS finding many \n21  more working immigrants likely to become a public charge.   \n22  96.  The incomes of fifty-six percent of recently admitted immigrants—a huge proportion \n23  of the workforce—would fall below the 250 percent income threshold, one of the Rule’s “heavily \n24  weighed positive” factors.  Many immigrant workers have incomes under the 125 percent \n25  threshold, which is a “heavily weighted negative factor” under the Rule.  The Rule recognized \n26  that many people with incomes below the 125 percent income threshold will now receive a public \n27  charge finding.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,417.     \n28 \n \n  20   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 22 of 63\n \n1  97.  For example, California childcare and early education providers’ average annual \n2  income is only $30,000, which for a family of four, equates almost exactly to the Rule’s 125 \n3  percent income cutoff.  Farmworkers earn less still, an average of $17,500 per year in seasonal \n4  employment.  And homecare workers earn just $14,000 in median annual income.   \n5  98.  In the District of Columbia, earnings tend to be slightly more modest for immigrant \n6  workers compared with District workers overall.  The share of workers earning under $10,000 per \n7  year is similar for immigrants and all District workers (13 to 14 percent).  But immigrant workers \n8  in the District are more likely than the average District worker to have annual earnings between \n9  $10,000 and $49,999, and they are less likely to earn $100,000 or more a year than all District \n10  workers.  Approximately 36 percent of immigrant workers in the District are below 200 percent \n11  of the federal poverty level. \n12  99.  In Oregon, a child day care providers’ average income is only $26,740, which for a \n13  family of four, equates almost exactly to the Rule’s 125 percent income cutoff.  Similarly, in \n14  Oregon, farmworkers earn a median annual income of less than $26,500 per year home health \n15  aides earn $26,450.   \n16  100.   In Oregon, one must earn $21.26 an hour to afford a two-bedroom apartment with \n17  unsubsidized rent.  Workers earning minimum wage would need to work at least 79 hours a week \n18  in order to afford rent on that same two-bedroom apartment.   \n19  101.   In Pennsylvania, over 140,000 immigrants (16 percent) live below the federal \n20  poverty level and over 300,000 immigrants (34.7 percent) live below 200 percent of the federal \n21  poverty level.  The median household income in Pennsylvania is $56,951, well below the 250 \n22  percent income threshold for a family of four ($64,375).  There are over 380,000 Pennsylvania \n23  residents living in immigrant families with incomes under the 250 percent threshold, but only \n24  17,800 individuals living in immigrant families receiving a cash assistance benefit.  This means \n25  approximately 366,000 Pennsylvania residents have the potential to be subject to heavy scrutiny \n26  under the Rule despite not receiving any cash assistance.  \n27  102.   The Rule will have a profound disparate impact on immigrants from countries \n28  whose residents are non-White, and who already face significant economic disadvantage.  The \n \n  21   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 23 of 63\n \n1  poverty rate in California for Latinos (14 percent) is twice the poverty rate for Whites (7 percent).  \n2  For Blacks, the poverty rate is higher still, at 17 percent.  In Pennsylvania, the poverty rate for \n3  Hispanics (24 percent) and Blacks (23 percent) is more than three times that of Whites (7 \n4  percent).  In Oregon, the poverty rate for Blacks is 25.8%, 19.4% for Latinos, and 12.4% for \n5  Whites. \n6  103.   The gap between Latino and White elders in California is even wider than the \n7  overall Latino-White general population gap; the poverty rate for Latinos over age 65 is more \n8  than two-and-a-half times that for Whites.  Thus, the Rule’s disproportionate effect will be even \n9  more pronounced on elderly people of color and the extended families of which they are often a \n10  critical part. \n11  104.   Non-White families in the United States are less likely to have the wealth necessary \n12  to post the substantial minimum bonds that may be allowed for family members who are found to \n13  be inadmissible on public charge grounds. \n14  105.   Further, many people of color tend to have considerably larger household sizes than \n15  Whites, a function of housing costs, income, family size, culture, and the extended family living \n16  arrangements discussed above.  Conversely, the percentage of single-person households in \n17  California is much higher among White families than Latino families and most other immigrant \n18  groups. \n19  106.   Since the income needed to avoid a negative weight increases with larger household \n20  sizes, the incomes of immigrants from communities of color are more likely to fall within the \n21  negative band. \n22  107.   Because of these disparities, the Rule is more likely to prevent immigrants of color \n23  in the United States from adjusting their status, or extending or changing their visas, compared to \n24  their White immigrant counterparts.  Defendants concede that the Rule “may impact in greater \n25  numbers communities of color, including Latinos and AAPI [Asian-American, Pacific Islander] \n26  […] and therefore may impact the overall composition of immigration with respect to these \n27  groups.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,369.   \n28 \n \n  22   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 24 of 63\n \n1  108.   In addition to immigrants directly affected by the Rule because they may be subject \n2  to a public charge test, many more of our nation’s immigrants and families with mixed \n3  immigration-status will be indirectly affected.  The Rule’s inclusion of non-cash benefits as \n4  relevant to any public charge determinations will create a chilling effect that will discourage \n5  many other immigrants, such as refugees and asylees who are not otherwise subject to the Rule, \n6  from accessing benefits that they need and for which they are eligible.  See Section IV below.   \n7  109.   Defendants concede that the Rule will have a “potentially outsized impact […] on \n8  individuals with disabilities” while claiming that “disability itself would not be the sole basis for \n9  an inadmissibility finding,” 84 Fed. Reg. 41,368, 41,410.   \n10  110.   In fact, the Rule’s new criteria are so broad that they will exclude some persons with \n11  significant disabilities solely on that basis.  In addition to the already-existing health criteria, the \n12  Rule now requires immigration officials to consider whether the applicant “has any physical or \n13  mental condition […] significant enough to interfere with the person’s ability to care for himself \n14  or herself […].”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,407.  Medicaid-funded home and community-based services, \n15  which can assist individuals with disabilities with self-care and help them attain and retain \n16  independence and the ability to work, are treated as independent, heavily weighted negative \n17  factors against an immigrant with a disability.   \n18  III.  THE NEW PUBLIC CHARGE RULE IS DEEPLY FLAWED AND CONTRARY TO FEDERAL LAW  \n19  A.  The Rule is Contrary to Law \n20  111.   A person who merely happens to be of moderate income or poor, or who is likely to \n21  receive the types of public benefits that many other working members of society receive, is not a \n22  “public charge” within the meaning of Section 212(a)(4) of the INA.   \n23  112.   The Rule’s interpretation of public charge is inconsistent with all prior judicial \n24  interpretations of that term to date.    \n25  113.   Nor is the Rule consistent with prior agency interpretations of public charge.  Past \n26  DHS policy limited the term “public charge” to individuals likely to be “primarily dependent” on \n27  cash benefits for income maintenance, or institutionalized in “primarily government-funded” \n28  long-term care facilities.   \n \n  23   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 25 of 63\n \n1  114.   While application of the totality of the circumstances test involves some discretion, \n2  prior interpretations of the term require a public charge determination to be founded upon an \n3  individual’s primary dependence on the government for subsistence.   \n4  115.   Bright-line thresholds for income as a factor in inadmissibility determinations are \n5  contrary to the INA and to the IIRIRA’s codification of the “totality of the circumstances” test, \n6  and also bear no relationship to the meaning of public charge as established by Congress.   \n7  116.   For example, nothing in federal law supports establishment of an $8,100 minimum \n8  surety bond, a significant increase over the current minimum.  This amount is prohibitively high \n9  and deprives immigrants of the individualized analysis required by the IIRIRA.  \n10  117.   The bond requires low-income individuals to freeze significant assets in \n11  government-held bonds for years.  And while Defendants acknowledge that bond expenses may \n12  further destabilize an applicant’s self-sufficiency, they fail to provide any meaningful explanation \n13  why no alternative option would suffice, claiming that the mere likelihood of becoming a public \n14  charge requires monetary assurance.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,454.  The median American household’s \n15  savings balance, regardless of citizenship status, is just $11,700.  An $8,100 bond requirement \n16  would decimate a typical family’s cash reserves, and require many to go into debt to obtain the \n17  funds to post such a bond.  The new bond requirement only increases the likelihood that an \n18  immigrant will need to access public benefits in case of an emergency.   \n19  118.   Pursuant to the IIRIRA, USCIS has for decades accepted legally enforceable \n20  affidavits of support as contracts from sponsors, employers, and relatives, and in certain \n21  circumstances, failure to provide such an affidavit renders the applicant inadmissible.  Defendants \n22  offer no explanation for not treating these affidavits as sufficient assurance that immigrant \n23  applicants will not become overly reliant on the social safety net, without requiring immigrants to \n24  freeze significant assets in government-held bonds for years.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,454.   \n25  119.   The Rule’s inclusion in the definition of public charge of benefits used for more than \n26  12 months in the aggregate within a 36-month period, where receipt of two benefits in one month \n27  counts as two months, in supplemental medical, nutritional, or housing assistance, is also contrary \n28  to Section 212(a)(4).  84 Fed. Reg. 41,501; 8 C.F.R. §212.21(a). \n \n  24   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 26 of 63\n \n1  120.   Congress designed the programs enumerated by the Rule (community Medicaid, \n2  SNAP, public housing and housing subsidies) to improve health outcomes and economic \n3  opportunity for working communities.  As the INS concluded twenty years ago, modern public \n4  benefit programs reflect “broad public policy decisions about improving general public health and \n5  nutrition, promoting education, and assisting working-poor families in the process of becoming \n6  self-sufficient.”  64 Fed. Reg. at 28692.   \n7  121.   Congress intended to give states the flexibility to make decisions about whether and \n8  in what circumstances to include immigrants in certain federal benefit programs, and gave the \n9  states even more flexibility with respect to state-funded programs.  But immigrant families may \n10  not know or be able to determine whether a program is federally or State-funded, and many will \n11  disenroll from all public benefits as a precaution.  The chilling effects of the Final Rule will \n12  dramatically undercut state flexibility and reduce the ability of states to effectuate their respective \n13  policy priorities. \n14  122.   Moreover, in the years since the original inclusion of the term “public charge” in \n15  immigration law, Congress has enacted laws that substantially revise the rights of individuals \n16  with disabilities.  No longer is a person with a disability assumed to be a burden on society, and \n17  receipt of publicly-funded support services—such as Medicaid personal care services to keep \n18  individuals in their homes and communities as opposed to hospitals or other institutions—is \n19  common.  The rights of persons with disabilities to use such home- and community-based \n20  services have been codified in the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \n21  Supreme Court’s landmark Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) decision, and the ACA.  \n22  Congress intended that Medicaid services for persons with disabilities help them “attain or retain \n23  capability for independence or self-care.”  42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.  Congress never intended to attach \n24  negative weight to the receipt of such services for purposes of a public charge determination.   \n25  123.   State laws go even further.  For example, Pennsylvania has an “Employment First” \n26  law designed to “ensure that individuals with a disability be given the opportunity to achieve \n27  economic independence through jobs that pay competitive wages in community integrated \n28  settings.”  62 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 3402(1).  State, county, and other entities receiving public funding \n \n  25   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 27 of 63\n \n1  must consider competitive integrated employment as the preferred outcome of services and \n2  support for individuals with a disability who are eligible to work under state law.  62 Pa. Stat. \n3  Ann. § 3404.  \n4  124.   The Public Charge Rule attaches heavily negative weight to a healthcare program, \n5  Medicaid, that working individuals with disabilities use to support their independence.   \n6  125.   The Rule’s addition of community-based Medicaid, in addition to heavily weighting \n7  those who have been “diagnosed with a medical condition” that will “interfere with the alien’s \n8  ability to support him or herself,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 41316, means that some persons with \n9  disabilities now face an impossible hurdle to admissibility.   \n10  126.   Defendants’ attempted transformation of long-standing law and policy concerning \n11  who may be considered a public charge undermines Congress’ well-established goals of family \n12  reunification.  Congress did not delegate authority to DHS to make these changes to national \n13  immigration policy.  Similarly, DHS does not have authority to make substantial changes to \n14  impacting immigrant access to healthcare and other congressionally authorized benefit programs.     \n15  B.  Defendants Fail to Offer Adequate Justification for the Rule  \n16  127.   The APA requires reasonable justification for agency action, in particular where \n17  long-standing regulations are changed.  DHS has not presented evidence or research to justify its \n18  profound changes in the Public Charge Rule.   \n19  128.   The Rule’s purported justifications—to “minimize the incentive of aliens to \n20  immigrate to the United States because of the availability of public benefits and to promote self-\n21  sufficiency of aliens within the United States,” 84 Fed. Reg. 41,309— are not based on the \n22  statute, and is not even served by provisions of the Rule itself.   \n23  129.   Those subject to the Rule’s new changes—including immigrants adjusting to LPR \n24  status and those seeking to extend or change visa categories—are largely ineligible for any of the \n25  newly enumerated federal benefits.  Defendants acknowledge that “[noncitizens] who are \n26  unlawfully present and nonimmigrants [visa holders] physically present in the United States are \n27  generally barred from receiving federal public benefits other than emergency assistance,” and in \n28  fact, remain barred once admitted into lawful status for an additional five years.  84 Fed. Reg. \n \n  26   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 28 of 63\n \n1  41,313.  Furthermore, the Rule will primarily impact individuals adjusting status or changing \n2  their visa conditions who are generally not seeking to immigrate—they are already living in the \n3  United States.   \n4  130.    In light of these narrow direct effects, penalizing the use of congressionally \n5  authorized public benefits for individuals already residing in the U.S. in a manner that creates \n6  even broader chilling effects is not a proportionate or rational method to minimize incentives for \n7  immigration to the U.S.   \n8  131.   The Rule’s design fails to promote self-sufficiency because its income threshold is \n9  prohibitive even to low- and moderate-wage workers who do not use public benefits, and instead \n10  stifles a noncitizen’s ability to attain upward mobility by creating barriers to medical coverage \n11  and lawful employment.    \n12  132.   Nor is self-sufficiency served by a rule that discourages the use of non-cash \n13  healthcare, housing, and nutrition assistance.  Public benefits such as SNAP, for example, are \n14  intended to supplement, not replace, an individual’s ability purchase of basic food. Programs such \n15  as SNAP also provide employment services and enable families to afford to work and pay for \n16  housing.  As the administrative record shows, many workers and their dependents, regardless of \n17  immigration status, qualify for, utilize, and rely upon a wide range of public benefits.  Nearly \n18  three quarters of enrollees in the major federal programs are members of working families.  \n19  Overall, across immigration and citizenship categories, almost 60 percent of households with \n20  workers in the lowest decile of hourly wages (earning less than $7.42 per hour), and over half of \n21  those in the next highest decile (between $7.42 and $9.91 per hour), receive one of the public \n22  benefits enumerated in the Rule.   \n23  133.   Moreover, low-wage rates of many immigrants are not determinative of their \n24  abilities to contribute to and advance in the United States.  Immigrants work and contribute far \n25  more to the U.S. economy than they ever receive in public benefits.  Nevertheless, the Rule \n26  irrationally penalizes many immigrants for their low wages. \n27  134.   Defendants’ stated purpose of promoting self-sufficiency is further undermined by \n28  the Rule’s focus on income-earning capacity and age, neglecting the important contributions that \n \n  27   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 29 of 63\n \n1  non-citizen parents of adult children (themselves often naturalized citizens) make to support \n2  households’ economic self-sufficiency and emotional health. \n3  135.   In many working-class households, grandparents may be caretakers, providing \n4  critical support for working parents and their small children, or family members with illnesses or \n5  disabilities.  The Rule penalizes such arrangements based on the household’s income even when \n6  the applicant would add value to, and save costs for, the household, notwithstanding the Rule’s \n7  exemptions for caregivers.   \n8  136.   In adopting the Rule, Defendants ignored evidence in the administrative record \n9  showing that the Rule would cause serious harm to immigrants, their families, their communities, \n10  and Plaintiffs.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41,417.  These harms are described in more detail in Sections IV \n11  and V below. \n12  137.   Defendants refused to consider in the design of the Rule substantial evidence that \n13  despite the Rule’s various exemptions (e.g., for school-based Medicaid or vaccines), the Rule will \n14  have the predictable effect of causing harm to vulnerable populations and the community at large, \n15  due to chilling effects.   \n16  138.  In addition, Defendants included an exemption for individuals under the age of 21 \n17  who receive Medicaid benefits, but did not include a similar exemption for individuals under the \n18  age of 21 who receive SNAP benefits.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,501; 8 C.F.R. §212.21(b)(5)(iv).  The \n19  Rule does not acknowledge or address the harsh results that the Rule will impose on legal \n20  permanent resident children who will be subject to the public charge test pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \n21  § 1101(a)(13)(C) for reasons not within their control. \n22  139.    Although Defendants acknowledged when proposing the Rule that it may have the \n23  impact of “decreas[ing] disposable income and increas[ing] the poverty of certain families and \n24  children, including U.S. citizen children,” 83 Fed. Reg. 51277, it failed to conduct any \n25  meaningful assessment of chilling effect impacts on families’ well-being or on the State and local \n26  entities that will be impacted.   \n27  140.  The Rule provides an exemption from the public charge test for military service \n28  members and their spouses and children.  The factors considered in creating the military \n \n  28   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 30 of 63\n \n1  exemptions also apply to individuals who work in other low-wage sectors, such as agriculture, but \n2  Defendants failed to address those considerations.   \n3  141.    Defendants failed to weigh substantial reliance interests, including those associated \n4  with Plaintiffs’ integration of the administration of state and federal benefits, and other policies \n5  designed to promote broad-based access to healthcare services.   \n6  IV.  THE RULE WILL REDUCE PARTICIPATION IN VALUABLE PUBLIC PROGRAMS \n7  142.  As Defendants acknowledge, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,312, the Public Charge Rule will have \n8  a chilling effect on immigrants’ willingness to avail themselves of critically needed public \n9  benefits.   \n10  143.  The mere prospect of a public charge determination under the Rule will cause \n11  widespread confusion and fear, discouraging individuals from participating in public benefit \n12  programs in which they are eligible and authorized to participate. \n13  144.  Defendants estimate that this chilling effect will result in a 2.5 percent disenrollment \n14  rate in programs that are expressly included in the new public charge test (Medicaid, SNAP, and \n15  housing assistance).  84 Fed. Reg. 41,463.  According to the Rule’s estimates, over 324,438 \n16  individuals who are members of households with foreign-born noncitizens and about 9,632 \n17  households with at least one foreign-born noncitizen may forgo benefits for which they are \n18  eligible—an aggregate annual value that Defendants estimated to be over $1.5 billion.  Id.; 83 \n19  Fed. Reg. 51,266-69. \n20  145.  These estimates grossly understate the likely magnitude of chilling effects.  The \n21  Rule fails to quantify or weigh the chilling effects that will also impact immigrants who are not \n22  subject to the Public Charge Rule, U.S. citizens in mixed-status families, and public benefits, both \n23  state and federal, ostensibly exempted from consideration under the Rule.   \n24  146.  History demonstrates the likelihood of even greater chilling effects.  The 1996 \n25  enactment of the PRWORA caused disenrollment rates between 15 percent and 35 percent for all \n26  noncitizen immigrants and children in families with mixed immigration status.  Chilling effects \n27  for refugees have historically been even higher—with up to 60 percent disenrollment found in \n28 \n \n  29   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 31 of 63\n \n1  some cases, despite the fact that refugees have been generally exempted from restrictions on \n2  access to benefits.   \n3  147.  Plaintiffs operate a number of important programs that serve state residents, \n4  including immigrants, and will be negatively affected by the Rule’s chilling effect.   \n5  148.  California’s Medi-Cal provides healthcare coverage for one out of every three \n6  Californians, including more than two million noncitizens.  Similarly, one-third of the residents of \n7  the District of Columbia receive quality health care through the Medicaid program, including \n8  eligible noncitizens in accordance with federal law.  Over one-fifth of Pennsylvania residents \n9  receive health care through Pennsylvania Medical Assistance.  Approximately 23% of \n10  Oregonians receive quality health care through the Medicaid program, with children making up \n11  over half of the recipients.  Oregon’s Medicaid program is available to eligible noncitizens.   \n12  149.  Some of the noncitizens in the Plaintiff States who are eligible are enrolled in \n13  Medicaid programs that are funded with federal matching funds.  Noncitizens in the Plaintiff \n14  States who are not eligible to participate in federally-funded Medicaid programs are enrolled in \n15  authorized state-funded programs.  In practice, however, many participants do not distinguish \n16  between different types of publicly-funded healthcare services.  Fear that participation will \n17  jeopardize immigration status will affect utilization of all services, even those exempt from the \n18  Rule.   \n19  150.  Plaintiffs’ Medicaid programs provide comprehensive healthcare benefits to \n20  millions of participants.  In California, for example, full-scope Medi-Cal gives beneficiaries \n21  access to primary and preventive care, oral healthcare, hospitalization, prescription drugs, \n22  behavioral healthcare, and other vital services.  \n23  151.  Limited scope healthcare programs offer more targeted services.  For example, \n24  California’s state-funded Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) program \n25  is available to eligible low-income men and women in need of family planning coverage.  Family \n26  PACT services include a full range of FDA-approved contraceptives and comprehensive \n27  education, assistance, and services related to family planning.   \n28 \n \n  30   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 32 of 63\n \n1  152.  CHIP federal funds are used to extend Medicaid funding to children in working \n2  families whose parents or guardians exceed the income eligibility threshold for Medicaid, but \n3  lack access to affordable private coverage.  In California, District of Columbia, and Oregon, \n4  CHIP is part of the Medicaid program.   \n5  153.  Hundreds of thousands of Californians are likely to disenroll from Medi-Cal as a \n6  result of the Rule.  Those likely to disenroll include more than 40,000 children with at least one \n7  potentially life-threatening condition, such as asthma, influenza, diabetes, epilepsy, or cancer; \n8  27,000 children using prescribed medications; 24,000 newborns; and 17,000 children with \n9  musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions.   \n10  154.  Medicaid and CHIP provide health coverage to more than 132,000 children in \n11  Oregon who are U.S. citizens and have at least one immigrant parent.  If the immigrant parents \n12  avoid health care coverage, for fear of losing their immigration status, so will their child. \n13  155.  Thousands of residents in the District of Columbia are also likely to disenroll or \n14  forgo enrollment in the District’s Medicaid program, and its other District-funded health care \n15  programs for immigrants who do not qualify for federal benefits.  Currently, there are 9,800 \n16  Medicaid enrollees who are asylees, refugees, lawful permanent residents beyond the five-year \n17  bar, or have other qualifying immigration status.  In addition, more than 18,000 District residents \n18  are currently enrolled in the District-funded Alliance and ICP.  Many of these individuals will \n19  choose to opt out of coverage out of concern for their immigration status, or that of their family \n20  members. \n21  156.  Thousands of residents in Oregon are also likely to disenroll or forgo enrollment in \n22  Oregon’s Medicaid program, and its other state-funded health care programs for immigrants who \n23  do not qualify for federal benefits.  Oregon DHS’s call center has already had a surge in calls \n24  from concerned immigrants. \n25  157.  Pennsylvania Medical Assistance provides health coverage to almost 330,000 \n26  individuals with a household member who is a non-citizen.  The total number of these non-\n27  citizens is nearly 175,000.  Pennsylvania-funded Medical Assistance currently covers nearly \n28  1,800 immigrant children and pregnant women who not otherwise qualify for federally funded \n \n  31   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 33 of 63\n \n1  Medical Assistance.  If 35 percent of immigrant families disenrolled from Medical Assistance, \n2  almost 37,500 Pennsylvania families would lose health insurance.  \n3  158.  As commenters on the proposed rule noted, some of the chilling effects began \n4  occurring before the Rule was even finalized.  For example, the District of Columbia’s \n5  Department of Health Care Finance noted in its comment letter that it had already seen a 3.5 \n6  percent average decline in participation in local health care programs that extend coverage to \n7  immigrant adults and children.  Local health providers in the District of Columbia reported that \n8  this decline was directly attributable to fear and confusion about the application of a new public \n9  charge rule and its effect on the immigration status of immigrant families.  \n10  159.  SNAP helped more than 39 million people avoid food insecurity in 2018.  In \n11  providing SNAP benefits for the nation’s most vulnerable immigrants, Congress recognized the \n12  critical nature of nutrition for healthy families and communities. \n13  160.  In 2017, in California alone, SNAP served over four million California residents, \n14  including more than a million people at risk of chilling effects due to the Rule.  More than 74 \n15  percent of SNAP participants are in families with children, and almost 9 percent were in families \n16  with members who are elderly or have disabilities.  In addition, the California Food Assistance \n17  Program provides state-funded nutrition services for certain noncitizens who are not eligible for \n18  federal benefits.   \n19  161.  SNAP provides critical nutrition support to more than 64,000 households \n20  comprising more than 100,000 residents of the District of Columbia.  SNAP provides eligible \n21  individuals and families, including qualified immigrants and their families, non-cash benefits to \n22  support the health and well-being of low-wage workers, families, and elders.  In addition, many \n23  children in the District are directly certified for free or reduced-price school meals as a result of \n24  their families’ participation in SNAP.  The Public Charge Rule will chill participation of these \n25  eligible individuals and families in SNAP.   \n26  162.  In March 2019, there were more than 1.75 million Pennsylvania residents receiving \n27  essential food access via SNAP. There are almost 150,000 individuals receiving SNAP who live \n28  in a household with a non-citizen. The total number of these non-citizens is nearly 80,000. \n \n  32   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 34 of 63\n \n1  Pennsylvania has already witnessed a decrease in the number of SNAP cases since the Rule was \n2  first proposed in 2018. If 35% of immigrant families disenrolled from SNAP, more than 17,600 \n3  Pennsylvania families would lose access to basic nutrition. \n4  163.  DHS has conceded the Rule will lead to disenrollment of children from SNAP, a \n5  critical nutritional support.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,477.   \n6  164.  More than one hundred thousand Californians are likely to disenroll from CalFresh \n7  as a result of the Rule.   \n8  165.  In Oregon, SNAP or food stamp benefits are administered under a program called \n9  the Oregon Trail Card.  Approximately 597,000 Oregonians are using SNAP benefits in 2019, \n10  which benefits around 351,000 households.  Of those, approximately 25,000 children on \n11  Oregon’s SNAP caseload in the past year have an immigrant family member.  Oregon is already \n12  experiencing a decrease in applications for benefits due to fears that participation could affect a \n13  family member’s immigration status.  Children living in households who choose not to participate \n14  in SNAP or Medicaid, for fear of impacting their immigration status, will not automatically \n15  qualify for free or reduced-price school meals.   \n16  166.  In 2017, more than 58,000 District residents received housing assistance that will be \n17  included as a “public benefit” under the Rule.  More than 1,000 noncitizens in the District, \n18  including more than 400 noncitizens above the age of 62 received these benefits in 2017.  Up to \n19  1,000 District households could be negatively impacted by the Rule. \n20  167.  In 2017, more than one million Californians received a type of housing assistance \n21  that is now included as a public benefit under the Rule, including Section 8 housing vouchers or \n22  rental assistance, public housing, or other federal subsidies.   \n23  168.  Oregon Housing and Community Services has approximately 400 children in HUD-\n24  project housing with a head or co-head/spouse who is an immigrant.  The proposed rule change is \n25  likely to negatively impact these families and children.  If immigrant children become homeless, \n26  this will be a significant negative impact.  With regard to health outcomes, young children who \n27  experienced homelessness for more than six months were significantly more likely to have \n28  developmental delays, fair or poor health, and be hospitalized, than children who never \n \n  33   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 35 of 63\n \n1  experienced homelessness or did so for less than six months.  Thus, Oregon children who are U.S. \n2  citizens, but have immigrant parents, have much more to lose than just their homes because of \n3  this Rule.  \n4  169.  In Pennsylvania, 175,600 residents in 78,200 households use Section 8 Housing \n5  Choice Vouchers to afford decent, privately owned housing. There are an additional 406,700 \n6  people in 217,000 Pennsylvania households using Section 8 Rental Assistance.  \n7  V.  THE RULE WILL CAUSE IMMEDIATE, IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS’ \nCOMMUNITIES, ECONOMIES AND PUBLIC SYSTEMS  \n8 \nA.  The Rule Will Harm the Administration of Public Programs and Services  \n9 \n1.  Loss of Federal Funds to Support State Public Benefit Programs \n10 \n170.  The Rule’s chilling effects will harm Plaintiffs by reducing the number of eligible \n11 \nindividuals who choose to participate in public benefits programs, thereby causing loss of federal \n12 \nfunding associated with all individuals who were otherwise eligible for federally funded \n13 \nprograms.      \n14 \n171.  For example, Plaintiffs receive 50 percent or more in federal matching funds for \n15 \nqualified Medicaid expenditures.  Noncitizens who are eligible for federally funded Medicaid but \n16 \nchoose not to apply for such benefits reduces the amount of federal funding with which Plaintiffs \n17 \ncan ensure that their residents have access to healthcare. \n18 \n172.  Families with mixed immigration-status, i.e., families that include both U.S. citizen \n19 \nchildren and noncitizen parents, are particularly at risk of disenrollment due to chilling effects.  \n20 \nWhen parents perceive enrollment in public programs to place their own immigration status at \n21 \nrisk, they are less likely to enroll their children in those programs as well, even if their children \n22 \nare U.S. citizens.  For this reason, even though Defendants excluded CHIP from the list of \n23 \nprograms considered in a public charge determination, enrollment in CHIP is threatened by the \n24 \nRule. \n25 \n2.  Harm to State Programs’ Reliance Interests \n26 \n173.  Plaintiffs’ efforts to ensure broad-based access to health and nutrition programs \n27 \nhave engendered significant reliance interests that will be harmed by the Rule.  \n28 \n \n  34   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 36 of 63\n \n1  174.  Plaintiffs have made deep investments in human services and public healthcare \n2  infrastructure, and encouraged broad-based participation in healthcare and nutrition programs. \n3  175.  Plaintiffs have succeeded in reducing rates of individuals without health insurance \n4  to historic lows.  In California, for example, 96 percent of children currently have private or \n5  public health insurance.  In Pennsylvania, 94.5% of residents and 95.6% of children have health \n6  insurance.  In Oregon, 97.1% of children are insured. \n7  176.  As part of these efforts, Plaintiffs have developed complex systems to implement \n8  public benefit programs in a timely, efficient, and accurate manner.  They have designed \n9  streamlined processes for benefits applications, eligibility determinations, and benefits \n10  distribution, as well as communications with applicants, beneficiaries, and the general public.   \n11  177.  California has heavily invested time and monetary resources in outreach and \n12  enrollment in public benefit programs.  For example, as part of its implementation of the ACA, \n13  CalHEERS, a central automation system jointly administered by Covered California (the state’s \n14  health insurance Exchange) and the Department of Health Care Services, that consolidates state \n15  eligibility enrollment and retention for both Covered California and Medi-Cal.  CalHEERS is \n16  designed to integrate federal and state-funded health programs and to provide beneficiaries with \n17  timely and clear eligibility notices regarding coverage.     \n18  178.  Also in connection with the ACA, California established a single, accessible \n19  statewide application for all affordable health programs.  This application is used by all California \n20  entities authorized to make eligibility determinations, and all California residents are encouraged \n21  to apply.   \n22  179.  In designing CalHEERS and the single statewide application, California \n23  substantially relied upon longstanding federal agency guidance that limited benefits relevant to \n24  public charge determinations to a discrete, easily understood list that included only direct cash \n25  assistance programs and institutionalization at government expense. \n26  180.  Similarly, the District of Columbia has implemented a “no wrong door” \n27  environment for District residents seeking help with insurance coverage and costs.  The District’s \n28  Health Benefits Exchange Authority (HBX) created and operates DC Health Link, where District \n \n  35   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 37 of 63\n \n1  residents and employees, including qualified immigrants, can apply for Medicaid and purchase \n2  private health insurance.   \n3  181.  DC Health Link also provides information and links to more information about the \n4  District-funded programs that are available to immigrants who do not qualify for Medicaid and \n5  those who are not eligible to the use the Health Benefits Exchange.  The District provides a \n6  Combined Application for the Alliance Program and the ICP, which is also used to apply for \n7  other public benefits, including SNAP. \n8  182.  In Pennsylvania, COMPASS is central online tool for Pennsylvanians to apply for \n9  many health and human service programs and manage benefit information.  Pennsylvania \n10  implemented COMPASS with the approval of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n11  Services as part of Pennsylvania’s implementation of the ACA.  COMPASS serves as a single \n12  access point for Medical Assistance, SNAP, free or reduced price school meals, subsidized \n13  childcare, and cash assistance.  COMPASS allows Pennsylvania residents to see if they or their \n14  household members qualify for benefits, apply for and renew benefits, save and submit \n15  applications, check the status of applications, submit documents electronically, view their case \n16  benefit information, report changes to their cases, receive notices electronically, and manage \n17  other aspects of their cases online. \n18  183.  Pennsylvania has also created a single paper application for Medical Assistance and \n19  SNAP, among others.  \n20  184.  In connection with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Maine \n21  modified its automated eligibility system, ACES, that consolidates state eligibility enrollment and \n22  retention for the federal health insurance exchange and MaineCare.  Also in connection with the \n23  ACA, Maine has established a single, accessible statewide application for all affordable health \n24  programs. \n25  185.  If immigrants and their family members become confused or fearful about the \n26  possibility of a public charge determination, and decide to stop using statewide application and \n27  enrollment systems, then those systems will not operate as effectively as they do now.  The \n28  State’s ability to provide broad-based access will be compromised.   \n \n  36   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 38 of 63\n \n1  186.  Another policy that will be undermined by the Rule is Plaintiffs’ election of the \n2  option provided under federal law for twelve-month continuous certification periods for \n3  Medicaid.   \n4  187.  The Rule puts a strict twelve-month limit on overall time spent receiving public \n5  benefits for public charge purposes, regardless of whether services are used during that period of \n6  time.  In doing so, the Rule incentivizes “churn,” the phenomenon of otherwise eligible \n7  immigrants dropping in and out of Medicaid enrollment based on their perceived or actual \n8  medical needs, in order to reduce risks to their immigration status.   \n9  188.  Churn creates undesirable gaps in coverage that can disrupt the continuity of \n10  healthcare services, leading to worse patient outcomes and higher administrative costs.  The Rule \n11  thus undermines the efficacy of twelve-month continuous enrollment periods.   \n12  189.  In these and other healthcare and nutrition policy choices, Plaintiffs’ legislatures \n13  and/or state agencies relied upon federal immigration authorities’ long-standing guidance on \n14  immigrant inadmissibility in order to encourage immigrants’ participation in congressionally \n15  authorized benefit programs for which they are eligible.   \n16  3.  Additional Administrative Burdens Caused by the Rule  \n17  190.  Implementation of the Rule will cause additional administrative and fiscal burdens \n18  for Plaintiffs.   \n19  191.  State agencies will need to divert outreach and education funds in order to explain \n20  the Rule to affected communities.   \n21  192.  Plaintiffs already engage in extensive outreach efforts to inform and educate the \n22  public about availability of healthcare and nutrition programs.  For example, since the ACA’s \n23  initial open enrollment in 2013, Covered California has spent approximately $91,575,000 on \n24  targeted marketing campaigns designed to educate communities with high populations of eligible \n25  immigrants about the benefits of enrolling in health insurance coverage, including Spanish-\n26  speaking and Asian communities.  The State’s FFY 2019-2021 CalFresh outreach plan has an \n27  annual budget of over $44 million for each of those three years, and funds 145 contractors and \n28  subcontractors and works with local government agencies, local schools, community-based \n \n  37   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 39 of 63\n \n1  organizations, the California State University system, and many others to encourage CalFresh \n2  enrollment.  \n3  193.  The Oregon Department of Human Services (“ODHS”) provides refugee assistance \n4  services, coordinating with Refugee Resettlement Agencies to provide assistance for refugee \n5  families in applying for social services, medical benefits, vocational training, employments \n6  supports and language training. \n7  194.  Pennsylvania has allocated almost $500,000 for SNAP outreach. \n8  195.  Portions of these budgets will have to be diverted in order to evaluate the Rule’s \n9  impact, train employees and volunteers, and develop new outreach materials and applications.  \n10  196.  Plaintiffs’ outreach programs specifically includes outreach to immigrant or non-\n11  English-speaking communities.  State agencies have developed outreach materials and training \n12  guidelines that make clear that nutrition benefits have not been considered part of a public charge \n13  determination. \n14  197.  The Rule will necessitate the diversion of resources toward revising materials that \n15  provide technical support and advice to community members and stakeholders confused by the \n16  Rule.   \n17  B.  The Rule Will Harm Health and Well-Being of Plaintiffs’ Residents \n18  198. The Public Charge Rule will cause harm to the intended beneficiaries of public \n19  benefit programs, leading to deterioration of public health and well-being.  These irreparable \n20  harms are abundantly demonstrated throughout the administrative record.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs \n21  will bear costs associated with many of these harms.   \n22  1.  Impact on Health \n23  199.  Healthcare coverage makes a real difference to its recipients.  Medicaid coverage \n24  has proven positive impacts on health; improves access to prescriptions; reduces financial \n25  hardship; helps women plan their pregnancies; and reduces preventable mortality.   \n26  200.  In addition to benefits to the individual, healthcare services help Plaintiffs prevent \n27  the spread of communicable diseases; prevent, prepare for and respond to public health threats \n28  and emergencies; and achieve numerous other health-related goals.  Conversely, reductions in \n \n  38   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 40 of 63\n \n1  utilization of publicly-funded healthcare services due to immigrants’ decisions to avoid or \n2  minimize potential risks to their immigration status will have a direct, long-term negative effect \n3  on Plaintiffs’ ability to protect the public health.   \n4  201.  For instance, California’s Department of Public Health works to promote healthy \n5  communities by providing for the control and prevention of infectious diseases like the Zika \n6  virus, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis, and the \n7  prevention of unintended pregnancies.  California invests about $7 million annually so that local \n8  health departments can administer half a million doses of influenza vaccine that protect \n9  vulnerable populations, such as pregnant woman, children under five, adults over 65, and people \n10  with chronic conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications.   \n11  202.  The District of Columbia’s Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program provides \n12  qualifying health care practices with free vaccines for persons under the age of 19 who are \n13  eligible for Medicaid, uninsured, or underinsured.  It is a federally-funded program that provides \n14  vaccines free of charge to enrolled providers that serve eligible patients.  VFC helps ensure that \n15  all children have a better chance of getting their recommended vaccinations on schedule. \n16  203.  The Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) works to promote healthy \n17  lifestyles, prevent injury and disease, and to assure the safe delivery of quality health care for all \n18  Commonwealth residents. PADOH programs facilitate, among many other things: breast and \n19  cervical cancer screenings; immunizations to children who cannot easily afford childhood \n20  immunizations; HIV treatment and care; prescription drug monitoring; research, education, \n21  prevention, and intervention activities regarding cancer, tobacco use, and lead hazards; and \n22  operational support for public health emergencies and emerging diseases such as measles, Ebola, \n23  influenza, Lyme disease, Zika, sexually transmitted diseases, and Hepatitis A, B, and C.  \n24  204.  The Maine Center for Disease Control offers free vaccines to individuals who are \n25  uninsured or underinsured, including noncitizens.     \n26  205.  Public health efforts are most effective when they encompass the States’ entire \n27  population, including immigrants.  Protection of population health depends on broad-based access \n28  to healthcare services.   \n \n  39   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 41 of 63\n \n1  206.  The Rule’s restrictions on receipt of federally funded Medicaid and its chilling \n2  effects on all public healthcare benefits will make it harder for state agencies to reach populations \n3  in need.       \n4  207.  Defendants acknowledge that the Rule does not assure access to vaccinations to an \n5  extent that mirrors the PRWORA-defined exceptions for immunizations and testing and treatment \n6  of communicable diseases.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,384 (“[T]his final rule does not consider receipt of \n7  Medicaid by a child under age 21, or during a person’s pregnancy . . . This should address a \n8  substantial portion, though not all of the vaccination issue.”).  Under the Rule, if a person “enrolls \n9  in Medicaid for the purpose of obtaining vaccines, the Medicaid itself qualifies as a public \n10  benefit.”  Defendants are aware of the concerns that the Rule will increase the prevalence of \n11  disease and put at risk the health of vulnerable populations, even those not directly subject to the \n12  rule, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,311, but instead of quantifying these costs, DHS simply opines that such \n13  actions would be “unwarranted choices.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,313. \n14  208.  Rates of vaccinations and other preventive public health services make a difference \n15  not just to those who are unvaccinated, but to the overall health of the community at large.  \n16  Community immunity, also known as “herd immunity,” is achieved only when a sufficient \n17  proportion of a population is immune to an infectious disease, making the disease’s spread from \n18  person to person unlikely.  Community immunity helps protect individuals who cannot be \n19  vaccinated due to compromised immune systems, such as newborns and persons with chronic \n20  illnesses.    \n21  209.  The Rule will severely undermine access to all public healthcare services—from \n22  preventative screenings for sexually transmitted diseases to childhood immunizations—and in \n23  doing so place the entire community’s health at risk.   \n24  2.  Impact on Hunger \n25  210.   The Rule’s chilling of eligible immigrants from seeking both federally and state-\n26  funded nutrition assistance will thwart Plaintiffs’ programs addressing hunger and food \n27  insecurity. \n28 \n \n  40   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 42 of 63\n \n1  211.   Annually, between 2009 and 2012, SNAP kept an average of 806,000 people out of \n2  poverty in California, including 417,000 children.  In Pennsylvania, SNAP currently provides \n3  essential food assistance to more than 1.75 million Pennsylvanians, including almost 80,000 \n4  immigrants. \n5  212.   Reduced access to SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, which is associated with \n6  numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as depression, fatigue, poor self-efficacy, \n7  and behavioral problems.  Low-income children who go without nutritious food will struggle to \n8  learn in classrooms, impacting their educational advancement and that of their peers. \n9  213.   Conversely, food security translates to better health outcomes and lower public \n10  healthcare expenditures.  Low-income adults participating in SNAP incur about $1,400 less in \n11  medical care costs in a year than low-income non-participants.  When immigrants forego SNAP, \n12  these benefits will be lost.   \n13  214.   The Census Bureau also uses receipt of SNAP benefits to calculate the Supplemental \n14  Poverty Measure, which “serve[s] as an additional indicator of economic well-being and will \n15  provide a deeper understanding of economic conditions and policy effects.”  Disenrollment from \n16  SNAP will undermine the accuracy of this measure and therefore misrepresent national and \n17  statewide economic conditions.  \n18  215.   In addition to harming individual SNAP recipients, the Rule will have a broader \n19  negative impact on the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program \n20  (collectively “school meals” programs), despite the fact that those benefits are not included in the \n21  Rule’s new public charge determination.   \n22  216.   School meals programs help to fight hunger and obesity by assisting schools in \n23  providing healthy meals to children.   \n24  217.   Although the Rule exempts these programs from its definition of “public benefits,” \n25  the Rule will still indirectly undermine school meals programs and their goal of ensuring \n26  adequate nutrition for America’s schoolchildren because the school meal programs’ automatic \n27  enrollment process is linked to participation in SNAP and Medicaid.  DHS notes the importance \n28  of these processes to school meals, but merely states, without explanation, that the Rule “will not \n \n  41   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 43 of 63\n \n1  stop the child from accessing these programs through existing enrollment process other than \n2  direct certification.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,374. \n3  218.   California currently certifies over 730,000 children for free meals and over 310,000 \n4  children for reduced price meals due to their households’ participation in Medicaid, as well as \n5  almost 1.6 million children for free meals due to their households’ participation in SNAP.   \n6  219. Oregon automatically certifies approximately 47% of its children for free and reduced \n7  lunches, many due to the households’ participation in Medicaid or SNAP. \n8  220.   In the 2017-2018 school year, Pennsylvania served more than 167 million school \n9  lunches, enabling children from low-income households to focus on learning, not hunger.  \n10  Pennsylvania families that qualify for Medical Assistance, SNAP, or TANF are automatically \n11  eligible for free school lunches.  Pennsylvania is one of only a few states that provide direct \n12  certification based on Medical Assistance. \n13  221.   In Maine, for the 2018 year, SNAP helped to keep on average 167,000 people out of \n14  poverty in Maine, including 60,000 children. \n15  222.   Maine currently certifies approximately 60,000 children for free meals due to their \n16  household’s participation in SNAP. \n17  223.   Without these automatic certifications, many eligible children in Plaintiffs’ \n18  jurisdictions will go without free or reduced-price school meals.   \n19  224.   The community eligibility provision of the school meals program allows all students \n20  in eligible communities to obtain free school meals without a showing of individual eligibility.  \n21  For example, where at least 40 percent of students in a particular school are directly certified for \n22  free meals through programs like SNAP, all students receive free school lunch. If the percentage \n23  of eligible students dips below that mark, however, the school can no longer offer free schools \n24  meals to all.    \n25  225.   Thus, the Rule will cause some students in lower-income areas who are not \n26  themselves eligible for nutritional assistance based on higher household income—but may \n27  nevertheless be struggling with hunger—to lose access to healthy meals provided by their local \n28  school to all children.  \n \n  42   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 44 of 63\n \n1  3.  Impact on Housing \n2  226.  Loss of housing assistance will also seriously harm affected families.   \n3  227.  Housing vouchers have been repeatedly shown to improve children’s educational \n4  and health outcomes, and to help pull their families out of poverty.  \n5  228.  Children whose families were able to move to higher opportunity neighborhoods \n6  due to their receipt of housing assistance experienced long-term improvements in their income \n7  and educational attainment.  Children in these families also experienced reduced homelessness, \n8  housing instability, and overcrowding. \n9  229.  A study conducted by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department \n10  (HUD) showed that youth who live in public housing improved their self-sufficiency long term. \n11  230.  In contrast, if immigrant children become homeless, this will cause significant \n12  negative impacts.  Young children who experience homelessness for more than six months are \n13  significantly more likely to have developmental delays, fair or poor health, and be hospitalized, \n14  than children who never experienced homelessness or did so for less than six months.   \n15  231.  In addition, many housing authorities provide a suite of “wraparound” services to \n16  public housing residents, including employment, clinical, health, and financial literacy services.  \n17  In San Francisco, for example, an innovative program aimed at families involved with the child \n18  welfare system and at risk of homelessness offers housing vouchers along with intensive case \n19  management services, including mental and behavioral healthcare, parenting classes, and peer \n20  support.  \n21  232.  All of these will be lost to eligible families who withdraw from public housing \n22  assistance programs or fail to apply due to fear of impact on their immigration status, harming \n23  families and their communities, and undermining program effectiveness. \n24  C.  The Rule Will Cause Economic Harms to States  \n25  1.  Impact on Healthcare Providers and Insurers  \n26  233.   The Public Charge Rule will cause direct economic harm to Plaintiffs in the form of \n27  increased uncompensated costs for hospital care.   \n28 \n \n  43   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 45 of 63\n \n1  234.  Since passage of the ACA, which Congress enacted to increase access to care and \n2  improve healthcare affordability, in part, by increasing the insured proportion of the population, \n3  Plaintiffs have experienced a considerable decrease in the number of uninsured residents.  This is \n4  predominantly attributable to the expansion of eligibility in Medicaid programs and the newfound \n5  availability of health coverage through exchanges.   \n6  235.  Participation of eligible immigrants without fear of negative impacts on their ability \n7  to naturalize is a meaningful part of that improvement.  But now, hundreds of thousands of \n8  immigrants who have purchased health insurance through state exchanges, like Covered \n9  California, or who have taken advantage of Medicaid coverage for which they are eligible, may \n10  be impacted or chilled by the Public Charge Rule.   \n11  236.  Immigrants, on average, use fewer healthcare services than similarly situated native-\n12  born U.S. residents, and their participation in health care systems lowers costs for all participants \n13  in the insurance pool.   \n14  237.  The Public Charge Rule reverses these achievements and undoes the virtuous circle \n15  of more healthcare coverage, improved health outcomes, and lower costs.   \n16  238.  Defendants admit that the proposed regulation could lead to “increased use of \n17  emergency rooms and emergent care as a method of primary health care due to delayed \n18  treatment” and “increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for \n19  by an insurer or patient.”  84 Fed. Reg. 41,384.  However, Defendants fail to acknowledge and \n20  weigh the full ramifications of these harms.   \n21  239.  Higher rates of uninsured residents have a negative financial impact on hospital \n22  systems—which are charged with providing care in emergency situations regardless of insurance \n23  coverage—and therefore adversely impact community access to quality healthcare for all local \n24  residents.   \n25  240.  The Rule will have a particularly harmful effect on hospitals that serve a \n26  disproportionate share of low-income individuals. These facilities already operate on thin \n27  margins.  If public funding drops and uncompensated care rises, these hospitals will be less able \n28  to serve all patients in need.   \n \n  44   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 46 of 63\n \n1  241.  Immigrants who are chilled from accessing publicly funded health insurance \n2  programs for which they are eligible will be more likely to defer primary or preventive \n3  healthcare.  Deferred care leads to more complex medical conditions later on that are more \n4  expensive to treat.   \n5  242.  As the California Hospital Association warned in its opposition to the Rule, \n6  “Increased emergency room use by the uninsured leads to an increased financial burden on \n7  hospitals, which are required to provide care to all patients—regardless of their ability to pay.  \n8  This increase in uncompensated care causes financial strain, particularly for hospitals in \n9  communities with large immigrant populations.” \n10  243.  The Rule will undermine the efficacy of Plaintiffs’ established presumptive \n11  eligibility Medicaid programs designed to maximize the likelihood of coverage for people with \n12  emergency health conditions.  \n13  244.  The Rule will also increase administrative costs and burdens on healthcare \n14  providers, as they will need to devote considerable time and resources to educating their frontline \n15  and clinical staff about the various ways patients might be impacted by the Rule.   \n16  245.  As the primary funder for all their low-income residents’ healthcare services, \n17  Plaintiffs’ publicly funded healthcare programs will ultimately bear the cost of both financial \n18  pressure on safety net providers and the increased public health harms described in Section \n19  V(B)(1) above.   \n20  246.  For example, if those chilled from participating in Medicaid programs experience an \n21  unintended pregnancy as a result of reduced access to contraceptives and other family planning \n22  services, then many of the costs of that unintended pregnancy will be borne by Plaintiffs. \n23  247.  Unintended pregnancy is likely to result in relatively higher health costs, because \n24  shorter inter-pregnancy intervals are more likely to result in premature births, low birth weight \n25  infants, and congenital defects, all of which produce considerable harm to Plaintiffs, in addition to \n26  the worse health outcomes for the child and mother.  The average medical cost to Plaintiffs in the \n27  first year of life of a premature or low birth weight baby is up to 10 times higher than the cost of a \n28  full term baby.   \n \n  45   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 47 of 63\n \n1  248.  Medicaid programs are also likely to bear a portion of the costs associated with any \n2  delays in diagnosis and treatment of serious medical conditions such as cancer, unintended \n3  pregnancy, preventable diseases such as sexually transmitted diseases, and other serious health \n4  problems.   \n5  249.  Overall, the Public Charge Rule’s effect of pushing more people into the ranks of \n6  the uninsured will introduce financial strain on state, local, and private health systems and \n7  programs.   \n8  2.  Impact on Other Safety Net Providers \n9  250.  In addition to healthcare provider impacts, discouraging immigrants from accessing \n10  public benefits for which they are eligible will ultimately transfer costs to state and local \n11  governments and community organizations, as families increasingly rely on emergency services \n12  and public safety net programs, such as local shelters, homeless services, and food pantries.  \n13  251.   Food banks, for example, are already struggling to fill a growing nutrition gap that \n14  has arisen, in part, by immigrants avoiding public food assistance programs due to rumors of the \n15  Rule’s implications.  In Oregon, 552,900 people are facing food insecurity, of those, 194,070 are \n16  children.     \n17  252.   Implementation of the Rule will worsen the burden on food banks that already \n18  provide for 4.6 million Californians (including 1.7 million children) facing food insecurity.  In \n19  Maine, hundreds of food banks and pantries around the state provide food to 14.4 percent of \n20  Maine households, which face food insecurity. \n21  3.  Impact on Consumer Spending \n22  253.  Reduced participation in public benefit programs causes additional economic harm \n23  to the Plaintiffs.   \n24  254.  Decreased participation in SNAP and state nutrition programs has economic \n25  consequences beyond hunger and public health.   \n26  255.  Fewer Californians using CalFresh will harm the 26,599 grocers, farmers’ markets, \n27  and other merchants in California that accept SNAP benefits for food purchases.  SNAP benefits \n28  generate secondary economic effects that increase overall spending and production; the United \n \n  46   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 48 of 63\n \n1  States Department of Agriculture estimates that in a slowing economy, every $1 in SNAP benefits \n2  generates $1.54 in economic activity.  Decisions by immigrant families (an estimated 1.5 million \n3  in California) to forgo critical nutritional benefits will also result in loss of economic activity. \n4  256.   In Alameda County, 41 percent of noncitizens live in families that use at least one \n5  means-tested benefit, and the County estimated in its comment on the Rule that its immigrant \n6  population could miss out on millions of dollars of benefits due to the chilling effect generated by \n7  the Rule.  If half of the county’s households with noncitizens who use relevant benefits—over \n8  8,000—disenrolled from programs for which they are eligible, the direct annual economic impact \n9  would be approximately $39 million. \n10  257.   In Pennsylvania, there are 10,257 retailers that accept SNAP, including grocers and \n11  farmer’s markets.  If 35% of immigrant families disenrolled from SNAP (i.e., more than 17,600 \n12  Pennsylvania families), the direct annual economic impact from lack of food purchase alone \n13  would be nearly $4 million. \n14  4.  Impact on Workforce \n15  258.  Limiting the ability of immigrants to adjust their status, extend, or change the basis \n16  for their legal presence will also harm the economy by reducing important parts of the workforce. \n17  259.  Any diminution of the immigrant labor force and lost productivity will be especially \n18  pronounced in sectors that are critical to the economy.  Sectors that will be impacted include \n19  agriculture, construction, healthcare, childcare and early childhood education, food services, and \n20  janitorial and maintenance services.   \n21  260.  In California, for example, immigrants are a major share of all California workers in \n22  farming, fishing, and forestry (77.1 percent); building and grounds cleaning and maintenance \n23  (61.7 percent); and construction and extraction (43 percent).  Thirty-nine percent of child care and \n24  early education providers in California—81,000 people—are immigrants.  These impacted \n25  occupations and industries are known to pay workers low wages, making them particularly \n26  vulnerable to public charge determinations under the Rule.   \n27  261.  Immigrants make up about 24 percent of the District’s civilian labor force.  The top \n28  job categories for immigrant workers in the District include management, business, science, and \n \n  47   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 49 of 63\n \n1  the arts, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance, construction, and food preparation and \n2  serving.  Immigrant workers also provide office and administrative support, and education, \n3  training, and library services.  As noted above, earnings tend to be slightly more modest for \n4  immigrant workers compared with District workers overall.   \n5  262.  With current immigration trends and birth rates, almost all of the growth in the \n6  nation’s working-age population between now and 2050 will take place among immigrants and \n7  their U.S.-born children.  In Pennsylvania, which has an aging population, a reduction in the \n8  number of immigrants to the U.S. along with declining birth rates could cause serious economic \n9  consequences, as the number of workers needed to support older adults continues to increase. \n10  263.  Maine had over 25,000 immigrant workers in 2015. \n11  264.  Approximately 260,000 workers in Oregon are immigrants, comprising over 12% of \n12  the workforce generally.  The top categories for immigrant workers in Oregon include \n13  manufacturing, accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, retail trade, \n14  and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting. \n15  265.  In an era of tight labor supplies, the Rule threatens to further reduce availability of \n16  workers in these occupational categories and industries.  Workers lost across these sectors cannot \n17  be replaced without significant economic disruption.   \n18  266.  The Rule creates particularly steep barriers for immigrant students in public colleges \n19  and universities.  These students, many of whom live for a period of time on sparse incomes and \n20  thus are particularly susceptible to a public charge determination under the Rule, are critical \n21  components of the emergent workforce.   \n22  267.  The Rule’s new public charge condition will make it more difficult for \n23  nonimmigrant visa holders such as graduate students and specialized workers to extend or change \n24  their statuses.  These valued members of our schools, workplaces, and communities may be \n25  excluded or discouraged from seeking extended or changed statuses due to the Rule.  \n26  268.  Graduating students’ understandably low incomes are no indicator of their future \n27  earnings.  Working students are frequently poor, but by no means unproductive.  Yet students \n28  who seek to become legal permanent residents, or extend or otherwise adjust their status, face the \n \n  48   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 50 of 63\n \n1  Rule’s punitive public charge test.  As a result, Plaintiffs are likely to be deprived of the benefits \n2  of this skilled nascent workforce.   \n3  D.  The Rule Will Harm the Integrity of Immigrant Families and Plaintiffs’ \nCommunities   \n4 \n269.   The Rule will undermine the integrity, stability, and financial health of working \n5 \nimmigrant families by discouraging immigration to the United States, including adjustment of \n6 \nstatus for persons already residing in the United States. \n7 \n270.   The Rule’s definition of “household,” combined with its arbitrary income and asset \n8 \nstandards, will pressure extended families to live in separate households and to refrain from \n9 \nsupporting each other financially.  See 8 C.F.R. § 212.21(d), 84 Fed. Reg. 41,501 (including in \n10 \n“household” any individuals to whom the immigrant provides at least 50 percent of the \n11 \nindividual’s financial support). \n12 \n271.   This perverse incentive created by the Rule will discourage noncitizen members of \n13 \nmixed immigration-status families from living with and providing support to U.S.-citizen family \n14 \nmembers in order to avoid adverse immigration consequences. \n15 \n272.   In addition, the Rule will prevent permanent unification of grandparents, parents, \n16 \nand siblings who have been living in the United States patiently waiting for available visas \n17 \nthrough family-based immigration petitions. \n18 \n273.  Thousands of immigrant families have taken significant measures to come out of the \n19 \nshadows.  In the last three years, California has been the state with the highest number of \n20 \nindividuals obtaining lawful permanent resident status.  The Rule will reverse this trend, to the \n21 \ndetriment of Plaintiffs and their residents. \n22 \n274.  For many applicants, denial of the requested adjustment, extension, or change of \n23 \nstatus under the Rule would leave them without permission to remain in the United States.  In \n24 \nfact, under a recent DHS policy memorandum, those who are denied adjustment of status could \n25 \nbe placed in removal proceedings if they do not have a valid status, heightening the risk of \n26 \ndeportation after the application.  The Rule will thus lead to immigrants either declining to apply \n27 \n28 \n \n  49   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 51 of 63\n \n1  for lawful status out of fear—forcing them into unauthorized status, relegated to the margins of \n2  society—or risking deportation.   \n3  275.  For example, a DACA recipient who is a student and has a U.S. citizen child may be \n4  afraid to seek a visa through marriage with a U.S. citizen spouse if their household income could \n5  put them at risk of an adverse public charge determination, or if they have disabilities that may \n6  make them likely to receive Medicaid. \n7  276.  Similar fears could also prevent vulnerable populations that are exempted from \n8  public charge considerations, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders or Violence \n9  Against Women Act (VAWA) petitioners, from adjusting their status through family-based \n10  petitions.   \n11  277.  The Rule will also subject individuals with ongoing lawful nonimmigrant status \n12  (such as long-term, multiple-entry visas like student visas) to the more expansive public charge \n13  inadmissibility standards every time they return to the United States.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,507; 8 \n14  C.F.R. §214.1(a)(3)(iv). \n15  278.  If DHS (acting through CBP) determines that, after a visit outside of the United \n16  States longer than six months, a green card holder is seeking admission they could be subject to \n17  the expanded public charge inadmissibility ground.  This individual may have been receiving \n18  benefits for which they have long been eligible, and yet still be subject in the expanded \n19  inadmissibility ground.  84 Fed. Reg. 41,326. \n20  279.  This will discourage immigrant communities from remaining in contact with their \n21  families abroad, leading to unnecessary separation of family members during times of joy and \n22  hardship, such as a period of serious illness.   \n23  280.  By subjecting derivative family members of visa holders, such as the spouses and \n24  children of those on employment-based visas, to the public charge condition when they request to \n25  extend or change their status, the Rule could result family separations and denials.     \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  50   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 52 of 63\n \n1  VI.  THE RULE IS MOTIVATED BY RACIAL AND ETHNIC ANIMUS TOWARD NON-WHITE, NON-\nEUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS  \n2 \n281.    Defendants ignored thousands of comments describing the harm the Rule would \n3 \ncause.  They also ignored thousands of comments submitted in the public record opposing the \n4 \nRule on the ground that it would disproportionately impact immigrants of color, especially Latino \n5 \nand Black immigrants.  These commenters highlighted the fact that the public charge \n6 \ndetermination is being hijacked by Defendants and converted into a vehicle for discrimination.  \n7 \nSee 84 Fed. Reg. 41,401. \n8 \n282.    The federal government’s decision to adopt the Public Charge Rule is motivated by \n9 \nimproper discriminatory intent and animus toward non-White, non-European immigrants, who \n10 \naccount for the vast majority of people who will be adversely affected by the Rule.  The Rule \n11 \nviolates the Equal Protection Clause, pursuant to Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing \n12 \nDevelopment Corporation, 429 U.S. 252 (1977).    \n13 \n283.   As described in Section II(B) above, the Rule disproportionately impacts non-White, \n14 \nnon-European immigrants because they are substantially more likely than their White, European \n15 \ncounterparts to be treated disfavorably under the Rule.   \n16 \n284.   Numerous statements and actions by President Trump and high-ranking officials in \n17 \nhis administration reflect a pattern of bias against Mexicans, Latinos, Africans, Haitians, and \n18 \nother non-White, non-European immigrants. \n19 \n285.   Prior to his election, and during his campaign, President Trump voiced his disdain \n20 \nfor non-White, non-European immigrants, and in particular, Mexicans.  For example, on June 16, \n21 \n2015, during his speech launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump characterized \n22 \nimmigrants from Mexico as criminals, “rapists,” and “people that have lots of problems.”  In June \n23 \n2018, President Trump asserted that these remarks were “100 percent right.” \n24 \n286.   On September 25, 2015, then-candidate Trump suggested that the United States \n25 \nwould “no longer take care” of “anchor babies” from Mexico. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n  51   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 53 of 63\n \n1  287.   In October 2016, during a presidential debate, then-candidate Trump responded to a \n2  question about immigration by stating:  “We have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get \n3  them out.” \n4  288.   This pattern of racist animosity continued into his presidency.  President Trump \n5  repeated incendiary language at rallies and in social media conflating the issue of immigration \n6  with criminality, and raising the specter of invasion at the Southern border by individuals from \n7  Mexico and Central America.   \n8  289.   Against this backdrop of vitriol towards immigrants, in August 2017, President \n9  Trump endorsed the RAISE Act, introduced by Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue.  The \n10  RAISE Act proposed substantial cuts to family-based immigration, which comprises \n11  approximately two-thirds of the annual total number of green cards.  The bill sought to eliminate \n12  several categories of relatives eligible for family-sponsored immigration, and lower the caps for \n13  other categories of family-sponsors from 226,000 green cards to 88,000.  The bill’s design \n14  resulted in the deepest prospective cuts to immigration from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, \n15  the Philippines, China, India, and Vietnam.    \n16  290.   The bill faced bipartisan resistance, and gained only one additional co-sponsor, \n17  Senator Wicker of Mississippi, in November 2017.   \n18  291.   Frustrated with the lack of progress on this legislation, in early January 2018, at a \n19  Camp David meeting with congressional leaders, the President demanded the end to so-called \n20  “chain migration,” his preferred term for describing family-based immigration.   \n21  292.   Days later, on January 11, 2018, during a White House meeting with several U.S. \n22  Senators, the President is widely reported to have disparaged a draft immigration plan that \n23  protected people from El Salvador, Haiti, and some African countries, asking, “Why are we \n24  having all these people from shithole countries come here?”  In this meeting, the President is also \n25  widely reported to have expressed his preference for more immigrants from places like Norway, \n26  where the population is over 90 percent white.  Senator Dick Durbin, who attended the White \n27  House meeting, confirmed that Trump used “vile, vulgar” language, including repeatedly using \n28  the word “shithole” when speaking about African countries. \n \n  52   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 54 of 63\n \n1  293.   In February 2018, President Trump gave a speech at the annual Conservative \n2  Political Action Conference where he used MS-13 – a gang with many members having ties to \n3  Mexico and Central America – to disparage immigrants, indicating that all immigrants from \n4  Mexico and Central America are criminals and comparing them to snakes.  \n5  294.   In May 2018, President Trump again lashed out at immigrants, branding them as \n6  “animals” during a public White House meeting in which he aired his frustrations related to \n7  immigration.   \n8  295.   In addition to this pattern of conduct, procedural irregularities in the rulemaking \n9  process underscore the animus that has driven the Rule’s adoption.  The manipulation of agency \n10  leadership in 2019 that was required to institute it.  This included the ouster of key DHS officials, \n11  and the selection of their replacements without Senate approval.   \n12  296.   In April 2019, after then-Secretary Kristjen Nielson announced her departure, \n13  President Trump promptly tweeted that then-U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner \n14  Kevin McAleenan would take over DHS on an acting basis.  Representative Bennie Thompson \n15  implored the President to follow the law of succession, specifically 6 U.S.C. § 113, under which \n16  Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady would be statutorily required to serve as Acting Secretary.  \n17  Within a day, Grady, a career civil servant, offered her resignation, clearing the pathway for \n18  Defendant Acting Secretary McAleenan.    \n19  297.   On May 24, 2019, L. Francis Cissna, USCIS Director announced in an email to his \n20  staff that, at the request of the President, he was stepping down.  After it became clear that Senate \n21  Republicans intended to reject Trump’s preferred replacement, Ken Cuccinelli, the \n22  Administration circumvented the Senate.  On June 10, 2019, Defendant Acting Secretary \n23  McAleenan created a brand new position, Principal Deputy Director of USCIS, and installed Mr. \n24  Cuccinelli in that role.  This decision effectively demoted Mark Koumans, who was already \n25  serving as Acting Director, and replaced him with Mr. Cuccinelli.       \n26  298.   These maneuvers deviated from the customary practices of Presidents with regard to \n27  the appointment of acting officials, and are contrary to the typical requirements for Senate \n28  approval.     \n \n  53   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 55 of 63\n \n1  299.   Furthermore, President Trump installed an acting USCIS Director with a record of \n2  animus and disregard towards immigrants consistent with his own views.  In his prior role as a \n3  state legislator, Mr. Cuccinelli advocated for extreme restrictions on immigration, including \n4  limitations on birth right citizenship.  Mr. Cuccinelli later likened immigration policy to animal \n5  control measures, complaining that Washington D.C.’s animal control policies were worse than \n6  U.S. immigration policies because, “You can’t break up rat families.”      \n7  300.   This leadership turnover served to fast-track a pre-ordained Rule sought by the \n8  President, regardless of its lawfulness.  This manipulation of agency leadership has occurred \n9  alongside undue White House meddling in the rulemaking process.   \n10  301.   The process has been driven by White House political calculations and a strategy \n11  focused on inflaming racial animosities within the electorate and reducing the political influence \n12  of historically underrepresented minorities, rather than adhering to established law and sound \n13  rulemaking.  \n14  302.   According to emails from senior federal officials obtained via the Freedom of \n15  Information Act, the Public Charge Rule originated directly from the White House.  Trump \n16  administration senior advisor Stephen Miller reportedly maintained a “singular obsession” with \n17  the Rule.  According to these emails, Mr. Miller urged DHS to rush to release the rule, \n18  complaining that the agency’s deliberative process timeline was “unacceptable,” and stating, “I \n19  don’t care what you need to do to finish it on time.”  \n20  303.   The end result is a flawed Rule that radically upends the longstanding definition of \n21  public charge and weaponizes it against non-wealthy minorities of color.   \n22  304.   The Rule resulting from this improper process violates the Equal Protection Clause \n23  under United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528 (1973). \n24  305.   The Administration has identified a politically unpopular minority, namely non-\n25  White, Non-European immigrants, and has instituted a Public Charge Rule that punishes this class \n26  of individuals without advancing its stated purposes—i.e., ensuring that immigrants are \n27  productive and capable of self-sufficiency and minimizing incentives for immigrating to the \n28  United States because of the availability of public benefits.  As discussed earlier, the Rule will \n \n  54   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 56 of 63\n \n1  impact a substantial number of immigrants who are capable of working and contributing \n2  meaningfully to the economy; indeed, in many cases, the impacted individuals already have been \n3  productive participants in the Plaintiffs’ economies and communities.  Furthermore, the Rule’s \n4  chilling effect will harm a larger class of predominantly non-White, non-European immigrants \n5  who work in critical sectors and—like many low- and moderate-income U.S.-born citizens—rely \n6  on non-cash public benefits programs designed to safeguard the health and well-being of the \n7  general population.    \n8  306.   Various factors in the Rule do not rationally operate to further the purpose of the \n9  INA’s public charge test.  In combination with evidence of improper manipulation of agency \n10  processes, this suggests that the Rule’s rationale is pretextual.  See Dep’t. of Commerce v. New \n11  York, 139 S.Ct. 2551 (2019).    \n12  307.   For example, the bright-line income thresholds do not meaningfully identify \n13  individuals who are productive and capable of self-sufficiency.  This is particularly true given the \n14  evidence of immigrants’ upward mobility, and how the Rule would impact immigrant students in \n15  colleges and universities.   \n16  308.   Additionally, the manner in which the Rule treats public benefits is not reasonably \n17  connected with the purpose of the public charge test.  The Rule penalizes the mere application for \n18  benefits.  The Rule also penalizes receipt of public benefits even if they represent a small \n19  percentage of a worker’s income or were needed for a material reason, such as to facilitate the \n20  treatment of an acute medical condition or following a loss of a job until starting a new one.   \n21  309.   For these reasons, the Rule does not rationally advance the purpose of the public \n22  charge test, as enacted by Congress.   \n23  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(VIOLATION OF APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706—CONTRARY TO LAW, INA AND IIRIRA) \n24 \n310.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n25 \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n26 \n311.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is “not \n27 \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n28 \n \n  55   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 57 of 63\n \n1  312.  The Rule’s broad and novel interpretation of the term “public charge” is contrary to \n2  the meaning of the statutory term, and will exclude immigrants on public charge grounds in a \n3  manner that is inconsistent with the public charge statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4), and 8 U.S.C. \n4  § 1183a. \n5  313.  By heavily weighting factors such as an immigrant’s likelihood of receiving public \n6  benefits and imposing strict income thresholds, Defendants exceeded their statutory authority \n7  under the IIRIRA, making some factors effectively determinative in isolation, contrary to the \n8  IIRIRA’s clear requirement that multiple factors be considered. \n9  314.  By changing the weight traditionally given to legally enforceable affidavits of \n10  support filed by qualifying sponsors on behalf of intending immigrants, as required under the \n11  IIRIRA, Defendants have improperly reduced the significance of what Congress deemed \n12  substantial assurances that avert a finding of inadmissibility.  \n13  315.  Applying a public charge condition, which is essentially a public charge \n14  determination, to non-immigrant visa holders who are seeking to change or extend their visas is \n15  not grounded in any statutory authority.  \n16  316.  By promulgating this Rule, Defendants have acted contrary to the INA and the \n17  IIRIRA.  In doing so, Defendants have taken action in violation of the APA.  The Rule is \n18  therefore invalid.   \n19  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(VIOLATION OF APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706—CONTRARY TO LAW, SECTION 504 OF THE \n20  REHABILITATION ACT) \n21  317.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n22  the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n23  318.  The Public Charge Rule conflicts with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n24  1973, which prohibits “any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance” or any \n25  “program or activity conducted by any Executive agency,” from excluding, denying benefits to, \n26  or discriminating against persons with disabilities.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  This includes programs and \n27  activities conducted by DHS or receiving Federal financial assistance from DHS.  6 C.F.R. \n28  § 15.30. \n \n  56   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 58 of 63\n \n1  319.  In relevant part, Section 504 requires DHS to refrain from disability discrimination, \n2  ensure program access, provide applicants with reasonable accommodations, and refrain from \n3  utilizing discriminatory criteria or methods of administration in its programs and activities or in \n4  any contractual licensing, or other arrangement.  6 C.F.R. §§ 15.30(b), 15.49. \n5  320.  The Public Charge Rule’s new criteria will discriminatorily screen out applicants on \n6  the basis of disability and deny them an equal opportunity to participate in admission and \n7  naturalization processes.   \n8  321.  By promulgating this new Rule, Defendants have acted contrary to the Section 504 \n9  of the Rehabilitation Act, and in doing so, violate the APA.  The Rule is therefore invalid.   \n10  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n(VIOLATION OF APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706—CONTRARY TO LAW, STATE HEALTHCARE \n11  DISCRETION) \n12  322.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n13  the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n14  323.  Congress has given states the option to cover, with regular federal matching dollars, \n15  lawfully residing children and pregnant women under Medicaid and CHIP during their first five \n16  years in the U.S.  Section 214 of the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n17  2009 (CHIPRA), Pub. L. No. 111-3, 123 Stat. 8.  \n18  324.  The Public Charge Rule will effectively deprive Plaintiffs of their statutory option to \n19  extend program eligibility to this group.   \n20  325.  Congress also specifically authorized Plaintiffs to make their own eligibility \n21  determinations for state public benefits for qualified aliens, nonimmigrants, and aliens paroled \n22  into the United States for less than a year.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1612, 1613, 1621(d), 1622(a); 7 U.S.C. \n23  § 2016(i).   \n24  326.  The Public Charge Rule will effectively deprive Plaintiffs of their statutory option to \n25  provide healthcare and nutrition benefits to these immigrants. \n26  327.  Defendants’ improper attempt to reinterpret the INA disrupts the cooperative \n27  federalism that characterizes the Medicaid program and interferes with Plaintiffs’ authority to \n28  regulate their internal public welfare administration.   \n \n  57   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 59 of 63\n \n1  328.  By promulgating this new Rule, Defendants have acted contrary to federal laws, and \n2  in doing so, violate the APA.  The Rule is therefore invalid. \n3  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nVIOLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n4  (VIOLATION OF APA; 5 U.S.C. § 706—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS) \n5  329.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n6  the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n7  330.  The APA requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is \n8  “arbitrary,” “capricious,” or an “abuse of discretion.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n9  331.  The Public Charge Rule is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion \n10  because Defendants have relied on factors that Congress did not intend, failed to consider \n11  important aspects of the problem the agency is addressing, and has offered no explanation for the \n12  Rule that is consistent with the evidence that is before the agency.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n \n13  of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n14  332.  Although DHS may change its policies within statutory limits, the agency must \n15  “provide a reasoned explanation for the change.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. \n16  2117, 2125 (2016).  Even if the Rule were consistent with the INA—and it is not—Defendants \n17  fail to provide the necessary “satisfactory explanation” for their proposed changes to the public \n18  charge determination.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \n19  333.  Further, if an agency relies on contradictory factual findings, the justification for the \n20  changed policy must be “more detailed.”  F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, \n21  515 (2009).   The Rule contains numerous contrary factual findings, but lacks sufficient detail in a \n22  number of respects to justify the massive changes in the Rule. \n23  334.  Defendants failed to comply with Executive Orders 12866 and 13563, which require \n24  agencies to “assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is \n25  necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits.”  \n26  335.  Defendants failed to adequately assess, among other things, the actual costs to the \n27  Nation, its States, and communities from increasing the poverty of families and U.S. citizen \n28  children, in violation of the APA.   \n \n  58   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 60 of 63\n \n1  336.  The government departed significantly from its normal procedures in adopting the \n2  Public Charge Rule.  \n3  337.  Because Defendants’ new Rule is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, \n4  the Rule is invalid.   \n5  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nVIOLATION OF FIFTH AMENDMENT \n6  (DUE PROCESS—EQUAL PROTECTION BASED ON RACE) \n7  338.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n8  the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n9  339.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits \n10  the federal government from denying equal protection of the laws.   \n11  340.  The Fifth Amendment also prohibits federal officials from acting with a \n12  discriminatory intent or purpose.   \n13  341.  As set forth above, the Public Charge Rule was motivated by improper \n14  discriminatory intent and bias against non-White immigrants.  Accordingly, judicial deference to \n15  Defendants’ decision to adopt the Rule is not justified. \n16  342.  The government departed significantly from its normal procedures in adopting the \n17  Public Charge Rule.  \n18  343.  The history, procedure, substance, context, and impact of the decision to adopt the \n19  Public Charge Rule all demonstrate that the decision was motivated by discriminatory animus \n20  against non-White immigrants.  Because it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose, the \n21  adoption of the Rule violates the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the \n22  Fifth Amendment. \n23  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nVIOLATION OF FIFTH AMENDMENT \n24  (DUE PROCESS—EQUAL PROTECTION BASED ON UNCONSTITUTIONAL \nANIMUS) \n25 \n344.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \n26 \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n27 \n28 \n \n  59   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 61 of 63\n \n1  345.  The classification here further violates equal protection principles because \n2  defendants adopted it to harm a politically unpopular group and advance unconstitutional animus, \n3  and therefore, it is without a permissible, rational basis.   \n4  346.  The reasons offered by Defendants in the preamble of the Rule are unfounded and \n5  pretextual. \n6  347.  Defendants’ equal protection violation causes ongoing harm to Plaintiffs and their \n7  residents, as discussed above. \n8  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n9  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in its favor, \n10  and grant the following relief: \n11  1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the Rule is contrary to the law; \n12  2.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the Rule exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority; \n13  3.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the Rule is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of \n14  discretion, in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act; \n15  4.  Issue a declaratory judgment that the Rule violates the Equal Protection Clause; \n16  5.  Postpone the effective date of the Rule, pending judicial review, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n17  § 705;  \n18  6.  Hold unlawful and set aside the Rule, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2);   \n19  7.  Permanently enjoin implementation of the Rule; \n20  8.  Award Plaintiffs costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees; \n21  9.  Award such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n22   \n23   \n24   \n25   \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n  60   \nComplaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief   \n \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 1   Filed 08/16/19   Page 62 of 63\n \n1   \n2  Dated:  August 16, 2019  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \n3  KARL A.

Having read the parties’ papers and carefully \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  considered their arguments and the relevant legal authority, and good cause appearing, \nN\n19  the court hereby rules as follows. \n20  BACKGROUND \n21  This case involves a challenge to the implementation of the final rule entitled \n22  “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,” published by DHS on August 14, 2019.  See \n23  Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 84 Fed. Reg. 41,292 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“the \n24  Rule”).  On October 10, 2018, DHS began the rulemaking process to create a new \n25  framework for the public charge assessment by publishing a Notice of Proposed \n26 \n \n1 Kevin McAleenen was originally named in the complaint, but as of November 13, 2019, \n27 \nChad Wolf is the current acting secretary of DHS (see https://www.dhs.gov/person/chad-\nf-wolf).  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), an officer’s successor is \n28 \nautomatically substituted as a party. \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 2 of 43\n \n1  Rulemaking (“NPRM”).  See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. \n2  51,114 (Oct. 10, 2018).  On August 14, 2019, DHS published the Rule in the Federal \n3  Register.  Id. at 41,292.  The Rule was originally set to become effective on October 15, \n4  2019. \n5  Publication of the Rule resulted in several complaints filed in federal district courts \n6  across the nation.  Three such complaints were filed in the Northern District of California \n7  and related before this court.  Dkt. 24.  The present motion involves one of the three \n8  cases:  State of California, et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, et al., Case \n9  No. 19-cv-04975-PJH, wherein the States of California, Maine, and Oregon, the \n10  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia (the “state plaintiffs” or \n11  “plaintiffs”) filed a complaint (“Compl.”) asserting six causes of action:  (1) Violation of the \n  12  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, the Immigration \n a\ntruin\noro 13  and Nationality Act (“INA”) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”); (2) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, \niD tc 15  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the “Rehabilitation \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Act”); (3) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Contrary to Law, State Healthcare Discretion; \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  (4) Violation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706—Arbitrary and Capricious; (5) Violation of the Fifth \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Amendment’s Due Process clause requiring Equal Protection based on race; (6) Violation \nN\n19  of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause, based on a violation of Equal Protection \n20  principles based on unconstitutional animus.  Dkt. 1.   \n21  On October 11, 2019, this court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \n22  defendants from applying the Rule to any person residing in the City and County of San \n23  Francisco, Santa Clara County, the States of California, Oregon, or Maine, the \n24  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or the District of Columbia.  Dkt. 120 at 92.  Defendants \n25  appealed the preliminary injunction on October 30, 2019.  Dkt. 129.  A three-judge panel \n26  of the Ninth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction on December 5, 2019.2  Dkt. 141; \n27 \n \n2 The panel consolidated the three related cases before this court with a similar case \n28 \nfrom the Eastern District of Washington.  That court issued a nationwide injunction of the \n2 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 3 of 43\n \n1  see City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 944 F.3d 773 \n2  (9th Cir. 2019).  On February 18, 2020, the Ninth Circuit panel voted to deny plaintiffs-\n3  appellees’ motions for reconsideration and for rehearing en banc.  Dkt. 153.  Other \n4  district courts also issued preliminary injunctions prohibiting enforcement of the Rule, but \n5  these were ultimately stayed by the Supreme Court.  See Dep’t of Homeland Security v. \n6  New York, 140 S. Ct. 599 (2020); Wolf v. Cook Cty., Illinois, 140 S. Ct. 681 (2020).  \n7  Accordingly, the Rule went into effect on February 24, 2020. \n8  A broader summary of the relevant statutory framework and the changes \n9  implemented by the Rule may be found in the court’s preliminary injunction order.  Dkt. \n10  120 at 6–10.  To briefly summarize here, DHS promulgated the Rule pursuant to its \n11  authority under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., which requires that all noncitizens \n  12  seeking to be lawfully admitted into the United States or to become lawful permanent \n a\ntruin\noro 13  residents prove they are not inadmissible.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 1225(a).  A noncitizen may \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  be deemed inadmissible on any number of grounds, including that they are “likely at any \niD tc 15  time to become a public charge.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  The statute directs \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  immigration officials to form an opinion as to whether the applicant “is likely at any time to \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  become a public charge.”  Id.  In forming that opinion, immigration officers must consider \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  “at a minimum” five statutorily-defined factors: (1) age; (2) health; (3) family status; (4) \nN\n19  assets, resources, and financial status; (5) education and skills.  8 U.S.C. \n20  § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  The Rule would define the term “public charge” and set out various \n21  criteria for government officials as part of their totality of the circumstances determination. \n22  DISCUSSION \n23  A.  Legal Standard \n24  1.  Rule 12(b)(1) \n25  A federal court may dismiss an action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26 \n \n27 \nRule on the same day as this court’s geographically limited preliminary injunction order.  \nWashington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 408 F. Supp. 3d 1191, 1224 (E.D. \n28 \nWash. 2019). \n3 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 4 of 43\n \n1  12(b)(1) for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Rule \n2  12(h)(3) similarly provides that a court “must dismiss the action” if it “determines at any \n3  time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  “Federal courts are \n4  courts of limited jurisdiction” and the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction \n5  “rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n6  511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citations omitted). \n7  A jurisdictional challenge may be facial or factual.  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, \n8  373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004).  When the attack is facial, the court determines \n9  whether the allegations contained in the complaint are sufficient on their face to invoke \n10  federal jurisdiction.  Id.  Where the attack is factual, however, “the court need not \n11  presume the truthfulness of the plaintiff’s allegations.”  Id. \n  12  When resolving a factual dispute about its federal subject matter jurisdiction, a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  court may review extrinsic evidence beyond the complaint without converting a motion to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  dismiss into one for summary judgment.  McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 \niD tc 15  (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that a court “may review any evidence, such as affidavits and \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  testimony, to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction”); see also \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 735 n.4 (1947) (“[W]hen a question of the District Court’s \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  jurisdiction is raised . . . the court may inquire by affidavits or otherwise, into the facts as \nN\n19  they exist.”).  “Once the moving party has converted the motion to dismiss into a factual \n20  motion by presenting affidavits or other evidence properly brought before the court, the \n21  party opposing the motion must furnish affidavits or other evidence necessary to satisfy \n22  its burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at \n23  1039.   \n24  The Ninth Circuit has noted that “jurisdictional dismissals in cases premised on \n25  federal-question jurisdiction are exceptional, and must satisfy the requirements specified \n26  in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 (1946).”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039 (quoting \n27  Sun Valley Gas., Inc. v. Ernst Enters., 711 F.2d 138, 140 (9th Cir. 1983)).  “In Bell, the \n28  Supreme Court determined that jurisdictional dismissals are warranted ‘where the alleged \n4 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 5 of 43\n \n1  claim under the constitution or federal statutes clearly appears to be immaterial and \n2  made solely for the purpose of obtaining federal jurisdiction or where such claim is wholly \n3  insubstantial and frivolous.’”  Id. (quoting Bell, 327 U.S. at 682–83). \n4  2.  Rule 12(b)(6) \n5  A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests for the \n6  legal sufficiency of the claims alleged in the complaint.  Ileto v. Glock Inc., 349 F.3d 1191, \n7  1199–1200 (9th Cir. 2003).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires that \n8  a complaint include a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \n9  entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), a complaint may be dismissed under Rule \n10  12(b)(6) if the plaintiff fails to state a cognizable legal theory, or has not alleged sufficient \n11  facts to support a cognizable legal theory.  Somers v. Apple, Inc., 729 F.3d 953, 959 (9th \n  12  Cir. 2013). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  While the court is to accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint, \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  legally conclusory statements, not supported by actual factual allegations, need not be \niD tc 15  accepted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678–79 (2009).  The complaint must proffer \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  sufficient facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 558–59 (2007).   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nN\n19  the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \n20  alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court \n21  to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it \n22  has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \n23  P. 8(a)(2)).  Where dismissal is warranted, it is generally without prejudice, unless it is \n24  clear the complaint cannot be saved by any amendment.  In re Daou Sys., Inc., 411 F.3d \n25  1006, 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). \n26  Review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, although the court can \n27  also consider documents “whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose \n28  authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the plaintiff’s \n5 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 6 of 43\n \n1  pleading.”  Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting In re Silicon \n2  Graphics Inc. Sec. Litig., 183 F.3d 970, 986 (9th Cir. 1999), superseded by statute on \n3  other grounds as stated in In re Quality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig., 865 F.3d 1130 (9th Cir. \n4  2017)); see also Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[A] court can \n5  consider a document on which the complaint relies if the document is central to the \n6  plaintiff’s claim, and no party questions the authenticity of the document.” (citation \n7  omitted)).  The court may also consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial \n8  notice (Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688–89 (9th Cir. 2001)), and exhibits \n9  attached to the complaint (Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d \n10  1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1989)). \n11  B.  Analysis \n  12  1.  Standing \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases or controversies, U.S. Const. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  art. III, § 2, and may not render advisory opinions as to what the law ought to be or \niD tc 15  affecting a dispute that has not yet arisen.  Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn. v. \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240 (1937).  Article III’s “standing” requirements limit the court’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  subject matter jurisdiction.  Cetacean Cmty. v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2004) \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998)).  The \nN\n19  burden of establishing standing rests on the party asserting the claim.  Renne v. Geary, \n20  501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (citing Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, \n21  546 n.8 (1986)).  “In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must have (1) \n22  suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \n23  defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  \n24  California v. Trump, 963 F.3d 926, 935 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, \n25  504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).  “[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . \n26  allege facts demonstrating’ each element.”  Spokeo Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 \n27  (2016) (second alteration in original) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)). \n28  “At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested, \n6 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 7 of 43\n \n1  and that party bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing with the manner \n2  and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  E. Bay \n3  Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (“E. Bay Sanctuary I”), 932 F.3d 742, 763–64 (9th Cir. \n4  2018) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  They “need only establish a risk \n5  or threat of injury to satisfy the actual injury requirement.”  Id.; see also Dep’t of \n6  Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019) (noting that future injuries to \n7  states “may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial \n8  risk that the harm will occur” (quoting Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, \n9  158 (2014))). \n10  Finally, “[s]tates are ‘entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis.’”  \n11  California, 963 F.3d at 936 (quoting Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007)).  \n  12  “[A] state may sue to assert its ‘quasi-sovereign interests in the health and well-being—\n a\ntruin\noro 13  both physical and economic—of its residents in general.’”  Id. (quoting Alfred L. Snapp & \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982)). \niD tc 15  In the preliminary injunction order, the court found that the harm alleged by the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  states was not too speculative and, for that reason, they had established standing.  Dkt. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  120 at 83.  The court relied on DHS’s own assessments in the Rule and the NPRM that \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  projected a 2.5% disenrollment rate from federal programs, 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463, and \nN\n19  that payments from the federal government to the states would decrease by over $1.5 \n20  billion, 83 Fed. Reg. at 51,267–69.  The court found that plaintiffs had alleged sufficient \n21  facts in their complaint, as well as evidence submitted in support of the motion for \n22  preliminary injunction, to support a harm similar to that assessed by DHS.  Dkt. 120 at 79.  \n23  The court also determined that the Rule would cause individuals to disenroll from or \n24  forego enrolling in Medicaid, the cost of which is split between the federal and state \n25  governments.  Id. at 80 (“As individuals disenroll, the plaintiffs will  no longer be \n26  reimbursed for treating them.  This will have obvious adverse budgetary \n27  consequences.”). \n28  Defendants argue that, with regard to aliens who disenroll from federal health \n7 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 8 of 43\n \n1  benefits, federal health program participants would not distinguish between federal- and \n2  state-funded health and social services and, therefore, utilization of all services would be \n3  reduced.  Mtn. at 5.  Thus, in order for the states to suffer a harm, aliens would need to \n4  disenroll from federal health benefits, then enroll in state health benefits, and the \n5  increased amount of state expenses would need to be greater than the costs incurred but \n6  for the Rule.  Id. at 6.  With regard to a reduction in Medicaid reimbursements, \n7  defendants argue that a reduction in Medicaid funding would be commensurate with a \n8  reduction in the provision of health services.  In other words, utilization of healthcare paid \n9  by Medicaid would decrease, which means the amount paid by plaintiffs would also \n10  decrease. \n11  Defendants’ renewed standing argument does not alter this court’s prior findings.  \n  12  Both DHS’s own analysis and plaintiffs, in their complaint and evidence, demonstrate that \n a\ntruin\noro 13  the Rule will cause individuals to disenroll or forego enrollment from federal health \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  benefits, including Medicaid.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,463.  Defendants contend the \niD tc 15  disenrollment in Medicaid will result in a corresponding decrease in the provision of \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  services and thus no (or speculative) harm.  This proposition flies in the face of DHS’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  own analysis in the Rule and the evidence submitted by plaintiffs.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  In the Rule, DHS received a comment stating that hospitals are compelled to \nN\n19  provide emergency services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay but those \n20  services will go uncompensated if patients are disenrolled from Medicaid.  Id. at 41,384.  \n21  While the Rule provides for an emergency services exemption, the commenter expressed \n22  concern that different states would interpret the exemption differently resulting in \n23  individuals who would be denied admission or avoid treatment.  Id.  In response, DHS \n24  acknowledged that “increased use of emergency rooms and emergent care as a method \n25  of primary healthcare due to delayed treatment is possible and there is a potential for \n26  increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for by an \n27  insurer or patient.”  Id. \n28  Plaintiffs demonstrate that the cost of such uncompensated care will fall on the \n8 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 9 of 43\n \n1  states.  Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges “[i]ncreased emergency room use by the uninsured \n2  leads to an increased financial burden on hospitals, which are required to provide care to \n3  all patients—regardless of their ability to pay.”  Compl. ¶ 242.  In other cases, private \n4  providers will pass along the cost of uncompensated care to public and private payers of \n5  healthcare resulting in increased costs.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n6  519, 593 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part) (“Health-care providers do not absorb these \n7  bad debts.  Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost of uncompensated \n8  care to those who do pay reliably: the government and private insurance companies.”); \n9  see also Decl. of Mari Cantwell, Dkt. 18-2, ¶ 40 (“The cost of uncompensated care would \n10  be shifted to the broader healthcare delivery system resulting in higher costs for the state, \n11  local entities, and private healthcare payers.”); Decl. of Patrick Allen, Dkt. 18-4, ¶ 47 (“If \n  12  the number of uninsured in Oregon were to increase and overall public health declines as \n a\ntruin\noro 13  a result of the Rule, Oregon would incur a negative economic impact due to the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  accompanying increase in uncompensated costs for hospital and emergency room \niD tc 15  services that would follow.  These uncompensated care costs would then be shifted to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  the broader healthcare delivery systems resulting in higher costs for public and private \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  healthcare payers.”).  By indirectly passing the cost of care to the states, the Rule creates \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  and reallocates costs to the states. \nN\n19  In sum, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that a harm will occur—in this instance a \n20  reduction in federal funds and a corresponding increase in state funds to cover costs \n21  associated with healthcare.  As the Ninth Circuit stated in its opinion, “disenrollment from \n22  public benefits means a reduction in federal and state transfer payments, so the States \n23  will realize some savings in expenditures.  Nevertheless, we consider the harms to the \n24  States, even if not readily quantifiable, significant.”3  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 \n25  F.3d at 807 (citation omitted).  Because the court finds that plaintiffs have established \n26 \n \n27 \n3 In their reply brief, defendants concede that the Ninth Circuit’s opinion is controlling on \nthe issue of standing and that the argument was made to preserve it for appeal.  Reply at \n28 \n1 n.1.   \n9 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 10 of 43\n \n1  standing, it does not address their remaining standing arguments.  See Dkt. 120 at 81–83 \n2  (finding increased operational costs to provide a basis for standing). \n3  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to \n4  standing. \n5  2.  Ripeness \n6  “Ripeness is an Article III doctrine designed to ensure that courts adjudicate live \n7  cases or controversies and do not ‘issue advisory opinions [or] declare rights in \n8  hypothetical cases.’  A proper ripeness inquiry contains a constitutional and a prudential \n9  component.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe v. Inyo Cty., 863 F.3d 1144, 1153 (9th Cir. 2017) \n10  (alteration in original) (quoting Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d \n11  1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc)).   \n  12  “For a case to be ripe, it must present issues that are definite and concrete, not \n a\ntruin\noro 13  hypothetical or abstract.  Constitutional ripeness is often treated under the rubric of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  standing because ripeness coincides squarely with standing’s injury in fact prong.”  Id. \niD tc 15  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1138–39 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  (“Sorting out where standing ends and ripeness begins is not an easy task. . . . [I]n \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  ‘measuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  than speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness inquiry merges almost completely with \nN\n19  standing.’” (citation omitted)).  Allegations that a “threat” to a “concrete interest is actual \n20  and imminent” are sufficient to allege “an injury in fact that meets the requirements of \n21  constitutional ripeness.”  Bishop Paiute Tribe, 863 F.3d at 1154.  Therefore, if plaintiffs \n22  satisfy the Article III standing requirements under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n23  addressed above, the action here is ripe.  See, e.g., Thomas, 220 F.3d at 1139 \n24  (“Whether the question is viewed as one of standing or ripeness, the Constitution \n25  mandates that prior to our exercise of jurisdiction there exist a constitutional ‘case or \n26  controversy,’ that the issues presented are ‘definite and concrete, not hypothetical or \n27  abstract.’ . . . We need not delve into the nuances of the distinction between the injury in \n28  fact prong of standing and the constitutional component of ripeness: in this case, the \n10 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 11 of 43\n \n1  analysis is the same.” (citations omitted)). \n2  “In evaluating the prudential aspects of ripeness, our analysis is guided by two \n3  overarching considerations: ‘the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the \n4  hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.’”  Id. at 1141 (quoting Abbott \n5  Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. \n6  Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977)).  When the question presented “is ‘a purely legal one’” that \n7  “constitutes ‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA,” that suggests \n8  the issue is fit for judicial decision.  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. \n9  803, 812 (2003).  However, an issue may not be ripe for review if “further factual \n10  development would ‘significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues \n11  presented.’”  Id. (quoting Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl. Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, \n  12  82 (1978)). \n a\ntruin\noro 13  In this case, the court has determined that plaintiffs have standing, therefore, it \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  follows that the case is constitutionally ripe for adjudication.  See Thomas, 220 F.3d at \niD tc 15  1139.  The court has not previously addressed prudential ripeness.  Defendants contend \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  that plaintiffs’ claims fail the prudential ripeness standard because the claims are \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  premised on speculation about the Rule’s operation in practice and further factual \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  development is required.  Mtn. at 7.  Plaintiffs assert that the prudential ripeness standard \nN\n19  is met because the Rule is final, and plaintiffs have already presented evidence of a \n20  chilling effect.  Opp. at 6.   \n21  “Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires [a \n22  court] to evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to \n23  the parties of withholding court consideration.”  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n, 538 U.S. at 808 \n24  (citing Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).  When considering whether issues are fit for \n25  review, the question should be a “purely legal one” and the agency action in question \n26  should constitute a “‘final agency action’ within the meaning of § 10 of the APA.”  Id. at \n27  812 (quoting Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149).   \n28  The second factor examines “the hardship to the parties of withholding court \n11 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 12 of 43\n \n1  consideration.”  Id. at 808.  Generally, a showing of hardship requires demonstrating that \n2  the regulation in question creates “adverse effects of a strictly legal kind.”  Id. at 809 \n3  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733 (1998)).  Such \n4  adverse effects do not arise if the regulation in question “do[es] not command anyone to \n5  do anything or to refrain from doing anything; [it] do[es] not grant, withhold, or modify any \n6  formal legal license, power, or authority; [it] do[es] not subject anyone to any civil or \n7  criminal liability; [and it] create[s] no legal rights or obligations.”  Id. (alterations in original) \n8  (quoting Ohio Forestry Ass’n, 523 U.S. at 733).   \n9  Here, the challenge to the Rule in this case “is a purely legal one,” i.e., whether the \n10  INA was properly construed and implemented by DHS.  See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at \n11  149 (noting that “whether the statute was properly construed by the Commissioner” to be \n  12  a purely legal challenge).  Next, the Rule constitutes a “rule” as defined by the APA.  See \n a\ntruin\noro 13  5 U.S.C. § 551(4), (13) (defining “agency action” and “rule”).  The text of the Rule \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  confirms that its promulgation was an agency action.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 41,294 (“This \niD tc 15  rule changes how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) interprets and \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  implements the public charge ground of inadmissibility.”).  This factor indicates the Rule \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  is ripe for review. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  With respect to hardship, the Rule imposes potential adverse effects of a strictly \nN\n19  legal kind.  If an alien falls within the Rule’s definition of a public charge as determined by \n20  an immigration officer, then he or she is inadmissible.  In other words, the Rule defines a \n21  legal right—admissibility to the United States.  Concurrently, it also defines the legal \n22  powers and authorities of federal government officials in evaluating whether an alien is \n23  admissible.  Of course, the Rule does not define the legal rights of plaintiffs or create any \n24  legal obligations directly impacting them.  However, the potential adverse effects on \n25  individuals cause a direct harm to plaintiffs, as discussed above with regard to plaintiffs’ \n26  standing. \n27  Defendants, citing Habeas Corpus Resource Center v. United States Department \n28  of Justice, 816 F.3d 1241, 1252 (9th Cir. 2016), contend that the court “would benefit \n12 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 13 of 43\n \n1  from further factual development.”  Mtn. at 7.  They argue that plaintiffs’ claims are largely \n2  based on speculation about the Rule’s operation in practice.  Yet, plaintiffs have alleged \n3  that the chilling effects of the Rule began before it was even finalized.  For example, \n4  plaintiffs allege that the District of Columbia’s Department of Health Care Finance \n5  submitted a comment during the notice and comment period stating that the department \n6  has already seen a 3.5 percent average decline in participation in local health care \n7  programs that extend coverage to immigrants.  Compl. ¶ 158.  Moreover, because \n8  appellate courts have stayed all preliminary injunctions enjoining the Rule, it is currently \n9  in effect.4 \n10  Plaintiffs’ challenge is not speculative and further factual development of the \n11  Rule’s impact is not needed for purposes of ripeness.  Accordingly, the court DENIES \n  12  defendants’ motion with respect to ripeness. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  3.  Zone of Interests \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In order to succeed on the merits, plaintiffs must be within the zone of interests of \niD tc 15  the statute that forms the basis of their challenge.  The zone of interests analysis asks \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  “whether Congress created a private cause of action in legislation,” Organized Vill. of \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Kake v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 795 F.3d 956, 964 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc), such that “this \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  particular class of persons has a right to sue under this substantive statute,” Lexmark \nN\n19  Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 127 (2014).  It is “not a \n20  question of Article III standing” and “this inquiry . . . ‘does not implicate subject-matter \n21  jurisdiction . . . .’”  Organized Vill. of Kake, 795 F.3d at 964 (quoting Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n22  128 & n.4).  “[I]n the APA context, . . . the [zone of interests] test is not ‘especially \n23  demanding.’”  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130 (quoting Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of \n24 \n \n25 \n4 The court understands that the district court for the Southern District of New York \nrecently issued a preliminary injunction staying the Rule for the duration of any declared \n26 \npublic health emergency associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.  See New York v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., — F. Supp. 3d —, No. 19 Civ. 7777 (GBD), 19 Civ. 7993 (GBD), \n27 \n2020 WL 4347264, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. July 29, 2020).  This stay does not affect the fact that \nthe Rule was effective from February 24, 2020 until July 29, 2020 such that plaintiffs’ \n28 \nchallenge remains ripe. \n13 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 14 of 43\n \n1  Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 225–26 (2012)). \n2  “Whether a plaintiff’s interest is ‘arguably . . . protected . . . by the statute’ within \n3  the meaning of the zone-of-interests test is to be determined not by reference to the \n4  overall purpose of the Act in question[,] . . . but by reference to the particular provision of \n5  law upon which the plaintiff relies.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 175–76 (1997) (first \n6  and second alterations in original) (quoting Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. \n7  Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)).  Put differently, “the plaintiff must establish that the \n8  injury he complains of . . . falls within the ‘zone of interests’ sought to be protected by the \n9  statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint.”  Id. at 176 \n10  (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990); and \n11  citing Air Courier Conf. v. Postal Workers, 498 U.S. 517, 523–24 (1991); see also E. Bay \n  12  Sanctuary I, 932 F.3d at 768 n.9 (“‘[W]e are not limited to considering the [specific] \n a\ntruin\noro 13  statute under which [plaintiffs] sued, but may consider any provision that helps us to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  understand Congress’[s] overall purposes in the [INA].’” (alterations in original) (quoting \niD tc 15  Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 401 (1987))).  “[F]or APA challenges, a plaintiff \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  can satisfy the test in either one of two ways: (1) ‘if it is among those [who] Congress \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  expressly or directly indicated were the intended beneficiaries of a statute,’ or (2) ‘if it is a \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  suitable challenger to enforce the statute—that is, if its interests are sufficiently congruent \nN\n19  with those of the intended beneficiaries that the litigants are not more likely to frustrate \n20  than to further . . . statutory objectives.’  California, 963 F.3d at 941–42 (second and third \n21  alterations in original) (quoting Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Dep’t of Def., 87 \n22  F.3d 1356, 1359 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). \n23  In the preliminary injunction order, this court determined that section 1183a’s \n24  affidavit of support provision is incorporated in and has an integral relationship with the \n25  public charge analysis (see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii), 1183a) and therefore should be \n26  considered as part of the zone of interests analysis.  Dkt. 120 at 69.  Section 1183a \n27  explains that someone can sponsor an alien by guaranteeing to financially support him, \n28  and thereby alleviate the concern that he may become a public charge.  That statute also \n14 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 15 of 43\n \n1  provides that any such sponsorship can only be considered in the public charge analysis \n2  if it is supported by an affidavit that is “legally enforceable against the sponsor by . . . any \n3  State (or any political subdivision of such State), or by any other entity that provides any \n4  means-tested public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1)(B). \n5  The court reasoned that by recognizing that states would be paying means-tested \n6  public benefits to those subject to a public charge analysis, requiring that states have \n7  legally-enforceable rights to recover those expenses when an alien is admitted based on \n8  consideration of an affidavit of support, and guaranteeing state-court jurisdiction for such \n9  enforcement actions, Congress clearly intended to protect states and their political \n10  subdivisions.  Dkt. 120 at 70.  The court also determined that because states have the \n11  right to recover payment from an affiant under section 1183a, Congress intended to \n  12  protect states’ financial interests.  Id.   \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Defendants argue that individual aliens deemed inadmissible, rather than the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  states, are in the INA’s zone of interest.  Mtn. at 8.  Defendants would distinguish the \niD tc 15  court’s preliminary injunction finding because enforcement of affidavits of support does \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  not constitute an injury that falls within the zone of interests.  Id.  Plaintiffs first contend \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  that section 1183a demonstrates Congress’s intent to protect states by permitting states \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  to enforce affidavits of support.  Opp. at 7.  Second, in enacting the INA, Congress gave \nN\n19  states the discretion to allocate public benefits.  Plaintiffs contend that the Rule disrupts \n20  the provision of benefits to noncitizens, resulting in more costly emergency care.  Id. at \n21  7–8.  Third, plaintiffs argue that defendants conflate their merits argument with the zone \n22  of interests analysis by contending that the public charge provision is meant to reduce \n23  aliens reliance on both states and the federal government.  Id. at 8. \n24  Defendants’ zone of interests argument does not alter the court’s prior \n25  conclusions.  Significantly, plaintiffs rely on section 1183a as a basis for their first claim \n26  such that it is a relevant statute for the zone of interests test.  Compl. ¶ 312.  By \n27  permitting states to recover payments under section 1183a, plaintiffs are intended \n28  beneficiaries under the statute.  Further, the injuries complained of by plaintiffs include \n15 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 16 of 43\n \n1  harm to their coffers.  See id. ¶ 233 (“The Public Charge Rule will cause direct economic \n2  harm to Plaintiffs in the form of increased uncompensated costs for hospital care.”); ¶ 241 \n3  (“Immigrants who are chilled from accessing publicly funded health insurance programs \n4  for which they are eligible will be more likely to defer primary or preventive healthcare.  \n5  Deferred care leads to more complex medical conditions later on that are more expensive \n6  to treat.”).  Harm to the financial well-being of the states falls within the zone of interests \n7  protected by the statute.  As stated in the prior order, the affidavit of support section \n8  creates a legally enforceable contract against the sponsor and the states may bring an \n9  action to compel reimbursement of government expenses.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(a)(1), \n10  (b)(1)–(2).   \n11  In a footnote, defendants contend that plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims fail the \n  12  zone of interests test because the Supreme Court has suggested that there is a \n a\ntruin\noro 13  heightened zone of interests requirement for implied causes of action such as plaintiffs’ \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  constitutional claim.  Mtn. at 8 n.2.  Yet, in the very case that defendants cite for this \niD tc 15  proposition, Clarke v. Securities Industry Association, 479 U.S. at 400 n.16, the Court \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  cautioned that “[w]hile inquiries into reviewability or prudential standing in other [non-\nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  APA] contexts may bear some resemblance to a ‘zone of interest’ inquiry under the APA, \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  it is not a test of universal application.”  The Court went on to distinguish earlier dicta \nN\n19  suggesting a zone of interest inquiry was applicable to constitutional claims, stating “[w]e \n20  doubt, however, that it is possible to formulate a single inquiry that governs all statutory \n21  and constitutional claims.”  Id. (citing Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, \n22  397 U.S. 150, 153 (1970)).  As plaintiffs point out, the Ninth Circuit has also questioned \n23  whether a zone of interests test can be applied in light of the Court’s decision in Lexmark, \n24  which focused on Congress’s intent in creating statutory causes of action as opposed to \n25  causes of action that arise under the Constitution.  See Sierra Club v. Trump, 929 F.3d \n26  670, 701–02 (9th Cir. 2019) (“[W]e doubt that any zone of interests test applies to \n27  Plaintiffs’ equitable cause of action.”).  Accordingly, the court declines to apply a zone of \n28  interest test to plaintiffs’ constitutional claims.   \n16 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 17 of 43\n \n1  In sum, the zone of interests test is not “especially demanding,” Lexmark, 572 U.S. \n2  at 130, and, “at the very least, the [states’] interests are ‘marginally related to’ and \n3  ‘arguably within’ the scope of the statute.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 950 \n4  F.3d 1242, 1270 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Pottawatomi Indians, 520 U.S. at 175–76).  The \n5  court, therefore, DENIES defendants’ motion with respect to zone of interests. \n6  4.  First and Fourth Claims—Contrary to Law and Arbitrary and \n7  Capricious \n8  Turning to defendants’ motion with regard to individual claims, the court addresses \n9  plaintiffs’ first and fourth claims together as they present a related issue.  In its \n10  preliminary injunction order, the court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on \n11  the merits of their claim that the Rule was not in accordance with the INA.  Dkt. 120 at 48.  \n  12  After a lengthy review of the prior legislative, regulatory, and judicial history of the term \n a\ntruin\noro 13  “public charge,” the court determined that DHS’s interpretation of the term “public charge” \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  was not reasonable at Chevron step two.  In its order staying the injunction, the Ninth \niD tc 15  Circuit determined that, at Chevron step one, the term “public charge” is not a term of art \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  and not self-defining—thus, it was ambiguous.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  792.  At step two, the court also reviewed the lengthy legislative history and case law \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  surrounding the term “public charge” and concluded that there has not been “one fixed \nN\n19  understanding of ‘public charge’ that has endured since 1882.”  Id. at 796.  Instead, “[i]f \n20  anything has been consistent, it is the idea that a totality-of-the-circumstances test \n21  governs public-charge determinations.  But different factors have been weighted more or \n22  less heavily at different times, reflecting changes in the way in which we provide \n23  assistance to the needy.”  Id. In resolving the step two analysis, the Ninth Circuit \n24  determined that the Rule was a reasonable interpretation of the INA.  Id. at 799.   \n25  Also in its prior order, this court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on \n26  the merits that the Rule is arbitrary and capricious because DHS failed to consider costs \n27  and benefits, including costs to state governments and health effects on state \n28  populations.  Dkt. 120 at 53.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit motions panel discussed both \n17 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 18 of 43\n \n1  the cost-benefit issue and the public health effect issue.  With regard to the former, the \n2  court observed that DHS “addressed at length the costs and benefits associated with the \n3  Final Rule.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 801.  With respect to public health \n4  effects, the Ninth Circuit noted that “DHS not only addressed these concerns directly, it \n5  changed its Final Rule in response to the comments.”  Id.  The court determined that \n6  DHS could change its policy as long as DHS acknowledged the change and explained \n7  the reasons for it.  Id. at 805.  In sum, the court held that DHS demonstrated that it was \n8  likely to succeed on the merits of the arbitrary and capricious claim. \n9  The Ninth Circuit motions panel decision to stay the preliminary injunction presents \n10  novel procedural and substantive questions.  The court requested supplemental briefing \n11  on these issues, (Dkt. 176), to which both parties responded (Dkts. 177, 178).  As a \n  12  procedural matter, defendants’ motion to dismiss comes after the motions panel’s opinion \n a\ntruin\noro 13  staying the preliminary injunction but before the merits panel has issued its opinion on the \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  preliminary injunction.  The merits panel may issue an opinion that comes out entirely the \niD tc 15  same way as the motions panel, adopts an entirely contrary view, or lands somewhere in \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  between.  The prospect of conflicting or confirming guidance indicates that deciding these \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  issues prior to the merits panel’s opinion may be premature. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  With respect to the substantive issues, the Ninth Circuit motion panel opinion \nN\n19  implicates both the law of the circuit and the law of the case.  Under the law of the circuit \n20  doctrine, “[p]ublished decisions of [the Ninth Circuit] become law of the circuit, which is \n21  binding authority that we and district courts must follow until overruled.”  E. Bay \n22  Sanctuary II, 950 F.3d at 1261.  “Under the law of the case doctrine, a court will generally \n23  refuse to reconsider an issue that has already been decided by the same court or a \n24  higher court in the same case.”  Gonzalez, 677 F.3d at 390 n.4.  However, “[t]he Ninth \n25  Circuit has instructed that a ‘district court should abide “by the general rule” that our \n26  decisions at the preliminary injunction phase do not constitute the law of the case,’ but \n27  that ‘[a]ny of our conclusions on pure issues of law, however, are binding.’”  E. Bay \n28  Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 354 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1106 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (alteration in \n18 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 19 of 43\n \n1  original) (quoting Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of Am. v. \n2  U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 499 F.3d 1108, 1114 (9th Cir. 2007)). \n3  A motions panel opinion reviewing a motion to stay an injunction is not necessarily \n4  binding on a future merits panel reviewing the substance of that injunction.  See E. Bay \n5  Sanctuary II, 950 F.3d at 1264 (“The decision whether to grant a stay—much like the \n6  decision whether to grant a preliminary injunction—is a ‘probabilistic’ endeavor.  We \n7  discuss the merits of a stay request in ‘likelihood terms,’ and exercise a ‘restrained \n8  approach to assessing the merits.’  Such a predictive analysis should not, and does not, \n9  forever bind the merits of the parties’ claims.”  (quoting Sierra Club, 929 F.3d at 688)); \n10  see also Innovation Law Lab v. Wolf, 951 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing E. Bay \n11  Sanctuary II for proposition that “a motions panel’s legal analysis, performed during the \n  12  course of deciding an emergency motion for a stay, is not binding on later merits \n a\ntruin\noro 13  panels”).  While East Bay Sanctuary II indicated that an appellate decision regarding a \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  stay “should not, and does not, forever bind the merits of the parties’ claims,” 950 F.3d at \niD tc 15  1264, this court is bound to follow opinions constituting law of the circuit, see id. at 1263 \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  n.3 (“[T]he first panel to consider an issue sets the law . . . for all the inferior courts in the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  circuit” and “future panels of the court of appeals . . . .” (first and second alterations in \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hart v. Massanari, 266 F.3d 1155, \nN\n19  1171 (9th Cir. 2001))). \n20  Applying the motions panel’s opinion would also require determining the extent to \n21  which the opinion is binding (or persuasive) on each of plaintiffs’ claims that defendants \n22  now seek to dismiss in full.  As plaintiffs point out in the supplemental brief, the motions \n23  panel did not address all legal issues raised by the States and did not assess the \n24  complete administrative record in reaching its decision.  Alternatively, as defendants \n25  note, if the court dismisses the first or fourth claims, such a decision would moot the \n26  preliminary injunction appeal on those causes of action. \n27  Given the minefield of potential issues, a cautious approach is warranted.  As part \n28  of its request for supplemental briefing, the court asked whether it should defer ruling on \n19 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 20 of 43\n \n1  plaintiffs’ first and fourth claims until the Ninth Circuit merits panel has issued its opinion.  \n2  Dkt. 176 at 2–3.  Both parties responded that they were not opposed to such a course of \n3  action.  Dkt. 177 at 9; Dkt. 178 at 10.  Accordingly, the court DEFERS RULING ON \n4  defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ first and fourth causes of action until the Ninth \n5  Circuit issues an opinion on the preliminary injunction or otherwise disposes of the case. \n6  5.  Second Claim—APA Contrary to Law, Rehabilitation Act \n7  Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ second claim, which alleges a violation of \n8  the APA as contrary to the Rehabilitation Act.  Under the APA, “the reviewing court shall \n9  decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and \n10  determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.  The reviewing \n11  court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found \n  12  to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \n a\ntruin\noro 13  law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  “In the usual course, when an agency is authorized by Congress to issue \niD tc 15  regulations and promulgates a regulation interpreting a statute it enforces, the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  interpretation receives deference if the statute is ambiguous and if the agency’s \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  interpretation is reasonable.  This principle is implemented by the two-step analysis set \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  forth in Chevron.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2124 (2016) \nN\n19  (citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)).   \n \n20  At the first step, a court must determine whether Congress has \n“directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  If so, “that is \n21  the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must \ngive  effect  to  the  unambiguously  expressed  intent  of \n22  Congress.”  If not, then at the second step the court must defer \nto the agency’s interpretation if it is “reasonable.”   \n23 \n24  Id. at 2124–25 (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842–44). \n25  “[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the \n26  question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible \n27  construction of the statute.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843; see also Michigan v. E.P.A., 135 \n28  S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015) (“Even under this deferential standard, however, agencies must \n20 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 21 of 43\n \n1  operate within the bounds of reasonable interpretation.” (internal quotation marks and \n2  citation omitted)).  The Chevron analysis calls upon the court to “employ[] traditional tools \n3  of statutory construction” to fulfill its role as “the final authority on issues of statutory \n4  construction.”  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9; accord Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. \n5  1612, 1630 (2018). \n6  The Rehabilitation Act prohibits “any program or activity receiving federal financial \n7  assistance” or “any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency,” from \n8  excluding, denying benefits to, or discriminating against persons with disabilities.  29 \n9  U.S.C. § 794(a).  “To establish a violation of § 504 of the [Rehabilitation Act (“RA”)], a \n10  plaintiff must show that (1) she is handicapped within the meaning of the RA; (2) she is \n11  otherwise qualified for the benefit or services sought; (3) she was denied the benefit or \n  12  services solely by reason of her handicap; and (4) the program providing the benefit or \n a\ntruin\noro 13  services receives federal financial assistance.”  Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1052 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Weinreich v. L.A. Cty. Metro. Transp. Auth., 114 F.3d 976, 978 (9th \niD tc 15  Cir. 1997)). \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  In its prior order on plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the court \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  determined that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their Rehabilitation Act claim for \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  two reasons.  First, the Rehabilitation Act requires that a plaintiff show that a disabled \nN\n19  person was denied services “solely by reason of her handicap.”  The Rule does not deny \n20  any alien admission into the United States, or adjustment of status, “solely by reason of” \n21  disability.  All covered aliens, disabled or not, are subject to the same inquiry:  whether \n22  they are likely to use one or more covered federal benefits for the specified period of \n23  time.  Even though a disability is likely to be an underlying cause of some individuals \n24  qualifying for additional negative factors, it will not be the sole cause.  As such, disability \n25  is one non-dispositive factor.  Dkt. 120 at 50. \n26  Second, the INA explicitly lists “health” as a factor that an officer “shall . . . \n27  consider” in making a public charge determination.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  “Health” \n28  includes an alien’s disability and whatever impact the disability may have on the alien’s \n21 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 22 of 43\n \n1  expenses and ability to work.  Congress, not the Rule, requires DHS to take this factor \n2  into account.  Courts have recognized that the RA cannot revoke or repeal a more \n3  specific statute.  See, e.g., Knutzen v. Eben Ezer Lutheran Hous. Ctr., 815 F.2d 1343, \n4  1353 (10th Cir. 1987) (noting that section 504 may not “‘revoke or repeal . . . a much \n5  more specific statute with an articulated program’ . . . absent express language by \n6  Congress stating its intent to revoke or repeal that statute” (citations omitted)); Dkt. 120 at \n7  50.  The INA’s requirement to consider health was enacted subsequent to the RA and is \n8  specific to the consideration of who constitutes a public charge.  The Ninth Circuit \n9  likewise found that Congress directed DHS to consider health—including an alien’s \n10  disability—as a factor in public charge determinations.  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 \n11  F.3d at 800.  The court also reasoned that “[n]othing in the Final Rule suggests that \n  12  aliens will be denied admission or adjustment of status “solely by reason of her or his \n a\ntruin\noro 13  disability.’”  Id.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ second claim fails because the Rehabilitation Act \niD tc 15  requires that a disabled person be denied services by reason of her disability and this \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  causal standard is strict.  Mtn. at 15.  According to defendants, plaintiffs cannot meet this \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  strict causal requirement because a medical condition may constitute one factor that is \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  considered as part of the totality of the circumstances test.  Id.  In response, plaintiffs first \nN\n19  point out that Congress did not exempt DHS from the Rehabilitation Act’s requirements.  \n20  Opp. at 13.  According to plaintiffs, recipients of Medicaid for more than 12 months, \n21  especially those with disabilities, are by definition a public charge.  Id. at 14.  Thus, the \n22  Rule would deny such individuals meaningful access to immigration benefits because of \n23  their disability-related needs.  Id.   \n24  Plaintiffs’ arguments are unconvincing.  Plaintiffs assert that the Rule is dispositive \n25  with regard to a disabled alien’s public charge determination as long as the individual in \n26  question is a Medicaid recipient for more than 12 months.  Opp. at 14; Compl. ¶ 51.  DHS \n27  acknowledged the impact on those individuals with disabilities when it stated that it  \n \n28  understands  that  individuals  with  disabilities  receive  public \n22 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 23 of 43\n \nbenefits that are listed in the rule.  However, Congress did not \n1  specifically  provide  for  a  public  charge  exemption  for \nindividuals with disabilities and in fact included health as a \n2  mandatory  factor  in  the  public  charge  inadmissibility \nconsideration.  Therefore, DHS will retain the designation of \n3  Medicaid and SNAP as public benefits, notwithstanding the \npotentially outsized impact of such designation on individuals \n4  with disabilities. \n5  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,368 (footnote omitted).  While there may be a higher correlation \n6  between Medicaid enrollment and having a disability, it does not follow that the disability \n7  is the sole reason an individual is determined to be a public charge.  When DHS \n8  considers public benefits, such as Medicaid, the factor being considered is not the \n9  disability but an individual’s “assets, resources, and financial status.”  8 U.S.C. \n10  § 1182(a)(4)(B)(IV).  Further, the Rule facially states that the applicable standard is a \n11  totality of the circumstances test and a single positive or negative factor is never \n  12  determinative.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Even if the court were to find that receipt of Medicaid was determinative for \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  individuals with disabilities, plaintiffs have not put forward a convincing argument that \niD tc 15  DHS can disregard Congress’s mandate to consider an alien’s health as part of the public \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  charge determination.  The court’s reasoning from the preliminary injunction order applies \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  here.  Congress, not the Rule, requires DHS to take this factor into account.  The Ninth \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Circuit agreed with this rationale, observing that the 1996 amendment to the INA \nN\n19  requiring immigration officers to consider health occurred twenty-three years after \n20  passage of the Rehabilitation Act.  Thus, the court stated “[w]e cannot see how a general \n21  provision in one statute constrains an agency given a specific charge in a subsequent \n22  law.”  City & Cty. of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 800. \n23  Thus, plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for an \n24  APA cause of action as contrary to the Rehabilitation Act.  The court GRANTS \n25  defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ second cause of action.  Because no factual \n26  allegations could alter the court’s determination, further amendment would be futile and \n27  the dismissal is without leave to amend. \n28  / / / \n23 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 24 of 43\n \n1  6.  Third Claim—APA Contrary to Law, State Healthcare Discretion \n2  Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ third claim for violation of the APA as \n3  contrary to state healthcare discretion.  The court did not previously address this claim as \n4  part of the preliminary injunction order.  The Ninth Circuit likewise did not address this \n5  issue. \n6  In the complaint, plaintiffs advance two theories in support of their third claim.  \n7  First, they contend that the Rule will effectively deprive plaintiffs of their statutory option \n8  under the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. \n9  111-3, § 214, 123 Stat. 8, 56 (“CHIPRA”) to provide certain benefits to lawfully residing \n10  children and pregnant women.  Compl. ¶¶ 323–24.  Second, plaintiffs argue that the \n11  Public Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (“PRWORA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1612–13, \n  12  1621(d), 1622(a); 7 U.S.C. § 2016(i), expressly gave states the discretion to decide \n a\ntruin\noro 13  whether to provide many public benefits to noncitizens and the Rule will effectively \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  deprive the states of this option.  Compl. ¶¶ 325–26.   \niD tc 15  Defendants argue that the Rule does not deprive the states of their statutory \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  option to extend program eligibility for lawfully residing children and pregnant women \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) during their first \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  five years in the U.S.  Mtn. at 16.  Defendants point out that the Rule explicitly excludes \nN\n19  CHIP from the definition of public benefit and also excludes public benefits received by \n20  children eligible for acquisition of citizenship and Medicaid benefits received by aliens \n21  under 21 or pregnant women through 60 days after the last day of pregnancy.  Id.  Thus, \n22  the Rule does not deprive plaintiffs of their authority to provide these benefits.  \n23  Defendants also contend that the Rule does not limit or change an alien’s entitlement to \n24  public benefits; rather, it requires immigration officials to consider the receipt of benefits \n25  as part of the totality of the circumstances test.  Id. \n26  In response, plaintiffs argue that the Rule’s known and predictable chilling effects \n27  will effectively deprive plaintiffs of their statutory option to extend program eligibility to \n28  certain groups.  Opp. at 15.  Plaintiffs point out that several states have elected to \n24 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 25 of 43\n \n1  automatically certify Medicaid enrollees for up to 12 months at a time, yet enrollment in \n2  Medicaid for 12 months translates into a heavily weighted factor under the Rule.  Id.  \n3  Individuals who are subject to both the public charge determination and the automatic \n4  Medicaid certification face a particularly harsh choice—continue to enroll in Medicaid and \n5  risk a negative public charge determination or disenroll from Medicaid.  By causing \n6  disenrollment and underutilization, plaintiffs contend the Rule interferes with their robust \n7  safety net systems and benefits authorized by Congress.  Id. at 16.   \n8  Plaintiffs’ arguments implicate Chevron step two, where “deference is not owed to \n9  an agency decision if it construes a statute in a way that is contrary to congressional \n10  intent or frustrates congressional policy.”  CHW W. Bay v. Thompson, 246 F.3d 1218, \n11  1223 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Anaheim Mem’l Hosp. v. Shalala, 130 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir. \n  12  1997)).  As an initial observation, the Rule does not facially detract from or limit the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  authority with which Congress empowered the states under CHIPRA or PRWORA.  As \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  defendants note in their brief, the Rule directly affects the rights and obligations of those \niD tc 15  aliens that fall under the scope of the public charge provision.  Plaintiffs acknowledge this \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  point as they argue that the Rule’s chilling effect will effectively deprive them of their \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  statutory options.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  There are two reasons why plaintiffs fail to state a claim.  First, the statutory \nN\n19  schemes referenced in the complaint are permissive, not mandatory.  These are \n20  programs that states may implement or extend to applicable individuals.  See 8 U.S.C. \n21  § 1612(b) (“[A] State is authorized to determine the eligibility of an alien . . . .”); § 1621(d) \n22  (“A State may provide that an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States is \n23  eligible for any State or local public benefit for which such alien would otherwise be \n24  ineligible under subsection (a) only through the enactment of a State law after August 22, \n25  1996, which affirmatively provides for such eligibility.” (emphasis added)); § 1622(a) (“[A] \n26  State is authorized to determine the eligibility for any State public benefits . . . .”); 7 \n27  U.S.C. § 2016(i) (“[A] State agency may . . . issue benefits under this chapter . . . .”); 123 \n28  Stat. at 56 (“A State may elect . . . .”).  Each state is free to choose whether, and the \n25 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 26 of 43\n \n1  extent to which, it will exercise the authority granted to it by Congress.   \n2  Second, each individual is also free to choose whether he or she will accept public \n3  benefits from the state.  Plaintiffs have alleged that the Rule will have a chilling effect on \n4  immigrants, including those who are not subject to the Rule.  Compl. ¶¶ 145–46.  For \n5  purposes of a motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true the chilling effect of the Rule \n6  on enrollment in public benefit programs.  Yet, even so, plaintiffs have not demonstrated \n7  that the Rule requires or prevents the states from undertaking a particular course of \n8  action.  Instead, the Rule impacts the choices of individuals who may or may not be \n9  under the Rule’s purview.  The opposition even refers to the “particularly hard choices” \n10  faced by those subject to the Rule.  Opp. at 15.  Those individuals may be dissuaded or \n11  chilled from participating in benefit programs, but the actions of such third parties do not \n  12  frustrate the availability of the benefits in the first instance.  The states remain free to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  offer benefits.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Thus, the Rule does not prevent the states from offering public benefit programs \niD tc 15  authorized by Congress and is not contrary to law.  Accordingly, defendants’ motion to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  dismiss plaintiffs’ third cause of action is GRANTED.  Because no factual allegations \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  could alter the court’s determination, further amendment would be futile and the dismissal \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  is without leave to amend. \nN\n19  7.  Fifth and Sixth Claims—Equal Protection \n20  Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ fifth and sixth claims for violation of the \n21  Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  Neither this court nor the Ninth \n22  Circuit addressed these claims when considering the preliminary injunction.  The Equal \n23  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no state shall “deny to \n24  any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” U.S. Const. amend. \n25  XIV, § 1, which amounts to a direction that all persons who are similarly situated should \n26  be treated alike.  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  The \n27  equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause imposes a \n28  similar obligation on the federal government.  See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499–\n26 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 27 of 43\n \n1  500 (1954); see also I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, 486 U.S. 875, 886 (1988) (considering “the \n2  possibility of a violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due \n3  Process Clause”). \n4  Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims should be dismissed \n5  because the Rule is facially neutral, and plaintiffs cannot establish discriminatory intent.  \n6  Mtn. at 19.  Defendants contend that the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. Hawaii, \n7  138 S. Ct. 2392, 2418 (2018), set a “deferential standard of review” that applies to \n8  immigration policies.  Mtn. at 20.  According to defendants, the Rule is valid under either \n9  Hawaii’s standard of review or rational basis review because the Rule is plausibly related \n10  to DHS’s stated objectives.  Id.  Defendants also contend that the public statements by \n11  government officials on which plaintiffs rely were not made by DHS officials and have no \n  12  express connection to the Rule.  Id. at 21. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Plaintiffs respond that the applicable standard of review is provided by Village of \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), \niD tc 15  under which they must produce direct or circumstantial evidence that a discriminatory \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  reason more likely than not motivated the defendants and that the defendants’ action \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  adversely affected the plaintiffs in some way.  Opp. at 21.  Plaintiffs argue that they have \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  alleged facts that are indicative of a discriminatory intent.  These include: the Rule is \nN\n19  more likely to prevent immigrants of color from adjusting their status or changing their \n20  visas compared to White immigrant counterparts, which DHS acknowledged, (id. at 22); \n21  the Rule reflects a pattern of bias against non-White, non-European immigrants as \n22  illustrated by pre- and post-election statements by the President and other statements by \n23  decisionmakers (id. at 22–24); and plaintiffs allege that circumstantial evidence in the \n24  form of the departure from the normal procedures and the manipulation by the White \n25  House of DHS officials also support an inference of discriminatory intent (id. at 24).  \n26  Plaintiffs next argue that Trump v. Hawaii is not applicable where, as here, DHS’s \n27  regulated activity applies to people already residing in the United States and national \n28  security concerns are not present.  Id.   \n27 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 28 of 43\n \n1  The parties’ dispute falls into two general camps.  First, they disagree as to the \n2  applicable framework to review plaintiffs’ Equal Protection challenge.  Plaintiffs assert \n3  that the court should apply the disparate treatment framework described in Arlington \n4  Heights so that plaintiffs can demonstrate discriminatory intent.  Defendants contend that \n5  the deferential standard of review in Trump v. Hawaii applies here such that plaintiffs fail \n6  to state a claims regardless of the facts alleged in the complaint.  Second, the parties \n7  dispute whether the factual allegations are sufficient to plausibly state a claim for an \n8  Equal Protection violation.  The court analyzes each in turn. \n9  i.  Whether Trump v. Hawaii Applies to the Rule \n10  Relevant to the public charge rule, there are two broad principles intricately \n11  intertwined with the Supreme Court’s immigration law jurisprudence.  First, the Court has \n  12  long recognized that Congress’s power concerning the initial entry of aliens into the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  country is plenary.  See Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (“This Court has \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  repeatedly emphasized that ‘over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of \niD tc 15  Congress more complete than it is over’ the admission of aliens.” (quoting Oceanic \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909)).  Second, once an alien arrives \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  in the United States and begins establishing ties to the country, the Court has recognized \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  certain constitutional protections extend to those persons, even if their presence is \nN\n19  “unlawful, involuntary, or transitory.”  Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77 (1976) (“There \n20  are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States.  The Fifth \n21  Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these persons \n22  from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” (citations \n23  omitted)).   \n24  1.  Plenary Power Jurisprudence \n25  The Supreme Court’s recognition of Congress’s plenary power over immigration \n26  first arose soon after the passage of the immigration legislation in the latter half of the \n27  nineteenth century.  In 1882, Congress enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, Pub. L. No. \n28  47-126, 22 Stat. 58, which prohibited entry of Chinese laborers into the United States.  \n28 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 29 of 43\n \n1  See Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 866 (2018) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  The \n2  Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act in a series of cases, in particular Chae Chan \n3  Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581 (1889), and Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 \n4  U.S. 698 (1893).  Chae Chan Ping, 130 U.S. at 581–82, dealt with the exclusion of a \n5  Chinese lawful permanent resident who left the United States and then was denied re-\n6  entry and Fong Yue Ting, 149 U.S. at 729, involved the deportation of Chinese \n7  immigrants because they could not demonstrate by the testimony of “at least one credible \n8  white witness” (as required by the Chinese Exclusion Act) that they were lawful residents.  \n9  In Chae Chan Ping, Justice Field wrote that  \n \n10  [t]he  power of  exclusion  of  foreigners being  an  incident  of \nsovereignty belonging to the government of the United States \n11  as  a  part  of  those  sovereign  powers  delegated  by  the \nconstitution, the right to its exercise at any time when, in the \n a  12  judgment of the government, the interests of the country require \ntruin it, cannot be granted away or restrained on behalf of any one.   \noro 13 \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  130 U.S. at 609.  In a passage that was later cited with approval by the Court in Fong \niD tc 15  Yue Ting, Justice Field also expounded on Congress’s plenary power with regard to \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  different races of aliens: \nt\nS \nn  \n dere 17  The  government,  possessing  the  powers  which  are  to  be \nh\nt\nintr exercised for protection and security, is clothed with authority \nUoN 18  to determine the occasion on which the powers shall be called \nforth; and its determination, so far as the subjects affected are \n19  concerned, is necessarily conclusive upon all its departments \nand officers.  If, therefore, the government of the United states, \n20  through its legislative department, considers the presence of \nforeigners  of  a  different  race  in  this  country,  who  will  not \n21  assimilate with us, to be dangerous to its peace and security, \ntheir exclusion is not to be stayed because at the time there are \n22  no actual hostilities with the nation of which the foreigners are \nsubjects. \n23 \n24  Id. at 606; Fong Yue Ting, 149 U.S. at 706. \n25  However, around the turn of the century, “the Court began to walk back the \n26  plenary power doctrine in significant ways.”  Castro v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 835 \n27  F.3d 422, 441 (3d Cir. 2016).  In Kaoru Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86, 87 (1903), a \n28  Japanese immigrant entered the United States but a few days later, an immigration \n29 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 30 of 43\n \n1  officer sought her deportation because he determined that she was likely to become a \n2  public charge.  The Court, while acknowledging its plenary power as described in Fong \n3  Yue Ting, stated that immigration officers could not “disregard the fundamental principles \n4  that inhere in ‘due process of law’ as understood at the time of the adoption of the \n5  Constitution.”  Id. at 100.  In Yamataya, the fundamental principle at stake was the \n6  procedural due process right to be heard prior to being taken into custody and deported.  \n7  Id. at 101.  As the Third Circuit recently described, Yamataya represented a “turning \n8  point” in the Supreme Court’s plenary power jurisprudence such that Congress’s power \n9  was qualified by basic constitutional considerations.  Castro, 835 F.3d at 442 (quoting \n10  Henry M. Hart, Jr., The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts: An \n11  Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1390 n.85 (1953)).   \n  12  Though it was a turning point for immigrants inside the United States, Yamataya \n a\ntruin\noro 13  did not alter Congress’s plenary power at initial entry because in United States ex rel. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950), and Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. \niD tc 15  Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953), the Court upheld actions by immigration officials to exclude \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  two aliens “on the threshold of initial entry,” Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212, without the \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  procedural due process rights afforded in Yamataya.  “Knauff and Mezei essentially \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  restored the political branches’ plenary power over aliens at the border seeking initial \nN\n19  admission.”  Castro, 835 F.3d at 443.  Thus, if the immigration action pertains to initial \n20  admission, then Congress’s power is plenary.  In Landon v. Plasencia, the Court \n21  summarized these two competing interests, stating that it “has long held that an alien \n22  seeking initial admission to the United States requests privilege and has no constitutional \n23  rights regarding his application, for the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign \n24  prerogative.  459 U.S. 21, 32 (1982) (citing Knauff, 338 U.S. at 542; and Nishimura Ekiu \n25  v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 659–60 (1892)).  “As we explained in Johnson v. \n26  Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 770 (1950), however, once an alien gains admission to our \n27  country and begins to develop the ties that go with permanent residence his constitutional \n28  status changes accordingly.  Our cases have frequently suggested that a continuously \n30 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 31 of 43\n \n1  present resident alien is entitled to a fair hearing when threatened with deportation.”  Id. \n2  (citations omitted). \n3  With this framing in mind, the leading case cited by defendants, Trump v. Hawaii, \n4  is properly viewed as an initial admission case.  There, the Supreme Court examined an \n5  Equal Protection challenge to an executive order issued by the President that restricted \n6  entry into the United States by foreign nationals of select countries, nearly all majority-\n7  Muslim countries.  Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. at 2403–04.  From the outset, the Court’s analysis \n8  focused on admission and exclusion cases, citing the plenary power doctrine with regard \n9  to initial admission: “the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a ‘fundamental \n10  sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune \n11  from judicial control.’”  Id. at 2418 (quoting Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792).  The Hawaii court \n  12  discussed at length the standard of review articulated in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  753, 756–57 (1972), which involved an Equal Protection challenge to the Attorney \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  General’s denial of a temporary nonimmigrant visa for a Belgian author.  Mandel, too, \niD tc 15  was an initial admission case as the Court cited the rule that “Mandel personally, as an \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  unadmitted and nonresident alien, had no constitutional right of entry to this country as a \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  nonimmigrant or otherwise.”  Id. at 762 (emphasis added) (citing, e.g., Knauff, 338 U.S. at \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  542).  Recognizing Congress’s plenary power over initial admission decisions, Mandel \nN\n19  upheld Congress’s delegation to the Executive the decision to exclude as long as “the \n20  Executive gave a ‘facially legitimate and bona fide’ reason for its action.”  Hawaii, 138 S. \n21  Ct. at 2419 (quoting Mandel, 408 U.S. at 769).   \n22  The Hawaii court also framed the initial entry cases in the context of national \n23  security, stating “Mandel’s narrow standard of review ‘has particular force’ in admission \n24  and immigration cases that overlap with ‘the area of national security.’”  Id. (quoting Kerry \n25  v. Din, 576 U.S. 86, 104 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).  In Hawaii, the rationale for \n26  such a standard of review rested on the intersection of immigration and national security: \n27  “‘[a]ny rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility’ of the President ‘to \n28  respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution,’ \n31 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 32 of 43\n \n1  and our inquiry into matters of entry and national security is highly constrained.”  Id. at \n2  2419–20 (quoting Diaz, 426 U.S. at 81–82).   \n3  Yet, despite the foregoing buildup, the Court specifically declined to determine \n4  whether Mandel applied in the particular case concerning the President’s proclamation \n5  and instead pivoted to a rational basis standard of review.  Id. at 2420 (“For our purposes \n6  today, we assume that we may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of \n7  applying rational basis review.”).  In its rational basis analysis, the Court examined the \n8  facts underlying the proclamation, id. at 2421 (rejecting the argument that five of seven \n9  countries are Muslim-majority “given that the policy covers just 8% of the world’s Muslim \n10  population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or \n11  prior administrations as posing national security risks”), and the process by which it was \n  12  produced, id. (“The Proclamation, moreover, reflects the results of a worldwide review \n a\ntruin\noro 13  process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their agencies.”). \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  After the Hawaii decision, lower courts have recognized that the deferential \niD tc 15  standard articulated in Mandel, and cited in Hawaii and Fiallo v. Bell, applies to initial \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  admission and exclusion cases but not to aliens who are lawfully admitted into the United \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  States.  For example, several opinions concerning the revocation of temporary protected \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  status (“TPS”) for certain groups, distinguished Hawaii on the grounds that the plaintiffs \nN\n19  were “foreign nationals . . . [who] are lawfully present in the United States . . . .”  Saget v. \n20  Trump, 375 F. Supp. 3d 280, 367 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Centro Presente v. U.S. Dep’t of \n21  Homeland Sec., 332 F. Supp. 3d 393 410–11 (D. Mass. 2018); and New York v. U.S. \n22  Dep’t of Commerce, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502, 666 (S.D.N.Y.), aff’d in part, rev’d in part 139 \n23  S. Ct. 2551 (2019)).  Similarly, in an opinion overturning the Administration’s decision to \n24  rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, the Ninth Circuit \n25  also distinguished Hawaii, citing, in part, “the physical presence of the plaintiffs within the \n26  geographic United States.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n27  908 F.3d 476, 519–20 (9th Cir. 2018), rev’d in part, vacated in part, 140 S. Ct. 1891 \n28  (2020) (citing Lopez-Valenzuela v. Arpaio, 770 F.3d 772, 781 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc)).  \n32 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 33 of 43\n \n1  As a counterexample, the district court in S.A. v. Trump, 363 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1094 \n2  (N.D. Cal. 2018), applied Hawaii to an Equal Protection challenge brought by plaintiffs \n3  residing in the United States against a policy prohibiting their family members from \n4  entering the United States.  These opinions represent instances where the scope of the \n5  challenged action could be cleanly divided: in the cases of TPS or DACA, the individuals \n6  were all within the United States; in S.A. the family members were attempting to enter the \n7  United States. \n8  Here, the Rule applies to immigrants and nonimmigrants seeking initial admission \n9  to the United States.  84 Fed. Reg. at 41,295.  It also applies to aliens who are already in \n10  the United States and are seeking adjustment of status.  Id.  Because the Rules applies \n11  in part to aliens who are already in the United States, defendants cannot entirely rely on \n  12  the plenary power doctrine to uphold the Rule.  Accordingly, the court proceeds to \n a\ntruin\noro 13  determine whether an alien inside the United States can state an Equal Protection claim. \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  2.  Constitutional Rights of Aliens Admitted to the United \niD tc 15  States \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  As Yamataya and similar cases demonstrate, persons within the United States can \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  assert at least some rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Early \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  cases only addressed whether persons had a procedural due process right to be heard \nN\n19  before the government imposed some legal action on them.  See, e.g., Wong Wing v. \n20  United States, 163 U.S. 228, 237 (1896) (“[T]o declare unlawful residence within the \n21  country to be an infamous crime, punishable by deprivation of liberty and property, would \n22  be to pass out of the sphere of constitutional legislation, unless provision were made that \n23  the fact of guilt should first be established by a judicial trial.”).  No procedural due process \n24  challenge is alleged here; rather, plaintiffs challenge the Rule on Equal Protection \n25  grounds.  The issue may be stated as whether Congress or the Executive may \n26  discriminate within different classes of aliens present in the United States based on the \n27  race or ethnicity of the aliens.   \n28  In Mathews v. Diaz, the Court indicated that the equal protection component of the \n33 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 34 of 43\n \n1  Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause extends to aliens who are physically present in \n2  the United States.  426 U.S. at 77 (“The Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth \n3  Amendment, protects every one of these persons from deprivation of life, liberty, or \n4  property without due process of law.”).  In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982) \n5  (citations omitted), the Court stated “[a]liens, even aliens whose presence in this country \n6  is unlawful, have long been recognized as ‘persons’ guaranteed due process of law by \n7  the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”  Then, the Court stated: “Indeed, we have clearly \n8  held that the Fifth Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful \n9  from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government.”  Id. (citing Mathews, 426 U.S. \n10  at 77).  Plyler’s holding only applied to a state’s classification of aliens rather than the \n11  federal government.  Yet, in a footnote, the Court stated “[i]t would be incongruous to \n  12  hold that the United States, to which the Constitution assigns a broad authority over both \n a\ntruin\noro 13  naturalization and foreign affairs, is barred from invidious discrimination with respect to \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  unlawful aliens, while exempting the States from a similar limitation.  Id. at 201 n.9 (citing \niD tc 15  Mathews, 426 U.S. at 84–86).  While dicta, these two cases suggest that the Supreme \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  Court would hold that aliens within the United States are protected by the equal \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  protection component of the Fifth Amendment. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  In a case closer to the question at issue here, in Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, \nN\n19  373 F.3d 952, 970–73 (9th Cir. 2004), the Ninth Circuit reviewed at length whether an \n20  alien who has not “entered” the United States for purposes of the INA but has physically \n21  entered the United States could state a discrimination claim under the equal protection \n22  component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The court held that non-\n23  admitted (but physically present) aliens were not precluded  \n \n24  from coming within the ambit of the equal protection component \nof the Due Process Clause.  We cannot countenance that the \n25  Constitution would permit immigration officials to engage in \nsuch behavior as rounding up all immigration parolees of a \n26  particular race solely because of a consideration such as skin \ncolor.    Although  “Congress  has  ‘plenary  power’  to  create \n27  immigration  law,  and . . .  the  judicial  branch  must  defer  to \nexecutive  and  legislative  branch  decisionmaking  in  that \n28  area, . . . .  that  power  is  subject  to  important  constitutional \n34 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 35 of 43\n \nlimitations.” \n1 \n2  Id. at 974 (alterations in original) (footnote omitted) (quoting Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. \n3  678, 695 (2001)).  Kwai Fun Wong distinguished initial entry cases on the grounds that \n4  those cases were determinative of “the procedural rights of aliens with respect to their \n5  applications for admission,” but initial entry cases have not been applied to “deny all \n6  constitutional rights to non-admitted aliens.”  Id. at 971.  If Kwai Fun Wong establishes \n7  that non-admitted, but physically present aliens can bring an Equal Protection challenge, \n8  then it follows that admitted aliens subject to the Rule (who are further from Congress’s \n9  plenary power) may also bring an Equal Protection challenge. \n10  Read together, Mathews, Plyler, and Kwai Fun Wong stand for the proposition that \n11  aliens who have been admitted to the United States are not precluded from bringing an \n  12  Equal Protection challenge on the theory that they were discriminated against on the \n a\ntruin\noro 13  basis of their race or ethnicity.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  3.  Resolving the Applicable Standard of Review \niD tc 15  Plaintiffs urge the court to apply the Arlington Heights inquiry to the Rule so that \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  they can assert an Equal Protection challenge on behalf of aliens who have been \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  admitted to the United States.  An important point is worth noting at this juncture: \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Arlington Heights did not address what level of scrutiny—i.e., strict scrutiny, heightened \nN\n19  scrutiny, or rational basis—a court should apply to an Equal Protection claim based on \n20  racial or ethnic discrimination.  Instead, Arlington Heights described a framework to \n21  “[d]etermin[e] whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor” by using \n22  “a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be \n23  available.”  429 U.S. at 266.  “Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required \n24  to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”  Id. at 265.  Conversely, if the \n25  government action in question only has a “racially disproportionate impact,” then it may \n26  not be unconstitutional.  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976).  Accordingly, if \n27  plaintiffs are able to demonstrate racial or ethnic discriminatory purpose to be a \n28  motivating factor of the Rule, then the court would apply a strict scrutiny standard of \n35 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 36 of 43\n \n1  review.   \n2  In Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, \n3  writing for a plurality with regard to the plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim, Chief Justice \n4  Roberts stated that “[t]o plead animus, a plaintiff must raise a plausible inference that an \n5  ‘invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor’ in the relevant decision.  \n6  Possible evidence includes disparate impact on a particular group, ‘[d]epartures from the \n7  normal procedural sequence,’ and ‘contemporary statements by members of the \n8  decisionmaking body.’”  140 S. Ct. at 1915 (second alteration in original) (quoting \n9  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68).  This indicates that application of the Arlington \n10  Heights framework is appropriate to evaluate whether plaintiffs plead discriminatory \n11  animus.  Further, the plurality sidestepped the issue of whether the Court’s opinion in \n  12  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 488 (1999), \n a\ntruin\noro 13  foreclosed a constitutional claim by an alien unlawfully present in the United States.  See \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  Because the court has likewise determined that Trump v. \niD tc 15  Hawaii (and the plenary power doctrine more generally) does not apply to the Rule in its \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  entirety, similar to Regents, it is appropriate to apply Arlington Heights in this instance. \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Several recent district court opinions have also applied the Arlington Heights \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  framework to evaluate whether the federal government acted with discriminatory purpose \nN\n19  despite a facially neutral action.  In Cook County, Illinois v. Wolf, No. 19 C 6334, 2020 \n20  WL 2542155, at *7 (N.D. Ill. May 19, 2020), the district court in the Northern District of \n21  Illinois declined to apply Hawaii and instead applied what the court described as \n22  “Arlington Heights-style strict scrutiny,” in evaluating a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ \n23  Equal Protection challenge to the Rule.  The court reasoned that in “contrast to the \n24  President’s national security and international relations justifications for the executive \n25  order in Hawaii, DHS justified and continues to justify the Final Rule solely on economic \n26  grounds.”  Id.; see also CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, 355 F. Supp. 3d 307, 312, 324 \n27  (D. Md. 2018) (declining to apply Hawaii and Mandel to an Equal Protection challenge \n28  against the federal government’s decision to TPS status for El Salvador).   \n36 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 37 of 43\n \n1  ii.  Whether Plaintiffs’ Allegations Plausibly State a Claim \n2  “Under Arlington Heights, a plaintiff must ‘simply produce direct or circumstantial \n3  evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely that [sic] not motivated \n4  the defendant and that the defendant’s actions adversely affected the plaintiff in some \n5  way.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., LLC v. City of Yuma, Ariz., 818 F.3d 493, 504 (9th Cir. 2016) \n6  (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pac. Shores Props., LLC v. City of Newport \n7  Beach, 730 F.3d 1142, 1158 (9th Cir. 2013)); see also Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.  “A \n8  plaintiff does not have to prove that the discriminatory purpose was the sole purpose of \n9  the challenged action, but only that it was a ‘motivating factor.’”  Ave. 6E Invs., (quoting \n10  Arce v. Douglas, 793 F.3d 968, 977 (9th Cir. 2015)).  While Arlington Heights describes \n11  an evidentiary framework rather than a pleading standard, the Ninth Circuit has used its \n  12  factors in evaluating a district court’s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).5  \n a\ntruin\noro 13  See id.   \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  In Arlington Heights, the Court described a series of non-exhaustive factors that \niD tc 15  guides the inquiry into whether a defendant’s actions were motivated by a discriminatory \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  purpose “by examining (1) statistics demonstrating a ‘clear pattern unexplainable on \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  grounds other than’ discriminatory ones, (2) ‘[t]he historical background of the decision,’ \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  (3) ‘[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,’ (4) the \nN\n19  defendant’s departures from its normal procedures or substantive conclusions, and (5) \n20  relevant ‘legislative or administrative history.’”  Pac. Shores Props., 730 F.3d at 1158–59 \n21  (alterations in original) (quoting Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266–68; and citing Comm. \n22 \n \n23 \n5 While not directly applicable to Equal Protection claims, the Supreme Court and the \nNinth Circuit have held that, for employment discrimination cases, the McDonnell \n24 \nDouglas evidentiary framework is a useful touchstone to evaluate whether a claim \nsurvives a motion to dismiss; however, a plaintiff “is not required to plead a prima facie \n25 \ncase of discrimination in order to survive a motion to dismiss.”  Sheppard v. David Evans \n& Assoc., 694 F.3d 1045, 1050 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 \n26 \nU.S. 506, 508–11 (2002)).  Similar to McDonnell Douglas, the Arlington Heights \nframework is an evidentiary burden-shifting regime.  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion only requires \n27 \nplaintiffs to meet the requirements of Rule 8 and Twombly/Iqbal.  See Kwai Fun Wong, \n373 F.3d at 968 (applying Swierkiewicz to Equal Protection claim that immigration \n28 \nofficials discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of her race). \n37 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 38 of 43\n \n1  Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, 703 (9th Cir. 2009)); \n2  see also Avenue 6E Invs., 818 F.3d at 504 (applying Arlington Heights factors to an \n3  Equal Protection claim dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)). \n4  1.  Disparate Impact \n5  Here, plaintiffs allege that the Rule is “more likely to prevent immigrants of color in \n6  the United States from adjusting their status, or extending or changing their visas, \n7  compared to their White immigrant counterparts.”  Compl. ¶ 107.  The complaint also \n8  cites the Rule, where DHS stated that it “recognizes that it is possible that the inclusion of \n9  benefits such as SNAP and Medicaid may impact in greater numbers communities of \n10  color, including Latinos and [Asian-American, Pacific Islanders], as well as those with \n11  particular medical conditions that require public benefits for treatment, and therefore may \n  12  impact the overall composition of immigration with respect to these groups.”  84 Fed. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Reg. at 41,369.  Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Rule will impact certain racial \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  groups more heavily than others. \niD tc 15  However, the court notes that the plurality opinion in Regents found that the \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  disparate impact of the DACA rescission on Latinos was not sufficient to state a claim.  \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  Writing for himself and three other justices, Chief Justice Roberts stated “because \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  Latinos make up a large share of the unauthorized alien population, one would expect \nN\n19  them to make up an outsized share of recipients of any cross-cutting immigration relief \n20  program. . . . Were this fact sufficient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable \n21  immigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds.”  Regents, 140 S. \n22  Ct. at 1915.  This reasoning is persuasive and the Rule’s disparate impact, while notable, \n23  is not dispositive. \n24  2.  Statements by Decisionmakers \n25  Next, plaintiffs cite evidence of potential bias exemplified by statements of the \n26  President and his advisors.  For example, as a candidate, President Trump called \n27  Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “people who have a lot of problems.”  Compl. ¶ 285.  \n28  After his inauguration, the President disparaged an immigration plan that would protect \n38 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 39 of 43\n \n1  people from El Salvador, Haiti, and African countries, asking, “Why are we having all \n2  these people from shithole countries come here?”  Id. ¶ 292.  Plaintiffs allege that the \n3  President was widely reported to have expressed his preference for more immigrants \n4  from places like Norway, where the population is over 90 percent white.  Id.  In May 2018, \n5  the President called immigrants “animals” during a public White House meeting.  Id. \n6  ¶ 294.  In addition to the President, plaintiffs allege that other senior administration \n7  officials made statements indicative of racial bias.  But they only offer one example; \n8  defendant Kenneth Cuccinelli is alleged to have stated that Washington, D.C.’s animal \n9  control policies were worse than U.S. immigration policies because, “You can’t break up \n10  rat families.”  Id. ¶ 299. \n11  Defendants contend that these statements were not made by DHS officials and \n  12  have no express connection to the Rule.  Mtn. at 21.  It is notable that one of the alleged \n a\ntruin\noro 13  statements is attributed to Kenneth Cuccinelli who is a named defendant in this case and \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  is alleged to be responsible for implementing and enforcing immigration laws.  Compl. \niD tc 15  ¶¶ 28, 299.  However, that is the only statement offered by plaintiffs made by a \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  decisionmaker who was directly involved in the Rule’s promulgation and it is not clearly \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  tied to the Rule.   \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  With regard to the President’s statements, in Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1916, Chief \nN\n19  Justice Roberts’ plurality opinion found the President’s statements as “unilluminating” and \n20  instead noted that “relevant actors were most directly [the] Acting Secretary [of Homeland \n21  Security] and the Attorney General.”  The opinion stated that “respondents did not \n22  ‘identif[y] statements by [either] that would give rise to an inference of discriminatory \n23  motive.’”  Id. (alterations in original) (citation omitted).  Next, Chief Justice Roberts found \n24  the President’s statements were “remote in time and made in unrelated contexts” and did \n25  not “qualify as ‘contemporary statements’ probative of the decision at issue.”  Id. (quoting \n26  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 268).  While a plurality opinion, this reasoning suggests \n27  that the President’s statements, which have no direct connection to the Rule are not \n28  relevant to the Equal Protection analysis.   \n39 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 40 of 43\n \n1  Applying here, plaintiffs allege both pre- and post-inauguration statements by the \n2  President.  The pre-inauguration statements, Compl. ¶¶ 285–87, are similar to those in \n3  Regents that are more remote in time and not applicable to the agency action at issue.  \n4  The post-inaugurations statements pertain to the same time period as the beginning of \n5  the rulemaking process but are not connected to the Rule.  The closest statement \n6  concerning an immigration plan was in reference to a draft plan that would have \n7  protected individuals with TPS status.  Id. ¶ 292.  In sum, plaintiffs have identified a few \n8  statements made in unrelated contexts by the President and only one comment from a \n9  DHS official that did not appear to have any connection to the Rule or the rulemaking \n10  process.  They have not alleged sufficient factual matter concerning statements by \n11  decisionmakers. \n  12  3.  Departure from Normal Procedures \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Plaintiffs also contend that the Rule departed from normal procedures as \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  evidenced by the efforts of White House advisor Stephen Miller’s comments to fast-track \niD tc 15  the Rule to completion.  Compl. ¶¶ 300–02.  Defendants assert that the text of the Rule \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  provides the most reliable indicia of its intent and contends that the Rule is devoid of any \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  discriminatory justifications.  Mtn. at 20.  They also argue that the proposed rule, \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  extensive notice and comment process, and changes from the proposed to final rules \nN\n19  undermine allegations of improper bias.  Id. at 20–21.   \n20  The text of the Rule, while a relevant factor, is not dispositive because the \n21  Arlington Heights analysis presumes that the official government action in question is \n22  facially neutral.  429 U.S. at 266 (“Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds \n23  other than race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing \n24  legislation appears neutral on its face.” (citations omitted)).   \n25  However, plaintiffs’ allegations barely raise an inference of an improper departure \n26  from the norm.  Cf. Regents, 908 F.3d at 519 (“DACA received reaffirmation by the \n27  agency as recently as three months before the rescission, only to be hurriedly cast aside \n28  on what seems to have been a contrived excuse (its purported illegality).  This strange \n40 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 41 of 43\n \n1  about-face, done at lightning speed, suggests that the normal care and consideration \n2  within the agency was bypassed.”).  Plaintiffs’ allegations that the Rule was fast tracked \n3  do not raise an inference of discriminatory intent.  This rulemaking process was not a 3-\n4  month about-face; the NPRM began a year before the final Rule was published.  At most, \n5  they plausibly allege that defendants wanted to implement the Rule sooner rather than \n6  later. \n7  In light of the foregoing, plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient factual matter to state \n8  a claim for an Equal Protection violation.  The court GRANTS defendants’ motion to \n9  dismiss plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action.  Because plaintiffs could allege additional factual \n10  matter, the dismissal is with leave to amend.6 \n11  iii.  Sixth Claim—Unconstitutional Animus \n  12  In a footnote, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ sixth claim should be dismissed \n a\ntruin\noro 13  because it fails to identify any protected class, rather, plaintiffs allege that the Rule was \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  adopted to harm a politically unpopular group.  Mtn. at 21 n.9.  In response, plaintiffs \niD tc 15  attempt to clarify the claim, stating that the sixth claim incorporates by reference plaintiffs’ \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  previous allegations including the allegation that the Rule is intended to target immigrants \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  of color.  Opp. at 22 n.10. \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  In their complaint, plaintiffs’ sixth claim incorporates by reference the allegations \nN\n19  set forth in the preceding paragraphs of the complaint.  Compl. ¶ 344.  The sixth claim \n20  goes on to allege that “[t]he classification here further violates equal protection principles \n21  because defendants adopted it to harm a politically unpopular group and advance \n22  unconstitutional animus, and therefore, it is without a permissible, rational basis.”  Id. \n23  ¶ 345.   \n24  It appears that plaintiffs are seeking to challenge the Rule under a heightened \n25 \n \n26 \n6 Other district courts have found that plaintiffs in those cases have alleged sufficient \nfactual allegations to state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection component of the \n27 \nFifth Amendment.  See New York, 2020 WL 4347264, at *6; Cook Cty., Ill., 2020 WL \n2542155, at *3–5.  These other cases suggest that plaintiffs could allege additional facts \n28 \nsuch that amendment of their complaint is not futile. \n41 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 42 of 43\n \n1  rational basis review.  In Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Wasden, the Ninth Circuit stated \n2  “[w]hen a law exhibits a desire to harm an unpopular group, courts will often apply a \n3  ‘more searching’ application of rational basis review.”  878 F.3d 1184, 1200 (9th Cir. \n4  2018) (quoting Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 580 (2003) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  \n5  However, the court indicated that this more searching review applies “[w]hen the \n6  politically unpopular group is not a traditionally suspect class.”  Id. (emphasis added)  \n7  There are two separate problems with the sixth claim.  First, the unpopular group \n8  referenced in paragraph 345 is non-White, non-European immigrants.  Opp. at 22 n.10.  \n9  Yet, plaintiffs’ framing of this group is based on the group’s racial and ethnic composition, \n10  a traditionally suspect class.  See Compl. ¶ 305 (“The Administration has identified a \n11  politically unpopular minority, namely non-White, non-European immigrants . . . .”).  Thus, \n  12  the more searching rational basis of review is not available to them. \n a\ntruin\noro 13  Second, the factual allegations for the fifth and sixth claims are the same.  \nCf\n tila\ncirtsC fo 14  Assuming plaintiffs are able to state a claim for violation of the Equal Protection \niD tc 15  component of the Fifth Amendment in a future amended complaint, the court would then \n sir\net\ns\ntaiD 16  determine whether the group is is a traditionally suspect class and what level of scrutiny \nt\nS \nn\n dre 17  applies to that group.  See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439–42 (describing standards of review \ne\nh\nt\nintr\nUo 18  applicable to an Equal Protection clause challenge).  For that reason, plaintiffs’ sixth \nN\n19  claim is entirely duplicative of their fifth claim because it involves the same facts and \n20  requested relief. \n21  Accordingly, the court GRANTS defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ sixth \n22  cause of action.  Because the claim is duplicative of plaintiffs’ fifth claim, the dismissal is \n23  without leave to amend. \n24  CONCLUSION \n25  For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES defendants’ motion to dismiss with \n26  respect to their standing, ripeness, and zone of interest challenges.  Defendants’ motion \n27  to dismiss plaintiffs’ second cause of action for violation of the APA, contrary to the \n28  Rehabilitation Act, is GRANTED, and the claim is DISMISSED WITHOUT LEAVE TO \n42 \n\nCase 4:19-cv-04975-PJH   Document 180   Filed 08/03/20   Page 43 of 43\n \n1  AMEND; defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ third cause of action for violation of the \n2  APA, contrary to State Healthcare Discretion, is GRANTED, and the claim is DISMISSED \n3  WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND; defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ fifth cause of \n4  action for violation of the Fifth Amendment is GRANTED, and the claim is DISMISSED \n5  WITH LEAVE TO AMEND; and defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ sixth cause of \n6  action for violation of the Fifth Amendment is GRANTED, and the claim is DISMISSED \n7  WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  Further, the court DEFERS RULING ON defendants’ \n8  motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ first and fourth causes of action.7  Plaintiffs will be permitted \n9  to file an amended complaint after resolution of the deferred claims. \n10    IT IS SO ORDERED. \n11  Dated: August 3, 2020 \n  12  /s/ Phyllis J.

CITY AND COUNTY  \nOF SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, ET  AL. \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \nAPPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT  \n[June 15, 2022] \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE  THOMAS,  \nJUSTICE ALITO, and JUSTICE GORSUCH join, concurring.  \n  This  case  involves  a  regulation  known  as  the  Public \nCharge Rule, promulgated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in 2019.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 41292 (2019).  The Rule \nset out the test the Department planned to use to determine \nwhether an applicant for admission into the country or ad-\njustment to lawful permanent resident status is “likely at \nany time to become a public charge,” which would make him  \nineligible.  8 U. S. C. §1182(a)(4)(A).  Several parties filed \nlawsuits arguing that the Rule was unlawful because it de-\nfined “public charge” too broadly. \n  We granted certiorari in this case not to address the mer-\nits of that argument, but to decide whether the petition-\ners—13 States which support the Rule—should have been \npermitted to intervene in this litigation to defend the Rule’s\nlegality in the Court of Appeals. Petitioners argue that the \nanswer is yes, in light of the Government’s actions. \n  When this and other suits challenging the Rule were first \nbrought in 2019, the Government defended it.  And when  \nmultiple lower courts, including the District Court here,  \nfound the Rule unlawful, the Government appealed those\ndecisions.  After a change in administrations, though, the \nGovernment reversed course and opted to voluntarily dis-\n \n\n2  ARIZONA v.  CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO \n   \nROBERTS,  C.  J., concurring  \nmiss those appeals, leaving in place the relief already en-\ntered. \n  A new administration is of course as a general matter en-\ntitled to do that.  But the Government then took a further  \nstep.  It seized upon one of the now-consent judgments\nagainst it—a final judgment vacating the Rule nationwide, \nissued in a different litigation—and leveraged it as a basis \nto immediately repeal the Rule, without using notice-and-\ncomment procedures.  86 Fed. Reg. 14221 (2021) (“Because \nthis rule simply implements the district court’s vacatur of \nthe August 2019 rule . . . DHS is not required to provide  \nnotice and comment.”). This allowed the Government to cir-\ncumvent the usual and important requirement, under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, that a regulation originally \npromulgated  using  notice  and  comment  (as  the  Public \nCharge Rule was) may only be repealed through notice and \ncomment, 5 U. S. C. §551(5); see Perez v. Mortgage Bankers  \nAssn., 575 U. S. 92, 101 (2015).  As part of this tactic of \n“rulemaking-by-collective-acquiescence,” City and County  \nof San Francisco v. United States Citizenship and Immigra-\ntion Servs., 992 F. 3d 742, 744 (CA9 2021) (VanDyke, J., \ndissenting), the Government successfully opposed efforts by \nother interested parties—including petitioners here—to in-\ntervene in order to carry on the defense of the  Rule, includ-\ning possibly before this Court. \n  These maneuvers raise a host of important questions.  \nThe most fundamental is whether the Government’s ac-\ntions, all told, comport with the principles of administrative \nlaw.  But bound up in that inquiry are a great many issues \nbeyond the question of appellate intervention on which we \ngranted certiorari, among them standing; mootness; vaca-\ntur under United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36  \n(1950); the scope of injunctive relief in an APA action;  \nwhether, contrary to what “[t]he government has long ar-\ngued,” the APA “authorize[s] district courts to vacate regu-\nlations or other agency actions on a nationwide basis,” Brief \n \n\n  Cite as:  596 U. S. ____ (2022)  3 \n \nROBERTS,  C.  J., concurring  \nfor Federal Respondents 5, n. 3; how the APA’s procedural \nrequirements  apply  in  this  unusual  circumstance,  cf.  \n§551(5); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,  \n515 (2009); and more.\n  It has become clear that this mare’s nest could stand in  \nthe way of our reaching the question presented on which we \ngranted certiorari, or at the very least, complicate our reso-\nlution of that question.  I therefore concur in the Court’s \ndismissal of the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  \nBut that resolution should not be taken as reflective of a  \nview on any of the foregoing issues, or on the appropriate \nresolution of other litigation, pending or future, related to \nthe 2019 Public Charge Rule, its repeal, or its replacement \nby a new rule.  See Cook County v.  Mayorkas, 340 F. R. D.  \n35 (ND Ill. 2021), appeal pending, No. 21–2561 (CA7); 87 \nFed. Reg. 10571 (2022) (new proposed rule that would “im-\nplement a different policy than the 2019 Final Rule”). \n ",
