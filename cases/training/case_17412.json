    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. District court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule but after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule.</p><p><u>Maryland Coalition Sues Over the Public Charge Rule</u></p><p>On September 27, 2019, a coalition \"comprised by local governments, an elected representative, and a number of non-profit and faith-based agencies providing legal and social services to immigrant populations and their families,\" filed this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the City of Baltimore Department of Law, sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary, in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs sought declaration that the Department of Homeland Security’s <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-17142/inadmissibility-on-public-charge- grounds\">Final Rule</a> (the Rule) violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment and an order setting it aside. The plaintiffs also sought injunctive relief enjoining the defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule. The case was assigned to Judge Peter J. Messitte. </p><p>On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a revised, final public charge rule, which defines personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increases the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is “inadmissible.” Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid, or is deemed likely to receive them in the future, may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. According to a New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/immigration-public-charge-injunction.html\">article</a>, the new standards would directly affect about 1.2 million applicants annually, primarily immigrants from Africa and Latin America. The rule was initially set to be implemented on October 15, 2019.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that the Rule was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA, because the defendants failed to provide adequate justification for the change, utilized a \"patently inadequate cost-benefit analysis\" in promulgating the Rule, and disregarded facts and evidence. The plaintiffs also asserted that the Rule denied the constitutional right to equal protection of the laws because a discriminatory purpose was the motivating factor in promulgating the Rule. Moreover, the plaintiffs contended that the Rule will cause actual suffering by producing a chilling effect that discourages eligible members from utilizing public benefits and requiring plaintiffs to allocate significant resources to combat this chilling effect. </p><p><u>Case is Deferred, Related to Another Case, then Reassigned</u></p><p>On October 15, 2019, Judge Messitte entered an order deferring ruling on the complaint. Judge Messitte considered the nationwide preliminary injunctions enjoining defendants from implementing and enforcing the Rule instituted by district courts in New York (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\"><i>State of New York v. DHS</i></a>) and Washington (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17290\"><i>State of Washington v. DHS</i></a>) and concluded that there was not a \"need at present to enter into yet another consideration of the relief sought by Plaintiffs in this case.\" </p><p>On December 3, 2019, the parties filed a joint notice of related case, asserting that the current case is related to (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17411\"><i>Casa de Maryland v. Trump</i></a>) and requesting that the case be transferred to Judge Paul J. Grimm for concurrent adjudication. The parties contended that that \"the two cases 'arise from the same or identical transaction, happenings, or events,' that they involve identical defendants, and that hearing them separately 'would entail substantial duplication of labor if heard by different judges.'” In that case, Judge Grimm had issued an order for a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from implementing or enforcing the Rule. The cases were ordered related and the current case reassigned to Judge Grimm on December 6.</p><p>The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 3, 2020, in which they asserted the same causes of actions, claims for relief, and requests for relief. However, the amended complaint removed the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore as a plaintiff. On the same day, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore was added as a plaintiff in an amended complaint in <i>Casa de Maryland</i>.</p><p><u>The Supreme Court Stays All Nationwide Injunctions Enjoining Implementation of the Public Charge Rule</u></p><p>On January 27, 2020, the Supreme Court issued orders staying a nationwide injunction in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\"><i>State of New York v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</i></a> and an injunction for the State of Illinois in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17408\"><i>Cook County, Illinois v. Wolf</i></a>. Following these decisions, the defendants indicated that the Rule would be implemented and enforced starting February 24, 2020.</p><p><u>District Court Stays Discovery Pending Motion to Dismiss</u></p><p>On March 17, 2020, Judge Grimm issued an order granting the defendants' motion to stay \"proceedings related to discovery and completion of the administrative record,\" but ordered the parties to continue with the motion to dismiss briefing.</p><p>On May 27, defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint. Defendants asserted that the complaint should be dismissed in full \"[i]n light of the Supreme Court’s repeated stays of injunction, the Ninth Circuit’s detailed opinion on the Rule’s legality,\" and because the Rule does not violate the due process or equal protection clauses.</p><p><u>The Fourth Circuit Reverses Judge Grimm's October 15, 2019 Nationwide Preliminary Injunction</u></p><p>On August 5, a split Fourth Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Harvie Wilkinson III, Paul Niemeyer, and Robert King) issued an order and opinion denying the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction from the related case <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17411\"><i>Casa de Maryland v. Trump</i></a>. 971 F.3d 220. Writing for the majority, Judge Wilkinson held that Casa lacked standing; that the plaintiffs were unlikely to win on the merits of their claims because the Rule was a permissible interpretation of \"public charge;\" and that a nationwide injunction was an overly broad remedy.</p><p>Judge King dissented. Citing a decision of the Seventh Circuit two months prior (962 F.3d 208), he disagreed on all points. He would have held that plaintiffs <i>did</i> have standing; that the plaintiffs <i>were</i> likely to win on the merits because the Rule was not a permissible interpretation of \"public charge\" given the statute and history; and that a nationwide injunction was an appropriate remedy given the circumstances.</p><p>In light of this decision, back in the district court, Judge Grimm back issued an order on August 7, directing the parties to supplement their briefings on the pending motion to dismiss.</p><p><u>The Reversal is Stayed Pending a Rehearing en banc</u> </p><p>On September 15, the Fourth Circuit's order was stayed pending ruling on a petition to rehear the case en banc. That petition was granted on December 3, 2020, and oral arguments were scheduled to begin in March 2021.</p><p><u>President Biden Issues Executive Order to Review the Public Charge Rule</u></p><p>On February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. The parties began conferring to determine how this would impact the litigation.</p><p>On March 1, 2021, the District Court denied the government's motion to dismiss without prejudice, noting that the motion would be subject to reinstatement once the administration reviewed the rule.</p><p><u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u></p><p>On March 9, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule\">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>. The government voluntarily dismissed its appeal to the Seventh Circuit, lifting the stay of the Northern District of Illinois' November 2, 2020 decision that vacates the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17408\"><i>Cook County v. Wolf</i></a>). That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition for <i>Cook County</i>, as well as similar petitions for the Ninth (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409\"><i>City  and County of San Francisco v. USCIS</i></a>) and Second (<a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287\"><i>New York v. DHS</i></a>) Circuits.</p><p>On March 11, the Fourth Circuit issued an order granting the government's voluntary dismissal of its appeal. That same day, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants. They also moved to reconsider the dismissal. They filed similar intervention motions in the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf\">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <i>Cook County</i>.</p><p>The Fourth Circuit denied the motion to intervene, as well as the motion to reconsider, on March 18.</p><p>As of April 15, 2021, the case is ongoing.</p>",

Reg. 41,282, among other relief sought.  Defendants have \nnot yet appeared in the case.  In the meantime, other cases have gone forward, including Casa De \nMaryland,  Inc.  eta/ v.

This is particularly true given that the nationwide Preliminary Injunction issued in the \ncase before Judge Peterson in the Eastern District of Washington is one in which the State of \nMaryland is a Plaintiff.1  Therefore, pending further order, the Court will DEFER ruling on the \nComplaint. \nDespite the informal nature of this ruling, it shall constitute an Order of the Court and the Clerk is \ndirected to docket it accordingly. \nlsi \nP  TER J.

In the fall of 2018, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) proposed \na  new  set  of  regulations  that,  by  the  agency’s  own  account,  would  make  it \nsubstantially more difficult for lawful immigrants to qualify for permanent legal \nresident status.3 The new rules are designed to expand the universe of persons the \n2 Wolf is being substituted automatically, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d) for the originally-\nnamed defendant, Kevin K. McAleenan. \n3 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114-01, 51,198, to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, \n213, 214, 245, and 248) (Oct. 10, 2018).   \n2 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 3 of 68\nagency may permissibly characterize as likely to become “public charges” and thus \nineligible to become permanent legal residents. Departing from more than a century \nof judicial precedent, as well as the agency’s own decades-long interpretation and \npractices, the new rule would label not only the destitute (such as those entirely or  \nprimarily reliant on government cash assistance) as persons likely to become \n“public charges,” but, for the first time would also label as public charges millions \nof immigrants holding down full time, but low-paying, jobs. This rule would treat \na lawful immigrant’s receipt of even nominal annual levels of non-cash assistance \n– in Defendant’s words “hundreds of dollars, or less, in public benefits annually”4\n(such as rental vouchers, medical services or food) – for periods as short as four \nmonths as a “heavily-weighted” negative factor in that individual’s application for \npermanent residence status, even where the individual is fully-employed. \n2. DHS received over a quarter million public comments  that the agency itself \ncharacterized as overwhelmingly opposed to the proposed rule. Yet, the agency’s \nfinal rule actually makes it even harder for lawful immigrants to qualify for \npermanent legal residence than the proposed rule. See Inadmissibility on Public \nCharge Grounds, Final Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. (“FR”) 41282 (Aug. 14, 2019) (“Public \nCharge Rule” or “Rule”). The Rule violates the Administrative Procedures Act and \nshould be vacated for several reasons: 1) it adopts a definition of “public charge” \nthat is contrary to law, (2) it lacks an adequate—or in several respects, any—\njustification and the stated justification is contrary to the evidence; 3) it overrides \nlongstanding  agency  interpretation  and  policy  on  which  substantial  reliance \n4 84 FR 41361 (emphasis added).\n3 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 4 of 68\ninterests have developed, without adequate evidence to establish the need for the \nchange; 4) DHS failed to perform an adequate cost-benefit analysis, and it failed to \naddress substantive comments concerning the harms the Rule will cause; 5) DHS \nfailed to follow notice and comment procedures by publishing a final Rule which \nwas  substantively  different  from  the  Proposed  Rule,  without  providing  an \nopportunity for public comment on the substantively different changes in the new \nRule; and 6) it is motivated by race, ethnic, and national origin bias in violation of \nthe constitutional right to equal protection. \n3. The Public Charge Rule makes dramatic changes to immigration policy that are \ndesigned to reduce legal immigration levels and to disfavor poorer immigrants and \nimmigrants of color. Initially DHS ticked off the boxes for notice and comment by \nissuing a notice-and-comment proposed rule, but it flouted the intent of this process \nby relying on racial, ethnic, and national origin bias, while ignoring the actual \nevidence, including that presented in public comments, and then promulgating a \nfinal rule that was substantively different from the proposed rule. Predictably, the \nresult is illogical. DHS’s stated objective—to ensure that immigrants  granted \npermanent legal status do not become a burden on taxpayers—runs directly counter \nto the evidence of its impact. The federal government’s own studies show that new \nimmigrants are more likely than the U.S. born population to join and stay in the \nworkforce, and thus to pay taxes. Data from the government’s own Census Bureau \nindicates that the Rule will increase, not decrease, the overall burden on taxpayers. \nWith a declining birthrate among native born Americans, an increasing flow of \nimmigrants is needed simply to replace those who leave the workforce through \n4 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 5 of 68\ndeath or retirement. By reducing the level of legal immigration (and thus the size \nof the national workforce), the Public Charge Rule will place an even greater \nburden on the declining number of tax-paying native-born Americans still in the \nworkforce to support those dependent on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and \na variety of other government services.5 Thus, the Public Charge Rule is worse than \na solution in search of a problem. It is a problem, in and of itself. \n4. Plaintiffs are a broad-based coalition comprised by a local government, an elected \nrepresentative, and a number of non-profit and faith-based agencies providing legal \nand social services to immigrant populations and their families. Plaintiffs, the \nconstituents they serve and the communities they represent will suffer actual injury \nas a result of the Public Charge Rule. The Public Charge Rule will place a greater \nburden on health care, food security, housing assistance and other services Plaintiffs \nprovide to immigrants. Immigrants and their citizen family members, afraid of \nbeing designated public charges and jeopardizing legal status, will disenroll from \nor forgo participation in federal nutrition, health care and housing programs to \nwhich they are lawfully entitled. This will place a greater burden not only on non-\nprofit social service agencies, but also on state, local and county government \nassistance  programs.  In  addition,  when  immigrants  and  their  citizen  family \nmembers withdraw altogether from government assistance programs, including \nthose provided by Gaithersburg, public health and safety and general welfare is \nharmed. And, as the Public Charge Rule reduces the pool of immigrant workers, \n5 Comments of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, et al. (filed December 10, 2018), pp. \n10-14, https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-47454.  \n5 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 6 of 68\nsocial service agencies that employ immigrants as direct care workers will both find \nit harder to secure and retain employees and face upward pressure on their costs.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this case \narises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n6. This Court has authority to grant the requested declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202. Publication of the Public Charge Rule in the \nFederal Register, 84 Fed. Reg. (“FR”) 41282 (Aug. 14, 2019), constitutes final \nagency action and thus is reviewable by this Court. 5 U.S.C. §§ 704 and 706. \n7. Venue is appropriate in this district because Defendants are United States agencies \nor  officers  sued  in  their  official  capacities,  because  this  district  is  where  a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2), (e)(1), and because Plaintiffs Gaithersburg, State Senator Jeff \nWaldstreciher,  and  the  Jewish  Community  Relations  Council  of  Greater \nWashington reside and provide services in this district. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). \nPARTIES \n8. Plaintiff the City of Gaithersburg, Maryland (“Gaithersburg”) is the fourth largest \nincorporated city in the state of Maryland, with a population of about 70,000, nearly \n40% of whom are foreign-born. Gaithersburg’s Community Services Division \nimplements  and  supports  assistance  programs  encompassing  interim  case \nmanagement,  community  outreach,  education,  housing  counseling,  financial \nwellness, emergency assistance and safety-net services, and it provides resources \nand referrals to Gaithersburg residents in need. The Division of Housing and \nCommunity Development maintains comprehensive housing policies and programs \n6 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 7 of 68\nthat provide fair, affordable options in homeownership and rental opportunities. \nHousing programs administered by Gaithersburg include closing cost and down \npayment assistance for first-time homebuyers and deferred loans for homeowners \nand qualified tenants who wish to make their homes accessible for anyone with a \ndisability. The Homeless Services Division is responsible for homeless advocacy, \ncommunity education on homelessness, outreach services, housing, and linking \nhomeless individuals to needed services. Gaithersburg and its community partners \noffer a number of programs and services to ensure that those facing hunger have \naccess to healthy foods throughout the year, including the Student Supper Program, \nthrough which the City of Gaithersburg Olde Towne Youth Center provides free, \nnutritious  suppers to children ages 18 and under. Gaithersburg  also  provides \ninformation, referrals and navigation assistance for a myriad of services offered by \nlocal, federal and state agencies, and nonprofit organizations, including in the areas \nof immigration, housing, health, and mental health. \n9. The Public Charge Rule is harming Gaithersburg by creating uncertainty about \nimmigrant eligibility for permanent residence status and causing immigrants and \ntheir family members to forgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. As a \nresult, immigrants and their families will increasingly rely on City-run health, \nnutritional,  homelessness  and  social  service  programs,  as  well  as  on  similar \nprograms operated by non-profit organizations that receive City funds. This will \nput a strain on and divert Gaithersburg’s resources from other priorities and, \nbecause many resident may forgo use of public benefits altogether, the Public \nCharge Rule will adversely affect the health of Gaithersburg’s residents. The \n7 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 8 of 68\nimmigrant residents and their family members within Gaithersburg face significant \nobstacles in bringing this suit on their own, “as they may hold a credible fear that \nsuing the federal government would torpedo” their chances or the chances of their \nfamily members to obtain permanent residence status. See Mayor and City Council \nof Baltimore v. Trump, et al, Case 1:18-cv-3636-ELH, 2019 WL 4598011, at *18 \n(D. Md. September 20, 2019). \n10. Plaintiff  Maryland  State  Senator  Jeffrey  D.  Waldstreicher  (“State  Senator \nWaldstreicher”) serves Maryland District 18, which is home to about 120,000 \npersons, about one third of whom are foreign born. Twenty-five percent of District \n18 identifies as Hispanic, making it the largest population of Hispanic residents in \nMontgomery County and the second largest population of Hispanic residents in the \nstate.  \n11. The Public Charge Rule is impeding State Senator Waldstreicher’s  ability to \nsafeguard the health and wellbeing of his constituents by causing immigrants and \ntheir family members to forgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. As a \nresult, to the extent immigrants and their families continue to access government \nbenefits at all, they will increasingly rely on state-run health, nutritional, and social \nservice  programs,  as  well  as  on  similar  programs  operated  by  non-profit \norganizations that receive state funds. The Public Charge Rule has also had and will \ncontinue to have a chilling effect and significant negative impact on public health \nin in his district. Like the immigrant residents of Gaithersburg, the immigrant \nresidents and their family members within Senator Walstreicher’s district face \nsignificant obstacles in bringing this suit on their own, “as they may hold a credible \n8 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 9 of 68\nfear that suing the federal government would torpedo” their chances or the chances \nof their family members to obtain permanent residence status. Mayor and City \nCouncil of Baltimore v. Trump, supra. \n12. Plaintiff Friends of Immigrants (“FOI”) is a volunteer organization based in Red \nWing,  Goodhue  County,  Minnesota.  FOI  publicly  supports  immigrants  and \nrecognizes  their  economic,  cultural,  social,  and  individual  importance  in  the \nGoodhue County community. Among its functions, FOI supports immigrants in \nnavigating local resources to obtain the benefits to which they are entitled. FOI also \nacts to promote immigrants’ rights more generally. \n13. The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm FOI by straining its \nresources to help immigrants become fully integrated into the community. The \nRule’s adverse impacts are already being felt, as persons who would otherwise \nqualify for benefits that would help them fully participate in the community are \ndisenrolling or choosing to forgo these benefits out of fear of that it will impact \ntheir efforts to become legal residents or citizens. As a result, FOI must divert \nresources  from  its  existing  programs  to  educate  and  to  assist  immigrants  in \nnavigating the new rules. \n14. Plaintiff Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota (“ILCM”) enhances opportunities for \nimmigrants and refugees through legal representation for low-income individuals, \nand through education and advocacy with diverse communities. ILCM serves \nimmigrants and refugees residing in the state of Minnesota who earn less than 187.5 \npercent of federal poverty guidelines. In 2018, ILCM served clients coming from \n112 countries, with 36 percent of ILCM cases originating from Mexico, 19 percent \n9 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 10 of 68\nfrom countries in Central and South America, 20 percent from countries in Asia, \n20 percent from countries in Africa, and the remaining 5 percent from countries in \nEurope, Oceania, and from Canada. \n15. ILCM provides a wide range of legal services to low-income immigrants and \nrefugees, including: \n Assisting  clients  in  preparing  and  presenting  citizenship  applications,  and  in \npassing exams; reuniting families by helping citizens and permanent residents to \npetition for family members abroad; keeping families together through family \npetitions; and preventing the separation of families by providing representation for \npersons in removal proceedings; \n Assisting families and individuals in filing asylum applications; assisting battered \nimmigrant women and children in filing Violence against Women Act petitions; \nassisting victims of serious crimes in obtaining U-Visas; \n Providing  legal  representation  for  young  immigrants  through  its  DREAMers \nImmigration Project; \n Pursuing judicial appeals to vindicate the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of \nimmigrants; \n Advocating for fair and comprehensive immigration reform; and \n Educating  immigrants,  professionals,  and  the  general  community  about \nimmigration and the issues faced by immigrants and refugees. \n16. Since its beginning, ILCM has assisted tens of thousands of immigrants to secure \nlegal status in the United States and to overcome the challenges of obtaining work \nauthorization and citizenship. In 2018, ILCM provided legal services in 4,270 \n10 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 11 of 68\nunique  cases  with  clients  from  112  countries.  It  reached  more  than  5,400 \nindividuals  through  more  than  130  education  and  advocacy  presentations,  in \naddition to numerous appearances on radio and television. Its services help break \ndown barriers and make meaningful improvements to immigrant families’ lives, \nallowing them a safe and sustainable future in Minnesota. \n17. The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm to ILCM. ILCM’s \nmission of advocating for the rights of low-income immigrant communities is \ninseparable from the interests of its clients in not being denied admission or \nadjustment of their immigration status, in receiving vital public benefits, and in \nmaintaining  family  integrity  and  unity.  Defendants’  actions  have  caused  the \norganization to divert resources to educate its staff on the new Public Charge Rule. \nIn August 2019 alone, ILCM’s staff spent considerable amounts of time away from \nnormal duties learning the intricacies of the new Rule, interacting with partners at \nvarious legal aid organizations, organizing educational materials, planning training \nsessions and community information options in case the Rule goes into effect, and \nmeeting with community partners who are concerned about both the Public Charge \nRule’s adverse actual and chilling effects for immigrants. \n18. Defendants’ actions also will cause ILCM’s staff to spend additional time with each \nclient, thus diverting additional resources from the organization, to educate them \nabout the Rule, to address the modified “totality of the circumstances” factors as \napplied  to  each  client’s  situation,  to  document  the  new  form  I-944,  and  to \ndemonstrate why the client is not likely to become a public charge under the newly \nadopted definition. Because ILCM’s staff currently operates at capacity and has a \n11 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 12 of 68\nwaitlist of potential new clients, these extra hours will create significant delays and \notherwise strain ILCM’s limited resources. Because most of ILCM’s budget comes \nfrom grants, because ILCM only has one current grant to assist with immigration \nthrough family-based visas, and only for clients who live in three designated \ncounties, any other services ILCM offers to assist with family-based immigration \nare unfunded and divert staff away from funded case priorities.  If ILCM fails to \nmeet its obligations under a grant, ILCM puts its relationship with those funders at \nrisk for future projects. \n19. Beside the adverse impact on ILCM’s resources in dealing with potential and \naccepted cases, a further strain on its resources has already occurred and will \ncontinue in educating clients who are not subject to the Public Charge Rule, but are \nnonetheless fearful about their status if they obtain public benefits for themselves \nor  their  children.  Another  strain  resulting  from  the  Rule  concerns  ILCM’s \ninteractions with various state and private organizations that work with refugees \nwith health issues or who have suffered domestic violence, either in the form of \nindividual consultations with ILCM on behalf of their clients or through ILCM-led \nstaff trainings on the new Public Charge Rule.

Among its other work, the JCRC has a long history of advocacy and \ncommunity engagement on public policy issues directly impacting local refugee \nand immigrant populations. As an outgrowth of American Jews’ history as an \nimmigrant population fleeing devastating persecution and poverty, the Jewish \ncommunity has consistently championed the rights of refugees and immigrants to \nbe treated with fairness and compassion as they seek safety and security in the \nUnited States. \n21. Over the last two years JCRC has partnered with organizations such as HIAS, \nCASA, and VACALAO to: (1) support legislation that protects immigrant and \nrefugee populations and the agencies that serve them; (2) mobilize Jewish lawyers \nto  provide  pro  bono  assistance  to  immigrants  pursuing  naturalization;  and \n(3) sponsor programming highlighting our community’s moral commitment to the \ncore American value of being a welcoming society for all. JCRC’s members \ninclude: \n The Jewish Social Service Agency (“JSSA”), which provides social services \nincluding  meals,  counseling,  immigration  resettlement,  early  childhood \nservices, home care services for senior citizens, services for individuals with \nspecial needs, and health care to community members. JSSA staff includes \nhome care service workers, many of whom are foreign born and who rely on \nnon-cash assistance. \n13 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 14 of 68\n The  Jewish  Foundation  for  Group  Homes  (“JFGH”),  which  provides \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and/or chronic mental disorders \nwith the opportunity to live independently within the community with dignity, \npersonal choice and respect regardless of faith or creed.

JCA’s  Senior  Community  Service  Employment \n(“SCSEP”) provides on-the-job training for low income job seekers age 55+ in \nMontgomery and Frederick Counties. In addition, the program helps to staff \nWorkSource Montgomery’s American Job Center in Wheaton by providing a \npart-time, onsite specialist on older workers. SCSEP serves 48-75 interns in any \ngiven week, 50 percent of whom are foreign born. Their homelands include \nPeru, Ghana, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Iran, and Panama. JCA staff includes home care \nservice workers, many of whom are foreign born and who rely on non-cash \nassistance. \n The Greater Washington Jewish Coalition Against Domestic Abuse (JCADA) \nprovides  counseling,  victim  advocacy/case  management,  and/or  legal \nrepresentation in protective orders to survivors of power-based violence --\ndomestic violence (also known as intimate partner violence), dating violence, \n14 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 15 of 68\nelder abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and stalking.  Many of JCADA’s \nclients are immigrants leaving not only violent, but economically abusive \nrelationships. \n22. The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm JCRC and its \nmembers,  as  it  creates  uncertainty  about  immigrant  eligibility  for  permanent \nresidence status and causes immigrants and their family members to forgo federal \nassistance to which they are entitled. As a result, immigrants and their families will \nincreasingly rely on JCRC’s and its members’ programs for assistance in navigating \nthis new terrain. Home care agencies and nursing facilities like those operated by \nJCRC  member  agencies  report  “a  growing  shortage  of  aides,  thanks  to  a \ncombination of low wages, a strong economy, and past curbs on immigration. The \nmarket is so tight that some agencies are requiring their workers to sign non-\ncompete agreements to prevent them from moving to competitors or working \ndirectly for their clients.”6\n23. “And the shortage will only get worse as the Baby Boomers age. According to \nCareerCast, Americans will require a half-million more home health aides and \n750,000 more personal care aides by 2025.”7  “According to Robert Espinoza of \nthe Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute (PHI), about one-quarter of the nation’s 4 \nmillion direct care workers are immigrants. Because their wages are so low, about \n43% of these immigrant workers access some public benefits.” Two thirds of these \n6 Howard Gleckman, How Frail Elders will Pay For Trump’s New Anti-Immigrant Rules, \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2019/08/12/how-frail-elders-will-pay-for-\ntrumps-new-anti-immigrant-rules/#3ddaa04d5b44.

And some will, as the Administration intends, \navoid coming to the U.S.”10 And that “will dramatically shrink the workforce \navailable to assist frail elders and younger people with disabilities,”11 harming \nJCRC members in their ability to provide quality care both by limiting the pool of \navailable employees and putting upward pressure on labor costs.  \n25.

JCPA’s mandate is to advocate for a just and pluralistic \nAmerican society, Israel’s quest for peace and security, and human rights around \nthe world. In this regard, and relevant to the Public Charge Rule, it has adopted \npolicies (1) to combat stereotypes about immigrants, (2) to maintain support for fair \nand generous immigration policies as an expression of our country’s core values of \n8 Id.\n9 Id.\n10 Id. \n11 Id.\n16 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 17 of 68\nrefugee protection, family reunification and economic opportunity and (3) to work \nto ensure that those seeking to enter the country legally with the intention to settle \nhere permanently are afforded a reasonable, effective, and judicious process, and \nthat a rational and timely mechanism be developed to establish immigrants’ status. \n26. JCPA’s Local Member Agencies are 125 Jewish Community Relations Councils or \nCommittees  (“JCRCs”)  around  the  country.  Some  are  independent  agencies \naffiliated with local Jewish Federations, while others are integrated within the local \nJewish Federations. Both the local Jewish Federations and the independent JCRCs \nare themselves umbrella organizations whose member organizations (1) provide \nsocial services on a non-sectarian basis to members of their communities, including \nimmigrants and their family members, and (2) rely upon immigrants to staff many \nof their programs. \n27. The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm the JCPA and its \nmembers  by  creating  uncertainty  about  immigrant  eligibility  for  permanent \nresidence status and causing immigrants and their family members to forgo federal \nassistance to which they are entitled. As a result, immigrants and their families will \nincreasingly rely on JCPA member-run programs for assistance in navigating the \nnew  terrain.  The  costs  to  run  these  programs  will  increase  as  discussed  in \nParagraphs 20-24 of this complaint. \n28. Plaintiff Tzedek DC provides pro bono legal assistance and advocacy services to \nsafeguard the legal rights of low-income DC residents dealing with often unjust, \nabusive, and illegal debt collection practices, as well as other consumer protection \nproblems like credit reporting issues, identity theft, and predatory lending. Tzedek \n17 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 18 of 68\nDC provides low-income members of the community, including immigrants, direct \nfree legal services. Tzedek DC also provides systemic and policy advocacy on \nbehalf  of  client  communities,  and,  in  concert  with  its  community  partners, \npreventative financial empowerment and community education programming in \nEnglish and Spanish. By addressing debt-related legal issues before they become \nirreversible, catastrophic crises, Tzedek DC enhances the overall stability and \nfinancial  health  of  low-income  DC  families,  including  immigrants  and  their \nfamilies. \n29. The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm Tzedek DC. The \norganization’s mission of safeguarding the rights and interests of low-income \nimmigrants residing in the DC area who are facing debt-related problems will be \nfrustrated because the Rule places inappropriate weight on credit report information \nthat is often inaccurate and unreliable. Tzedek DC’s immigrant clients who timely \npay bills (such as rent and utilities) that are not reported to credit reporting agencies \nwill be adversely impacted by the Rule. In addition, Tzedek DC’s immigrant clients \nwill tend to have newer credit histories  and lower credit scores  and  will be \nnegatively impacted by the Rule for this reason as well. Immigrant clients who \ncannot pay medical debts will face potential adverse immigration consequences \nunder the Rule, forcing such clients to consider redirecting funds from their grocery \nor rent budgets to pay medical debt or to forgo medical care entirely. Tzedek DC \nalready has had to expend resources to advise community partners and clients of \nthe harms of the Rule, which has diverted resources away from pursuing its mission \nand  serving  low-income  DC  residents  who  would  otherwise  benefit  from  its \n18 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 19 of 68\nservices. Tzedek DC has also launched a bilingual know your rights information \ncampaign designed to serve DC area immigrant households called “Sin Deudas, Sin \nDudas,” Spanish for “No Debt, No Doubt.”  If the Public Charge Rule stands, \nresources from this information campaign will be diverted to advise community \npartners and clients of the harms of the rule. \n30. During the public notice-and-comment period regarding the Public Charge Rule, \nPlaintiffs City of Gaithersburg, State Senator Waldstreicher, FOI, ILCM, JCRC, \nJCPA, and Tzedek DC submitted detailed comments documenting numerous harms \nthe Public Charge Rule would inflict on their missions, their members, their clients, \ntheir  immigrant  communities,  and  surrounding  communities.12  Plaintiffs’ \ncomments highlighted the expected adverse effects that the Public Charge Rule \nwould inflict on immigrants and refugees who are reliant on DHS’s longstanding \ninterpretation and policy, described below, that did not consider temporary non-\ncash public benefits as evidence that an individual was not self-sufficient. \n31. Plaintiff Tzedek DC also jointly submitted with 49 consumer, civil rights, economic \njustice, faith, privacy, and advocacy organizations an additional comment opposing \nthe Public Charge Rule’s radical expansion of the programs and factors to be \nconsidered in a public charge analysis, particularly the provision that requires \nUSCIS to consider an immigrant’s credit history and credit score in the public \ncharge determination as ill-advised and inappropriate. \n12 Comments of Tzedek DC on Proposed Public Charge Rule, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-46339.  \n19 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 20 of 68\nBACKGROUND \nII. THE “PUBLIC CHARGE” EXCLUSION HAS LONG BEEN INTERPRETED TO \nAPPLY ONLY TO PERSONS WHO ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON \nGOVERNMENT CASH ASSISTANCE. \n32. The term “public charge” has since its inception referred to persons who cannot \ncare for themselves and are thus primarily dependent on the government to avoid \ndestitution. The predecessor agency to DHS, the Immigration and Nationalization \nService (“INS”), noted in 1999 that the “primary dependence model of public \nassistance  was  the  backdrop  against  which  the  ‘public  charge’  concept  in \nimmigration law developed in the 1800s.” 64 F.R. 28676 (May 26, 1999). \n33. The term first appeared in an 1882 law barring the admission into the United States \nof “any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself \nwithout becoming a public charge.” An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, § 2, \n22 Stat. 214 (1882). \n34. Since then, Congress has re-employed the term “public charge” over the years \nincluding in 1891, 1903, 1907, 1917, 1952, 1990, and 1996 without expanding its \nmeaning to include non-cash benefits, even as public assistance programs expanded \nover the years. \n35. In 1952 Congress enacted the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Pub. L. 414, ch. \n2, 66 Stat. 163, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. (1952). Section 212 of that Act \nexcluded from admission individuals “who, in the opinion of the consular officer \nat the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the \ntime of application for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges.” \nId.  § 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(A).  \n20 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 21 of 68\n36. The longstanding interpretation of the term “public charge” in these statutes had \nconsistently been and continued after 1952 to be limited to a person who is destitute. \nAs the Bureau of Immigration Appeals held, “[t]he words ‘public charge’ had their \nordinary meaning: that is to say, a money charge upon or an expense to the public \nfor support and care, the alien being destitute.” Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. \nDec. 583, 586 (BIA 1974) (citations omitted). \n37. Congress has not altered this well-established meaning of “public charge,” despite \nrevisiting the topic on many occasions. \n38. For example, in 1965, Congress reversed previous national policy that restricted \nimmigration from certain global regions and opened the U.S. to immigrants from \nall over the world without modifying the well-established meaning of  public \ncharge. Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-236. \n39. In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (“IRCA”), \nwithout modifying the “public charge” definition. Instead, Congress provided \nadditional grounds for waivers allowing individuals deemed a public charge to \novercome that determination and obtain admission.  8 U.S.C. § 1255a(d). \n40. In 1987, the INS promulgated a regulation clarifying that applicants would not be \nsubject to exclusion on public charge grounds if “the applicant demonstrates a \nhistory of employment in the United States evidencing self-support without the \nreceipt of public cash assistance.” Adjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 FR \n16205, 16211 (May 1, 1987) (emphasis added), codified at 8 C.F.R. 245A. The INS \ndefined  “public  cash  assistance”  as  “income  or  needs-based  monetary \nassistance . . . designed to meet subsistence levels [such as ‘supplemental security \n21 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 22 of 68\nincome’].” Id. at 16,209. The agency specifically excluded “assistance in kind, such \nas food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits” from those benefits that \nwould be considered in determining whether to render an individual a public \ncharge. Id. (emphasis added). In addition, the regulation excluded from public \ncharge  consideration  Medicare,  Medicaid,  emergency  treatment,  services  to \npregnant women or children under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of \npublic health). Id.\n41. Congress again declined to alter the “public charge” test in the Immigration Act of \n1990, despite making a number of other changes to immigration-related statutes. \nPub. L. No. 101-649 (Nov. 29, 1990), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. \n42. In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation  Act  of  1996  (“PRWORA”),  which  imposed  restrictions  on \nimmigrant eligibility for certain public benefits. However, Congress did not alter \nthe “public charge” test in this statute. \n43. Congress again declined to change the meaning of “public charge” one month after \npassing  the  PRWORA,  when  it  enacted  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), which codified the totality–of-\nthe-circumstances test that had been developed in case law and administrative \npolicies.  8  U.S.C.  § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i).  At  that  time,  Congress  considered  but \nrejected an expanded definition of “public charge” that would have included \nindividuals who received “federal public benefits for an aggregate of 12 months \nover a period of 7 years.” 142 Cong. Rec. S11882 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1996). \n22 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 23 of 68\n44. IIRIRA also introduced a provision that allowed the use of an affidavit of support \nas a means that could be used to help an immigrant overcome the public-charge \nbarrier, so long as the sponsor of the affidavit pledged to maintain the sponsored \nimmigrant’s income at or above 125 percent of the federal poverty level. 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); 1183a(a)(1)(A). \n45. Upon learning that enacting both PRWORA (making immigrants ineligible for \ncertain federal benefits) and IIRIRA (codifying the totality of the circumstances test \nfor “public charges”) in the same year had caused confusion, the INS and the State \nDepartment published several documents to confirm that the longstanding historic \nunderstanding of the term “public charge” remained operative. \n46. In 1997, the INS issued internal guidance explaining that the IIRIRA “has not \naltered the standards used to determine the likelihood of an alien to become a public \ncharge nor has it significantly changed the criteria to be considered in determining \nsuch a likelihood.” Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Dep’t of Justice, Public \nCharge: INA Sections 212(A)(4) and 237(A)(5)—Duration of Departure for LPRs \nand Repayment of Public Benefits (Dec. 16, 1997). \n47. Similarly, the State Department issued an internal update in 1998 that IIRIRA did \n“not change[] the long-standing legal presumption that an able-bodied, employable \nindividual will be able to work upon arrival in the United States” and thus not \nbecome a public charge. State Department Cable no. 98-State-102426 (June 8, \n1998),  reprinted  in  75  Interpreter  Releases  879  (June  29,  1998).  The  State \nDepartment further stated “[t]he presumption that the applicant will find work \ncoupled with the fact that the [affidavit of support] is a legally enforceable contract \n23 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 24 of 68\nwill provide in most cases a sufficient basis to accept a sponsor’s . . . technically \nsufficient [affidavit] as overcoming the public charge ground.” Id. \n48. Although these INS and State Department internal documents recognized that \nIIRIRA made no changes to the longstanding meaning or interpretation of the term \n“public charge,” by 1999 the INS was concerned that public “confusion about the \nrelationship between the receipt of public benefits and the concept of ‘public \ncharge’ ha[d] deterred eligible [non-citizens] and their families, including U.S. \ncitizen children, from seeking important health and nutrition benefits that they are \nlegally entitled to receive.” Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on \nPublic  Charge  Grounds,  64  FR  28689,  28692  (May  26,  1999)  (“1999  Field \nGuidance”). \n49. The Field Guidance explained that “[t]his reluctance to access benefits has an \nadverse impact not just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the \ngeneral welfare.” Id. at 28692. \n50. At the same time, the INS published a proposed rule for notice and public comment \nthat the uncertainty following the near simultaneous enactment of IIRIRA and \nPRWORA was “undermining the Government policies of increasing access to \nhealth care and helping people to become self-sufficient.” Inadmissibility and \nDeportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28676, 28677 (proposed May 26, \n1999) (“Public Charge Grounds”). This rule was never issued in final form. \n51. These  two  INS  documents  each  confirmed  that  the  longstanding  historic \nunderstanding of the term “public charge” remained operative. \n24 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 25 of 68\n52. The Public Charge Grounds confirmed that the term “public charge” meant an \nindividual “who is likely to become . . . primarily dependent on the Government \nfor subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for \nincome  maintenance  or  institutionalization  for  long-term  care  at  Government \nexpense.” Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR at 28,677. \n53. The 1999 Field Guidance also aimed to “help alleviate public confusion over the \nmeaning of the term ‘public charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the \nreceipt of Federal, State, and local public benefits” and to “provide aliens with \nbetter guidance as to the types of public benefits that will and will not be considered \nin public charge determinations.” 1999 Field Guidance, 64 FR at 28689. \n54. The 1999 Field Guidance made clear that only receipt of cash assistance for income \nmaintenance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental \nSecurity  Income,  and  state  equivalents)  and  publicly  funded  long-term \ninstitutionalization, and not non-cash benefits, would be considered in making the \npublic-charge determination.  1999 Field Guidance, 64 FR at 28693. \n55. In explaining the contemporaneous validity of the long standing definition of \n“public charge,” the 1999 Field Guidance recognized that “federal, state, and local \nbenefits are increasingly being made available to families with incomes far above \nthe poverty level, reflecting broad public policy decisions about improving general \npublic  health  and  nutrition,  promoting  education,  and  assisting  working-poor \nfamilies in the process of becoming self-sufficient.” Id. at 28,692. \n56. As a corollary, “participation in such noncash programs is not evidence of poverty \nor dependence” because they “are by their nature supplemental and do not, alone \n25 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 26 of 68\nor in combination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family.” \nId. By focusing only on cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term \ninstitutionalization, the INS could thus “identify those who are primarily dependent \non the government for subsistence without inhibiting access to non-cash benefits \nthat serve important public interests.” Id. \n57. The  focus  on  cash  benefits  for  making  the  public  charge  determination  was \nconsistent with the advice provided by federal benefits agencies, including the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, and the \nSocial  Security  Administration,  that  “receipt  of  cash  assistance  for  income \nmaintenance is the best evidence of primary dependence on the Government” \nbecause “non-cash benefits generally provide supplementary support . . . to low-\nincome working families  to sustain and improve their ability to remain self-\nsufficient.” Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR at 28677–78. \n58. Indeed, the INS could not “conceive of a situation where an individual . . . could \nsupport himself or his family solely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily \ndependent on the [G]overnment,” other than for long-term institutionalization at \ngovernment expense. Id. at 28678. \n59. In addition, according to the Public Charge Grounds, “[p]ast receipt of non-cash \nbenefits [e.g., Medicaid, CHIP as well as similar state and local programs] should \nbe excluded from consideration for public charge purposes.” Id. \n60. Congress has expanded immigrants’ access to benefits that had been explicitly \nexcluded from the public charge determination without indicating that they should \nbe factored into the determination. In the 2002 Farm Bill, for example, Congress \n26 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 27 of 68\nrestored  eligibility  for  food  stamps  (now  known  as  Supplemental  Nutritional \nAssistance Program or “SNAP”) to immigrant children, immigrants receiving \ndisability benefits, and adults who had lived in the United States in a “qualified” \nimmigrant status for five years. Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, \nPub L. No. 107-171 (May 13, 2002). \n61. Indeed, the SNAP statute prohibits “consider[ation]” of “[t]he value of [SNAP] \nbenefits that my be provided . . . [as] income resources for any purpose under any \nFederal, State, or local laws.” 7 U.S.C. § 2017(b). \n62. As  recently  as  2018,  the  Congressional  Research  Service  confirmed  that \nDefendants’ position on including the receipt of non-cash benefits in the public \ncharge determination had been consistent and clear: \n[P]ublic charge determination[s] for aliens applying for adjustment \nto  [Legal  Permanent  Residency]  status,  only  consider[s]  cash \nincome  maintenance  benefits  and  government-funded \ninstitutionalization for long-term care. Cash assistance for income \nmaintenance . . .  ‘includes  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI), \ncash assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families \n(TANF) program and state or local cash assistance programs for \nincome  maintenance,  often  called  “general  assistance” \nprograms’ . . . . [A]n alien’s past or current receipt of these benefits \nor of government funded long-term care does not automatically lead \nto a determination of inadmissibility, but instead only factors into \nthe prospective analysis under the totality of the circumstances test.  \nCongressional Research Service, Immigration: Frequently Asked Questions about \n“Public  Charge”  at  7  (Sept.  19,  2018)  (available  at\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45313.pdf). \n63. Although Congress, DHS, and the State Department have interpreted “public \ncharge” consistently over time, altering the definition of “public charge” has been \na clear priority from the early days of the Trump Administration. During the \n27 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 28 of 68\nPresident’s first month in office, an executive order reinterpreting the term was \nleaked to the public, but never issued.13\n64. In 2017, the Administration endorsed the Reforming American Immigration for \nStrong Employment (“RAISE”) Act that would have eliminated some of the family-\nbased admission preferences created by the 1965 Act and established a point-based \nsystem  based  on  factors  including  age,  formal  education,  English  language \nproficiency,  and  highly-compensated  employment  for  evaluating  potential \nimmigrants. Congress did not pass the RAISE Act. S.B. 354, 115th Cong., 1st sess. \n(2017). \nIII. THE PROPOSED RULE REDEFINED THE MEANING OF “PUBLIC \nCHARGE.” \n65. On October 10, 2018, DHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed \nRule) regarding the public charge ground for inadmissibility. 83 FR 51114. \n66. The  Proposed  Rule  sought  to  redefine  the  meaning  of  public  charge  and  to \nsignificantly change the process by which DHS decides whether an applicant would \nlikely become a public charge and thus be inadmissible. \n67. The Proposed Rule abandoned the long-standing understanding of a public charge \nas a person who was and would remain primarily dependent on the government \nover the long term. It proposed to impose a new threshold that any applicant who \nreceived public benefits valued at more than 15 percent of the Federal Poverty \n13 Read the Trump administration’s draft proposal penalizing immigrants who accept almost any \npublic benefit, Wash. Post., http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-trump-\nadministrations-draft-proposal-penalizing-immigrants-who-accept-almost-any-public-\nbenefit/2841/.   \n28 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 29 of 68\nGuideline for a household of one (approximately $5 per day) for a period of 12 \nconsecutive months would be considered a public charge. 83 FR at 51164-65. \n68. The Proposed Rule also expanded the benefits to be considered to include non-cash \nbenefits, like food supplements, public health insurance, and housing assistance. Id.  \nThe Proposed Rule classified subsidies like SNAP and Section 8 housing vouchers \nas  “monetizable  benefits”  and  services  like  Medicaid  as  “non-monetizable \nbenefits.”  If an applicant received both simultaneously, then use of the non-\nmonetizable benefits for only nine months in aggregate within a 36-month period \nwould render the applicant a public charge. Id. at 51,158, 51,290. \n69. The Proposed Rule also would assign positive, negative, heavily positive, and \nheavily negative weights to enumerated factors. Id. at 51,291-92. \n70. DHS acknowledged that the changes to the determination of “public charge” will \nlikely create a chilling effect causing immigrants to take advantage of fewer public \nbenefits for which they are eligible. Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 \nFed. Reg. 51,114, 51,266 (Oct. 10, 2018); Id. at 51,268 (“There may also be \nadditional reductions in transfer payments from states to individuals who may \nchoose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in a public benefits program.”).  \n71. The Proposed Rule received over 266,000 comments, “the vast majority of which \nopposed the rule.” Public Charge Rule, 84 FR at 41297. \nIV. THE FINAL PUBLIC CHARGE RULE DEPARTS FROM SETTLED LAW \nDEFINING “PUBLIC CHARGE” TO MEAN PRINCIPAL DEPENDENCE ON \nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT CASH ASSISTANCE. \n72. The final Public Charge Rule changes both the public charge definition and the \nprocess by which DHS determines whether an applicant is likely to meet this \n29 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 30 of 68\ndefinition in the future. See generally 84 Fed. Reg. at 41297-300 (summary of \nchanges). \n73. Despite the longstanding exclusion of supplemental, non-cash benefits from the \npublic charge analysis, the Public Charge Rule creates a new standard for public \ncharge that requires an applicant to show s/he has maintained what is, in effect, \nsomething close to total self-sufficiency, a concept which the Public Charge Rule \nadmits is “not codified in the INA itself.” 84 FR at 41356.  \n74. DHS’s redefinition of public charge to mean “a person who receives the designated \nbenefits [including non-cash benefits] for more than 12 months in the aggregate of \nany  36-month  period,”  84  FR  at  41357,  contravenes  Congressional  intent, \nregulatory  history,  and  decades  of  case  law  which  all  rely  on  the  primarily \ndependent standard that excluded non-cash benefits. Moreover, the predictable \nconsequences of the Public Charge Rule are that immigrant communities will \nbecome  less  healthy,  less  educated,  and  less  equipped  for  the  workforce, \nsignificantly undermining their ability to attain self-sufficiency by supplementing \nlow-paying,  full-time  employment  with  reliance  on  non-cash  public  benefits \nprograms that Congress created and extended to immigrants for that very purpose. \n75. The Public Charge Rule also fails to acknowledge long-standing agency guidance \nthat immigrants’ use of supplemental, non-cash benefits did not raise apprehensions \nabout improper incentives nor was their use considered inimical to achieving self-\nsufficiency. See 1999 Field Guidance, 64 FR at 28692. Further, the Rule proffers \nno evidence that immigrants are motivated by participation in non-cash benefits \nprograms to come or to stay in the United States or that immigrants who use \n30 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 31 of 68\nsupplemental, non-cash  benefits  typically became primarily dependent on the \ngovernment, rather than using those benefits as assistance to become upwardly \nmobile and more self-sufficient. \n76. While the Public Charge Rule projects certain cost advantages for federal and state \nbudgets  that  allegedly  will  result  from  disenrollment  or  failure  to  enroll  in \nsupplemental, non-cash benefits programs, it fails to account for a wide range of \npublic  health,  public  safety,  economic,  and  administrative  cost  injuries  that \nPlaintiffs  (and  others)  will  suffer  as  a  result  of  disenrollment  or  foregone \nparticipation in those programs by immigrants fearful of losing their status. \nV. THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE WAS MOTIVATED BY RACIAL, ETHNIC, \nNATIONAL ORIGIN AND NATIONALITY ANIMUS. \n77. Throughout his campaign and time in office, President Trump has made clear his \nintent to limit the number of immigrants from Latin American, African, and Asian \ncountries. Most notably, President Trump asked, “Why do we want all these people \nfrom ‘shithole countries’ coming here?”,14 a remark Senator Lindsey Graham \ndescribed  as  “incredibly  disappointing.”15  Similarly,  Trump  has  described \nimmigrants from those countries as “infesting” the United States.16\n14 Eli Watkins & Abby Phillip, Trump Decries Immigrants from ‘Shithole Countries’ Coming to \nUS, CNN (Jan. 12, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-\ncountries-trump/index.html. \n15 Emma Dumain, A Day Later, Lindsey Graham Breaks Public Silence on Trump’s ‘Shithole’ \nRemarks, McClatchy (Jan. 12, 2018), https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/congress/article194434204.html. \n16 Donald J.

President Trump’s view on limiting immigration from “shithole countries” is in \nturn based on his discriminatory belief that immigrants from such countries are \npoorer and consequently drain taxpayer resources. During a meeting in the Oval \nOffice, President Trump complained that immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS” \nand that once immigrants from Nigeria had seen the United States, they would \nnever “go back to their huts.”17 At the same time, President Trump “suggested that \nthe  United  States  should  instead  bring  more  people  from  countries  such  as \nNorway,” and he was “open” to immigrants from some Asian countries thought to \nbe economically beneficial.18\n79. President Trump has made no secret of his views that immigrants drain public \nresources. In 2018, Trump promoted an article titled “Shock report: US paying \nmore for illegal immigrant births than Trump’s wall.”19 President Trump has also \nstated: \n “ObamaCare gives free insurance to illegal immigrants.”20\n “Your tax dollars well spent. Over 1.295M ObamaCare enrollees will also be illegal \nimmigrants.”21\n17 Michael D. Shear & Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Stoking Fears, Trump Defied Bureaucracy to \nAdvance Immigration Agenda, N.Y.

As a candidate and in office, President Trump endorsed significant cuts to legal \nimmigration  and  challenged  the  centrality  of  family  reunification  to  federal \nimmigration policy. The official White House website states that “the President \nsupports ending chain migration, eliminating the Visa Lottery, and moving the \ncountry to a merit-based entry system.”24\n81. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the media obtained \na draft of an “Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our \nImmigration  Laws  Promote  Accountability  and  Responsibility.”  The  draft \nExecutive Order instructed DHS to “rescind any field guidance” and “propose for \nnotice and comment a rule that provides standards for determining which aliens are \nadmissible or deportable on public charge grounds,” including if a noncitizen \nreceives or is likely to receive non-cash public benefits. The draft Executive Order \nwas never issued.25\n22 Donald J.

In 2017, two U.S. senators introduced a bill designed to significantly reduce legal \nimmigration by, for example, curbing the government’s long-established policy \nfavoring family reunification. The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong \nEconomy (“RAISE”) Act would have given visa preference only to immediate \nfamily and eliminated the diversity visa lottery, which allots a limited number of \nvisas to countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States.26\nIt also proposed a “merit-based immigration system,” which gives preference to \nimmigrants between the ages of 26 and 30, with doctoral degrees, high English \nproficiency, and a job offer with a high salary. The RAISE Act would have \nprecluded  parents  of  adult  U.S.  citizens  from  applying  for  Legal  Permanent \nResident status and, if they entered as temporary nonimmigrants, barred those \nparents from receiving federal, state, or local public benefit.27\n83. President Trump supported the RAISE Act.28 Explaining his support, President \nTrump said “The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from \ncollecting welfare . . . . They’re not going to come in and just immediately go and \ncollect welfare.” The White House also asserted falsely that “[m]ore than 50 percent \nof all immigrant households receive welfare benefits, compared to only 30 percent \nof native households in the United States that receive welfare benefits.”29 In fact, \nimmigrants are less likely to consume public assistance benefits than native-born \n26 S.B. 354, 115th Cong., 1st sess. (2017). \n27 Id. § 4(d)(2)(B). \n28 White House, Fact Sheets, President Donald J.

Overall, immigrants consume 27% fewer benefits on average than native-\nborn Americans with similar incomes and ages.30\n84. In June 2017, shortly before announcing his support for the RAISE Act, President \nTrump  received  a  briefing  on  immigration  from  White  House  senior  adviser \nStephen  Miller.  (Miller,  an  ardent  supporter  of  the  Public  Charge  Rule,  had \nreportedly once told a former White House communications aide, “I would be \nhappy if not a single refugee foot ever touched American soil.”31) At the briefing, \nafter learning that 15,000 Haitians had received U.S. visas in 2017, President \nTrump replied that they “all have AIDS.” When President Trump learned that \n40,000 Nigerians had received visas, he said that they would never “go back to their \nhuts.”32\n85. Defendant  Cuccinelli  has  expressed  similar  sentiments.  In  a  2012  interview, \nCuccinelli compared U.S. immigration policy to local laws governing treatment of \nrats, stating that a District of Columbia law prohibiting killing of rats or separating \nrat families is “worse than our immigration policy—you can’t break up rat families. \nOr raccoons or all the rest and you can’t even kill them. It’s unbelievable.”33 He \n30 Alex Nowrasteh & Robert Orr, Immigration and the Welfare State at 1, 7, Cato Institute, May \n10, 2018, https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/ files/pubs/ pdf/irpb6.pdf.   \n31 Cliff Sims, Team of Vipers: My 500 Extraordinary Days in the Trump White House, 191 \n(2019). \n32 Michael D.

In a press conference at the \nWhite House announcing issuance of the Public Charge Rule, Defendant Cuccinelli \nstated that in promulgating “President Trump’s public charge inadmissibility rule,” \nthe Department was “promoting our shared history” and “implement[ing] . . . a law \npassed by Congress in 1996 that has not been given meaningful effect.”34\n86. Asked about the 1903 plaque on the Statue of Liberty that invites “your tired, your \npoor, your huddled masses,” Cuccinelli initially stated: “I’m certainly not prepared \nto take anything down off the Statue of Liberty.” He went on to say, that plaque \n“was referring back to people coming from Europe where they had class-based \nsocieties” not to people coming to the United States from outside Europe. He also \nreinterpreted it to “[g]ive me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own \ntwo feet . . . .”35 When asked if the Rule changes the definition of the American \ndream, Cuccinelli said, “[n]o one has a right to become an American who isn’t born \nhere as an American” and that “it is a privilege to become an American, not a right \nfor anybody who is not already an American citizen.”36 He also said the Rule was \n“part of President Trump keeping his promises.”37\n87. In December 2017, DHS noted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and \nDeregulatory Actions its intent to publish a Notice for Public Rulemaking regarding \n34 Cuccinelli on “public charge” immigration rule, CBS News, Aug. 12, 2019, \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/video/immigration-official-ken-cuccinelli-immigrants-public-charge-\nrule/.   \n35 Rebecca Morin, Immigration official Ken Cuccinelli: Statue of Liberty poem refers to \nimmigrants from Europe, USA Today Aug. 13, 2019. \n36 Sasha Ingber and Rachel Martin, Immigration Chief: ‘Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor Who \nCan Stand On Their Own 2 Feet’, Nat’l Pub.

In early 2018, it was widely reported \nthat  the  new  rule  would  dramatically  expand  the  types  of  public  assistance \nprograms that could be considered in the public charge test, including non-cash \nbenefits like SNAP and Medicaid.38 In January 2018, the State Department revised \nthe Foreign Affairs Manual (“FAM”) to instruct consular officers to consider a \nwider range of public benefits when determining whether visa applicants who have \nreceived or are currently receiving benefits are inadmissible on public charge \ngrounds.39 As revised, the FAM also allowed State Department officials to consider \nwhether an applicant’s family member has received public benefits as part of the \npublic charge test.40\n88. Visa denials due to public charge inadmissibility have substantially increased since \nthe State Department issued the amended FAM. See Mayor and City of Baltimore\nv.

In January 2018, President Trump rejected a bipartisan immigration proposal by \nmembers of Congress. In reference to the deal’s protections for immigrants from \nHaiti and Africa, President Trump asked why he should accept immigrants from \n“shithole countries” rather than from nations like “Norway.”41\n90. During the spring of 2018, President Trump said in a meeting at the White House \nthat the United States has “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world” and \nexhorted his administration officials to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable \nimmigrants. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are,” President Trump \nsaid. “These aren’t people, these are animals . . . .”42\n91. In June 2018, Miller emailed then-USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna regarding \nDHS’s public charge rule.

Dec. 409 \n(A.G. 1964), holds that a “healthy person in the prime of life cannot ordinarily be \nconsidered likely to become a public charge.” 10 I. & N. Dec. at 421. Because \n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g) binds DHS to that decision, and because the Public Charge \nRule’s interpretation of the term “public charge,” conflicts with that decision, it is \ncontrary to law. \n99. The Public Charge Rule also treats SNAP benefits as income or a resource for \npurposes of public charge determinations in violation of 7 U.S.C. §2017(b). \n100. Specifically, the Public Charge Rule authorizes USCIS to consider noncitizens’ \npast application or certification for or receipt of SNAP benefits in determining \nwhether their “assets, resources, and financial status” weigh in favor or against \nexclusion of noncitizens on public-charge grounds. Final Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n41,502–03 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.22(b)(4)(ii)(E)). The Public Charge \nRule  therefore  impermissibly  treats  SNAP  benefits  as  either  “income”  or  a \n“resource.” \n101. In addition, the Public Charge Rule renders noncitizens inadmissible based on the \nlikelihood that they might receive SNAP benefits in the future. Id. at 41,501 (to be \ncodified at 212.21(a), (b)(2), (c)). The Public Charge Rule therefore requires \nimmigration officials to unlawfully take into account the possibility that noncitizens \nmight one day receive SNAP benefits at a “value” other than zero, contrary to 7 \nU.S.C. § 2017(b). \n40 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 41 of 68\n102. The Public Charge Rule must be set aside as not in accordance with law and in \nexcess of statutory authority. \nCOUNT II \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(A)–ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS– \nINADEQUATELY JUSTIFIED \n103. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n104. The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).An \nagency action is arbitrary and capricious where “the agency has relied on factors \nwhich Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an \nimportant aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be \nascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.” Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n26, 43 (1983). And “an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated \nto supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required \nwhen an agency does not act in the first instance.” Id. at 42. \n105. DHS failed to cite evidence or to provide substantive reasons to abandon the federal \ngovernment’s  over  100-year-old  definition  of  public  charge--as  published  in \nagency guidance documents since 1999—to mean dependence on subsistence cash \nbenefits.   \n106. As  to  the  longstanding  nature  of  DHS’s  prior  policy,  DHS  recognizes,  “the \nprevailing approach to public charge inadmissibility has been dictated” for decades \nby  the  1999  Field  Guidance.  84  FR  at  41294.  Under  that  Guidance,  DHS \n41 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 42 of 68\nacknowledges non-cash benefits have not been be factored into public charge \ndeterminations:  \nan alien’s reliance on or receipt of non-cash benefits such as the \nSupplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP),  or  food \nstamps;  Medicaid;  and  housing  vouchers  and  other  housing \nsubsidies  are  not  currently  considered  by  DHS  in  determining \nwhether an alien is deemed likely at any time to become a public \ncharge.  \n84 FR at 41295. \n107. DHS justifies the change from the longstanding Guidance definition on the basis \nthat receipt of “non-cash benefits for basic living needs such as food and nutrition, \nhousing, and healthcare, that account for significant public expenditures . . . for \nmore than 12 months within any 36-month period is sufficient to render a person a \npublic charge. 84 FR at 41349; see Proposed Rule, 83 FR at 51164 (same). This, \nDHS now asserts, is because “an individual with limited means to satisfy basic \nliving needs who uses government assistance to fulfill such needs for that duration \nof time relies on such assistance to such an extent that the person is not self-\nsufficient.” Id.\n108. This assertion, however, is contrary to longstanding agency policy and is asserted \nwithout any evidence of a change of the facts on the ground. Under the 1999 Field \nGuidance, the INS could not “conceive of a situation where an individual . . . could \nsupport himself or his family solely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily \ndependent on the [G]overnment,” other than for long-term institutionalization at \ngovernment expense. Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR at 28677–78. \n109. “[A]n agency’s decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the \nagency  ignores  or  countermands  its  earlier  factual  findings  without  reasoned \n42 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 43 of 68\nexplanation  for  doing  so.  An  agency  cannot  simply  disregard  contrary  or \ninconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can \nignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank slate.” FCC v. Fox Television \nStations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  557  (2009)  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring);  accord \nOrganized Village of Kake v. Dept. of Agriculture, 795 F.3d 956, 969 (9th Cir. \n2015) (en banc) (an agency’s change in policy when there has been no demonstrated \nchange in the underlying facts, but only a change in the Administration, is arbitrary \nand capricious). \n110. In its Proposed Rule, DHS proposed a threshold for a public charge determination \nto be receipt of “monetizable [non-cash] public benefits . . . [whose] cumulative \nvalue . . .  exceeds  15  percent  of  the  Federal  Poverty  Guidelines  (FPG)  for  a \nhousehold of one” for twelve consecutive months, which translates to “$1,821 \nworth  of  monetizable  public  benefits.”  69  FR  at  51164.  In  other  words,  an \nindividual  that  received  $1,822  or  more  in  2018  would  be  considered  to  be \ndependent on the government for subsistence. Seeid. at 51165 (“DHS believes that \nan individual who receive monetizable public benefits in excess of 15 percent of \nFPG is neither self-sufficient nor on the road to achieving self-sufficiency.”). \n111. Many commenters pointed out the obvious: that, consistent with the 1999 Field \nGuidance’s finding that non-cash benefits are supplemental, the $1,822 threshold \ncan hardly be considered in 2018, especially in areas with a higher cost of living, a \nreasonable measure of dependence on the government or as indicative of a lack of \nself-sufficiency. Other commenters pointed to studies that support the continued \nvalidity of the 1999 conclusion that non-cash public benefits are supplemental by \n43 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 44 of 68\nshowing that receipt of them amounted to 10 percent or less of annual income for \notherwise self-sufficient individuals or families. See generally Public Charge Rule, \n84 FR at 41357-58. \n112. Rather than confront these showings head-on, the Public Charge Rule abandons the \n15 percent threshold in favor of “a single duration-based threshold” based on \n“current receipt or past receipt of more than 12 months of public benefits, in the \naggregate, in any 36-month period . . . will be considered a heavily weighted \nnegative factor in the totality of the alien’s circumstances.” Id. at 41358. This \nchange cannot hide the fact that DHS also abandoned the 15 percent FPG threshold \nin favor of no threshold for non-cash public benefits to be considered a heavily \nweighted negative factor in the public charge determination. See id. (“DHS will \nconsider in the totality whether an alien has applied for, received, or been certified \nor approved to receive any public benefits . . . in assessing whether he or she is \nlikely to become a public charge”) (emphasis added). \n113. DHS also failed to consider the disruption of significant reliance interests the \nchanged  definition  will  cause,  more  specifically,  the  reliance  of  Plaintiffs  in \ndeveloping government assistance programs and allocating their resources, on the \nability of immigrants in their employ or whom they serve to utilize non-cash \nbenefits to which they are lawfully entitled.  A failure to even acknowledge, much \nless take reliance interests into account when changing a rule or policy is a form of \narbitrary agency action.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n115. The costs and benefits of agency action are “a centrally relevant factor when \ndeciding whether to regulate.” Michigan v. EPA, 103 S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015). In \nthis  regard,  cost  “includes  more  than  the  expenses  of  complying  with  the \nregulations, any disadvantage could be termed a cost . . . including, for instance, \nharms that regulation might do to human health or the environment.” Id. Judicial \nreview  of  agency  action  must  evaluate  the  agency’s  cost  analysis  because \n“reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and \nthe disadvantages of agency decisions.” Id. \n116. The Public Charge Rule expressly acknowledges that its costs and benefits are \nmatters to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the proposed changes. \nSee generally 84 FR at 41300-03 & Table 1 (“Summary of Costs and Benefits”); \nsee alsoid. at 41485-90 & Tables 2 and 8 (same). DHS states that the primary cost \nadvantage of the rule change is “a reduction in transfer payments from the Federal \nGovernment to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment \nin a public benefits program . . . [which] DHS estimates . . . will be approximately \n$2.47 billion annually.” Id. at 41485; seeid. at 41300-01 (same).47\n47 While DHS suggests that these amounts “account for significant federal expenditures, 84 FR at \n41296, $2.47 billion represents 0.05% of the proposed 2020 federal budget of $4.7 trillion. \n45 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 46 of 68\n117. As to the cost disadvantages, the Public Charge Rule projects several costs related \nto the additional information collection required under the Rule that would amount \nin aggregate to at least $570 million annually. 84 FR at 41497-500 (listing total \nannual cost burden associated with several different forms required under the new \nrule). The Rule does not, however, provide estimates of what are likely to be the \nmore significant and serious cost burdens of the Public Charge Rule. With regard \nto the cost disadvantages to affected individuals, “DHS has determined that the rule \nmay decrease disposable income and increase the poverty of certain families and \nchildren, including U.S. citizen children,” 84 FR at 41493. DHS does not make any \neffort to quantify this cost, but merely states its “opinion that the benefits of the \naction justify the financial impact on the family.” Id. \n118. Likewise, “DHS recognizes that reductions in federal and state transfers under \nfederal benefit programs may have impacts on state and local economies, large and \nsmall businesses, and individuals. For example, the rule might result in reduced \nrevenues  for  healthcare  providers  participating  in  Medicaid,  companies  that \nmanufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals, grocery retailers participating in \nSNAP, agricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for purchase using \nSNAP benefits, or landlords participating in federally funded housing programs.” \n84 FR at 41301; see id. at 41486 (same). Despite this recognition, DHS made no \neffort to quantify these adverse impacts. \n119. Aside from these recognized, but unquantified, costs, DHS completely ignored the \nhigh costs to states and local governments, and other organizations as immigrants \nand their families  withdraw from or forego public benefits  programs. Health \n46 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 47 of 68\ninsurance is one public benefit from which individuals and families are likely to \nwithdraw. Without coverage, these individuals and families are likely to put off \nhealth care until an emergency arises, thus likely leading to more complex and \ncostly health problems and an increased use emergency room care services. In \naddition as members of the community forgo health care, including immunizations, \nthe spread of contagious diseases will increase, imposing additional costs on state \nand local governments. \n120. Without health insurance to pay the higher costs related to those outcomes, states \nand other will have to bear an increase in uncompensated care costs. See 84 FR at \n41384 (“there is a potential for increases  in uncompensated care in which a \ntreatment or service is not paid for by an insurer or patient”); id. (“DHS does not \nhave  specific  estimates  on  the  increase[d]  cost  for  [uncompensated  care] \nservices.”). For example, Maryland, as a result of increasing the number of persons \nwho were covered by health insurance, saw a drop of approximately $311 million \nin uncompensated care costs from 2013 to 2015. This decline would be reversed as \nindividuals and families disenroll or forego enrollment in health insurance benefits \nas a result of the Rule. Similar results would likely occur in a large number of other \nstates, such that in aggregate the nation-wide cost disadvantage from reduced \nenrollment in the health insurance public benefit would largely diminish, if not \ncompletely offset, the $2.47 billion benefit estimated in the Rule. 84 FR at 41485. \nA similar, albeit smaller, burden will be placed on private organizations that \nprovide health care services to uninsured, and should also be considered as a cost \ndisadvantage of the Rule. \n47 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 48 of 68\n121. Aside from health costs, implementation of the Rule would also put a greater strain \non state and local governments and private organizations to offset the lost federal \nfood security and housing assistance benefits that will result from disenrollment or \nnon-enrollment. Yet, DHS made no effort to quantify these costs either. Without \nsuch quantification, it is impossible to determine if the Rule “does significantly \nmore harm than good.” Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. at 2707. It follows that DHS \n“entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” State Farm, 463 \nU.S. at 43, and thus its action is arbitrary and capricious. E.g., Sierra Club v. Dept. \nof Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 294 (4th Cir. 2018) (“agency action was arbitrary and \ncapricious when ‘it evidences a complete failure to reasonably reflect upon the \ninformation contained in the record and grapple with contrary evidence’”) (citation \nomitted). \n122. While DHS acknowledged that the Public Charge Rule is intended to “minimize \nthe incentive of aliens to immigrate,” i.e, to reduce the number of immigrants in the \nUnited States, 84 FR at 41309,48  it completely failed to acknowledge the cost to \n48 There has already been well-reported increase in the number of visa denials on public charge \ngrounds under the State Department’s similar change to its definition of “public charge.” Lindsay \nGray, Keeping Families Apart: Trump’s Update to the Public Charge Provision, Whitlock & \nGray Immigration Law Blog (May 24, 2018) [hereinafter Gray, Keeping Families Apart], \nhttp://www.whitlockgray.com/2018/05/24/public-charge/; Arelis R.

The harm to nursing homes and other home health care providers is \nparticularly significant. As noted in the “Parties” section of this Complaint, about \none-quarter of the nation’s 4 million direct care workers are immigrants, 43% of \nwhom access some public benefits.”49 Two thirds of these individuals “receive \nMedicaid and more than half get food and nutrition assistance.” And, while the \nPublic Charge Rule does not apply to current green card holders, it “effectively will \nend the pipeline for new workers in an industry with notoriously high turnover.”50\n123. In  contrast  to  the  significant  costs  that  the  agency  ignored,  it  makes  only  a \nconclusory statement about what it claims is its main benefit. DHS states: “The \nprimary benefit of the final rule would be to better ensure that aliens . . . will be \nself-sufficient, i.e., will rely on their own financial resources, as well as the \nfinancial resources of the family, sponsors, and private organizations.” 84 FR at \n41301. As noted below in Count IV, however, DHS provided scant evidence that \nlack of self-sufficiency among immigrants is a serious problem, and indeed the \nevidence of the U.S. Census Bureau and many commenters is that immigrants are \nmore likely than native born to be fully employed. See ¶ 127, infra.

Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n125. The  Public  Charge  Rule  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  Defendants’ \njustification for its promulgation runs counter to the evidence before the agency, is \ninconsistent with the agency’s own fact findings, relies on factors Congress did not \nintend the agency to consider, and disregards material facts and evidence, including \nthe U.S. Census Bureau’s own studies predicting that without immigration the \nburden on taxpayers will increase. \n126. Defendants’  stated  objective  in  revising  the  Public  Charge  rule  includes \n“minimiz[ing] the incentive of aliens to immigrate to the United States because of \nthe availability of public benefits and . . . promot[ing] self-sufficiency of aliens \nwithin the United States.” 84 FR at 41309.  \n127. There is ample basis to conclude that the Public Charge Rule will achieve its stated \nobjective of reducing immigration levels. Judge Hollander, for example, recently \ntook judicial notice that this has been precisely the effect of the State Department’s \nsimilar change to its definition of public charge:  \n[V]isa denials due to public charge inadmissibility have surged since \nthe State Department issued the amended [Foreign Affairs Manual \nto expand the definition of public charge.]  In 2015, the State \nDepartment denied 897 visa applications on public charge grounds. \n. . . In contrast, during the 2018 fiscal year, the number of visa \napplications denied on public charge grounds exceeded 13,000 visa \napplications. U.S. Dep’t of State, Ann. Rep. Table XX (2018).  \n50 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 51 of 68\nMayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, No. 1:18 cv 3636, 2019 WL \n4598011, at *7 (September 20, 2019) (internal citations omitted). \n128. As DHS acknowledges, “to sustain a public charge inadmissibility finding, there \nmust be evidence of a fact that tends to show that the burden of supporting the alien \nis likely to be cast upon the public.” Id. at 41351 (citing Ex parte Hosaye Skaguchi, \n277  F.  913,  916  (9th Cir.  1922).  Such  evidence,  as  DHS  acknowledged  the \nProposed Rule, involves “more than a showing of a possibility that the alien will \nrequire public support.” 83 FR at 51125 (quoting Matter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 \nI&N Dec. 409, 421–23 (BIA 1962)). \n129. DHS never addresses, however, whether, if, as DHS anticipates, the Rule reduces \nimmigration levels, the result would be to increase, rather than decrease the burden \n“cast upon the public,” more specifically, the burden on a shrinking number of \ntaxpayers. With an aging native-born population dependent on fewer wage earners \nto support existing entitlement programs, statistical data shows that the United \nStates increasingly relies on immigrants to grow the workforce. Far from reducing \nthe burden “cast on the public,” the agency’s broader definition of public charge \nwill increase the number of able-bodied immigrants who will be labeled “public \ncharges,” but who, if granted permanent legal status, would likely help to reduce\nthe burden on taxpayers. \n130. The evidence before DHS demonstrates that critical demographic trends in the \nUnited States will make it less, not more, likely that categorizing immigrant \napplicants under the agency’s overly broad definition of “public charge” will result \nin actual benefits to the public. As evidence before the DHS documents: \n51 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 52 of 68\nLast year, the total number of births in the United States fell to its \nlowest level in 30 years. The general fertility rate dropped to the \nlowest rate since the United States  Centre for  Disease Control \nstarted keeping records in 1909: to 60.3 births per 1,000 women \naged between 15 and 44. The total fertility rate, meanwhile, which \nestimates the average number of children a woman could expect to \nhave over her lifetime at current birth rates for each age, at 1.76 \nbirths per woman, is below the “replacement rate” for fertility. That \nis the level that keeps populations stable (about 2.1 children per \nwoman). And it is a considerable drop from a decade earlier, when \nthe rate was 2.12 births per woman.51\n131. These same observations are reflected in the Census Bureau’s 2017 population \nprojections.52 As the Census Bureau’s report shows, the only possibility for an \nincrease in the nation’s workforce population in coming years (necessary to support \nthe aging population who will rely on social security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) is \nthrough more, not less, immigration: \nThe year 2030 marks a demographic turning point for the United \nStates. Beginning that year, all baby boomers will be older than 65. \nThis will expand the size of the older population so that one in every \nfive Americans is projected to be retirement age. Later that decade, \nby 2035, we project that older adults will outnumber children for the \nfirst time in U.S. history. The year 2030 marks another demographic \nfirst  for  the  United  States.  Beginning  that  year,  because  of \npopulation  aging,  immigration  is  projected  to  overtake  natural \nincrease (the excess of births over deaths) as the primary driver of \npopulation growth for the country. As the population ages, the \nnumber of deaths is projected to rise substantially, which will slow \nthe country’s natural growth. As a result, net international migration \nis projected to overtake natural increase, even as levels of migration \nare projected to remain relatively flat. These three demographic \n51 C.K.

And because “the foreign born are more likely to be in the labor force” than \nnative-born people, id. at 11, these demographic changes suggest that immigrants \nare vital contributors to our economy and not burdens. \n133. The  2017  Census  Bureau  Report  observes  that  the  projected  net  growth  in \npopulation  fueled  by  immigration  distinguishes  the  United  States  from  other \neconomically stagnating developed nations who are also faced with an overall \ndecline  in  their  native-born  populations.53  One  disadvantage  of  the  growing \npercentage of older Americans will be an increased burden on those working in the \nUnited States to fund the programs that benefit an older population. See id. at 5 (“In \ncoming decades, the United States is expected to shift from a youth-dependent \npopulation toward an elderly-dependent population.”). \n134. In November 2018, Jay Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made a similar \nobservation: reducing the number of legal immigrants coming to the United States \n53 Id. at 12 (“This continued growth sets the United States apart from other developed countries, \nwhose populations are expected to barely increase or actually contract in coming decades.”). \n53 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 54 of 68\nwould retard economic growth by placing constraints on the ability of businesses \nto expand their operations.54\n135. Yet immigration policy changes by DHS are already reducing the level of legal \nimmigration, despite this being a time “when there are more job openings than job \nseekers in the United States.”55 “[N]ewly released government data show that \nduring 2018, the Trump Administration was denying applications submitted to the \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services at a rate 37 percent higher than \nthe Obama administration did in 2016.”56 A Cato Institute study in fact shows that \nthe DHS 11.3% rejection rate for “work permits, travel documents and status \napplications, based on family reunification, employment and other grounds . . . is \nthe highest rate of denial on record.”57\n54 Craig Torres, Fed’s Powell Says Reduced Immigration Could Slow U.S. Economy, Bloomberg \nNews (November 1, 2018), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-\n01/fed-s-powell-says-reduced-immigration-could-slow-u-s-economy (“Thus, from an economic \ngrowth standpoint, reduced immigration would result in lower population growth and thus, all \nelse equal, slower trend economic growth.”). \n55 Id.See also Even in a Solid Economy, U.S. fertility rate is falling, The Economist (Nov. 26, \n2018), reprinted in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com/what-s-causing-\nthe-baby-bust-in-the-u-s/501260312/.  \n56 David J.

Adopting the Public Charge Rule whose purpose is to reduce the number of \nimmigrants who could qualify for permanent status, simply damages employers and \nreduces tax revenues in both the short and long term future. It will add to the burden \non existing wage earners by artificially reducing the size of the workforce who \ncould pay taxes to support the aging population. Thus, far from providing a benefit \nto the public, the Public Charge Rule would exacerbate the burden on taxpayers. \n137. DHS’s only acknowledgment of this body of evidence was its statement that “[o]ne \ncommenter stated that the rule would reduce immigration and hurt the country’s \neconomic future given the need for immigrant workers to replenish an increasingly \naging population.” 84 FR at 41472. The agency, however, provided no substantive \nresponse, saying only that “[b]eyond the indirect costs and other economic effects \ndescribed in the economic analysis of this rule, DHS is unable to determine the \neffect this rule will have on every economic entity mentioned or all aspects of future \neconomic growth.” Id. \n138. Defendants’ assertion that DHS is unable to specify the effect on “every economic \nentity or all aspects of future economic growth” improperly focuses on the trees, \nwhile ignoring the forest; namely, that, as the Census Bureau found, with declining \nbirthrates and workforce stagnation, legal immigration levels must increase to \nsustain current economic growth. Thus, the Rule never addresses, quantitatively or \nqualitatively, whether its stated aim of reducing immigration would increase, rather \nthan decrease, the “burden cast upon the public,” i.e., the burden cast upon a \nshrinking number of taxpayers.  \n55 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 56 of 68\n139. The Proposed Rule suggested a shift from the 1999 Field Guidance’s criterion of \n“primarily dependent” on public benefits as the threshold for determining public \ncharge to a threshold criterion based on “receipt of monetizable public benefits . . . \n[whose] cumulative value . . . exceeds 15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines \n(FPG) for a household of one within any period of 12 consecutive months.” 83 FR \nat 51164. Based on 2018 data, the proposed threshold “would exclude up to $1,821 \nworth of monetizable public benefits for a household of one” from consideration in \nthe public charge determination. Id. \n140. The final rule completely eliminated the 15 percent threshold, substituting instead, \na new “single duration-based threshold” under which DHS will consider an alien \nlikely to become a public charge at any time in the future if the alien is more likely \nthan not to receive public benefits for longer than 12 months in the aggregate in any \n36-month period.” Id. at 41358. In dollar terms, DHS admits that this means that \nan individual could be found a “public charge” who receives only “hundreds of \ndollars, or less, in public benefits annually.” 84 FR 41361 (emphasis added).\n141. Where,  as  here,  “a  party  seeks  review  of  agency  action  under  the  APA \n(Administrative Procedure Act [before a district court], the district judge sits as an \nappellate tribunal. The `entire case’ on review is a question of law.” Am. Bioscience, \nInc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001). And, in such cases, where \na party raises serious, material arguments, “‘it most emphatically remains the duty \nof [the reviewing] court to ensure that an agency engage the arguments raised \nbefore it - that it conduct a process of reasoned decisionmaking.’” NorAm Gas \nTransmission Company v. FERC, 148 F.3d 1158, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citation \n56 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 57 of 68\nomitted).  As  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  stated:  “during  notice  and  comment \nproceedings, the agency is obligated to identify and respond to relevant, significant \nissues raised during those proceedings.” North Carolina Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. v. \nUnited Farm Workers, 702 F. 3d 755, 769 (4th Cir. 2012). To avoid being arbitrary, \nan agency must also demonstrate a “rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.” United States v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). The Public Charge Rule is arbitrary because it fails to \naddress evidence that the Rule would be economically harmful or its earlier \nfindings that  receipt of cash or non-cash benefits up to the proposed 15% minimum \nthreshold does not seriously call “into question [a person’s] self-sufficiency.” 83 \nFR at 51165. \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(A)—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS— \nFAILURE TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS COMMENTS  \nTHAT CREDIT REPORTS ARE NOT A RELIABLE BASIS FOR  \nDETERMINING SELF-RELIANCE OF IMMIGRANTS \n142. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n143. An agency acts arbitrarily under the Administrative Procedure Act when it gives \n“dismissive treatment” to material objections to the agency’s purported justification \nfor final action. NorAm Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 148 F.2d at 1165. \n144. DHS acted arbitrarily in failing to address meaningfully the “many comment[]s” \n84 FR at 41425, that credit reports are not a reliable basis for determining an \nimmigrant’s present or future self-reliance. Yet, the Public Charge Rule’s negative \nfactors include whether an applicant has a poor credit score. 84 FR at 41502-04.  \n57 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 58 of 68\n145. Commenters noted that credit scores are especially poor indicators of whether an \nimmigrant is likely to become a public charge, because credit scores do not reflect \nthe subject’s history of paying rent, utilities, income, savings or other financial \nresources.  Credit  scores  measure  the  likelihood  that  a  borrower  will  make  a \npayment ninety or more days late on a credit obligation. Because recent immigrants \nare unlikely to have access to credit and are thus unable to demonstrate a positive \npayment history, a credit score or report does not predict an immigrant’s long-term \nfinancial stability. See generally 84 FR at 41426-28. \n146. Credit scores and reports may also be inaccurate.58 For example, according to a \nFederal Trade Commission study, twenty-six percent of participants noted at least \none potentially material error on at least one of their three credit reports.59 Thirteen \npercent of the consumers’ credit scores increased as a result of modifying an error.60\nErrors in credit reports might be due to mismatched records, balance errors, data \nmanagement errors, and incorrect reporting of account status, among others.61 In \naddition, identity theft might inaccurately and inappropriately affect an individual’s \ncredit score.  \n58 Comments of Tzedek DC, DHS Docket No. USCIS-2010-0012, RIN 1615-AA22 (filed Dec. \n10, 2018). \n59 Federal Trade Comm’n, Report to Congress Under Section 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit \nTransactions Act of 2003 (Dec. 2012), \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/section-319-fair-and-accurate-\ncredittransactions-act-2003-fifth-interim-federal-trade-commission/130211factareport.pdf. \n60 Id. \n61 What are Common Credit Report Errors That I Should Look for on My Credit Report?, \nConsumer Fin.

DHS downplays the inability of credit scores to portray accurately an individual’s \nability to become self-sufficient. The agency relies on vague generalities as to what \na “good” or “poor” credit score might mean. 84 FR at 41428 (“A ‘good’ credit \nreport is generally near or slightly above the average of U.S. consumers, and \ntherefore the person may be self-sufficient and less likely to become a public \ncharge. A poor credit report is well below the average of U.S. consumers.”) \n(footnote omitted). But DHS makes no effort and presents no evidence to a show a \n“poor” credit score predicts long term dependency, rather than resulting from the \ninadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in compiling credit score histories.  \nCOUNT VI \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(D)–WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF \nPROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW \n148. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n149. The APA imposes two duties on an agency conducting a rulemaking: the notice \nmust specify “either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or description of \nthe subjects and issues involved,” and parties must be given “an opportunity to \nparticipate  in  the  rulemaking  through  submission  of  written  data,  views,  or \narguments.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) and (c). “The Courts of Appeals have generally \ninterpreted this to mean that the final rule the agency adopts must be “a ‘logical \nout-growth’ of the rule proposed.” Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 \nU.S. 158, 174 (2007). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted \nthese provisions to mean that “[a]lthough an agency, in its notice of proposed \nrulemaking, need not identify precisely every potential regulatory change, the \nnotice must be sufficiently descriptive to provide interested parties with a fair \n59 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 60 of 68\nopportunity to comment and to participate in the rulemaking.” Chocolate Mfrs. \nAss’n v. Block, 755 F.2d 1098, 1104 (4th Cir. 1985) (citations omitted). \n150. Here, the Proposed Rule suggested a shift from the 1999 Field Guidance’s criterion \nof “primarily dependent” on public benefits as the threshold for determining public \ncharge to a threshold criterion based on “receipt of monetizable public benefits . . . \n[whose] cumulative value . . . exceeds 15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines \n(FPG) for a household of one within any period of 12 consecutive months.” 83 FR \nat 51164. Based on 2018 data, the proposed threshold “would exclude up to $1,821 \nworth of monetizable public benefits for a household of one” from consideration in \nthe public charge determination. Id. \n151. The Proposed Rule justified the 15 percent quantity of benefits threshold stating it \n“would not lead to unintended consequences, as could be the case if there was no \nthreshold or the threshold was much smaller.” 83 FR at 51165. This threshold also \n“recognizes that individuals may receive public benefits in relatively small amounts \nto supplement their ability to meet their needs and the needs of their household \nwithout seriously calling into question their self-sufficiency.” Id. \n152. With one exception, a comment describing 15 percent as “an acceptable proxy,” \nthe agency’s final rule neither referenced the existence of, nor purported to respond \nto numerous comments urging that 15 percent was too low an amount of benefits. \nSee Public Charge Rule, 84 FR at 41357-58 (“many commenters voiced general \nopposition to the 15 percent threshold;” “commenters asserted that the standard \nshould be 50 percent of the FPG;” “the proposed threshold was so low that it would \nbe more of an indicator that the alien is subject to the inherent uncertainties and \n60 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 61 of 68\nexigencies of life . . . [than] an indicator of the alien’s ongoing dependence on \npublic benefits”). \n153. Rather than adopt the 15 percent threshold or respond to the overwhelming view of \nthe comments and adopt a larger threshold, DHS abandoned the quantity of benefits \nthreshold altogether and adopted instead an entirely new “single duration-based \nthreshold” in the final Public Charge Rule: “under this final rule, DHS will consider \nan alien likely to become a public charge at any time in the future if the alien is \nmore likely than not to receive public benefits for longer than 12 months in the \naggregate in any 36-month period.” Id. at 41358. In dollar terms, DHS admits that \nthis means that an individual could be found a public charge merely by receiving \n“hundreds of dollars, or less, in public benefits annually” – far below the $1,821 \nper year cut-off under the 15% threshold originally proposed. 84 FR at 41361. \n154. The final Rule restricts receipt of cash or non-cash benefits to “12 months in the \naggregate,” meaning, “for instance, receipt of two public benefits in one month \ncounts as two months.” Id. at 41297 (emphasis added). Put another way, if an \napplicant for permanent residence status temporarily took three non-cash public \nbenefits—food, housing and medical assistance—in any amount and for a period \nas short as four months within any 36-month period, that applicant would be treated \nas if he or she had been taking public assistance for 12 months. And DHS, in turn, \nwill treat this as a heavily-weighted negative factor in assessing whether the \napplicant would be likely to become a public charge.  Under the Proposed Rule, \nthat same person could have relied upon each of the listed three forms of assistance \n61 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 62 of 68\nseparately for 11 months within a 36-month period without incurring a negative \nfactor for immigration purposes. \n155. The Public Charge Rule’s approach is the opposite of what had been proposed; the \nProposed Rule had rejected a no quantity threshold approach because it could lead \nimmigrants to be excluded as “public charges” after they had received “relatively \nsmall amounts to supplement their ability to meet their needs and the needs of their \nhousehold [which do not] seriously call[] into question their self-sufficiency.” 83 \nFR at 51165. Eliminating the threshold has the same “unintended consequences” \n(id.) of making people excludable based on receipt of far smaller amounts and \nduration of benefits than the Proposed Rule had allowed. The final Public Charge \nRule thus did exactly what the Proposed Rule had assured the public it would not \ndo. Id.\n156. In cases where “a final rule reaches a conclusion exactly opposite to that proposed,” \na reviewing court is “not constrained by the same degree of deference [a court] must \nafford most agency determinations.” Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n, 755 F.2d at 1103. \nUnder the APA’s notice requirements, 5 U.S.C. § 553, an agency “does not have \ncarte blanche to establish a rule contrary to its original proposal;” rather, “the notice \nmust be sufficiently descriptive to provide interested parties with a fair opportunity \nto comment and to participate in the rulemaking.” Id. at 1104 (citations omitted). \n157. To determine if a notice is sufficiently descriptive of the rule finally adopted, courts \nhave “noted the absence of comments from groups which could be expected to \noppose downgrading the performance criteria.” Id. at 1105; see, e.g., Sprint Corp. \nv. FCC, 315 F.3d 369, 376 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (because parties “did not appreciate \n62 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 63 of 68\nthat  the  [agency]  was  contemplating”  a  particular  point,  “the  commenters \nunderstandably  submitted  no  comments  on  this  point”).  Here,  DHS  cited  no\ncomments suggested a downgrading from a 15 percent to a smaller threshold for \nuse of benefits, referenced only one comment that supported 15 percent, and \nindicated that all others supported a quantity threshold above the proposed 15 \npercent limit. 84 FR at 41357-58. Given the agency’s earlier finding that replacing \nthe 15 percent threshold with a “much smaller” or “no threshold” might lead to \n“unintended consequences,” 83 FR at 51165, it would not have been reasonable to \nassume that the agency would adopt a standard below that threshold—especially \none so low that “the alien who exceeds the [newly devised] duration threshold may \nreceive only hundreds of dollars, or less, in public benefits annually.” 84 FR 41361 \n(emphasis added). Indeed, that such an assumption was beyond the pale can be \nreasonably inferred both from the absence of a reference in the agency’s final rule \nto any comments suggesting elimination of the 15% threshold and the agency’s \nacknowledgment that there was overwhelming objection to the originally proposed \n15% threshold as too low. The foregoing demonstrates “the final rule substantially \ndeparts from the terms or substance of the proposed rule, [and thus] the notice is \ninadequate.” Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n, 755 F.2d at 1105. Had interested persons \nunderstood that the agency was considering elimination of the 15% threshold they \nwould have, and should have, had the opportunity to comment on the inconsistency \nbetween such a change and the agency’s own findings that receipt of benefits below \nthe 15% threshold would not seriously call the applicant’s self-sufficiency into \n63 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 64 of 68\nquestion (83 FR at 51165)—even if “their comments may well have been futile.” \n755 F.2d at 1107. \nCOUNT VII  \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(B)- DENIAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO  \nEQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS \n158. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of \nthe preceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n159. A court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n160. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids \nthe federal government from denying equal protection of the laws.62 It is an equal \nprotection violation where a “discriminatory purpose” was a “motivating factor” in \na government decision.63\n161. The Public Charge Rule was motivated by Defendants’ intent to discriminate on \nthe basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and nationality. \n162. The Public Charge Rule discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, national \norigin,  and  nationality,  and  was  motivated  by  discriminatory  and  baseless \nstereotypes concerning the receipt of public benefits by immigrants, particularly \n62 See, e.g., Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234 (1979); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 500 \n(1954). \n63 Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977).

Defendants’ \nstatements provide direct evidence of their discriminatory motives in enacting the \nPublic Charge Rule. \n163. In addition, the Public Charge Rule will cause Latinos, Asians, and Africans to be \ndisproportionately excluded from the United States. An analysis of the Public \nCharge Rule found that it would potentially block up to 71 percent of all applicants \nfrom Mexico and Central America, 69 percent of applicants from Africa, and 52 \npercent of applicants from Asia. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, \nNo. 1:18 cv 3636, 2019 WL 4598011, at *6 (September 20, 2019). \n164. The Public Charge Rule fails strict scrutiny because its broad focus on the receipt \nof  “public  assistance”  by  immigrants  is  not  narrowly  tailored  to  the  goal  of \npreventing immigrants from becoming primarily dependent upon public benefits. \n165. Through the actions described in this Complaint, the Public Charge Rule violates \nthe APA as contrary to the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n166. Plaintiffs have standing to assert violations of the APA. In addition, local governments \nmay assert the equal protection claims of their immigrant residents and their families. \nGaithersburg is injured by the Public Charge Rule, as described above. See, supra,\n¶¶ 8-15.\n167. Gaithersburg  has  close  relationships  with  those  who  take  their  public  benefits, \nincluding their medical, legal, educational, food, and housing services. Because local \ngovernments are better off when all of their residents can access the public benefits to \nwhich they are entitled, regardless of immigration status, Gaithersburg will serve as an \nespecially effective advocate for the equal protection claims.\n65 \nCORE/2052922.0049/156864201.1 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PWG   Document 41   Filed 01/03/20   Page 66 of 68\n168. Finally,  Gaithersburg’s  immigrant  residents  and  the  residents  of  Senator \nWaldstreicher’s district and their families face impediments to bringing their claims in \ntheir own names because they fear the potential immigration consequences of coming \nforward,  suffer  from  language-related  and  other  barriers,  and  cannot  bear  the \nsignificant economic and logistical burdens of participating in litigation.

Last  fall  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”)  proposed  a  new  set  of \nregulations that, by the agency’s own account, would make it substantially more difficult for \n2 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 3 of 62\n \nlawful immigrants to qualify for permanent legal resident status.2 The new rules are designed \nto expand the universe of persons the agency may permissibly characterize as likely to \nbecome “public charges” and thus ineligible to become permanent legal residents. Departing \nfrom more than a century of judicial precedent, as well as the agency’s own decades-long \npractices, the new rule would label not only the destitute and those primarily reliant on \ngovernment cash assistance as persons likely to become “public charges,” but also millions \nof immigrants holding down full time, but low-paying, jobs. This rule would treat a lawful \nimmigrant’s receipt of even nominal levels of non-cash assistance (such as rental vouchers, \nmedical services or food) for periods as short as four months as a “heavily-weighted” negative \nfactor  in  that  individual’s  application  for  permanent  residence  status,  even  where  the \nindividual is fully-employed. \n2.  DHS received over a quarter million public comments that the agency itself characterized as \noverwhelmingly opposed to the proposed rule. Yet, the agency’s final rule actually makes it \neven harder for lawful immigrants to qualify for permanent legal residence than the proposed \nrule. See Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, Final Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. (“FR”) 41282 \n(Aug. 14, 2019) (“Public Charge Rule” or “Rule”). The Rule violates the Administrative \nProcedures Act and should be vacated for several reasons: 1) it lacks an adequate—or in \nseveral respects, any—justification and the stated justification is contrary to the evidence; 2) \nit  overrides  longstanding  agency  policy  on  which  substantial  reliance  interests  have \ndeveloped, without adequate evidence to establish the need for the change; 3) DHS failed to \nperform an adequate cost-benefit analysis, and it failed to address substantive comments \n                                                \n2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs., U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, Inadmissibility on \nPublic Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114-01, 51,198, to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 103, 212, \n213, 214, 245, and 248) (Oct. 10, 2018).   \n3 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 4 of 62\n \nconcerning the harms the Rule will cause; 4) DHS failed to follow notice and comment \nprocedures by publishing a final Rule which was substantively different from the Proposed \nRule, without providing an opportunity for public comment on the new Rule; and 5) it is \nmotivated by race, ethnic, and national origin bias in violation of the constitutional right to \nequal protection. \n3.  The Public Charge Rule makes dramatic changes to immigration policy that are designed to \nreduce legal immigration levels and to disfavor poorer immigrants and immigrants of color. \nInitially DHS ticked off the boxes for notice and comment, but it flouted the intent of this \nprocess by relying on racial, ethnic, and national origin bias, while ignoring the actual \nevidence, including that presented in public comments, and then promulgating a final rule \nthat was substantively different. Predictably, the result is illogical. DHS’s stated objective—\nto  ensure  that  immigrants  granted  permanent  legal  status  do  not  become  a  burden  on \ntaxpayers—runs directly counter to the evidence of its impact. The federal government’s own \nstudies show that new immigrants are more likely than the U.S. born population to join and \nstay in the workforce, and thus to pay taxes. Data from the government’s own Census Bureau \nindicates that the Rule will increase, not decrease, the overall burden on taxpayers. With a \ndeclining birthrate among native born Americans, an increasing flow of immigrants is needed \nsimply to replace those who leave the workforce through death or retirement. By reducing \nthe level of legal immigration, the Public Charge Rule will place an even greater burden on \nthe declining number of tax-paying native-born Americans still in the workforce to support \nthose dependent on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and a variety of other government \n4 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 5 of 62\n \nservices.3 Thus, the Public Charge Rule is worse than a solution in search of a problem. It is \na problem, in and of itself. \n4.  Plaintiffs  are  a  broad-based  coalition  comprised  by  local  governments,  an  elected \nrepresentative, and a number of non-profit and faith-based agencies providing legal and social \nservices to immigrant populations and their families. Plaintiffs, the constituents they serve \nand the communities they represent will suffer actual injury as a result of the Public Charge \nRule. The Public Charge Rule will place a greater burden on health care, food security, \nhousing assistance and other services Plaintiffs provide. Immigrants and their citizen family \nmembers,  afraid  of  being  designated  public  charges  and  jeopardizing  legal  status,  will \ndisenroll from or forgo participation in federal nutrition, health care and housing programs \nto which they are lawfully entitled. This will place a greater burden not only on non-profit \nsocial service agencies, but also on state, local and county government assistance programs. \nIn addition, when immigrants and their citizen family members withdraw altogether from \ngovernment assistance programs, including those provided by the Mayor and City Council \nof Baltimore (“Baltimore”) and by Gaithersburg, those jurisdictions’ public health and safety \nand general welfare is harmed. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as this case arises \nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n6.

Baltimore is the \nlargest city in Maryland and the thirtieth largest city in the United States, with a population \nof more than 600,000, according to 2016 Census estimates. \n9.  “Over the course of the 20th century, Baltimore has welcomed many immigrants from all \naround the world.”5 More recently, Baltimore has become yet another “story of large influxes \nof immigrants bringing new vibrancy to America’s storied, yet aging cities.”6 As of 2016, \n                                                \n4 “Baltimore” refers to Plaintiff, the municipal corporation. “City” or “City of Baltimore” refers \nto the geographic jurisdiction. \n5 The Role of Immigrants in Growing Baltimore, City of Baltimore 4 (Sept. 2014) [hereinafter \nThe Role of Immigrants], https://www.abell.org/sites/default/files/publications/cd-role \nimmigrants914.pdf.  \n6 Id. \n6 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 7 of 62\n \nmore than 48,000 foreign-born immigrants called the City of Baltimore home,7 with more \nthan  half  of  that  population  arriving  since  2000.8  Baltimore’s  immigrant  population  is \nmajority Latin American, African, and Asian.9 \n10.  Baltimore views  it as “crucial that [Baltimore] recognizes, expands, and develops  new \nstrategies to welcome immigrants and help facilitate an easy transition to life as Baltimoreans \nso these immigrants choose to make [the City] their permanent home.”10 Approximately 7.2 \npercent  of  all  immigrants  in  the  City  were  entrepreneurs  in  2016.11  Thus,  “attracting \nadditional immigrants to the [C]ity would make a significant difference in the [C]ity’s future \neconomic prospects.”12 \n11.  Baltimore strives to show immigrant communities that it is a welcoming City by promoting \ntheir wellbeing, economic development, and integration. Baltimore does so by providing \nhealth  care  services  (including  immunizations),  early  childhood  education,  nutrition \nassistance to school children, fire and police protection, as well as housing and job training \nservices. Facilitating the development and progress of immigrants in civic life, including \nwithin the workforce and the greater economy, the City’s religious and cultural life, and \nneighborhood and political affairs promotes the growth, prosperity, public health and public \nsafety of the City as a whole. In addition, as a welcoming city, Baltimore seeks to enhance \n                                                \n7 Selected Characteristics of the Native and Foreign-Born Populations, 2012-2016 American \nCommunity Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau, \nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk. \n8 The Role of Immigrants, at 5. \n9 Id. \n10 Id. \n11 NAE Cities Index, New Am.

Immigrants in the City of Baltimore and their families may refuse to accept public benefits \nand services—even if they need them—if they fear immigration consequences. In 2012, then-\nMayor  Stephanie  Rawlings-Blake  issued  an  executive  order  stating  that  “[t]he  City  of \nBaltimore remains committed to ensuring public safety, public health, and vital services on \nwhich  the  entire  community  depends.”13  For  that  reason,  she  directed  that  “[n]o  City \nDepartment, agency, officer or employee shall condition the provision of City services or \nbenefits on the immigration status of the individual seeking those services or benefits unless \nsuch conditions are lawfully imposed by federal or state law.”14 For its efforts, Baltimore \nreceived the second-highest score in the county in one study of the integration of immigrants \ninto local communities.15 \n13.  The Public Charge Rule will harm Baltimore by sowing confusion among immigrants and \ntheir families as to the consequences of accepting public benefits, and chilling them from \npursuing such benefits. As a result, immigrants will take advantage of fewer public benefits, \nor will shift from federal programs – like Medicaid – to in-kind local programs – like free or \nreduced-cost Baltimore City Health Department (“BCHD”) clinics.  \n                                                \n13 Baltimore City Executive Order: Advancing Public Safety and Access to City Services, City of \nBaltimore 1, \nhttps://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MDBALT/2012/03/01/file_attachments/97683/exec\n001.pdf. \n14 Id. at 2. \n15 NAE Cities Index, New Am.

Plaintiff  the  City  of  Gaithersburg,  Maryland  (“Gaithersburg”)  is  the  fourth  largest \nincorporated city in the state of Maryland, with a population of about 70,000, nearly 40% of \nwhom  are  foreign-born.  Gaithersburg’s  Community  Services  Division  implements  and \nsupports assistance programs encompassing interim case management, community outreach, \neducation,  housing  counseling,  financial  wellness,  emergency  assistance  and  safety-net \nservices, and it provides resources and referrals to Gaithersburg residents in need. The \nDivision  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  maintains  comprehensive  housing \npolicies and programs that provide fair, affordable options in homeownership and rental \nopportunities. Housing programs administered by Gaithersburg include closing cost and \ndown payment assistance for first-time homebuyers and deferred loans for homeowners and \nqualified tenants who wish to make their homes accessible for anyone with a disability. The \nHomeless Services Division is responsible for homeless advocacy, community education on \nhomelessness,  outreach  services,  housing,  and  linking  homeless  individuals  to  needed \nservices. Gaithersburg and its community partners offer a number of programs and services \nto ensure that those facing hunger have access to healthy foods throughout the year, including \nthe Student Supper Program, through which the City of Gaithersburg Olde Towne Youth \nCenter provides free, nutritious suppers to children ages 18 and under. Gaithersburg also \nprovides information, referrals and navigation assistance for a myriad of services offered by \nlocal, federal and state agencies, and nonprofit organizations, including in the areas of \nimmigration, housing, health, and mental health. \n15.  The Public Charge Rule is harming Gaithersburg by creating uncertainty about immigrant \neligibility for permanent residence status and causing immigrants and their family members \nto forgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. As a result, immigrants and their \n9 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 10 of 62\n \nfamilies will increasingly rely on City-run health, nutritional, homelessness and social service \nprograms, as well as on similar programs operated by non-profit organizations that receive \nCity funds. This will put a strain on and divert Gaithersburg’s resources from other priorities \nand, because many resident may forgo use of public benefits altogether, the Public Charge \nRule will adversely affect the health of Gaithersburg’s residents. \n16.  Plaintiff Maryland State Senator Jeff Waldstreicher (“State Senator Waldstreicher”) serves \nMaryland District 18, which is home to about 120,000 persons, about one third of whom are \nforeign born. Twenty-five percent of District 18 identifies as Hispanic, making it the largest \npopulation of Hispanic residents in Montgomery County and the second largest population \nof Hispanic residents in the state. \n17.  The Public Charge Rule is impeding State Senator Waldstreicher’s ability to safeguard the \nhealth and wellbeing of his constituents by causing immigrants and their family members to \nforgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. As a result, to the extent immigrants and \ntheir families continue to access government benefits at all, they will increasingly rely on \nstate-run health, nutritional, and social service programs, as well as on similar programs \noperated by non-profit organizations that receive state funds. The Public Charge Rule has \nalso had and will continue to have a chilling effect and significant negative impact on public \nhealth in in his district. The immigrant residents and their family members within Senator \nWalstreicher’s district face significant obstacles in bringing this suit on their own, “as they \nmay hold a credible fear that suing the federal government would torpedo” their chances or \nthe chances of their family members to obtain permanent residence status. See Mayor and \nCity Council of Baltimore v. Trump, et al, Case 1:18-cv-3636-ELH, 2019 WL 4598011, at \n*18 (D. Md.

Plaintiff Friends of Immigrants (“FOI”) is a volunteer organization based in Red Wing, \nGoodhue  County,  Minnesota.  FOI  publicly  supports  immigrants  and  recognizes  their \neconomic, cultural, social, and individual importance in the Goodhue County community. \nAmong its functions, FOI supports immigrants in navigating local resources to obtain the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. FOI also acts to promote immigrants’ rights  more \ngenerally. \n19.  The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm FOI by straining its resources \nto help immigrants become fully integrated into the community. The Rule’s adverse impacts \nare already being felt, as persons who would otherwise qualify for benefits that would help \nthem fully participate in the community are disenrolling or choosing to forgo these benefits \nout of fear of that it will impact their efforts to become legal residents or citizens. As a result, \nFOI must divert resources from its existing programs to educate and to assist immigrants in \nnavigating the new rules. \n20.  Plaintiff  Immigrant  Law  Center  of  Minnesota  (“ILCM”)  enhances  opportunities  for \nimmigrants  and  refugees  through  legal  representation  for  low-income  individuals,  and \nthrough education and advocacy with diverse communities. ILCM serves immigrants and \nrefugees residing in the state of Minnesota who earn less than 187.5 percent of federal poverty \nguidelines. In 2018, ILCM served clients coming from 112 countries, with 36 percent of \nILCM cases originating  from Mexico, 19 percent from countries  in Central and South \nAmerica, 20 percent from countries in Asia, 20 percent from countries in Africa, and the \nremaining 5 percent from countries in Europe, Oceania, and from Canada. \n21.  ILCM provides a wide range of legal services to low-income immigrants and refugees, \nincluding: \n11 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 12 of 62\n \n•  Assisting  clients  in  preparing  and  presenting  citizenship  applications,  and  in  passing \nexams; reuniting families by helping citizens and permanent residents to petition for family \nmembers abroad; keeping families together through family petitions; and preventing the \nseparation of families by providing representation for persons in removal proceedings; \n•  Assisting  families  and  individuals  in  filing  asylum  applications;  assisting  battered \nimmigrant women and children in filing Violence against Women Act petitions; assisting \nvictims of serious crimes in obtaining U-Visas; \n•  Providing legal representation for young immigrants through its DREAMers Immigration \nProject; \n•  Pursuing judicial appeals to vindicate the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of immigrants; \n•  Advocating for fair and comprehensive immigration reform; and \n•  Educating immigrants, professionals, and the general community about immigration and \nthe issues faced by immigrants and refugees. \n22.  Since its beginning, ILCM has assisted tens of thousands of immigrants to secure legal status \nin the United States and to overcome the challenges of obtaining work authorization and \ncitizenship. In 2018, ILCM provided legal services in 4,270 unique cases with clients from \n112 countries. It reached more than 5,400 individuals through more than 130 education and \nadvocacy presentations, in addition to numerous appearances on radio and television. Its \nservices help break down barriers and make meaningful improvements to immigrant families’ \nlives, allowing them a safe and sustainable future in Minnesota. \n23.  The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm to ILCM. ILCM’s mission of \nadvocating for the rights of low-income immigrant communities is inseparable from the \ninterests of its clients in not being denied admission or adjustment of their immigration status, \n12 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 13 of 62\n \nin receiving vital public benefits, and in maintaining family integrity and unity. Defendants’ \nactions have caused the organization to divert resources to educate its staff on the new Public \nCharge Rule. In August 2019 alone, ILCM’s staff spent considerable amounts of time away \nfrom normal duties learning the intricacies of the new Rule, interacting with partners at \nvarious legal aid organizations, organizing educational materials, planning training sessions \nand community information options in case the Rule goes into effect, and meeting with \ncommunity partners who are concerned about both the Public Charge Rule’s adverse actual \nand chilling effects for immigrants. \n24.  Defendants’ actions also will cause ILCM’s staff to spend additional time with each client, \nthus diverting additional resources from the organization, to educate them about the Rule, to \naddress the modified “totality of the circumstances”  factors as applied to each client’s \nsituation, to document the new form I-944, and to demonstrate why the client is not likely to \nbecome a public charge under the newly adopted definition. Because ILCM’s staff currently \noperates at capacity and has a waitlist of potential new clients, these extra hours will create \nsignificant delays and otherwise strain ILCM’s limited resources. \n25.  Beside the adverse impact on ILCM’s resources in dealing with potential and accepted cases, \na further strain on its resources has already occurred and will continue in educating clients \nwho are not subject to the Public Charge Rule, but are nonetheless fearful about their status \nif they obtain public benefits for themselves or their children. Another strain resulting from \nthe Rule concerns ILCM’s interactions with various state and private organizations that work \nwith refugees with health issues or who have suffered domestic violence, either in the form \nof individual consultations with ILCM on behalf of their clients or through ILCM-led staff \ntrainings on the new Public Charge Rule. \n13 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 14 of 62\n \n26.  Plaintiff  the  Jewish  Community  Relations  Council  of  Greater  Washington  (“JCRC”) \nrepresents over 100 constituent Jewish agencies, organizations and synagogues in the District \nof Columbia, Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. The JCRC serves as the chief \nadvocate for the DC area Jewish community to elected officials, government agencies, other \nfaith and ethnic communities, and the media. Among its other work, the JCRC has a long \nhistory of advocacy and community engagement on public policy issues directly impacting \nlocal refugee and immigrant populations. As an outgrowth of American Jews’ history as an \nimmigrant population fleeing devastating persecution and poverty, the Jewish community has \nconsistently championed the rights of refugees and immigrants to be treated with fairness and \ncompassion as they seek safety and security in the United States. \n27.  Over the last two years JCRC has partnered with organizations such as HIAS, CASA, and \nVACALAO to: (1) support legislation that protects immigrant and refugee populations and \nthe agencies that serve them; (2) mobilize Jewish lawyers to provide pro bono assistance to \nimmigrants  pursuing  naturalization;  and  (3) sponsor  programming  highlighting  our \ncommunity’s moral commitment to the core American value of being a welcoming society \nfor all. JCRC’s members include: \n•  The Jewish Social Service Agency (“JSSA”), which provides social services including \nmeals, counseling, immigration resettlement, early childhood services, home care services \nfor  senior  citizens,  services  for  individuals  with  special  needs,  and  health  care  to \ncommunity members. JSSA staff includes home care service workers, many of whom are \nforeign born and who rely on non-cash assistance. \n•  The Jewish Foundation for Group Homes (“JFGH”), which provides individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and/or chronic mental disorders with the opportunity to live \n14 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 15 of 62\n \nindependently within the community with dignity, personal choice and respect regardless \nof faith or creed. JFGH’s programs support more than 200 individuals in over 70 sites \nthroughout the Washington metropolitan area. JFGH staff includes home care service \nworkers, many of whom are foreign born and who rely on non-cash assistance. \n•  The Jewish Council for the Aging of Greater Washington (“JCA”), through its Albert & \nHelen Misler Adult Day Center in Rockville has been offering activities, nursing and social \nwork services for older adults who are frail, ill, or cognitively impaired. JCA’s Senior \nCommunity Service Employment (“SCSEP”) provides on-the-job training for low income \njob seekers age 55+ in Montgomery and Frederick Counties. In addition, the program helps \nto staff WorkSource Montgomery’s American Job Center in Wheaton by providing a part-\ntime, onsite specialist on older workers. SCSEP serves 48-75 interns in any given week, \n50 percent of whom are foreign born. Their homelands include Peru, Ghana, Ethiopia, \nEritrea, Iran, and Panama. JCA staff includes home care service workers, many of whom \nare foreign born and who rely on non-cash assistance. \n28.  The Public Charge Rule has harmed and will continue to harm JCRC and its members, as it \ncreates uncertainty about immigrant eligibility for permanent residence status and causes \nimmigrants and their family members to forgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. \nAs a result, immigrants and their families will increasingly rely on JCRC’s and its members’ \nprograms for assistance in navigating this new terrain. Home care agencies and nursing \nfacilities like those operated by JCRC member agencies report “a growing shortage of aides, \nthanks to a combination of low wages, a strong economy, and past curbs on immigration. The \nmarket is so tight that some agencies are requiring their workers to sign non-compete \n15 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 16 of 62\n \nagreements to prevent them from moving to competitors or working directly for their clients. \n“16 \n29.  “And the shortage will only get worse as the Baby Boomers age. According to CareerCast, \nAmericans will require a half-million more home health aides and 750,000 more personal \ncare aides by 2025.”17  “According to Robert Espinoza of the Paraprofessional Healthcare \nInstitute  (PHI),  about  one-quarter  of  the  nation’s  4  million  direct  care  workers  are \nimmigrants. Because their wages are so low, about 43% of these immigrant workers access \nsome public benefits.” Two thirds of these individuals “receive Medicaid and more than half \nget food and nutrition assistance.” The new rules do not apply to current green card holders, \nbut “they effectively will end the pipeline for new workers in an industry with notoriously \nhigh turnover.”18 Experts at the Urban Institute “estimate that even  in response to the \nproposed  Public  Charge  Rule,  about one-in-five  low-income  workers  did  not  apply  or \nwithdrew from government benefit programs.”19 \n30.  “Others will work off-the-books. And some will, as the Administration intends, avoid coming \nto the U.S.”20 And that “will dramatically shrink the workforce available to assist frail elders \nand younger people with disabilities,”21 harming JCRC members in their ability to provide \nquality care.  \n                                                \n16 Howard Gleckman, How Frail Elders will Pay For Trump’s New Anti-Immigrant Rules, \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2019/08/12/how-frail-elders-will-pay-for-\ntrumps-new-anti-immigrant-rules/#3ddaa04d5b44.

Plaintiff the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (“JCPA”) is the national hub for more than \n125  local  Jewish  Community  Relations  Councils,  and  17  national  Jewish  agencies.  Its \nmandate is to advance the interests of the Jewish people to, among other things, promote a \njust American society. In this regard, and relevant to the Public Charge Rule, it has adopted \npolicies (1) to combat stereotypes about immigrants, (2) to maintain support for fair and \ngenerous legal immigration policies as an expression of our country’s core values of refugee \nprotection, family reunification and economic opportunity and (3) to work to ensure that \nthose seeking to enter the country legally with the intention to settle here permanently are \nafforded  a  reasonable,  effective,  and  judicious  process,  and  that  a  rational  and  timely \nmechanism be developed to establish immigrants’ status. \n32.  JCPA’s  Local  Member  Agencies  are  125  Jewish  Community  Relations  Councils  or \nCommittees around the country that provide social services on a non-sectarian basis to \nmembers of their communities, including immigrants and their family members, including: \n•  The Jewish Federations of North America—comprised of 147 Jewish Federations across \nNorth America—identifies, supports and addresses the full range of social service issues, \nprovides lifesaving humanitarian relief, and supports breakthrough programs for all ages. \nThe Jewish Federations of North America raise and distribute more than $3 billion annually \nfor social welfare, social services, and educational needs. \n33.  The Public Charge Rule  has harmed and will continue to harm the JCPA  by  creating \nuncertainty  about  immigrant  eligibility  for  permanent  residence  status  and  causing \nimmigrants and their family members to forgo federal assistance to which they are entitled. \nAs a result, immigrants and their families will increasingly rely on JCPA-run programs for \nassistance in navigating the new terrain. \n17 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 18 of 62\n \n34.  Plaintiff Tzedek DC provides pro bono legal assistance and advocacy services to safeguard \nthe legal rights of low-income DC residents dealing with often unjust, abusive, and illegal \ndebt collection practices, as well as other consumer protection problems like credit reporting \nissues, identity theft, and predatory lending. Tzedek DC provides low-income members of \nthe community, including immigrants, direct free legal services. Tzedek DC also provides \nsystemic and policy advocacy on behalf of client communities, and, in concert with its \ncommunity  partners,  preventative  financial  empowerment  and  community  education \nprogramming in English and Spanish. By addressing debt-related legal issues before they \nbecome  irreversible,  catastrophic  crises,  Tzedek  DC  enhances  the  overall  stability  and \nfinancial health of low-income DC families, including immigrants and their families. \n35.  The  Public  Charge  Rule  has  harmed  and  will  continue  to  harm  Tzedek  DC.  The \norganization’s mission of safeguarding the rights and interests of low-income immigrants \nresiding in the DC area who are facing debt-related problems will be frustrated because the \nRule places inappropriate weight on credit report information that is often inaccurate and \nunreliable. Tzedek DC’s immigrant clients who timely pay bills (such as rent and utilities) \nthat are not reported to credit reporting agencies will be adversely impacted by the Rule. In \naddition, Tzedek DC’s immigrant clients will tend to have newer credit histories and lower \ncredit scores and will be negatively impacted by the Rule for this reason as well. Immigrant \nclients who cannot pay medical debts will face potential adverse immigration consequences \nunder the Rule, forcing such clients to consider redirecting funds from their grocery or rent \nbudgets to pay medical debt or to forgo medical care entirely. Tzedek DC already has had to \nexpend resources to advise community partners and clients of the harms of the Rule, which \nhas diverted resources away from pursuing its mission and serving low-income DC residents \n18 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 19 of 62\n \nwho would otherwise benefit from its services. Tzedek DC has also launched a bilingual \nknow your rights information campaign designed to serve DC area immigrant households \ncalled “Sin Deudas, Sin Dudas,” Spanish for “No Debt, No Doubt.”  If the Public Charge \nRule stands, resources from this information campaign will be diverted to advise community \npartners and clients of the harms of the rule. \n36.  During the public notice-and-comment period regarding the Public Charge Rule, Plaintiffs \nCity of Baltimore, City of Gaithersburg, State Senator Waldstreicher, FOI, ILCM, JCRC, \nJCPA, and Tzedek DC submitted detailed comments documenting numerous harms the \nPublic  Charge  Rule  would  inflict on their  missions,  their  members,  their  clients, their \nimmigrant communities, and surrounding communities.22 Plaintiffs’ comments highlighted \nthe expected adverse effects that the Public Charge Rule would inflict on immigrants and \nrefugees  who  are  reliant on  DHS’s  longstanding  policy,  described  below, that  did  not \nconsider temporary non-cash public benefits as evidence that an individual was not self-\nsufficient. \n37.  Plaintiff Tzedek DC also jointly submitted with 49 consumer, civil rights, economic justice, \nfaith,  privacy,  and  advocacy  organizations  an  additional  comment opposing  the  Public \nCharge Rule’s radical expansion of the programs and factors to be considered in a public \ncharge analysis, particularly the provision that requires USCIS to consider an immigrant’s \ncredit  history  and  credit  score  in  the  public  charge  determination  as  ill-advised  and \ninappropriate. \n                                                \n22 Comments of Tzedek DC on Proposed Public Charge Rule, \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=USCIS-2010-0012-46339.  \n19 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 20 of 62\n \n38.  Plaintiff  Mayor  and  City  Council  of  Baltimore  submitted two  comments  opposing  the \nproposed Rule, one as part of a collaboration effort with a number of other municipalities, \nand one as the sole signatory.23  \nBACKGROUND \nII.  THE “PUBLIC CHARGE” EXCLUSION HAS LONG BEEN INTERPRETED TO \nAPPLY ONLY TO PERSONS WHO ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON \nGOVERNMENT CASH ASSISTANCE. \n39.  The term “public charge” has since its inception referred to persons who cannot care for \nthemselves and are thus primarily dependent on the government to avoid destitution. The \npredecessor agency to DHS, the Immigration and Nationalization Service (“INS”), noted in \n1999 that the “primary dependence model of public assistance was the backdrop against \nwhich the ‘public charge’ concept in immigration law developed in the 1800s.” 64 F.R. 28676 \n(May 26, 1999). \n40.  The term first appeared in an 1882 law barring the admission into the United States of “any \nconvict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without \nbecoming a public charge.” An Act to Regulate Immigration, ch. 376, § 2, 22 Stat. 214 \n(1882). \n41.  Since then, Congress has re-employed the term “public charge” over the years including in \n1891, 1903, 1907, 1917, 1952, 1990, and 1996 without expanding its meaning to include non-\ncash benefits, even as public assistance programs expanded over the years. \n                                                \n23 See Comments of New York City, Chicago, U.S. Conference of Mayors, et al.

Pugh, \nMayor of Baltimore, https://www.regulations.gov/contentStreamer?documentId=USCIS-2010-\n0012-51407&attachmentNumber=1&contentType=pdf. \n20 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 21 of 62\n \n42.  In 1952 Congress enacted the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Pub. L. 414, ch. 2, 66 Stat. \n163, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. (1952). Section 212 of that Act excluded from \nadmission individuals “who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application \nfor a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, \nare likely at any time to become public charges.” Id.  § 212(a)(15), 66 Stat. 163, 183, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(4)(A).  \n43.  The longstanding interpretation of the term “public charge” in these statutes had consistently \nbeen and continued after 1952 to be limited to a person who is destitute. As the Bureau of \nImmigration Appeals held, “[t]he words ‘public charge’ had their ordinary meaning: that is \nto say, a money charge upon or an expense to the public for support and care, the alien being \ndestitute.” Matter of Harutunian, 14 I. & N. Dec. 583, 586 (BIA 1974) (citations omitted). \n44.  Congress has not altered this well-established meaning of “public charge,” despite revisiting \nthe topic on many occasions. \n45.  For example, in 1965, Congress reversed previous national policy that restricted immigration \nfrom certain global regions and opened the U.S. to immigrants from all over the world \nwithout  modifying  the  well-established  meaning  of  public  charge.  Immigration  and \nNaturalization Act of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89-236. \n46.  In 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (“IRCA”), without \nmodifying the “public charge” definition. Instead, Congress provided additional grounds for \nwaivers allowing individuals deemed a public charge to overcome that determination and \nobtain admission.  8 U.S.C. § 1255a(d). \n47.  In 1987, the INS promulgated a regulation clarifying that applicants would not be subject to \nexclusion on public charge grounds if “the applicant demonstrates a history of employment \n21 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 22 of 62\n \nin the United States evidencing self-support without the receipt of public cash assistance.” \nAdjustment of Status for Certain Aliens, 52 FR 16205, 16211 (May 1, 1987) (emphasis \nadded), codified at 8 C.F.R. 245A. The INS defined “public cash assistance” as “income or \nneeds-based  monetary  assistance . . .  designed  to  meet  subsistence  levels  [such  as \n‘supplemental security income’].” Id. at 16,209. The agency specifically excluded “assistance \nin kind, such as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits” from those benefits \nthat would be considered in determining whether to render an individual a public charge. Id. \n(emphasis added). In addition, the regulation excluded from public charge consideration \nMedicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or children under 18 \nyears of age, or treatment in the interest of public health). Id. \n48.  Congress again declined to alter the “public charge” test in the Immigration Act of 1990, \ndespite making a number of other changes to immigration-related statutes. Pub. L. No. 101-\n649 (Nov. 29, 1990), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. \n49.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \nAct of 1996 (“PRWORA”), which imposed restrictions on immigrant eligibility for certain \npublic benefits. However, Congress did not alter the “public charge” test in this statute. \n50.  Congress again declined to change the meaning of “public charge” one month after passing \nthe PRWORA, when it enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \nAct of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), which codified the totality–of-the-circumstances test that had been \ndeveloped in case law and administrative policies. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(4)(B)(i). At that time, \nCongress considered but rejected an expanded definition of “public charge” that would have \nincluded individuals who received “federal public benefits for an aggregate of 12 months \nover a period of 7 years.” 142 Cong. Rec. S11882 (daily ed. Sept. 30, 1996). \n22 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 23 of 62\n \n51.  IIRIRA also introduced a provision that allowed the use of an affidavit of support as a means \nthat could be used to help an immigrant overcome the public-charge barrier, so long as the \nsponsor of the affidavit pledged to maintain the sponsored immigrant’s income at or above \n125 percent of the federal poverty level. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(4)(B)(ii); 1183a(a)(1)(A). \n52.  Upon learning that enacting both PRWORA (making immigrants ineligible for certain federal \nbenefits) and IIRIRA (codifying the totality of the circumstances test for “public charges”) \nin the same year had caused confusion, the INS and the State Department published several \ndocuments to confirm that the  longstanding  historic understanding of the term  “public \ncharge” remained operative. \n53.  In 1997, the INS issued internal guidance explaining that the IIRIRA “has not altered the \nstandards used to determine the likelihood of an alien to become a public charge nor has it \nsignificantly  changed  the  criteria  to  be  considered  in  determining  such  a  likelihood.” \nImmigration  and  Naturalization  Serv.,  Dep’t  of  Justice,  Public  Charge:  INA  Sections \n212(A)(4)  and  237(A)(5)—Duration  of  Departure  for  LPRs  and  Repayment  of  Public \nBenefits (Dec. 16, 1997). \n54.  Similarly, the State Department issued an internal update in 1998 that IIRIRA did “not \nchange[] the long-standing legal presumption that an able-bodied, employable individual will \nbe able to work upon arrival in the United States” and thus not become a public charge. State \nDepartment Cable no. 98-State-102426 (June 8, 1998), reprinted in 75 Interpreter Releases \n879  (June  29,  1998).  The  State  Department  further  stated  “[t]he  presumption  that  the \napplicant will find work coupled with the fact that the [affidavit of support] is a legally \nenforceable contract will provide in most cases a sufficient basis to accept a sponsor’s . . . \ntechnically sufficient [affidavit] as overcoming the public charge ground.” Id. \n23 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 24 of 62\n \n55.  Although these INS and State Department internal documents recognized that IIRIRA made \nno changes to the longstanding meaning or interpretation of the term “public charge,” by \n1999 the INS was concerned that public “confusion about the relationship between the receipt \nof public benefits and the concept of ‘public charge’ ha[d] deterred eligible [non-citizens] \nand  their  families,  including  U.S.  citizen  children,  from  seeking  important  health  and \nnutrition benefits that they are legally entitled to receive.” Field Guidance on Deportability \nand Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR 28689, 28692 (May 26, 1999) (“1999 \nField Guidance”). \n56.  The Field Guidance explained that “[t]his reluctance to access benefits has an adverse impact \nnot just on the potential recipients, but on public health and the general welfare.” Id. at 28692. \n57.  At the same time, the INS published a proposed rule for notice and public comment that the \nuncertainty  following  the  near  simultaneous  enactment  of  IIRIRA  and  PRWORA  was \n“undermining the Government policies of increasing access to health care and helping people \nto become self-sufficient.” Inadmissibility and Deportability on Public Charge Grounds, 64 \nFR 28676, 28677 (proposed May 26, 1999) (“Public Charge Grounds”). This rule was never \nissued in final form. \n58.  These two INS documents each confirmed that the longstanding historic understanding of the \nterm “public charge” remained operative. \n59.  The Public Charge Grounds confirmed that the term “public charge” meant an individual \n“who is likely to become . . . primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence, as \ndemonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or \ninstitutionalization for long-term care at Government expense.” Public Charge Grounds, 64 \nFR at 28,677. \n24 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 25 of 62\n \n60.  The 1999 Field Guidance also aimed to “help alleviate public confusion over the meaning of \nthe term ‘public charge’ in immigration law and its relationship to the receipt of Federal, \nState, and local public benefits” and to “provide aliens with better guidance as to the types of \npublic benefits that will and will not be considered in public charge determinations.” 1999 \nField Guidance, 64 FR at 28689. \n61.  The  1999  Field  Guidance  made  clear  that  only  receipt  of  cash  assistance  for  income \nmaintenance (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security \nIncome, and state equivalents) and publicly funded long-term institutionalization, and not \nnon-cash benefits, would be considered in making the public-charge determination.  1999 \nField Guidance, 64 FR at 28693. \n62.  In explaining the contemporaneous validity of the long standing definition of “public charge,” \nthe 1999 Field Guidance recognized that “federal, state, and local benefits are increasingly \nbeing made available to families with incomes far above the poverty level, reflecting broad \npublic policy decisions about improving general public health and nutrition, promoting \neducation, and assisting working-poor families in the process of becoming self-sufficient.” \nId. at 28,692. \n63.  As a corollary, “participation  in such  noncash programs  is not evidence of poverty or \ndependence”  because  they  “are  by  their  nature  supplemental  and  do  not,  alone  or  in \ncombination, provide sufficient resources to support an individual or family.” Id. By focusing \nonly on cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term institutionalization, the INS \ncould thus “identify those who are primarily dependent on the government for subsistence \nwithout inhibiting access to non-cash benefits that serve important public interests.” Id. \n25 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 26 of 62\n \n64.  The focus on cash benefits for making the public charge determination was consistent with \nthe advice provided by federal benefits agencies, including the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the Department of Agriculture, and the Social Security Administration, that \n“receipt  of  cash  assistance  for  income  maintenance  is  the  best  evidence  of  primary \ndependence  on  the  Government”  because  “non-cash  benefits  generally  provide \nsupplementary support . . . to low-income working families to sustain and improve their \nability to remain self-sufficient.” Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR at 28677–78. \n65.  Indeed, the INS could not “conceive of a situation where an individual . . . could support \nhimself or his family solely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily dependent on the \n[G]overnment,” other than for long-term institutionalization at government expense. Id. at \n28678. \n66.  In addition, according to the Public Charge Grounds, “[p]ast receipt of non-cash benefits \n[e.g., Medicaid, CHIP as well as similar state and local programs] should be excluded from \nconsideration for public charge purposes.” Id. \n67.  Congress has expanded immigrants’ access to benefits that had been explicitly excluded from \nthe public charge determination without indicating that they should be factored into the \ndetermination. In the 2002 Farm Bill, for example, Congress restored eligibility for food \nstamps  (now  known  as  Supplemental  Nutritional  Assistance  Program  or  “SNAP”)  to \nimmigrant children, immigrants receiving disability benefits, and adults who had lived in the \nUnited States in a “qualified” immigrant status for five years. Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act of 2002, Pub L. No. 107-171 (May 13, 2002). \n68.  As recently as 2018, the Congressional Research Service confirmed that Defendants’ position \nhad been consistent and clear:  \n26 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 27 of 62\n \n[P]ublic  charge  determination[s]  for  aliens  applying  for  adjustment  to  [Legal \nPermanent Residency] status, only consider[s] cash income maintenance benefits \nand government-funded institutionalization for long-term care. Cash assistance for \nincome  maintenance . . .  ‘includes  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI),  cash \nassistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program \nand state or local cash assistance programs for income maintenance, often called \n“general assistance” programs’ . . . . [A]n alien’s past or current receipt of these \nbenefits or of government funded long-term care does not automatically lead to a \ndetermination  of  inadmissibility,  but  instead  only  factors  into the  prospective \nanalysis under the totality of the circumstances test.  \nCongressional Research Service, Immigration: Frequently Asked Questions about “Public \nCharge” at 7 (Sept. 19, 2018) (available at https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45313.pdf). \n69.  Although  Congress,  DHS,  and  the  State  Department  have  interpreted  “public  charge” \nconsistently over time, altering the definition of “public charge” has been a clear priority \nfrom the early days of the Trump Administration. During the President’s first month in office, \nan executive order reinterpreting the term was leaked to the public, but never issued.24 \n70.  In 2017, the Administration endorsed the Reforming American Immigration for Strong \nEmployment (“RAISE”) Act that would have eliminated some of the family-based admission \npreferences created by the 1965 Act and established a point-based system based on factors \nincluding age, formal education, English language proficiency, and highly-compensated \nemployment for evaluating potential immigrants. Congress did not pass the RAISE Act. S.B. \n354, 115th Cong., 1st sess. (2017). \n                                                \n24 Read the Trump administration’s draft proposal penalizing immigrants who accept almost any \npublic benefit, Wash. Post., http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-trump-\nadministrations-draft-proposal-penalizing-immigrants-who-accept-almost-any-public-\nbenefit/2841/.   \n27 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 28 of 62\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED RULE REDEFINED THE MEANING OF “PUBLIC \nCHARGE.” \n71.  On October 10, 2018, DHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) \nregarding the public charge ground for inadmissibility. 83 FR 51114. \n72.  The Proposed Rule sought to redefine the meaning of public charge and to significantly \nchange the process by which DHS decides whether an applicant would likely become a public \ncharge and thus be inadmissible. \n73.  The Proposed Rule abandoned the long-standing understanding of a public charge as a person \nwho was and would remain primarily dependent on the government over the long term. It \nproposed to impose a new threshold that any applicant who received public benefits valued \nat  more  than  15  percent  of  the  Federal  Poverty  Guideline  for  a  household  of  one \n(approximately $5 per day) for a period of 12 consecutive months would be considered a \npublic charge. 83 FR at 51164-65. \n74.  The Proposed Rule also expanded the benefits to be considered to include non-cash benefits, \nlike food supplements, public health insurance, and housing assistance. Id.  The Proposed \nRule  classified  subsidies  like  SNAP  and  Section  8  housing  vouchers  as  “monetizable \nbenefits” and services like Medicaid as “non-monetizable benefits.” If an applicant received \nboth simultaneously, then use of the non-monetizable benefits for only nine months in \naggregate within a 36-month period would render the applicant a public charge. Id. at 51,158, \n51,290. \n75.  The  Proposed  Rule  also  would  assign  positive,  negative,  heavily  positive,  and  heavily \nnegative weights to enumerated factors. Id. at 51,291-92. \n76.  DHS acknowledged that the changes to the determination of “public charge” will likely create \na chilling effect causing immigrants to take advantage of fewer public benefits for which they \n28 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 29 of 62\n \nare eligible. Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds, 83 Fed. Reg. 51,114, 51,266 (Oct. \n10, 2018); Id. at 51,268 (“There may also be additional reductions in transfer payments from \nstates to individuals who may choose to disenroll from or forego enrollment in a public \nbenefits program.”).  \n77.  The Proposed Rule received over 266,000 comments, “the vast majority of which opposed \nthe rule.” Public Charge Rule, 84 FR at 41297. \nIV.  THE FINAL PUBLIC CHARGE RULE DEPARTS FROM SETTLED LAW \nDEFINING “PUBLIC CHARGE” TO MEAN PRINCIPAL DEPENDENCE ON \nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT CASH ASSISTANCE. \n78.  The final Public Charge Rule changes both the public charge definition and the process by \nwhich DHS determines whether an applicant is likely to meet this definition in the future. See \ngenerally 84 Fed. Reg. at 41297-300 (summary of changes). \n79.  Despite the longstanding exclusion of supplemental, non-cash benefits from the public charge \nanalysis, the Public Charge Rule creates a new standard for public charge that requires an \napplicant to show s/he has maintained what is, in effect, something close to total self-\nsufficiency, a concept which the Public Charge Rule admits is “not codified in the INA itself.” \n84 FR at 41356.  \n80.  DHS’s redefinition of public charge to mean “a person who receives the designated benefits \nfor  more than 12  months  in the aggregate of any 36-month period,” 84 FR at 41357, \ncontravenes Congressional intent, regulatory history, and decades of case law which all rely \non  the  primarily  dependent  standard  that  excluded  non-cash  benefits.  Moreover,  the \npredictable consequences of the Public Charge Rule are that immigrant communities will \nbecome  less  healthy,  less  educated,  and  less  equipped  for  the  workforce,  significantly \nundermining their ability to attain self-sufficiency by supplementing low-paying, full-time \n29 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 30 of 62\n \nemployment with reliance on non-cash public benefits programs that Congress created and \nextended to immigrants for that very purpose. \n81.  The Public Charge Rule also fails to acknowledge  long-standing agency guidance that \nimmigrants’  use  of  supplemental,  non-cash  benefits  did  not  raise  apprehensions  about \nimproper incentives nor was their use considered inimical to achieving self-sufficiency. See \n1999 Field Guidance, 64 FR at 28692. Further, the Rule proffers no evidence that immigrants \nare motivated by participation in non-cash benefits programs to come or to stay in the United \nStates  or  that  immigrants  who  use  supplemental,  non-cash  benefits  typically  became \nprimarily dependent on the government, rather than using those benefits as assistance to \nbecome upwardly mobile and more self-sufficient. \n82.  While the Public Charge Rule projects certain cost advantages for federal and state budgets \nthat allegedly will result from disenrollment or failure to enroll in supplemental, non-cash \nbenefits programs,  it fails to account for a wide range of public  health, public safety, \neconomic,  and  administrative  cost  injuries  that  Plaintiffs  will  suffer  as  a  result  of \ndisenrollment or foregone participation in those programs by immigrants fearful of losing \ntheir status. \nV.  THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE WAS MOTIVATED BY RACIAL, ETHNIC, \nNATIONAL ORIGIN AND NATIONALITY ANIMUS. \n83.  Throughout his campaign and time in office, President Trump has made clear his intent to \nlimit the number of immigrants from Latin American, African, and Asian countries. Most \nnotably, President Trump asked, “Why do we want all these people from ‘shithole countries’ \n30 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 31 of 62\n \ncoming  here?”,25  a  remark  Senator  Lindsey  Graham  described  as  “incredibly \ndisappointing.”26  Similarly,  Trump  has  described  immigrants  from  those  countries  as \n“infesting” the United States.27 \n84.  President Trump’s view on limiting immigration from “shithole countries” is in turn based \non his discriminatory belief that immigrants from such countries are poorer and consequently \ndrain taxpayer resources. During a meeting in the Oval Office, President Trump complained \nthat immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS” and that once immigrants from Nigeria had seen \nthe United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”28 At the same time, President \nTrump “suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from countries \nsuch as Norway,” and he was “open” to immigrants from some Asian countries thought to be \neconomically beneficial.29 \n                                                \n25 Eli Watkins & Abby Phillip, Trump Decries Immigrants from ‘Shithole Countries’ Coming to \nUS, CNN (Jan. 12, 2018), https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-\ncountries-trump/index.html. \n26 Emma Dumain, A Day Later, Lindsey Graham Breaks Public Silence on Trump’s ‘Shithole’ \nRemarks, McClatchy (Jan. 12, 2018), https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-\ngovernment/congress/article194434204.html. \n27 Donald J.

President Trump has made no secret of his views that immigrants drain public resources. In \n2018, Trump promoted an article titled “Shock report: US paying more for illegal immigrant \nbirths than Trump’s wall.”30 President Trump has also stated: \n•  “ObamaCare gives free insurance to illegal immigrants.”31 \n \n•  “Your tax dollars well spent. Over 1.295M ObamaCare enrollees will also be illegal \nimmigrants.”32 \n \n•  “It’s a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and \nreceive free health care.”33 \n \n•  “We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating \nillegal immigrants better than our veterans.”34 \n86.  As a candidate and in office, President Trump endorsed significant cuts to legal immigration \nand challenged the centrality of family reunification to federal immigration policy. The \nofficial White House website states that “the President supports ending chain migration, \neliminating the Visa Lottery, and moving the country to a merit-based entry system.”35  \n87.  Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the media obtained a draft of \nan “Executive Order on Protecting Taxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws \nPromote Accountability and Responsibility.” The draft Executive Order instructed DHS to \n                                                \n30 Donald J.

In  2017,  two  U.S.  senators  introduced  a  bill  designed  to  significantly  reduce  legal \nimmigration by, for example, curbing the government’s long-established policy favoring \nfamily  reunification.  The  Reforming  American  Immigration  for  a  Strong  Economy \n(“RAISE”) Act would have given visa preference only to immediate family and eliminated \nthe diversity visa lottery, which allots a limited number of visas to countries with historically \nlow rates of immigration to the United States.37 It also proposed a “merit-based immigration \nsystem,” which gives preference to immigrants between the ages of 26 and 30, with doctoral \ndegrees, high English proficiency, and a job offer with a high salary. The RAISE Act would \nhave precluded parents of adult U.S. citizens from applying for Legal Permanent Resident \nstatus and, if they entered as temporary nonimmigrants, barred those parents from receiving \nfederal, state, or local public benefit.38 \n89.  President Trump supported the RAISE Act.39 Explaining his support, President Trump said \n“The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare . . . . \n                                                \n36 See Memorandum from Andrew Bremberg Regarding Executive Order on Protecting \nTaxpayer Resources by Ensuring Our Immigration Laws PromoteAccountability and \nResponsibility (Jan. 23, 2017), https://www.nafsa.org \n/uploadedFiles/NAFSA_Dojo/Professional_Resources/Browse_by_Interest/International_Studen\nts_and_Scholars/DraftEOtaxprograms.pdf. \n37 S.B. 354, 115th Cong., 1st sess.

Overall, immigrants consume 27% fewer benefits on average than native-born \nAmericans with similar incomes and ages.41 \n90.  In June 2017, shortly before announcing his support for the RAISE Act, President Trump \nreceived a briefing on immigration from White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. (Miller, \nan ardent supporter of the Public Charge Rule, had reportedly once told a former White House \ncommunications aide, “I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever touched American \nsoil.”42) At the briefing, after learning that 15,000 Haitians had received U.S. visas in 2017, \nPresident Trump replied that they “all have AIDS.” When President Trump learned that \n40,000 Nigerians had received visas, he said that they would never “go back to their huts.”43 \n91.  Defendant Cuccinelli  has expressed similar sentiments. In a 2012 interview, Cuccinelli \ncompared U.S. immigration policy to local laws governing treatment of rats, stating that a \nDistrict of Columbia law prohibiting killing of rats or separating rat families is “worse than \nour immigration policy—you can’t break up rat families.

In a press conference at the White House announcing issuance of the Public Charge \nRule, Defendant Cuccinelli stated that in promulgating “President Trump’s public charge \ninadmissibility  rule,”  the  Department  was  “promoting  our  shared  history”  and \n“implement[ing] . . . a law passed by Congress in 1996 that has not been given meaningful \neffect.”45 \n92.  Asked about the 1903 plaque on the Statue of Liberty that invites “your tired, your poor, your \nhuddled masses,” Cuccinelli initially stated: “I’m certainly not prepared to take anything \ndown off the Statue of Liberty.” He went on to say, that plaque “was referring back to people \ncoming from Europe where they had class-based societies” not to people coming to the \nUnited States from outside Europe. He also reinterpreted it to “[g]ive me your tired and your \npoor who can stand on their own two feet . . . .”46 When asked if the Rule changes the \ndefinition of the American dream, Cuccinelli said, “[n]o one has a right to become an \nAmerican who isn’t born here as an American” and that “it is a privilege to become an \nAmerican, not a right for anybody who is not already an American citizen.”47 He also said \nthe Rule was “part of President Trump keeping his promises.”48 \n                                                \n44 Latino Voices, Ken Cuccinelli Protested With Live Rats Over Comments About Immigrants, \nHuff.

In  December  2017,  DHS  noted  in  the  Unified  Agenda  of  Federal  Regulatory  and \nDeregulatory Actions its intent to publish a Notice for Public Rulemaking regarding the \npublic charge ground of inadmissibility. In early 2018, it was widely reported that the new \nrule  would  dramatically  expand  the  types  of  public  assistance  programs  that  could  be \nconsidered in the public charge test, including non-cash benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.49 \nIn January 2018, the State Department revised the Foreign Affairs Manual (“FAM”) to \ninstruct consular officers to consider a wider range of public benefits when determining \nwhether  visa  applicants  who  have  received  or  are  currently  receiving  benefits  are \ninadmissible on public charge grounds.50 As revised, the FAM also allowed State Department \nofficials to consider whether an applicant’s family member has received public benefits as \npart of the public charge test.51 \n94.  Visa denials due to public charge inadmissibility have substantially increased since the State \nDepartment issued the amended FAM. See Mayor and City of Baltimore v. Trump, Case No. \nELH-18-3636, 2019 WL 4598011, at *7 (D. Md. Sept. 20, 2019).  In the 2018 fiscal year, \nmore than 13,000 visas applications were denied on public charge grounds, whereas just 897 \nvisa applications were denied on public charge grounds in 2015.

In January 2018, President Trump rejected a bipartisan immigration proposal by members of \nCongress. In reference to the deal’s protections for immigrants from Haiti and Africa, \nPresident Trump asked why he should accept immigrants from “shithole countries” rather \nthan from nations like “Norway.”52 \n96.  During the spring of 2018, President Trump said in a meeting at the White House that the \nUnited  States  has  “the  dumbest  laws  on  immigration  in  the  world”  and  exhorted  his \nadministration officials to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable immigrants. “You \nwouldn’t believe how bad these people are,” President Trump said. “These aren’t people, \nthese are animals . . . .”53 \n97.

The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).An agency action is \narbitrary and capricious where “the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not \nintended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered \nan explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Co., 463 U.S. 26, 43 (1983). And “an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is \nobligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required \nwhen an agency does not act in the first instance.” Id. at 42. \n102. DHS  failed  to  cite  evidence  or  to  provide  substantive  reasons  to  abandon  the  federal \ngovernment’s over 100-year-old definition of public charge--as published in agency guidance \ndocuments since 1999—to mean dependence on subsistence cash benefits.   \n103. As to the  longstanding  nature of DHS’s prior policy, DHS recognizes, “the prevailing \napproach to public charge inadmissibility has been dictated” for decades by the 1999 Field \nGuidance. 84 FR at 41294. Under that Guidance, DHS acknowledges non-cash benefits have \nnot been be factored into public charge determinations:  \nan alien’s reliance on or receipt of non-cash benefits such as the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps; Medicaid; and housing \nvouchers and other housing subsidies are not currently considered by DHS in \ndetermining whether an alien is deemed likely at any time to become a public \ncharge.  \n84 FR at 41295. \n104. DHS justifies the change from the longstanding Guidance definition on the basis that receipt \nof  “non-cash  benefits  for  basic  living  needs  such  as  food  and  nutrition,  housing,  and \nhealthcare, that account for significant public expenditures . . . for more than 12 months \nwithin any 36-month period is sufficient to render a person a public charge. 84 FR at 41349; \nsee Proposed Rule, 83 FR at 51164 (same). This, DHS now asserts, is because “an individual \nwith limited means to satisfy basic living needs who uses government assistance to fulfill \nsuch needs for that duration of time relies on such assistance to such an extent that the person \nis not self-sufficient.” Id. \n105. This assertion, however, is contrary to longstanding agency policy and is asserted without \nany evidence of a change of the facts on the ground. Under the 1999 Field Guidance, the INS \n39 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 40 of 62\n \ncould not “conceive of a situation where an individual . . . could support himself or his family \nsolely on non-cash benefits so as to be primarily dependent on the [G]overnment,” other than \nfor long-term institutionalization at government expense. Public Charge Grounds, 64 FR at \n28677–78. \n106. “[A]n agency’s decision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency \nignores or countermands its earlier factual findings without reasoned explanation for doing \nso. An agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that \nit made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank \nslate.”  FCC  v.  Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.,  556  U.S.  502,  557  (2009)  (Kennedy,  J., \nconcurring); accord Organized Village of Kake v. Dept. of Agriculture, 795 F.3d 956, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (an agency’s change in policy when there has been no demonstrated \nchange in the underlying facts, but only a change in the Administration, is arbitrary and \ncapricious). \n107. In its Proposed Rule, DHS proposed a threshold for a public charge determination to be \nreceipt of “monetizable [non-cash] public benefits . . . [whose] cumulative value . . . exceeds \n15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) for a household of one” for twelve \nconsecutive months, which translates to “$1,821 worth of monetizable public benefits.” 69 \nFR at 51164. In other words, an individual that received $1,822 or more in 2018 would be \nconsidered to be dependent on the government for subsistence. See id. at 51165 (“DHS \nbelieves that an individual who receive monetizable public benefits in excess of 15 percent \nof FPG is neither self-sufficient nor on the road to achieving self-sufficiency.”). \n108. Many commenters pointed out the obvious: that, consistent with the 1999 Field Guidance’s \nfinding  that  non-cash  benefits  are  supplemental,  the  $1,822  threshold  can  hardly  be \n40 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 41 of 62\n \nconsidered in 2018, especially in areas with a higher cost of living, a reasonable measure of \ndependence  on  the  government  or  as  indicative  of  a  lack  of  self-sufficiency.  Other \ncommenters pointed to studies that support the continued validity of the 1999 conclusion that \nnon-cash public benefits are supplemental by showing that receipt of them amounted to 10 \npercent or less of annual income for otherwise self-sufficient individuals or families. See \ngenerally Public Charge Rule, 84 FR at 41357-58. \n109. Rather than confront these showings head-on, the Public Charge Rule abandons the 15 \npercent threshold in favor of “a single duration-based threshold” based on “current receipt or \npast receipt of more than 12 months of public benefits, in the aggregate, in any 36-month \nperiod . . . will be considered a heavily weighted negative factor in the totality of the alien’s \ncircumstances.” Id. at 41358. This change cannot hide the fact that DHS also abandoned the \n15  percent  FPG threshold  in  favor of  no threshold  for  non-cash  public  benefits  to  be \nconsidered a heavily weighted negative factor in the public charge determination. See id. \n(“DHS will consider in the totality whether an alien has applied for, received, or been certified \nor approved to receive any public benefits . . . in assessing whether he or she is likely to \nbecome a public charge”) (emphasis added). \n110. DHS also failed to consider the disruption of significant reliance interests the changed \ndefinition will cause, more specifically, the reliance of Plaintiffs in developing government \nassistance programs and allocating their resources, on the ability of immigrants in their \nemploy or whom they serve to utilize non-cash benefits to which they are lawfully entitled.  \nA failure to even acknowledge, much less take reliance interests into account when changing \na rule or policy is a form of arbitrary agency action. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 \nUS 502, 515 (2009). \n41 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 42 of 62\n \nCOUNT II \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(A)—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS—PATENTLY \nINADEQUATE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS \n111. Plaintiffs reallege and  incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n112. The costs and benefits of agency action are “a centrally relevant factor when deciding whether \nto regulate.” Michigan v. EPA, 103 S. Ct. 2699, 2707 (2015). In this regard, cost “includes \nmore than the expenses of complying with the regulations, any disadvantage could be termed \na cost . . . including, for instance, harms that regulation might do to human health or the \nenvironment.” Id. Judicial review of agency action must evaluate the agency’s cost analysis \nbecause “reasonable regulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the \ndisadvantages of agency decisions.” Id. \n113. The Public Charge Rule expressly acknowledges that its costs and benefits are matters to be \nconsidered in evaluating the reasonableness of the proposed changes. See generally 84 FR at \n41300-03 & Table 1 (“Summary of Costs and Benefits”); see also id. at 41485-90 & Tables \n2 and 8 (same). DHS states that the primary cost advantage of the rule change is “a reduction \nin  transfer  payments  from  the  Federal  Government to  individuals  who  may  choose to \ndisenroll  from  or  forego  enrollment  in  a  public  benefits  program . . .  [which]  DHS \nestimates . . . will be approximately $2.47 billion annually.” Id. at 41485; see id. at 41300-01 \n(same).58 \n114. As to the cost disadvantages, the Public Charge Rule projects several costs related to the \nadditional information collection required under the Rule that would amount in aggregate to \n                                                \n58 While DHS suggests that these amounts “account for significant federal expenditures, 84 FR at \n41296, $2.47 billion represents 0.05% of the proposed 2020 federal budget of $4.7 trillion. \n42 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 43 of 62\n \nat least $570 million annually. 84 FR at 41497-500 (listing total annual cost burden associated \nwith several different forms required under the new rule). The Rule does not, however, \nprovide estimates of what are likely to be the more significant and serious cost burdens of the \nPublic Charge Rule. With regard to the cost disadvantages to affected individuals, “DHS has \ndetermined that the rule may decrease disposable income and increase the poverty of certain \nfamilies and children, including U.S. citizen children,” 84 FR at 41493. DHS does not make \nany effort to quantify this cost, but merely states its “opinion that the benefits of the action \njustify the financial impact on the family.” Id. \n115. Likewise, “DHS recognizes that reductions in federal and state transfers under federal benefit \nprograms may have impacts on state and local economies, large and small businesses, and \nindividuals. For example, the rule might result in reduced revenues for healthcare providers \nparticipating in Medicaid, companies that manufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals, \ngrocery retailers participating in SNAP, agricultural producers who grow foods that are \neligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, or landlords participating in federally funded \nhousing programs.” 84 FR at 41301; see id. at 41486 (same). Despite this recognition, DHS \nmade no effort to quantify these adverse impacts. \n116. Aside from these recognized, but unquantified, costs, DHS completely ignored the high costs \nto states and local governments, and other organizations as immigrants and their families \nwithdraw from or forego public benefits programs. Health insurance is one public benefit \nfrom  which  individuals  and  families  are  likely  to  withdraw.  Without  coverage,  these \nindividuals and families are likely to put off health care until an emergency arises, thus likely \nleading to more complex and costly health problems and an increased use emergency room \ncare  services.  In  addition  as  members  of  the  community  forgo  health  care,  including \n43 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 44 of 62\n \nimmunizations, the spread of contagious diseases will increase, imposing additional costs on \nstate and local governments. \n117. Without health insurance to pay the higher costs related to those outcomes, states and other \nwill have to bear an increase in uncompensated care costs. See 84 FR at 41384 (“there is a \npotential for increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for \nby an insurer or patient”); id. (“DHS does not have specific estimates on the increase[d] cost \nfor [uncompensated care] services.”). For example, Maryland, as a result of increasing the \nnumber of persons who were covered by health insurance, saw a drop of approximately $311 \nmillion in uncompensated care costs from 2013 to 2015. This decline would be reversed as \nindividuals and families disenroll or forego enrollment in health insurance benefits as a result \nof the Rule. Similar results would likely occur in a large number of other states, such that in \naggregate the nation-wide cost disadvantage from reduced enrollment in the health insurance \npublic benefit would largely diminish, if not completely offset, the $2.47 billion benefit \nestimated in the Rule. 84 FR at 41485. A similar, albeit smaller, burden will be placed on \nprivate organizations that provide health care services to uninsured, and should also be \nconsidered as a cost disadvantage of the Rule. \n118. Aside from health costs, implementation of the Rule would also put a greater strain on state \nand local governments and private organizations to offset the lost federal food security and \nhousing assistance benefits that will result from disenrollment or non-enrollment. Yet, DHS \nmade no effort to quantify these costs either. Without such quantification, it is impossible to \ndetermine if the Rule “does significantly more harm than good.” Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. \nat 2707. It follows that DHS “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,” \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, and thus its action is arbitrary and capricious.

While DHS acknowledged that the Public Charge Rule is intended to “minimize the incentive \nof aliens to immigrate,” i.e, to reduce the number of immigrants in the United States, 84 FR \nat 41309,59  it completely failed to acknowledge the cost to employers who rely on immigrant \nworkers, and members of the public who rely on their services.  The harm to nursing homes \nand other home health care providers is particularly significant. As noted in the “Parties” \nsection of this Complaint, about one-quarter of the nation’s 4 million direct care workers are \nimmigrants, 43% of whom access some public benefits.”60 Two thirds of these individuals \n“receive Medicaid and more than half get food and nutrition assistance.” And, while the \n                                                \n59 There has already been well-reported increase in the number of visa denials on public charge \ngrounds under the State Department’s similar change to its definition of “public charge.” Lindsay \nGray, Keeping Families Apart: Trump’s Update to the Public Charge Provision, Whitlock & \nGray Immigration Law Blog (May 24, 2018) [hereinafter Gray, Keeping Families Apart], \nhttp://www.whitlockgray.com/2018/05/24/public-charge/; Arelis R.

In contrast to the significant costs that the agency ignored, it makes only a conclusory \nstatement about what it claims is its main benefit. DHS states: “The primary benefit of the \nfinal rule would be to better ensure that aliens . . . will be self-sufficient, i.e., will rely on their \nown financial resources, as well as the financial resources of the family, sponsors, and private \norganizations.” 84 FR at 41301. As noted below in Count III, however, DHS provided scant \nevidence that lack of self-sufficiency among immigrants is a serious problem, and indeed the \nevidence of the U.S. Census Bureau and many commenters is that immigrants are more likely \nthan native born to be fully employed. See ¶ 127, infra. Instead of acknowledging this fact, \nDHS instead claims, “DHS is under no obligation to demonstrate that all or most aliens in the \nUnited States are not self-sufficient.” 84 FR. at 41306. \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(A)—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS— \nCOUNTER TO THE EVIDENCE \n121. Plaintiffs reallege and  incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n122. The Public Charge Rule is arbitrary and capricious because Defendants’ justification for its \npromulgation runs counter to the evidence before the agency, relies on factors Congress did \nnot intend the agency to consider, and disregards material facts and evidence, including the \nU.S.  Census  Bureau’s  own  studies  predicting  that  without  immigration  the  burden  on \ntaxpayers will increase. \n                                                \n61 Id. \n46 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 47 of 62\n \n123. Defendants’ stated objective in revising the Public Charge rule includes “minimiz[ing] the \nincentive of aliens to immigrate to the United States because of the availability of public \nbenefits and . . . promot[ing] self-sufficiency of aliens within the United States.” 84 FR at \n41309.  \n124. There is ample basis to conclude that the Public Charge Rule will achieve its stated objective \nof reducing immigration levels. Judge Hollander, for example, recently took judicial notice \nthat this has been precisely the effect of the State Department’s similar change to its definition \nof public charge:  \n[V]isa denials due to public charge inadmissibility have surged since the State \nDepartment issued the amended [Foreign Affairs Manual to expand the definition \nof public charge.]  In 2015, the State Department denied 897 visa applications on \npublic charge grounds. . . . In contrast, during the 2018 fiscal year, the number of \nvisa  applications  denied  on  public  charge  grounds  exceeded  13,000  visa \napplications. U.S. Dep’t of State, Ann. Rep. Table XX (2018).  \nMayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Trump, No. 1:18 cv 3636, 2019 WL 4598011, at *7 \n(September 20, 2019) (internal citations omitted). \n125. As DHS acknowledges, “to sustain a public charge inadmissibility finding, there must be \nevidence of a fact that tends to show that the burden of supporting the alien is likely to be \ncast upon the public.” Id. at 41351 (citing Ex parte Hosaye Skaguchi, 277 F. 913, 916 (9th \nCir. 1922). Such evidence, as DHS acknowledged the Proposed Rule, involves “more than a \nshowing of a possibility that the alien will require public support.” 83 FR at 51125 (quoting \nMatter of Martinez-Lopez, 10 I&N Dec. 409, 421–23 (BIA 1962)). \n126. DHS  never  addresses,  however,  whether,  if,  as  DHS  anticipates,  the  Rule  reduces \nimmigration levels, the result would be to increase, rather than decrease the burden “cast \nupon the public,” more specifically, the burden on a shrinking number of taxpayers. With an \naging  native-born  population  dependent  on  fewer  wage  earners  to  support  existing \n47 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 48 of 62\n \nentitlement programs, statistical data shows that the United States increasingly relies on \nimmigrants to grow the workforce. Far from reducing the burden “cast on the public,” the \nagency’s  broader  definition  of  public  charge  will  increase  the  number  of  able-bodied \nimmigrants who will be labeled “public charges,” but who, if granted permanent legal status, \nwould likely help to reduce the burden on taxpayers. \n127. The evidence before DHS demonstrates that critical demographic trends in the United States \nwill make it less, not more, likely that categorizing immigrant applicants under the agency’s \noverly broad definition of “public charge” will result in actual benefits to the public. As \nevidence before the DHS documents: \nLast year, the total number of births in the United States fell to its lowest level in \n30 years. The general fertility rate dropped to the lowest rate since the United States \nCentre for Disease Control started keeping records in 1909: to 60.3 births per 1,000 \nwomen aged between 15 and 44. The total fertility rate, meanwhile, which estimates \nthe average number of children a woman could expect to have over her lifetime at \ncurrent birth rates for each age, at 1.76 births per woman, is below the “replacement \nrate” for fertility. That is the level that keeps populations stable (about 2.1 children \nper woman). And it is a considerable drop from a decade earlier, when the rate was \n2.12 births per woman.62 \n128. These same observations are reflected in the Census Bureau’s 2017 population projections.63 \nAs the Census Bureau’s report shows, the only possibility for an increase in the nation’s \nworkforce population in coming years (necessary to support the aging population who will \nrely on social security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) is through more, not less, immigration: \nThe year 2030 marks a demographic turning point for the United States. Beginning \nthat year, all baby boomers will be older than 65. This will expand the size of the \n                                                \n62 C.K.

Later that decade, by 2035, we project that older adults will outnumber \nchildren  for  the  first  time  in  U.S.  history.  The  year  2030  marks  another \ndemographic first for the United States. Beginning that year, because of population \naging, immigration is projected to overtake natural increase (the excess of births \nover deaths) as the primary driver of population growth for the country. As the \npopulation ages, the number of deaths is projected to rise substantially, which will \nslow  the  country’s  natural  growth.  As  a  result,  net  international  migration  is \nprojected to overtake natural increase, even as levels of migration are projected to \nremain relatively flat. These three demographic mile-stones are expected to make \nthe 2030s a transformative decade for the U.S. population. \n2017 Census Bureau Report at 1. \n129. The fertility rate among native born Americans is currently insufficient to maintain current \npopulation. As the 2017 Census Bureau Report also notes: “Over the course of their life, \nforeign-born women have historically had slightly more children than native-born women \n(2.2 births compared with 1.9 births on average, respectively).” Id. at 3. And because “the \nforeign born are more likely to be in the labor force” than native-born people, id. at 11, these \ndemographic changes suggest that immigrants are vital contributors to our economy and not \nburdens. \n130. The 2017 Census Bureau Report observes that the projected net growth in population fueled \nby  immigration  distinguishes  the  United  States  from  other  economically  stagnating \ndeveloped  nations  who  are  also  faced  with  an  overall  decline  in  their  native-born \npopulations.64 One disadvantage of the growing percentage of older Americans will be an \nincreased burden on those working in the United States to fund the programs that benefit an \nolder population. See id. at 5 (“In coming decades, the United States is expected to shift from \na youth-dependent population toward an elderly-dependent population.”). \n                                                \n64 Id. at 12 (“This continued growth sets the United States apart from other developed countries, \nwhose populations are expected to barely increase or actually contract in coming decades.”). \n49 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 50 of 62\n \n131. In November 2018, Jay Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made a similar observation: \nreducing the number of legal immigrants coming to the United States would retard economic \ngrowth by placing constraints on the ability of businesses to expand their operations.65 \n132. Yet immigration policy changes by DHS are already reducing the level of legal immigration, \ndespite this being a time “when there are more job openings than job seekers in the United \nStates.”66  “[N]ewly  released  government  data  show  that  during  2018,  the  Trump \nAdministration was denying applications submitted to the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services at a rate 37 percent higher than the Obama administration did in \n2016.”67 A Cato Institute study in fact shows that the DHS 11.3% rejection rate for “work \npermits, travel documents and status applications, based on family reunification, employment \nand other grounds . . . is the highest rate of denial on record.”68  \n                                                \n65 Craig Torres, Fed’s Powell Says Reduced Immigration Could Slow U.S. Economy, Bloomberg \nNews (November 1, 2018), available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-\n01/fed-s-powell-says-reduced-immigration-could-slow-u-s-economy (“Thus, from an economic \ngrowth standpoint, reduced immigration would result in lower population growth and thus, all \nelse equal, slower trend economic growth.”). \n66 Id.

Adopting the Public Charge Rule whose purpose is to reduce the number of immigrants who \ncould qualify for permanent status, simply damages employers and reduces tax revenues in \nboth the short and long term future. It will add to the burden on existing wage earners by \nartificially reducing the size of the workforce who could pay taxes to support the aging \npopulation. Thus, far from providing a benefit to the public, the Public Charge Rule would \nexacerbate the burden on taxpayers. \n134. DHS’s  only  acknowledgment  of  this  body  of  evidence  was  its  statement  that  “[o]ne \ncommenter stated that the rule would reduce immigration and hurt the country’s economic \nfuture given the need for immigrant workers to replenish an increasingly aging population.” \n84 FR at 41472. The agency, however, provided no substantive response, saying only that \n“[b]eyond the indirect costs and other economic effects described in the economic analysis \nof this rule, DHS is unable to determine the effect this rule will have on every economic entity \nmentioned or all aspects of future economic growth.” Id. \n135. Defendants’ assertion that DHS is unable to specify the effect on “every economic entity or \nall aspects of future economic growth” improperly focuses on the trees, while ignoring the \nforest; namely, that, as the Census Bureau found, with declining birthrates and workforce \nstagnation, legal immigration levels must increase to sustain current economic growth. Thus, \nthe Rule never addresses, quantitatively or qualitatively, whether its stated aim of reducing \nimmigration would increase, rather than decrease, the “burden cast upon the public,” i.e., the \nburden cast upon a shrinking number of taxpayers.  \n136. Where, as here, “a party seeks review of agency action under the APA (Administrative \nProcedure Act [before a district court], the district judge sits as an appellate tribunal. The \n`entire case’ on review is a question of law.” Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d \n51 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 52 of 62\n \n1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001). And, in such cases, where a party raises serious, material \narguments, [i]t most emphatically remains the duty of [the reviewing] court to ensure that an \nagency engage the arguments raised before it - that it conduct a process of “reason” decision-\nmaking.” NorAm Gas Transmission Company v. FERC, 148 F.3d 1158, 1165 (D.C. Cir. \n1990). As the Fourth Circuit has stated: “during notice and comment proceedings, the agency \nis  obligated  to  identify  and  respond  to  relevant,  significant  issues  raised  during  those \nproceedings.” North Carolina Growers’ Ass'n, Inc. v. United Farm Workers, 702 F. 3d 755, \n769 (4th Cir. 2012). The Public Charge Rule is arbitrary because it fails to address evidence \nthat the Rule would be economically harmful. \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(A)—ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS— \nFAILURE TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS COMMENTS  \nTHAT CREDIT REPORTS ARE NOT A RELIABLE BASIS FOR  \nDETERMINING SELF-RELIANCE OF IMMIGRANTS \n137. Plaintiffs reallege and  incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n138. To avoid acting arbitrarily under the Administrative Procedure Act an agency much give \nreasoned  consideration  to  material  comments  and  arguments  presented.  NorAm  Gas \nTransmission Co. v. FERC, 148 F.2d 1158, 1165 (D. C. Cir. 1990). \n139. DHS acted arbitrarily in failing to address meaningfully the “many comment[]s” 84 FR at \n41425, that credit reports are not a reliable basis for determining an immigrant’s present or \nfuture self-reliance. Yet, the Public Charge Rule’s  negative  factors include whether an \napplicant has a poor credit score. 84 FR at 41,502-04.  \n140. Commenters noted that credit scores are especially poor indicators of whether an immigrant \nis likely to become a public charge, because credit scores do not reflect the subject’s history \nof paying rent, utilities, income, savings or other financial resources. Credit scores are \n52 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 53 of 62\n \ndesigned to measure the likelihood that a borrower will make a payment ninety or more days \nlate on a credit obligation. Recent immigrants are unlikely to have access to credit and are \nthus unable to demonstrate a positive payment history. A credit score or report does not \npredict an immigrant’s long-term financial stability. See generally 84 FR at 41426-28. \n141. Credit scores and reports may also be inaccurate.69 For example, according to a Federal Trade \nCommission study, twenty-six percent of participants noted at least one potentially material \nerror on at least one of their three credit reports.70 Thirteen percent of the consumers’ credit \nscores increased as a result of modifying an error.71 Errors in credit reports might be due to \nmismatched records, balance errors, data management errors, and incorrect reporting of \naccount  status,  among  others.72  In  addition,  identity  theft  might  inaccurately  and \ninappropriately affect an individual’s credit score.  \n142. DHS downplays the failure of credit scores to portray accurately an individual’s ability to \nbecome self-sufficient. The agency relies on vague generalities as to what a “good” or “poor” \ncredit score might mean. 84 FR at 41428 (“A ‘good’ credit report is generally near or slightly \nabove the average of U.S. consumers, and therefore the person may be self-sufficient and less \nlikely to become a public charge. A poor credit report is well below the average of U.S. \n                                                \n69 Comments of Tzedek DC, DHS Docket No. USCIS-2010-0012, RIN 1615-AA22 (filed Dec. \n10, 2018). \n70 Federal Trade Comm’n, Report to Congress Under Section 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit \nTransactions Act of 2003 (Dec. 2012), \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/section-319-fair-and-accurate-\ncredittransactions-act-2003-fifth-interim-federal-trade-commission/130211factareport.pdf. \n71 Id. \n72 What are Common Credit Report Errors That I Should Look for on My Credit Report?, \nConsumer Fin.

But DHS makes no effort and presents no evidence to link \nimmigrants’ poor credit scores to long term dependency.  \nCOUNT V \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(D)–WITHOUT OBSERVANCE OF \nPROCEDURE REQUIRED BY LAW \n143. Plaintiffs reallege and  incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n144. The APA imposes two duties on an agency conducting a rulemaking: the notice must specify \n“either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or description of the subjects and issues \ninvolved,” and parties must be given “an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through \nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) and (c). “The Courts of \nAppeals have generally interpreted this to mean that the final rule the agency adopts must be \n“a ‘logical out-growth’ of the rule proposed.” Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke, 551 \nU.S. 158, 174 (2007). The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has interpreted these \nprovisions to mean that “[a]lthough an agency, in its notice of proposed rulemaking, need not \nidentify  precisely  every  potential  regulatory  change,  the  notice  must  be  sufficiently \ndescriptive to provide interested parties with a fair opportunity to comment and to participate \nin the rulemaking.” Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n v. Block, 755 F.2d 1098, 1104 (4th Cir. 1985) \n(citations omitted). \n145. Here, the Proposed Rule suggested a shift from the 1999 Field Guidance’s criterion of \n“primarily dependent” on public benefits as the threshold for determining public charge to a \nthreshold criterion based on “receipt of monetizable public benefits . . . [whose] cumulative \nvalue . . . exceeds 15 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) for a household of one \nwithin any period of 12 consecutive months.” 83 FR at 51164. Based on 2018 data, the \n54 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 55 of 62\n \nproposed threshold “would exclude up to $1,821 worth of monetizable public benefits for a \nhousehold of one” from consideration in the public charge determination. Id. \n146. The Proposed Rule justified the 15 percent quantity of benefits threshold stating it “would \nnot lead to unintended consequences, as could be the case if there was no threshold or the \nthreshold  was  much  smaller.”  83  FR  at  51165.  This  threshold  also  “recognizes  that \nindividuals may receive public benefits in relatively small amounts to supplement their ability \nto meet their needs and the needs of their household without seriously calling into question \ntheir self-sufficiency.” Id. \n147. With one exception in the comments which asserted 15 percent was “an acceptable proxy,” \nall comments uniformly argued that the 15 percent was too low an amount of benefits. See \nPublic Charge Rule, 84 FR at 41357-58 (“many commenters voiced general opposition to the \n15 percent threshold;” “commenters asserted that the standard should be 50 percent of the \nFPG;” “the proposed threshold was so low that it would be more of an indicator that the alien \nis subject to the inherent uncertainties and exigencies of life . . . [than] an indicator of the \nalien’s ongoing dependence on public benefits”). \n148. Rather than adopt the 15 percent threshold or respond to the overwhelming view of the \ncomments and adopt a larger threshold, DHS abandoned the quantity of benefits threshold \naltogether and adopted instead an entirely new “single duration-based threshold” in the final \nPublic Charge Rule: “under this final rule, DHS will consider an alien likely to become a \npublic charge at any time in the future if the alien is more likely than not to receive public \nbenefits for longer than 12 months in the aggregate in any 36-month period.” Id. at 41358.  \n149. Another significant change from the Proposed Rule to the final Public Charge Rule is its more \nsevere way to calculate how long a person has received public benefits, thereby drastically \n55 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 56 of 62\n \nreducing the benefits a person could use without incurring a negative factor in the public \ncharge calculus. The final Rule restricts receipt of benefits to “12 months in the aggregate,” \nmeans “for instance, receipt of two public benefits in one month counts as two months.” Id. \nat 41297 (emphasis added). Put another way, if an applicant for permanent residence status \ntemporarily took three non-cash public benefits—food, housing and medical assistance—for \na period as short as four months within any 36-month period, that applicant would be treated \nas if he or she had been taking public assistance for 12 months. And DHS, in turn, will treat \nthis as a heavily-weighted negative factor in assessing whether the applicant would be likely \nto become a public charge.  Under the Proposed Rule, that same person could have relied \nupon all three forms of assistance for 11 months and not incurred a negative factor for \nimmigration purposes.  \n150. The Public Charge Rule’s aggregation approach is the opposite of what had been proposed; \nthe Proposed Rule had rejected a no quantity threshold approach because it could lead \nimmigrants to be excluded as “public charges” after they had received “relatively small \namounts to supplement their ability to meet their needs and the needs of their household \n[which  do  not]  seriously  call[]  into  question  their  self-sufficiency.”  83  FR  at  51165. \nAggregating  time  periods  has  the  same  “unintended  consequences”  of  making  people \nexcludable based on receipt of even smaller amounts and duration of benefits than the \nProposed Rule had allowed. The final Public Charge Rule thus did exactly what the Proposed \nRule had assured the public it would not do. Id.  \n151. In cases where “a final rule reaches a conclusion exactly opposite to that proposed,” a \nreviewing court is “not constrained by the same degree of deference [a court] must afford \nmost agency determinations.” Chocolate Mfrs. Ass’n, 755 F.2d at 1103. Under the APA’s \n56 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 57 of 62\n \nnotice requirements, 5 U.S.C. § 553, an agency “does not have carte blanche to establish a \nrule contrary to its original proposal;” rather, “the notice must be sufficiently descriptive to \nprovide  interested parties with a  fair opportunity to comment and to participate in the \nrulemaking.” Id. at 1104 (citations omitted). \n152. To determine if a notice is sufficiently descriptive of the rule finally adopted, courts have \n“noted  the  absence  of  comments  from  groups  which  could  be  expected  to  oppose \ndowngrading the performance criteria.” Id. at 1105; see, e.g., Sprint Corp. v. FCC, 315 F.3d \n369,  376  (D.C.  Cir.  2003)  (because  parties  “did  not  appreciate  that  the  [agency]  was \ncontemplating” a particular point, “the commenters understandably submitted no comments \non this point”). Here, no comments suggested a downgrading from a 15 percent to a smaller \nthreshold  for  use  of  benefits,  only  one  comment  supported  15  percent,  and  all  others \nsupported a quantity threshold above the proposed 15 percent limit. 84 FR at 41357-58. It \ncan be reasonably inferred that the latter group of commenters would have opposed lowering \nthe amount of benefits a person could use by eliminating the quantity threshold and switching \ninstead solely to a duration threshold in which benefit periods are aggregated. The absence \nof comments opposing elimination of a quantity measure and aggregating time period (or, \nindeed,  of  any  comments  suggesting  these  measures)  demonstrates  “the  final  rule \nsubstantially departs from the terms or substance of the proposed rule, [and thus] the notice \nis inadequate.” Chocolate Mfrs Ass’n, 755 F.2d 1055. \nCOUNT VI  \nVIOLATION OF APA § 706(2)(B)- DENIAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO  \nEQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS \n153. Plaintiffs reallege and  incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in each of the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \n57 \nCORE/2052922.0049/154461210.5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-02851-PJM   Document 1   Filed 09/27/19   Page 58 of 62\n \n154. A court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “contrary to constitutional \nright, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  \n155. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids the federal \ngovernment from denying equal protection of the laws.73 It is an equal protection violation \nwhere a “discriminatory purpose” was a “motivating factor” in a government decision.74 \n156. The Public Charge Rule was motivated by Defendants’ intent to discriminate on the basis of \nrace, ethnicity, national origin, and nationality. \n157. The Public Charge Rule discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and \nnationality, and was motivated by discriminatory and baseless stereotypes concerning the \nreceipt of public benefits by immigrants, particularly immigrants from Latin American, \nAfrican  and  Asian  countries.    Defendants’  statements  provide  direct  evidence  of  their \ndiscriminatory motives in enacting the Public Charge Rule.  \n158. In  addition,  the  Public  Charge  Rule  will  cause  Latinos,  Asians,  and  Africans  to  be \ndisproportionately excluded from the United States. An analysis of the Public Charge Rule \nfound that it would potentially block up to 71 percent of all applicants from Mexico and \nCentral America, 69 percent of applicants from Africa, and 52 percent of applicants from \n                                                \n73 See, e.g., Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234 (1979); Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 500 \n(1954). \n74 Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265–66 (1977).

September 20, 2019) (“if President Trump harbors animus towards \nimmigrants of color, and if he encouraged the State Department to revise the FAM, then the \namendments violate equal protection, even if officials within the State Department did not \npersonally harbor racial animus.)

Trump, No. 1:18 cv 3636, 2019 WL 4598011, \nat *6 (September 20, 2019).  \n159. The Public Charge Rule fails strict scrutiny because its broad focus on the receipt of “public \nassistance” by immigrants is not narrowly tailored to the goal of preventing immigrants from \nbecoming primarily dependent upon public benefits. \n160. Through the actions described in this Complaint, the Public Charge Rule violates the APA as \ncontrary to the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. \n161. Plaintiffs have standing to assert violations of the APA. In addition, local governments may assert \nthe equal protection claims of their immigrant residents and their families. Baltimore and \nGaithersburg are injured by the Public Charge Rule, as described above. See supra ¶¶ 8-15. \n162. Baltimore and Gaithersburg have close relationships with those who take their public benefits, \nincluding their medical, legal, educational, food, and housing services. Because Plaintiff local \ngovernments are better off when all of their residents can access the public benefits to which they \nare entitled, regardless of immigration status, Baltimore and Gaithersburg will serve as especially \neffective advocates for their equal protection claims.  \n163. Finally, Baltimore’s and Gaithersburg’s immigrant residents and their families face impediments \nto  bringing  their  claims  in  their  own  names  because  they  fear  the  potential  immigration \nconsequences of coming forward, suffer from language-related and other barriers, and cannot \nbear the significant economic and logistical burdens of participating in litigation.

Declare the Public Charge Rule is contrary to the Equal Protection Clause; \n4.  Vacate and set aside the Public Charge Rule; \n5.
