Assuming I grant the motion, many procedural steps will need to be accomplished-service, analysis of representation by the A.G., the hiring of counsel if the A.G. decides to represent. It is probably not your fault that you have not sought to add new parties until the close of fact discovery, but by doing so you have reset the clock. Can't get around that, I will not allow an open ended extension. The motion for leave to amend will be decided next week. If leave is granted (1) Service must be accomplished on any new defendant by March 30 (2) representation analysis must be completed and a decision made by April 27 (3) any defendant who is not represented by the A.G. must appear by his/her own attorney by May 31 (4) depositions of new defendants must be completed by June 29 (5) any other additional discovery must be completed by July 31 - including expert discovery (6) the State's expert reports are due by May 18 There is no need to abide the new EBTs. ( Deposition due by 6/29/2018., Discovery due by 7/31/2018., Expert Discovery due by 7/31/2018., Service due by 3/30/2018.) (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 3/2/2018) (kgo) (Entered: 03/06/2018)"

Counsel shall submit the proposed form of declaration to the Court no later than October 9, 2018, by means of a status letter filed on ECF. If the relevant parties are unable to agree on a single form of declaration, they must provide both versions (preferably with a redline highlighting the differences) without argument.

It is FURTHER ORDERED that the Orseck Firm (which this Court finds to be primarily responsible for the New Officer Defendants' discovery failures) shall pay plaintiff's reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in obtaining this Order. As noted during the November 5 conference, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5) requires such an award when the Court grants a motion to compel discovery, unless one of the exceptions set forth in Rule 37(a)(5)(A)(i)-(iii) would make a fee award unjust. In this case, none of the exceptions applies. Moreover, this Court previously ordered the New Officer Defendants to respond to the Document Requests and produce all non-privileged, responsive documents no later than August 31, 2018. Thus, a fee award is also required pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C). Plaintiff shall submit one or more declarations setting forth her reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining this Order no later than November 9, 2018. In order to recover attorney fees, plaintiff must submit detailed time records, properly authenticated, as well as admissible evidence concerning each timekeeper's background and qualifications, sufficient to evaluate the reasonableness of their charges. The Officer Defendants may submit a response, limited to the amount of the expenses to be awarded, no later than November 19, 2018. There shall be no reply. The New Officer Defendants who are the only parties to this action still out of compliance with their discovery obligations have now missed two Court-ordered deadlines to comply with Rule 34. Should they miss their third deadline, they will not be given a fourth or a fifth. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) (if a party fails to obey a discovery order, the court may issue \"further just orders\" up to and including the entry of a default judgment and/or contempt sanctions). SO ORDERED.

Dr. Alexander Bardey will not be permitted to testify for the defense, for the reasons set out in the Plaintiff's  Bench Memorandum (which is not a bench memorandum - those are prepared by my la w clerks - but rather, a brief in support of a motion to preclude his  testimony, which is an outstanding in limine issue). Dr. Bardey has absolutely  no basis to testify about what Plaintiff's decedent - whom he has never met -  would have perc eived on the morning he died. Treating physician testimony and information from his prison medical records, not the suppositions of a purported  expert who has never seen Karl Taylor, will be sufficient to establish that he suffered from mental illne ss; defendants are free to ask the jury to devalue the life of a person with mental disabilities, and we will see how kindly the jury takes to that argument. 2. I will rule on the objections to the deposition testimony of Officer Hunt at some point b efore he takes the stand, but I can tell you right now that most of these objections appear to be meritless. However, dues to Judge Batts' death and the preparations for her funeral, I cannot immerse myself in Officer Hunt's testimony today  or Monday. 3. Dr. Christensen will not be permitted to testify about his views on which  witnesses are telling the truth, or whose testimony should be believed when  there is a dispute. Any effort to introduce such testimony will be met with most  vigorous intervention by the court. I will be listening with extra care to Dr. Christensen.

ENDORSEMENT: I have reviewed your letters of April 17. There is, in my opinion, nothing for me to do. The case was settled in mid-trial. If an exact date, or even a time frame, for installing camera and microphones was essential to the settlement, it should have been put on the record at that time - or we should have continued with the trial. But everything I heard from both parties was at best aspirational. And the landscape has altered dramatically since we parted in February. In view of the COVID crisis, and the unprecedented stress (financial and otherwise) that it has put on correctional facilities, I am simply not prepared to start negotiating the precise terms of bidding and installation that the parties were content for whatever reason, to leave vague at the time the settlement was put on the record. Frankly, it is enough for me to know that this is going to happen in what I consider to be the foreseeable future. If it took three years to get a first rate camera and microphone system installed in Attica, and if Attica is the gold standard to be emulated at Sullivan it would be irrational for me to expect cameras and microphones of similar quality to be installed at Sullivan this year - especially in the middle of a pandemic that we all expect will last well into next year. I want the settlement agreement signed now. I want Ms. Ramsay-Nobles to get paid soon. That is, and always has been, my highest priority. So get it done.

          "description": "ORDER DISALLOWING WRIT OF PRODUCTION: Williams' deposition testimony was read into the record yesterday morning - both the Plaintiffs designations and the Supervisor Defendants' cross-designations. The decision whether to issue a writ to bring in a prisoner to testify for trial is committed to the sound discretion of the court. In an exercise of my discretion I allowed the deposition testimony to be read. As far as the court is concerned, the application to writ Williams in is now moot. I note for the record that Williams does not appear on the witness list of the Corrections Officers; he was scheduled to testify only on the Plaintiff's case. The court had ruled that he could testify by deposition. Since counsel for the Corrections Officer Defendants did not see fit to alert chambers by phone or fax to their last-second application for a writ - in effect, for reconsideration of a ruling already made by the court - the court had no ability to deal with the application last Friday afternoon, when it was made. By the time I was aware of the application it was too late to writ the witness, as Plaintiff was scheduled to rest, and did rest that very day. The Officer Defendants suffer no prejudice as a result. Defendants never indicated an interest in calling Williams on their case (and indeed, their opportunity to list him as a witness on their case expired long ago). The jury has now heard Williams' testimony - together with the Supervisor Defendants' cross-designations, which were read to the jury along with the deposition testimony that was offered by Plaintiff. The Officer Defendants had plenty of opportunity to cross examine Williams during his examination, and to offer cross-designations as well. Writting Williams in now so that he can say again what the jury has already heard would be purely duplicative. There is simply no reason to do it - it certainly would not \"substantially further the resolution of the case,\" which is one of the factors to be considered when deciding whether to grant or deny a writ to bring in a prisoner from a distant facility. 28 U.S.C. § 2241; In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48401, at* 17 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014). And the disruption to a trial that writing in Williams would have caused would have been ill advised. The trial is running long; it will inevitably go into a third week. Plaintiffs counsel made a good faith effort to get Williams into the district at a time when it was feasible to do so. I do not fault Plaintiff for not seeking a new writ given the last minute, mid-trial nature of the information that Williams was back in custody. The application for a writ is disallowed. The Clerk should remove Docket #402 from the court's list of open motions if it in fact appears thereon. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 2/19/2020) (mml) (Entered: 02/19/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>On July 20, 2016, the executrix of the estate of an African-American man who died in the Sullivan Correctional Facility (NY) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against various prison officials, both guards and guard supervisors, in their individual capacities and a doctor in his individual capacity that did not effectively diagnose and treat the decedent's mental illness. The plaintiff sought relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for violations of the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause, 42 U.S.C. 1985(2, 3), and New York State medical malpractice law in the case of the doctor. The plaintiff, represented by pro bono private counsel, sought a jury trial, damages, and costs.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the complaint detailed the decedent's medical history, including a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Polysubstance Dependence. It alleged that his condition was stable under treatment at the Central New York Psychiatric Center (CNYPC), but upon transfer to Sullivan, he was routinely placed in isolation, where his condition deteriorated further. The complaint noted that the defendant doctor said the decedent should have been transferred back to CNYPC after a long stay in isolation, but he did not order the transfer. The complaint outlined a pattern of abuse and racial insensitivity by the guards. The complaint described an incident where guards \"trashed\" the decedent's cell and the decedent refused to clean it, asking the guards to do it. The guards forcibly removed the decedent from his cell and severely beat him. The complaint alleged that the decedent died of his injuries, and the prison administration withheld information surrounding the death from the decedent's family.</p>\r\n<p>Besides this lawsuit, the plaintiff filed two complaints in state court. The parties agreed to dismiss the state actions pending full relief on the federal claim, which they eventually got.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Colleen McMahon referred the case to trial after receiving the initial complaint. The plaintiff amended the complaint on April 25, 2017 to add the doctor as a defendant and outline allegations against him. The plaintiff amended the complaint again on February 18, 2018 to name previously unknown correctional officers involved in the beating.</p>\r\n<p>After discovery, the defendants filed three summary judgment motions (one motion each against the officers, supervisors, and doctor) in May and June of 2019. On August 21, 2019 (2019 WL 4383187), Judge McMahon issued one opinion on all three summary judgment motions. She denied the motions related to the officers and the supervisors, saying that genuine issues of material fact remain as to their conduct surrounding the beating. However, she partially granted the motion related to the doctor, dismissing claims related to deliberate indifference in failure to provide adequate medical care. She stated that genuine issues of material fact arose on the medical malpractice claim, but determined that those claims were separate to the beating issue at the center of this case. She asked the plaintiff to show cause that the medical malpractice issues should not be separated from the initial one, and the claims against the doctor were severed on September 12, 2019 through an order signed by Judge McMahon (2019 WL 4382206).</p>\r\n<p>The parties were unable to settle the case in pre-trial negotiations, and the case went to trial on February 24, 2020. Shortly before closing arguments on February 25, the parties jointly filed a proposed settlement agreement, terminating the case before the jury reached a verdict. Judge McMahon ordered the case to be dismissed on May 5, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/02/28/karl-taylor-died-in-a-new-york-prison-now-the-state-has-agreed-to-pay-millions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">terms of the settlement agreement</a> showed that the State of New York agreed to pay the plaintiff $5 million, which covers compensatory damages and the plaintiff's attorney fees. The settlement added that the Sullivan Correctional Facility should install cameras to prevent future beatings, but left the details on camera installation vague. The plaintiff sought action from the Judge to clarify this point, but she denied the order, leaving it to the parties to settle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of the agreement to install a facility-wide CCTV/Audio Monitoring system in the Sullivan Correctional Facility, the state agreed that the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office would submit status reports to the court three times a year regarding the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the most recent report, filed on January 25, 2024, the Attorney General's office reported that 44% of the installation had been completed, with equipment becoming operational in different buildings throughout the facility as it is installed. The estimated substantial completion date for the entire project is February 4, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

They also\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 4 of 17\nparticipated in, had knowledge of, or failed to intervene in the attempted cover up of the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr. Taylor's death.

Plaintiff sues Defendants Tucker, Witte, and Topel in their\nindividual capacities.\n12.  At all relevant times herein, Defendants Sullivan Correction Officers 1-20\n(collectively, \"Sullivan COs\"), whose names are presently unknown, were COs at Sullivan who\nunlawfully abused, harassed, or discriminated against Mr. Taylor; physically assaulted Mr.\nTaylor without lawful justification; had knowledge of or failed to intervene in this assault on Mr.\nTaylor; or attempted to cover up the circumstances of Mr. Taylor's death. At all relevant times\nherein, Sullivan COs were acting under color of state law and within the scope of their capacities\nas agents, servants, or employees of DOCCS. Plaintiff sues Defendants Sullivan COs in their\nindividual capacities.\nSTAT~M~NT OF FACTS\n13.  In 1995, Mr. Taylor began serving consecutive New York State prison sentences\nof 27 to 55 years.\n4\n9063653 v. l\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 5 of 17\n14.  Mr. Taylor was transferred to Sullivan on or about November 25, 2014. He was\nhoused in the Intermediate Care Program (\"ICP\"), located in the E North cell block on the East\nWing.\n15.  Applicable regulations define the ICP as a \"therapeutic community\" for those\nwith \"serious mental illness\":\n[The ICP is] a program that includes a separate housing location\nwithin a correctional facility designed to address the corrections-\nbased therapeutic treatment of inmates currently diagnosed with\nwhat is,  generally, a serious  mental illness.  The ICP is  a\ntherapeutic community which provides rehabilitative services to\ninmates who are unable to function in general population because\nof their mental illness. The goal of the program is to improve the\ninmates' ability to function through programming and treatment so\nthat they may return to general population.  An ICP is not\noperated as a disciplinary housing unit.2\n16.  Sullivan is designated by statute as an ICP Level 1 facility, meaning:\n\"[Office of Mental Health] staff is assigned on a full-time basis\nand able to provide treatment to inmate-patients with a majo r\nmental disorder.  The array of available specialized services\nincludes residential crisis treatment, residential/day treatment, case\nmanagement, medication monitoring by psychiatric nursing staff,\nand potential commitment to the central New York Psychiatric\nCenter.\"3\n17.  While Mr. Taylor was incarcerated at Sullivan, he was arbitrarily singled out for\nabuse by CO Tucker, Sullivan COs, and Senior Sullivan Officers on the basis of his race, mental\nhealth, or other immutable characteristic. These individuals would routinely isolate, harass,\nprovoke, and inflict arbitrary punishments on Mr. Taylor in the form of physical acts and verbal\nabuse, which included the use of slurs related to Mr. Taylor's race or mental illness. CO Tucker,\nSullivan COs, and Senior Sullivan Officers that regularly abused Mr. Taylor were white.\nSee Residential Mental Health Treatment Units, N.Y. COMP. CODES R. BL REGS. tlt. 7, § 320.4\n(2011).\n3 N.Y. CORK. LAW § 13~ ~ZOOH~.\n5\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 6 of 17\n18.  Upon information and belief, these individuals attempted to provoke Mr. Taylor\nso that his reaction would supposedly justify their violent, punitive response.\n19.  Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, Senior Sullivan Officers,\nand Sullivan COs knew or should have known that CO Tucker and others targeted Mr. Taylor for\nabuse and discrimination. These Defendants failed to take any action to protect Mr. Taylor or\nstop the violations of Mr. Taylor's rights.\n20.  Some weeks or days prior to April 13, 2015, COs entered Mr. Taylor's cell in his\nabsence. They threw his possession on the floor and squirted shampoo and other liquids onto his\nbelongings. COs were later heard boasting about having \"trashed\" Mr. Taylor's cell.\n21.  Mr. Taylor thereafter refused to clean his cell. He stated repeatedly that the COs\nwho trashed his cell should clean it. COs, including Tucker, repeatedly directed Mr. Taylor to\nclean his cell.\n22.  On the morning of April 13, 2015, there were at least three COs on duty in the\narea proximate to Mr. Taylor's cell: Tucker, Witte, and Topel.\n23.  CO Tucker began harassing Mr. Taylor, including with regard to cleanliness.\nWithout provocation, CO Tucker then attacked and beat Mr. Taylor, hitting him with a baton.\nMr. Taylor called for help, and requested to be taken to \"OBS,\" a safe, solitary space where\ninmates with mental health issues can be observed. No help arrived.\n24.  After enduring unprovoked blows from CO Tucker, Mr. Taylor grabbed the baton\nfrom CO Tucker and hit him with it on his forearm.\n25.  Upon information and belief, COs Witte and Tope] then tackled Mr. Taylor. One\nof them grabbed Mr. Taylor's legs and another grabbed him around his neck. Together, the COs\nrestrained Mr. Taylor, forced him to the ground, facedown, and handcuffed him.\n6\n9063653 v.] \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 7 of 17\n26.  Mr. Taylor told the COs that he could not breathe. Other inmates who could see\nand hear what was happening from their cells starting yelling to COs Witte and Topel words to\nthe effect of\" he can't breathe\" and \"he's not resisting.\" Upon information and belief, the COs\ndid not release Mr. Taylor.\n27.  After Mr. Taylor had been restrained facedown, a group of additional Senior\nSullivan Officers and Sullivan COs arrived upon the scene. They further beat, punched, kicked,\nand otherwise struck Mr. Taylor, even though his hands were tied and he was fully restrained.\n28.  One or more of the Defendants shouted racial epithets at Mr. Taylor, including the\nword \"nigger,\" as they beat him.\n29.  By the end of the beating, Mr. Taylor's body was limp but he was still conscious.\nUpon information and belief, Senior Sullivan Officers and Sullivan COs lifted Mr. Taylor and\ncarried him into the hallway connecting E North to other areas of Sullivan. Inmates could not\nsee into the hallway from their cells.\n30.  Upon information and belief, the officers continued to beat Mr. Taylor in the\nhallway while he was fully restrained.\n31.  Upon information and belief, other officers at Sullivan became aware that Mr.\nTaylor was being beaten after he had been restrained, but made no effort to intervene or summon\nassistance.\n32.  Mr. Taylor was then dragged to the Sullivan infirmary, leaving a blood trail\nthrough parts of the hallway, and thrown onto a bed. Superintendent Keyser and Deputy\nSuperintendent Burnett entered or were present in the infirmary around this time.\n33.  Mr. Taylor was pronounced dead at 9:25 am on April 13, 2015.\n7\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 8 of 17\n34.  Mr. Taylor's death was caused by injuries inflicted upon him by COs Tucker,\nWitte, and Topel; Sullivan COs; and Senior Sullivan Officers.\n35.  An Autopsy Report conducted on April 13, 2015 noted \"blunt impact injuries of\nthe head, torso, and extremities as well as compression of neck injuries.\" Injuries to the head\nincluded contusions on the bridge of the nose, right forehead, upper and lower lips, and a\nlaceration above the left eye. The Medical Examiner noted a \"subarachnoid hemorrhage ... of\nthe left temporal lobe of the brain.\" Neck injuries included hemorrhages in the \"subcutaneous\nsoft tissue of the midline of the neck,\" the \"strap muscles of the neck,\" and the \"midline of the\nmuscles of the posterior aspect of the neck.\" Mr. Taylor had fractures of his thyroid cartilage\nand petechiae present in his conjunctivae.\n36.  Mr. Taylor's \"manner of death\" was listed in the Autopsy Report as \"homicide.\"\n37.  After Mr. Taylor was taken to the infirmary, several Sullivan COs or inmates\nassigned to \"blood spill\" cleaned up Mr. Taylor's blood and other evidence of the beating.\nSullivan COs or inmates, at COs' instruction, bleached or painted over Mr. Taylor's cell, and\ndisposed of Mr. Taylor's personal effects.\n38.  In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Taylor's death, Sullivan COs told inmates that\nthey would be \"thrown in the hole\" if they spoke to investigators about what had happened.\nUpon information and belief, inmates were sent to solitary confinement after witnessing what\nhappened to Mr. Taylor or speaking out.\n39.  Shortly after Mr. Taylor's death, New York State investigators arrived at Sullivan\nand interviewed inmates about Mr. Taylor's beating and death. Some inmates declined to speak\nwith investigators or tell investigators what they had seen, for fear of retaliation.\n8\n90636 53 v. l\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 9 of 17\n40.  Investigators told at least one inmate that part of the events leading to Mr.\nTaylor's death had been captured on video, which at least one of the investigators had watched.\n41.  Upon information and belief, Defendants conspired to beat Mr. Taylor and cover\nup their role in the events that led to Mr. Taylor's death. Upon information and belief, their\nactions included:\na. Hiding evidence of Mr. Taylor's beating by cleaning up Mr. Taylor's blood\nbefore New York State investigators arrived, cleaning, bleaching, and painting\nover Mr. Taylor's cell, as well as the areas where he was beaten, and disposing of\nMr. Taylor's clothes or personal effects;\nb. Threatening potential witnesses and retaliating against witnesses who spoke out\nabout how Mr. Taylor was killed;\nc. Jointly devising a false, exculpatory version of the events of April 13, 2015,\nwhich would be told to investigating authorities;\nd. Lying to New York State investigators about the events of April 13, 2015;\ne. Using the New York State Correction Officers and Police Benevolent Association\n(\"NYSCOPBA\")t o propagate a false narrative of the events surrounding Mr.\nTaylor's death, including falsely claiming that Mr. Taylor had started the fight\nwith CO Tucker by \"punching [CO Tucker] in the head\"4;\nf.  Coordinating false testimony that was presented to a grand jury assembled by the\nSullivan County District Attorney;\ng.  Otherwise suppressing incriminating information.\n4 NYSCOPBA News from the Field, http://www.n~pba.org/news-field (last visited Feb. 5,\n2016).\n9\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 10 of 17\n42.  Mr. Taylor's autopsy report was prepared on and dated April 13, 2015, the day he\nwas killed. However, in or about August 2015, officials from the Sullivan County Coroner's\nOffice falsely represented to the media and Mr. Taylor's next-of-kin that the autopsy had not\nbeen completed.5\n43.  After Mr. Taylor died, a person at Sullivan whose identity is unknown called Ms.\nRamsay-Nobles and told her that Mr. Taylor was \"code blue.\" She was provided with no further\ninformation.\n44.  After Mr. Taylor died, Sullivan officials did not release any of Mr. Taylor's\npersonal property to Ms. Ramsay-Nobles, even after she identified herself as his next of kin.\nDOCCS did send Ms. Ramsay-Nobles a check dated April 15, 2015 for two dollars.\n45.  Defendants contributed to or permitted a culture at Sullivan whereby Sullivan\nCOs abused or discriminated against incarcerated people at Sullivan, and this abuse and\ndiscrimination was concealed or otherwise covered up. Defendants failed to establish and\nimplement policies that would protect inmates' civil rights, and failed to supervise, train or\nmonitor COs at Sullivan under their charge.\n46.  Upon information and belief, Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent\nBurnett, and Senior Sullivan Officers were aware of or deliberately indifferent to a pattern and\npractice of COs' abuse of inmates, including Mr. Taylor. Defendants knew or should have\nknown that CO Tucker, Senior Sullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs had a history of abuse and\nviolence towards inmates with mental illness, including Mr. Taylor. Upon information and\nbelief, Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, and Senior Sullivan Officers\nSee, e.g., Crimesider Staff, Group wants federal probe of NY prisons expanded, CBS NEws,\n(August 21, 2015, 8:03 am), http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ roue-wants-federal-probe-of-ny-\nprisons-expanded/.\n10\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 11 of 17\nknew that Sullivan COs, and CO Tucker in particular, would target inmates suffering from\nmental illness because they were less likely to complain or report misconduct.\n47.  Inmates had on numerous occasions reported CO Tucker's, Senior Sullivan\nOfficers', and Sullivan COs' abusive and racist treatment to higher-ranking Sullivan officials.\nAdditionally, Senior Sullivan Officers knew or should have known that Sullivan COs would\nsometimes deliberately fail to process inmate grievances alleging COs' abusive conduct.\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\nAgainst All Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n48.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in\nparagraphs 1-47 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.\n49.  The acts of Defendants constituted conduct under color of state law that deprived\nMr. Taylor of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the\nUnited States, including the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n50.  The Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the Eighth Amendment places restraints\non prison officials, who may not ...use excessive physical force against prisoners.\"~ \"Being\nviolently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their\noffenses against society,\" and COs who engage in such assaults under color of law are violating\nthe Eighth Amendment.'\n51.  Upon information and belief, Senior Sullivan Officers; Sullivan COs; and COs\nTucker, Witte, and Topel, used excessive and unlawful force against Mr. Taylor, maliciously and\nwith the intent and purpose of causing harm. This force constituted cruel and unusual\npunishment, and ultimately, Mr. Taylor's death.\n6 Fai^rr~er v. Brown, 511 U.S. 825, 832( 1994)( citations omitted).\n~ Id. at 834 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n11\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 12 of 17\n52.  Mr. Taylor was intentionally treated differently from similarly-situated\nindividuals without rational basis, or was discriminated against based on race. Evidence of this\ndisparate treatment can be found in the previous paragraphs, and includes CO Tucker, Senior\nSullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs singling out Mr. Taylor for abuse, harassment, and arbitrary\npunishment; repeated physical and verbal abuse including racial slurs; and use of racial slurs\nwhile beating Mr. Taylor after he had been restrained on April 13, 2015, the date of his death.\nThese officers were motivated by discriminatory animus.\n53.  Defendants Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, and Senior\nSullivan Officers permitted, tolerated, caused, knew about, should have known about, or were\ndeliberately indifferent or grossly negligent to a pattern and practice of severe abuse and neglect,\nconstituting torture, against inmates at Sullivan prior to and during the time of Mr. Taylor's\ndeath; the practice of racially discriminatory treatment of incarcerated individuals, including Mr.\nTaylor; and the arbitrary targeting of Mr. Taylor for abuse and punishment. Despite this\nknowledge, these Defendants consciously permitted the custom or practice of severe physical\nabuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and discrimination to continue. Their failure to take measures\nto curb this pattern of abuse and discrimination constituted acquiescence of the known unlawful\nbehavior of their subordinates, and deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of the\nincarcerated individuals in their care and custody, and specifically, Mr. Taylor. These\nDefendants were grossly negligent or failed to supervise, train, and oversee COs at Sullivan.\nTheir conduct deprived Mr. Taylor of his rights, and was a substantial factor in the continuation\nof such abuse, a proximate cause of Constitutional violations alleged in this complaint, and\nultimately, the cause of Mr. Taylor's death.\n12\n9063653v.1\n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 1   Filed 07/20/16   Page 13 of 17\n54.  Defendants had an affirmative duty and reasonable opportunity to intervene, on\nbehalf of Mr. Taylor, to prevent his beating, discrimination, the use of force that resulted in Mr.\nTaylor's death, and the attempted cover-up of the violation of Mr. Taylor's Constitutional rights,\nbut due to their intentional conduct or deliberate indifference, failed to do so.\n55.  Defendants committed the acts alleged herein intentionally, willfully, wantonly,\nmaliciously, sadistically, or with such reckless disregard of the consequences as to reveal a\nconscious indifference to the clear risk of death or serious injury to Mr. Taylor that shocks the\nconscience. Defendants are liable for punitive damages.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\nAgainst All Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for\nConspiring to Violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n56.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in\nparagraphs 1-55 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.\n57.  Acting under the color of state law, Defendants conspired and acted in concert to\ndeprive Mr. Taylor of his Constitutional rights, including the rights to be free from cruel and\nunusual punishment, arbitrary targeting, or racial discrimination. As a direct and proximate\nresult of the conduct alleged herein, Defendants contributed to, knew of, or failed to intervene in\nthe fatal beating of Mr. Taylor at the hands of COs at Sullivan. In committing the acts and\nomissions complained of herein, Defendants also breached their affirmative duty to intervene to\nprotect Mr. Taylor's Constitutional rights from infringement by other law enforcement officers\nin their presence.\n58.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in\nparagraphs 1-59 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.\n61.  Defendants conspired together to impede the due course ofj ustice, interfering\nwith the federal and state judicial processes, with the intent of denying Mr. Taylor and his Estate\nthe equal protection of the laws.\n62.  Defendants intimidated witnesses, destroyed evidence, and otherwise covered up\ntheir violations of Mr. Taylor's rights, as enumerated in the previous paragraphs.\n63.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff claims as\ndamages pecuniary loss including medical expenses, funeral expenses and lost earnings, as well\nas non-economic damages, including conscious pain, mental anguish, and physical injury\nsuffered by Mr. Taylor prior to his death and the consequential loss of enjoyment of life.\n64.

Defendants participated in and knew of the conspiracy to deprive Mr. Taylor of\nthe equal protection of the law on the basis of his race. They had the power and ability to\nprevent the conspiracy, but refused or neglected to do so.\n67.  CO Tucker, Senior Sullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs regularly called Mr.\nTaylor racial slurs and epithets from around the time that he arrived at Sullivan, and in particular,\non the day that they beat him to death. This racial abuse was primarily or exclusively initiated\nby white officers.\n68.  CO Tucker, Senior Sullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs notoriously and\nfrequently abused Mr. Taylor, both physically and verbally, and subjected him to arbitrary\npunishment. Upon information and belief, they attempted to provoke Mr. Taylor so that his\nreaction would justify their violence response.\n69.  In furtherance of their conspiracy, all Defendants subjected Mr. Taylor to\nunlawful acts, thereby depriving him of his rights to the equal protection of the laws and equal\nprivileges and immunities under the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution. Defendants also took overt acts to participate in or cover up their\nviolations of Mr. Taylor's rights, as enumerated in the previous paragraphs, interfering with state\nand federal judicial processes.\n70.

This is a civil rights action brought by Plaintiff Julia Ramsay-Nobles, individually \nand as Administratrix of the Estate of Karl Taylor, seeking redress for the death of her brother, \nKarl Taylor, who was incarcerated at the Sullivan Correctional Facility (“Sullivan”) in Fallsburg, \nNew York.   \n2.  While incarcerated in New York State prisons, Karl Taylor was repeatedly \n10234675 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 2 of 26\ndiagnosed with severe mental illness.  Nonetheless, he spent many years in solitary confinement \nbefore being transferred to Sullivan in November 2014.  At Sullivan, Mr. Taylor was housed in a \nmental health unit as he was unable to function in general population.  In this unit, he was in the \nAssisted Daily Living program for inmates who required assistance with basic life functions.  \nNonetheless, Mr. Taylor was denied adequate medical treatment, and, in particular, intervention \nfrom staff psychiatrists, as his mental health deteriorated. \n3.  Mr. Taylor was also repeatedly provoked and harassed by Correction Officers \n(“COs”) assigned to his cell block, including CO Bruce Tucker, who had a history of abusing \ninmates suffering from mental illness.  Upon information and belief, as Mr. Taylor’s mental \nhealth deteriorated, he became less able to cope with the abuse endured from CO Tucker and \nother officers. \n4.  On the morning of April 13, 2015, CO Tucker was verbally abusive to Mr. Taylor \nregarding cleanliness, escalating a routine confrontation to the point where Mr. Taylor feared for \nhis safety.  Mr. Taylor called for help and requested to be taken to a protective mental health area \nwhere he would be safe.  CO Tucker then took out his baton and hit Mr. Taylor.  Mr. Taylor took \nthe baton, and struck CO Tucker on the forearm. \n5.  Shortly thereafter, Mr. Taylor was restrained by multiple officers, including \nDefendants COs Tucker, Witte, Topel, Walter, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir, and handcuffed.  \nThese officers and Defendants beat and choked him on the cell block.  Mr. Taylor was then \nrestrained and taken to the hallway, which was not visible to inmates in the cell block.  In the \nhallway, officers, including Defendants Sgts. Frunzi, and Bunch, and COs Walter, Daddezio, \nDarling, Santos, Steinberg, and Weir beat and choked Mr. Taylor further. \n6.  Mr. Taylor’s Autopsy Report observed that he suffered “blunt impact injuries of \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 3 of 26\nthe head, torso, and extremities as well as compression of neck injuries.”  These included \ncontusions on the bridge of the nose, right forehead, upper and lower lips, a laceration above the \nleft eye, a “subarachnoid hemorrhage . . . of the left temporal lobe of the brain,” as well as \nfractures of his thyroid cartilage and petechiae present in his conjunctivae. \n7.  Mr. Taylor died as a result of the beating and choking at the hands of Defendants \nTucker, Witte, Topel, Frunzi, Bunch, Daddezio, Walter, Darling Steinberg, Santos, Weir, and, \nupon information and belief, other unknown officer and supervisor Defendants at Sullivan. \n8.  The Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (“DOCCS”) \nDefendants’1 actions violated Mr. Taylor’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \nof the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985, and New York State common \nlaw.  Dr. Lee’s actions violated Mr. Taylor’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and New York State law.  \nPlaintiff seeks redress for Defendants’ acts and omissions that were contrary to the norms of a \ncivilized society, deprived Karl Taylor of civil rights protected by law, and caused his death. \n                                                 \n1 The DOCCS Defendants are Superintendent William Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Edward Burnett, \nSergeant (“Sgt.”) John Frunzi, Sgt. Timothy Bunch, the Senior Sullivan Officers 1-18, Correction Officer \n(“CO”) Bruce Tucker, CO Steven Witte, CO Shane Topel, CO Daniel Walter, CO Joseph Daddezio, CO \nKevin Darling, CO James Steinberg Jr., CO Felix Santos, CO Michael Weir, and Sullivan Correction \nOfficers 1-14. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 4 of 26\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction in this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 1343(a)(4) because this is an action for redress for the violation of Karl \nTaylor’s constitutional and civil rights.  Defendants work or worked at Sullivan, where the \nevents giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims took place, and are subject to personal jurisdiction. \n10.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S. § 1367(a) over state \nlaw claims that are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or \ncontroversy.  \n11.  Venue is proper in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims took place \ntherein. \nJURY DEMAND \n12.  Plaintiff demands a trial by jury in this action on all claims for which jury trial is \nlegally available. \nPARTIES \n13.

In 1995, Mr. Taylor began serving consecutive New York State prison sentences \nof 27 to 55 years. \n23.  During his incarceration, DOCCS or OMH officials recognized that Mr. Taylor \nsuffered from acute mental illness.  They responded by housing him in mental health units, \nprescribing medication, twice transferring him to a mental health hospital for a period of time – \nthe Central New York Psychiatric Center (“CNYPC”) – and seeking court-ordered medication of \nRisperdal, an anti-psychotic medication.  CNYPC is “a comprehensive mental health service \ndelivery system providing a full range of care and treatment to persons incarcerated in the New \nYork State and County Correctional System.”2 \n24.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Taylor’s mental health condition had improved \nduring his time at CNYPC and while he was receiving court-ordered medication. \n                                                 \n2Office of Mental Health, Central New York Psychiatric Center, OMH \nhttps://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/facilities/cnpc/ (last visited Apr. 6, 2017) \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 8 of 26\n25.  Throughout the course of his incarceration, Mr. Taylor was diagnosed as suffering \nfrom Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, and \nPolysubstance Dependence. \n26.  Nevertheless, Mr. Taylor was regularly punished with long stays in isolation or \nsegregation.  Upon information and belief, he spent approximately 12 years in the Special \nHousing Unit, also known as “solitary confinement,” and approximately four years in \n“keeplock,” another form of segregation.  In all, he spent approximately 16 years, or \napproximately 80% of his time in prison in isolation or segregation. \n27.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Taylor’s mental health deteriorated during long \nstays in isolation or segregation, and he was unable to comply with prison regulations due to his \nmental illness. \n28.  Defendants knew or should have known of Mr. Taylor’s serious mental illness. \nB.  Mr. Taylor’s Mental Health Treatment at Sullivan \n29.  Mr. Taylor was transferred to Sullivan on or about November 25, 2014.  He was \nhoused in the Intermediate Care Program (“ICP”), located in the E North cell block on the East \nWing. \n30.  Applicable regulations define the ICP as a “therapeutic community” for those \nwith “serious mental illness”: \n[The ICP is] a program that includes a separate housing location \nwithin a correctional facility designed to address the corrections-\nbased therapeutic treatment of inmates currently diagnosed with \nwhat  is,  generally,  a  serious  mental  illness.  The  ICP  is  a \ntherapeutic community which provides rehabilitative services to \ninmates who are unable to function in general population because \nof their mental illness. The goal of the program is to improve the \ninmates’ ability to function through programming and treatment so \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 9 of 26\nthat they may return to general population. . . .  An ICP is not \noperated as a disciplinary housing unit.3 \n \n31.  Sullivan is designated by statute as an ICP Level 1 facility, meaning: \n[Office of Mental Health] staff is assigned on a full-time basis and \nable to provide treatment to inmate-patients with a major mental \ndisorder.    The  array  of  available  specialized  services  includes \nresidential  crisis  treatment,  residential/day  treatment,  case \nmanagement, medication monitoring by psychiatric nursing staff, \nand potential commitment to the central New York Psychiatric \nCenter.4 \n32.  While Mr. Taylor was incarcerated at Sullivan, he was arbitrarily singled out for \nabuse by CO Tucker, and upon information and belief, other officers, on the basis of Mr. \nTaylor’s race, mental health, or other immutable characteristics.  Officers would routinely \nisolate, harass, provoke, and inflict arbitrary punishments on Mr. Taylor in the form of physical \nacts and verbal abuse, which included the use of slurs related to Mr. Taylor’s race or mental \nillness.  CO Tucker and other officers that regularly abused Mr. Taylor were white. \n33.  Upon information and belief, these individuals attempted to provoke Mr. Taylor \nso that his reaction would supposedly justify their violent, punitive response. \n34.  The DOCCS Defendants knew or should have known that CO Tucker and others \ntargeted Mr. Taylor for abuse and discrimination.  These Defendants failed to take any action to \nprotect Mr. Taylor or stop the violations of Mr. Taylor’s rights. \n35.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Taylor feared for his safety and sought to \nremain in his cell.  He refused to participate in group treatment programs or leave his cell for \nmedical treatment.  Mr. Taylor’s mental health further deteriorated.  He suffered auditory and/or \nvisual hallucinations. \n                                                 \n3 See Residential Mental Health Treatment Units, N.Y. COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 7, § 320.4 \n(2011). \n4 N.Y. CORR. LAW § 137 (2008). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 10 of 26\n36.  In January 2015, DOCCS or OMH officials transferred Mr. Taylor to an \nobservation cell in the Residential Crisis Treatment Program (“RCTP”), a mental health crisis \narea at Sullivan, so he could be monitored more closely. \n37.  Mr. Taylor had a mental health treatment team in the RCTP consisting of social \nworkers, Nurse Practitioners, Psychology Assistants and mental health care professionals.  Dr. \nLee was a psychiatrist on Mr. Taylor’s treatment team who provided mental health services to \nhim, and supervised or instructed the other team members. \n38.  In February 2015, the social workers, Nurse Practitioners, Psychology Assistants \nand mental health care professionals who supposedly provided Mr. Taylor’s mental health care \nreached a consensus that Mr. Taylor needed to be transferred to CNYPC for inpatient treatment \nbecause Mr. Taylor’s mental health condition was deteriorating at the Sullivan ICP or not \nimproving, and because Mr. Taylor was not complying with the treatment program therein. \n39.  CNYPC is the only psychiatric facility serving inmates in the custody of DOCCS.  \nThe hospital offers a range of inpatient services, including individual and group therapy, \ntreatment planning, medication management, and psychological and forensic assessment. \n40.  Upon information and belief, as Mr. Taylor’s treating physician, Dr. Lee had \nauthority to approve Mr. Taylor’s transfer to CNYPC.  Despite the medical team’s consensus \nthat Mr. Taylor should be sent to CNYPC, Dr. Lee neither approved nor denied the transfer. \n41.  Instead, Dr. Lee discharged Mr. Taylor from the RCTP, and sent him back to E \nNorth.  \n42.  Dr. Lee did not consider Mr. Taylor’s previous court-ordered medication.  He also \ndid not adequately consider Mr. Taylor’s mental health condition or threats he faced from certain \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 11 of 26\nCOs, namely, CO Tucker.  In fact, Mr. Taylor had repeatedly complained to OMH staff that he \nwas being harassed by an officer.  Upon information and belief, this officer was CO Tucker. \n43.  After Mr. Taylor’s death, Dr. Lee admitted that had he considered Mr. Taylor’s \ncourt-ordered medication he probably would have determined that Mr. Taylor should have been \ntransferred to CNYPC. \n44.  Dr. Lee failed to provide Mr. Taylor with the level of mental health treatment and \nsupervision required for an inmate with a serious mental health illness. \n45.  Mr. Taylor returned to his cell in E North towards the end of February 2015. \n46.  On April 13, 2015, he died as a result of being beaten and choked by Defendants \nTucker, Witte, Topel, Frunzi, Bunch, Daddezio, Walter, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir. \nC.  Karl Taylor’s Beating and Death \n47.  Some weeks or days prior to April 13, 2015, the day that Mr. Taylor died, CO \nTucker, and upon information and belief, other officers, entered Mr. Taylor’s cell in his absence.  \nThey threw his possession on the floor and squirted shampoo and other liquids onto his \nbelongings.  COs were later heard boasting about having “trashed” Mr. Taylor’s cell. \n48.  Mr. Taylor thereafter refused to clean his cell.  He stated repeatedly that the COs \nwho trashed his cell should clean it.  COs, including Tucker, repeatedly directed Mr. Taylor to \nclean his cell.  CO Tucker would arbitrarily turn Mr. Taylor’s water off, spray germicide through \nMr. Taylor’s cell bars, and throw soap into Mr. Taylor’s cell. \n49.  On the morning of April 13, 2015, CO Tucker began harassing Mr. Taylor, \nincluding with regard to cleanliness. \n50.  CO Tucker demanded that Mr. Taylor clean his cell and Mr. Taylor refused.  \nWithout provocation, CO Tucker then attacked and beat Mr. Taylor, hitting him with a baton.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 12 of 26\nMr. Taylor called for help, and requested to be taken to “OBS,” a safe, solitary space where \ninmates with mental health issues can be observed.  No help arrived. \n51.  At this time, there were at least three COs on duty in the area proximate to Mr. \nTaylor’s cell block:  Tucker, Witte, and Topel. \n52.  After enduring unprovoked blows from CO Tucker, Mr. Taylor took CO Tucker’s \nbaton, and hit CO Tucker with it on his forearm. \n53.  COs Witte and Topel then tackled Mr. Taylor.  One of them grabbed Mr. Taylor’s \nlegs and another grabbed him around his neck.  Together, the COs restrained Mr. Taylor, forcing \nhim to the ground, facedown. \n54.  After Mr. Taylor had been restrained facedown, a group of additional officers, \nincluding COs Walter, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir arrived upon the scene, and handcuffed him.  \nThese officers and, upon information and belief, Defendants Tucker, Witte, Topel, further beat, \npunched, kicked, and otherwise struck Mr. Taylor, even though he was handcuffed and fully \nrestrained. \n55.  One or more of the officers shouted racial epithets at Mr. Taylor, including the \nword “nigger,” as they beat him. \n56.  Mr. Taylor told these officers and Defendants that he could not breathe.  Other \ninmates who could see and hear what was happening from their cells started yelling words to the \neffect of “he can’t breathe” and “he’s not resisting” as they watched Mr. Taylor being beaten \nafter restrained. \n57.  Officers shouted at the inmates in E North to “get off [their] rails,” meaning move \nfurther into their cells, so the inmates could not see Mr. Taylor’s beating.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 13 of 26\n58.  After the beating, Mr. Taylor was escorted off the cell block in handcuffs, into the \nhallway that connects E North to other areas of Sullivan. \n59.  Inmates in E North could not see into the hallway from their cells. \n60.  Upon information and belief, Defendants Tucker, Witte, Topel, Frunzi, Bunch, \nWalter, Daddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, Weir, and other officers continued to beat and \nchoke Mr. Taylor in the hallway while he was fully restrained.  At times, Sgt. Frunzi held Mr. \nTaylor while other officers struck him.  One or more of these officers and Defendants continued \nto shout racial epithets at Mr. Taylor as they beat him, calling him a “monkey” and “nigger.” \n61.  Upon information and belief, other officers at Sullivan became aware that Mr. \nTaylor was being beaten after he had been handcuffed, but made no effort to intervene or \nsummon assistance. \n62.  Mr. Taylor was then dragged to the Sullivan infirmary, leaving a blood trail \nthrough parts of the hallway, and thrown onto a bed.  Superintendent Keyser and Deputy \nSuperintendent Burnett entered or were present in the Infirmary around this time. \n63.  Mr. Taylor was pronounced dead at 9:25 am on April 13, 2015. \n64.  Mr. Taylor’s death was caused by injuries inflicted upon him by Defendants \nTucker, Witte, Topel, Frunzi, Bunch, Walter, Daddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir. \n65.  An Autopsy Report conducted on April 13, 2015 noted “blunt impact injuries of \nthe head, torso, and extremities as well as compression of neck injuries.”  Injuries to the head \nincluded contusions on the bridge of the nose, right forehead, upper and lower lips, and a \nlaceration above the left eye.  The Medical Examiner noted a “subarachnoid hemorrhage . . . of \nthe left temporal lobe of the brain.”  Neck injuries included hemorrhages in the “subcutaneous \nsoft tissue of the midline of the neck,” the “strap muscles of the neck,” and the “midline of the \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 14 of 26\nmuscles of the posterior aspect of the neck.”  Mr. Taylor had fractures of his thyroid cartilage \nand petechiae present in his conjunctivae.   \n66.  Mr. Taylor’s “manner of death” was listed in the Autopsy Report as “homicide.”   \n67.  After Mr. Taylor was taken to the infirmary, several officers or inmates assigned \nto “blood spill” cleaned up Mr. Taylor’s blood and other evidence of the beating.  Officers or \ninmates, at officers’ instruction, bleached or painted over Mr. Taylor’s cell, and disposed of Mr. \nTaylor’s personal effects. \n68.  In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Taylor’s death, Sullivan COs told certain \ninmates that they would be “thrown in the hole” if they spoke to investigators about what had \nhappened.  Upon information and belief, inmates were sent to solitary confinement after \nwitnessing what happened to Mr. Taylor or speaking out. \n69.  Shortly after Mr. Taylor’s death, New York State investigators arrived at Sullivan \nand interviewed inmates about Mr. Taylor’s beating and death.  Some inmates declined to speak \nwith investigators or tell investigators what they had seen, for fear of retaliation. \n70.  Investigators told at least one inmate that part of the events leading to Mr. \nTaylor’s death had been captured on video, which at least one of the investigators had watched. \n71.  The DOCCS Defendants conspired to beat Mr. Taylor and cover up their role in \nthe events that led to Mr. Taylor’s death.  Their actions included: \na.  Continuing to beat and choke Mr. Taylor in the hallway, away from inmates in the \ncell block; \nb.  Ordering inmate witnesses in E North off their gates and inmate witnesses in the \nhallway to turn and face the wall; \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 15 of 26\nc.  Hiding evidence of Mr. Taylor’s beating by cleaning up Mr. Taylor’s blood \nbefore New York State investigators arrived, cleaning, bleaching, and painting \nover Mr. Taylor’s cell, as well as the areas where he was beaten, and disposing of \nMr. Taylor’s clothes or personal effects; \nd.  Threatening potential witnesses and retaliating against witnesses who spoke out \nabout how Mr. Taylor was killed; \ne.  Jointly devising a false, exculpatory version of the events of April 13, 2015, \nwhich would be told to investigating authorities; \nf.  Lying to New York State investigators about the events of April 13, 2015; \ng.  Using the New York State Correction Officers and Police Benevolent Association \n(“NYSCOPBA”) to propagate a false narrative of the events surrounding Mr. \nTaylor’s death, including falsely claiming that Mr. Taylor had started the fight \nwith CO Tucker by “punching [CO Tucker] in the head”5; \nh.  Coordinating false testimony that was presented to a grand jury assembled by the \nSullivan County District Attorney; \ni.  Otherwise suppressing incriminating information. \n72.  Mr. Taylor’s autopsy was performed on April 13, 2015, the day he was killed, and \nthe autopsy report was dated June 7, 2015.  However, in or about August 2015, officials from the \nSullivan County Coroner’s Office falsely represented to the media and Mr. Taylor’s next-of-kin \nthat the autopsy had not been completed.6 \n                                                 \n5 NYSCOPBA News from the Field, http://www.nyscopba.org/news-field (last visited Feb. 5, \n2016). \n6 See, e.g., Crimesider Staff, Group wants federal probe of NY prisons expanded, CBS NEWS, \n(August 21, 2015, 8:03 am), http://www.cbsnews.com/news/group-wants-federal-probe-of-ny-\nprisons-expanded/.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 16 of 26\n73.  After Mr. Taylor died, a person at Sullivan whose identity is unknown called Ms. \nRamsay-Nobles and told her that Mr. Taylor was “code blue.”  She was provided with no further \ninformation.   \n74.  After Mr. Taylor died, Sullivan officials did not release any of Mr. Taylor’s \npersonal property to Ms. Ramsay-Nobles, even after she identified herself as his next of kin.  \nDOCCS did send Ms. Ramsay-Nobles a check dated April 15, 2015 for two dollars.  \n75.  The DOCCS Defendants contributed to or permitted a culture at Sullivan whereby \nSullivan COs abused or discriminated against incarcerated people at Sullivan, and this abuse and \ndiscrimination was concealed or otherwise covered up.  The DOCCS Defendants failed to \nestablish and implement policies that would protect inmates’ civil rights, and failed to supervise, \ntrain or monitor COs at Sullivan under their charge. \n76.  Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, and Senior Sullivan \nOfficers were aware of or deliberately indifferent to a pattern and practice of COs’ abuse of \ninmates, including Mr. Taylor.  These Defendants knew or should have known that CO Tucker \nhad a history of abuse and violence towards inmates with mental illness, including Mr. Taylor.  \nSuperintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, and Senior Sullivan Officers knew or \nshould have known that CO Tucker, in particular, would target inmates suffering from mental \nillness because they were less likely to complain or report misconduct. \n77.  Inmates had on numerous occasions reported CO Tucker’s abusive and racist \ntreatment to higher-ranking Sullivan or DOCCS officials.  Additionally, Superintendent Keyser \nor Deputy Superintendent Burnett knew or should have known that Sullivan COs would \nsometimes deliberately fail to process inmate grievances alleging COs’ abusive conduct. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 17 of 26\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nAgainst Defendants Keyser, Burnett, Frunzi, Tucker, Witte, and Topel, Bunch, \nWalter, Daddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n78.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-77 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n79.  The acts of the DOCCS Defendants constituted conduct under color of state law \nthat deprived Mr. Taylor of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States, including the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. \n80.  The Supreme Court has emphasized that “the Eighth Amendment places restraints \non prison officials, who may not . . . use excessive physical force against prisoners.”7  “Being \nviolently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their \noffenses against society,” and COs who engage in such assaults under color of law are violating \nthe Eighth Amendment.8 \n81.  Senior Sullivan Officers; Sullivan COs; COs Tucker, Witte, Topel; Walter, \nDaddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir, and Sgts. Frunzi and Bunch, used excessive and \nunlawful force against Mr. Taylor, maliciously and with the intent and purpose of causing harm.  \nThis force constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and ultimately, caused Mr. Taylor’s death. \n82.  Mr. Taylor was intentionally treated differently from similarly-situated \nindividuals without rational basis, or was discriminated against based on race.  Evidence of this \ndisparate treatment can be found in the previous paragraphs, and includes CO Tucker, Senior \nSullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs singling out Mr. Taylor for abuse, harassment, and arbitrary \npunishment; repeated physical and verbal abuse including racial slurs; and use of racial slurs \n                                                 \n7 Farmer v. Brown, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (citations omitted). \n8 Id. at 834 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 18 of 26\nwhile beating Mr. Taylor after he had been restrained on April 13, 2015, the date of his death.  \nThese officers were motivated by discriminatory animus. \n83.  Defendants Superintendent Keyser, Deputy Superintendent Burnett, and Senior \nSullivan Officers permitted, tolerated, caused, knew about, should have known about, or were \ndeliberately indifferent or grossly negligent to a pattern and practice of severe abuse and neglect, \nconstituting torture, against inmates at Sullivan prior to and during the time of Mr. Taylor’s \ndeath; the practice of racially discriminatory treatment of incarcerated individuals, including Mr. \nTaylor; and the arbitrary targeting of Mr. Taylor for abuse and punishment.  Despite this \nknowledge, these Defendants consciously permitted the custom or practice of severe physical \nabuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and discrimination to continue.  Their failure to take measures \nto curb this pattern of abuse and discrimination constituted acquiescence of the known unlawful \nbehavior of their subordinates, and deliberate indifference to the rights and safety of the \nincarcerated individuals in their care and custody, and specifically, Mr. Taylor.  These \nDefendants were grossly negligent or failed to supervise, train, and oversee COs at Sullivan.  \nTheir conduct deprived Mr. Taylor of his rights, and was a substantial factor in the continuation \nof such abuse, a proximate cause of Constitutional violations alleged in this complaint, and \nultimately, the cause of Mr. Taylor’s death. \n84.  The DOCCS Defendants had an affirmative duty and reasonable opportunity to \nintervene, on behalf of Mr. Taylor, to prevent his beating, discrimination, the use of force that \nresulted in Mr. Taylor’s death, and the attempted cover-up of the violation of Mr. Taylor’s \nConstitutional rights, but due to their intentional conduct or deliberate indifference, failed to do \nso. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 19 of 26\n85.  The DOCCS Defendants committed the acts alleged herein intentionally, \nwillfully, wantonly, maliciously, sadistically, or with such reckless disregard of the \nconsequences as to reveal a conscious indifference to the clear risk of death or serious injury to \nMr. Taylor that shocks the conscience.  The DOCCS Defendants are liable for punitive damages. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nAgainst Defendants Keyser, Burnett, Frunzi, Tucker, Witte, Topel, Bunch, Walter, \nDaddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for \nConspiring to Violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \n \n86.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-85 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n87.  Acting under the color of state law, the DOCCS Defendants conspired and acted \nin concert to deprive Mr. Taylor of his Constitutional rights, including the rights to be free from \ncruel and unusual punishment, arbitrary targeting, or racial discrimination.  As a direct and \nproximate result of the conduct alleged herein, the DOCCS Defendants contributed to, knew of, \nor failed to intervene in the fatal beating of Mr. Taylor at the hands of COs at Sullivan.  In \ncommitting the acts and omissions complained of herein, the DOCCS Defendants also breached \ntheir affirmative duty to intervene to protect Mr. Taylor’s Constitutional rights from \ninfringement by other law enforcement officers in their presence. \n88.  In furtherance of the conspiracy to contribute to and cover up the acts of brutality \nagainst Mr. Taylor on April 13, 2015, the DOCCS Defendants’ actions included: \na.  Hiding evidence of Mr. Taylor’s beating by cleaning up Mr. Taylor’s blood \nbefore New York State investigators arrived, cleaning, bleaching, and painting \nover Mr. Taylor’s cell, as well as the areas where he was beaten, and disposing of \nMr. Taylor’s clothes or personal effects; \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 20 of 26\nb.  Threatening potential witnesses and retaliating against witnesses who spoke out \nabout how Mr. Taylor was killed; \nc.  Jointly devising a false, exculpatory version of the events of April 13, 2015, \nwhich would be told to investigating authorities; \nd.  Lying to New York State investigators about the events of April 13, 2015; \ne.  Using the NYSCOPBA, to propagate a false narrative of the events surrounding \nMr. Taylor’s death, including falsely claiming that Mr. Taylor had started the \nfight with CO Tucker by “punching [CO Tucker] in the head”9; \nf.  Coordinating false testimony that was presented to a grand jury assembled by the \nSullivan County District Attorney; \ng.  Otherwise suppressing incriminating information. \n89.  The DOCCS Defendants committed the foregoing acts intentionally, willfully, \nwantonly, maliciously, or with such reckless disregard of the consequences as to reveal a \nconscious indifference to the clear risk of death or serious injury to Mr. Taylor that shocks the \nconscience.  The DOCCS Defendants are liable for punitive damages. \n                                                 \n9 NYSCOPBA News from the Field, http://www.nyscopba.org/news-field (last visited Feb. 5, \n2016). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 21 of 26\nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nAgainst Defendants Keyser, Burnett, Frunzi, Tucker, Witte, Topel, Bunch, Walter, \nDaddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2)  \nfor Conspiring to Impede the Due Course of Justice \n \n90.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-89 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n91.  The DOCCS Defendants conspired together to impede the due course of justice, \ninterfering with the federal and state judicial processes, with the intent of denying Mr. Taylor \nand his Estate the equal protection of the laws. \n92.  The DOCCS Defendants intimidated witnesses, destroyed evidence, and \notherwise covered up their violations of Mr. Taylor’s rights, as enumerated in the previous \nparagraphs. \n93.  As a direct and proximate result of the DOCCS Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff \nclaims as damages pecuniary loss including medical expenses, funeral expenses and lost \nearnings, as well as non-economic damages, including conscious pain, mental anguish, and \nphysical injury suffered by Mr. Taylor prior to his death and the consequential loss of enjoyment \nof life.  \n94.  The DOCCS Defendants committed the foregoing acts intentionally, willfully, \nwantonly, maliciously, or with such reckless disregard of the consequences as to reveal a \nconscious indifference to the clear risk of death or serious injury to Mr. Taylor that shocks the \nconscience.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-94 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n96.  The DOCCS Defendants participated in and knew of the conspiracy to deprive \nMr. Taylor of the equal protection of the law on the basis of his race.  They had the power and \nability to prevent the conspiracy, but refused or neglected to do so. \n97.  CO Tucker, Senior Sullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs regularly called Mr. \nTaylor racial slurs and epithets from around the time that he arrived at Sullivan, and in particular, \non the day that they beat him to death.  This racial abuse was primarily or exclusively initiated \nby white officers. \n98.  CO Tucker, Senior Sullivan Officers, and Sullivan COs notoriously and \nfrequently abused Mr. Taylor, both physically and verbally, and subjected him to arbitrary \npunishment.  Upon information and belief, they attempted to provoke Mr. Taylor so that his \nreaction would justify their violence response.  \n99.  In furtherance of their conspiracy, the DOCCS Defendants subjected Mr. Taylor \nto unlawful acts, thereby depriving him of his rights to the equal protection of the laws and equal \nprivileges and immunities under the laws in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution.  The DOCCS Defendants also took overt acts to participate in or \ncover up their violations of Mr. Taylor’s rights, as enumerated in the previous paragraphs, \ninterfering with state and federal judicial processes.  \n100.  As a direct and proximate result of the DOCCS Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff \nclaims as damages pecuniary loss, including medical expenses, funeral expenses and lost \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 23 of 26\nearnings, as well as non-economic damages, including conscious pain, mental anguish, and \nphysical injury suffered by Mr. Taylor prior to his death, and the consequential loss of enjoyment \nof life. \n101.

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-102 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n104.  The acts of Defendant Lee constituted conduct under color of state law that \ndeprived Mr. Taylor of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States, including the Eighth Amendment.  \n105.  Upon information and belief, Mr. Taylor suffered from a serious mental illness, \nwhich could be substantially improved through treatment.   \n106.  Defendant Lee was deliberately indifferent to Mr. Taylor’s serious medical needs \nprior to his death by: \na.  Recklessly and negligently failing to properly treat Mr. Taylor’s serious mental \nillness; \nb.  Failing to transfer Mr. Taylor to a facility better equipped to diagnose and treat \nMr. Taylor’s illness; \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 24 of 26\nc.  Failing to seek a secure, rehabilitative environment for Mr. Taylor, a patient with \nserious mental illness under his charge; \nd.  Failing to recognize that Mr. Taylor’s deteriorated mental health condition \nrendered him less able to cope with COs’ abuse or threatening conduct, in \nparticular, the altercation with CO Tucker that precipitated Mr. Taylor’s death on \nApril 13, 2015. \n107.  These actions, and failures to act, created an excessive risk of harm, such as the \nharm caused by the altercation with CO Tucker that precipitated Mr. Taylor’s death on April 13, \n2015.  Dr. Lee’s conduct deprived Mr. Taylor of his rights, and was a substantial factor in the \ncontinuation of such abuse, a proximate cause of Constitutional violations alleged in this \ncomplaint, and ultimately, the cause of Mr. Taylor’s death.  These actions also caused Mr. Taylor \nmental anguish and pain and suffering. \n108.  Defendant Lee committed the acts alleged herein intentionally, willfully, \nwantonly, maliciously, sadistically, or with such reckless disregard of the consequences as to \nreveal a conscious indifference to the clear risk of death or serious injury to Mr. Taylor that \nshocks the conscience.  Defendant Lee is liable for punitive damages. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAgainst Defendant Dr. Seung Ho Lee in his individual capacity under New York Law For \nMedical Malpractice  \n \n109.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in \nparagraphs 1-108 above with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein. \n110.  Defendant Lee owed Mr. Taylor a duty to provide him with adequate care and to \nexercise reasonable care not to act in a manner that created an unreasonable risk of harm to Mr. \nTaylor’s mental health and physical safety.  This duty included, but was not limited to, properly \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 25 of 26\ntreating Mr. Taylor’s mental illness.  Defendant Lee breached his duty of care and was grossly \nnegligent by: \na.   Recklessly and negligently failing to properly treat Mr. Taylor’s serious mental \nillness; \nb.  Failing to transfer Mr. Taylor to a facility better equipped to diagnose and treat \nMr. Taylor’s illness; \nc.  Failing to seek a secure, rehabilitative environment for Mr. Taylor, a patient with \nserious mental illness under his charge; \nd.  Failing to recognize that Mr. Taylor’s deteriorated mental health condition \nrendered him less able to cope with COs’ abuse or threatening conduct, in \nparticular, the altercation with CO Tucker that precipitated Mr. Taylor’s death on \nApril 13, 2015. \n111.  Defendant Lee’s actions, and failures to act, were intentional, malicious, and \nreckless, or negligent, and deviated from accepted medical practice and norms. \n112.  Defendant Lee’s acts and failure to act caused Mr. Taylor to receive grievous \nbodily injury that ultimately resulted in his death and resulted in mental anguish and pain and \nsuffering.  \n113.  Defendant Lee committed the foregoing acts intentionally, willfully, maliciously, \nand/or with such reckless disregard as to demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the clear risk of \ndeath or serious injury that shocks the conscience.  He is therefore also liable for punitive \ndamages. \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 106   Filed 03/22/18   Page 26 of 26\nDEMAND FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands the following relief against Defendants, jointly and \nseverally: \n(a)  Compensatory damages in an amount just and reasonable and in conformity with \nevidence at trial; \n(b)  Punitive damages to the extent allowable by law; \n(c)  Attorneys’ fees; \n(d)  The costs and disbursements of this action; \n(e)  Interest; \n(f)  Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \nDated:  New York, NY \n    March 22, 2018 \nPATTERSON BELKNAP WEBB & TYLER LLP \n \nBy: /s/ Eugene M.

LEE SHOULD \nNOT BE SEVERED FOR SEPARATE TRIAL \nMcMahon, C.J.: \nIn this case, Plaintiff Julia Ramsay-Nobles brings civil rights claims on behalf of herself \nand her deceased brother,  Karl  Taylor,  a mentally ill prisoner who  was housed at Sullivan \nCorrectional Facility (\"Sullivan\").  On the morning of April 13, 2015, Taylor was involved in a \nphysical altercation with at least three Sullivan con·ection officers; he was pronounced dead at the \nprison infinnary shortly thereafter. \nPlaintiff brings this action against three groups of defendants, all of whom are current or \nformer employees of Sullivan.  (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\"), Dkt. No.  115.)  First, she sues \neleven correction officers (the \"Officer Defendants\"), for violations of her brother's Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights (id ~~ 78-82, 84-85 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)); for conspiracy to violate \nhis Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights (id ~~ 86-89 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)); and for conspiracy \n1 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 2 of 73\nto interfere with his civil rights (id. ,, 95-102 (42 U.S.C. § 1985(3))).  Second, Plaintiff brings a \nsupervisory  liability  claim  against  Sullivan's  current  superintendent  and  former  deputy \nsuperintendent (the \"Supervisor Defendants\"), under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, on \ntheories of failure to supervise and failure to train.  (Id.  ,, 78-85 (42 U.S.C. § 1983).)  Third, \nPlaintiff brings claims against a Sullivan psychiatrist, Dr. Seung Ho Lee (\"Dr. Lee\") for deliberate \nindifference to her brother's serious medical needs (id.  ,, 103-108 (42 U.S.C. § 1983)); and for \nmedical malpractice (id. ,, 109-13 (New York law)). \nFollowing  discovery,  these  three  groups  of Defendants  make  separate  motions  for \nsummary judgment. (Dkt. No. 268,273, 295.) For the reasons that follow, the Officer Defendants' \nmotion is denied in its entirety; the other two motions are granted in part and denied in part. \nI.  The Motion of the Officer Defendants Is Denied Because All Parties Agree That \nThere Are Genuine Issues of Material Fact As To All Issues \nOrdinarily on a motion for summary judgment I would begin by discussing the facts-\nthose that are undisputed and those that are disputed-using as my source the moving defendants' \nstatements of undisputed fact, filed pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, and the Plaintiffs corresponding \nLocal Rule 56.1 statement.  However, it is possible to get rid of the Officer Defendants' motion \nwithout discussing much of anything at all.  Here is why. \nLocal Rule 56.l(a) reads, \"Upon any motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 \nof the [FRCP], there shall be annexed to the notice of motion a separate, short and concise \nstatement, in numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends \nthere is no genuine issue to be tried.  Failure to submit such a statement may constitute grounds \nfor denial of the motion.\"  Subsection (d) further provides, \"Each statement by the movant ... \npursuant  to  Rule  56.1(a)  ... must be  followed  by  citation  to  evidence  which  would  be \nadmissible[.]\" \n2 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 3 of 73\nSubsection (c) reads, \"Each numbered paragraph in the statement of material facts set forth \nin the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted for \npurposes of the motion unless specifically controverted by a correspondingly numbered paragraph \nin the statement required to be served by the opposing party.\" \nThe Officer Defendants moved for summary judgment.  (Dkt. Nos. 275, 297.)  Herewith \ntheir Rule 56.1 statement: \nDefendant  Correctional  Officers'  Statement  of  Undisputed \nMaterial Facts upon Motion for Summary Judgment (Local \nRule 56 (1)) \n1)  In 1995, Inmate Karl Taylor began serving consecutive New \nYork  prison  sentence  of 27  to  55  years  (2  Complaint \nparagraph  22).  \"2  Complaint\"  means  plaintiffs  Second \nAmended  Complaint,  which is  docketed  in this  case  as \n\"document 10 6.\" \n2)  Inmate  Taylor  was  incarcerated  at  the  New  Y ark State \nSullivan Correctional Facility from November 25, 2014 until \nAprill3, 2015 (2 Complaint paragraph 2). \n3)  Inmate Taylor had been convicted of repeated aggravated \nsexual crimes. \n4)  While serving his sentence at Sullivan Correctional, Inmate \nTaylor was housed on the \"ENorth\" cell block (2 Complaint \nparagraph 2). \n5)  During the course of his incarceration, Inmate Taylor had \nbeen diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Delusional \nDisorder,  Anti-Social  Disorder,  and  Polysubstance \nDependence (2 Complaint paragraph 25). \n6)  Because Inmate Taylor had been diagnosed with serious \nmental illnesses, he was house in Sullivan's Intermediate \nCare program (\"ICP\"), located in the facility's E-North cell \nblock (2 Complaint paragraphs 29-31 ). \n7)  Taylor refused to participate in group treatment programs or \nleave his cell for medical t treatment (2 Complaint paragraph \n36). \n3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 4 of 73\n8)  On April  13,  2015,  an incident  occurred  during  which, \namongst other things, plaintiffs descendants inmate \"Taylor \ntook the baton (from Correction Officer Tucker), and struck \nCO Tucker on the forearm. \"(2 Complaint paragraph 4) \n9)  Tucker suffered a fracture of his forearm as a result thereof. \nCorrection Officer Steven Witte was struck in the head by \nthe baton from a blow by Taylor and suffered permanent \nbrain damage. \n10 ) \"Taylor was then restrained and taken to the hallway, which \nwas  not  visible  to  inmatesin  [sic]  the  cell  block.\"  (2 \nComplaint paragraph 5). \n11) Taylor died later that day of Aprill3, 2015. \n12) There is no legally actionable proof in this case that the \nCorrection Officer defendants, or anyone else, engage in a \nconspiracy  to  harm,  or  to  deprive  Taylor,  or  his \nadministratrix of any of their respective civil rights either \nbefore or after April 13, 2015. \n(Dkt. No. 298). \nThis is not a Statement of Undisputed Facts that complies with Local Rule 56.1.  It is \nlimited to only a few of the numerous material facts in this case; there are far more than 11  of \nthem.  Statement 12 is a pure conclusion of law, which does not belong in a Rule 56.1 statement \nand so will be ignored.  See Siddiqi v. NY. C.  Health & Hasps.  Corp., 572 F. Supp. 2d 353, 368 \n(S.D.N.Y.  2008)  (\"Of course,  [a]  conclusory statement is not evidence.\").  None of the  II \nstatements of allegedly undisputed fact cites to any supporting evidence; the only citations are to \nthe SAC, which is not evidence, and there is not even a citation to the SAC to support four of the \n\"statements of fact.\" Finally, the Rule 56.1 statement is submitted on behalf of eleven individuals, \neach of whom is entitled to have the evidence against him analyzed separately from the evidence \nagainst any other individual defendant; needless to say, the evidence is not separately discussed as \nto each Officer Defendant. And if ever there were a case when the evidence must be analyzed \nseparately as to each individual defendant, it is this one. \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 5 of 73\nIn short, this \"Rule 56.1 Statement\" is utterly insufficient and of absolutely no help to the \nCourt in framing and analyzing the issues that must be discussed in order to dispose of this motion. \nSubmission of such a defective statement is, as far as this Court is concerned, malpractice per se. \nIt is also grounds for denying the Officer Defendants' motion without more. \nPlaintiffs move for denial of the motion as a sanction for the failure of the moving Officer \nDefendants to comply with Local Rule 56.1. (Dkt. Nos. 289 at 1, 312.) \nWhile it is tempting to take up Plaintiffs suggestion, this would just make more work for \nPlaintiff and the Court, since the denial of summary judgment would have to be without prejudice \nto the making of a properly supported motion.  See, e.g., Jarry v. Nat'/ Collegiate Student Loan \nTr.  2005-3, No.  18-cv-0315, 2019  WL 1517106, at *1  (E.D.N.Y.  Feb.  6,  2019), report and \nrecommendation adopted, 2019 WL 1517096 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2019); Vanbrocklen v.  Gupta, \nNo. 09-cv-897, 2010 WL 1492328, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2010), report and recommendation \nadopted, 2010 WL 1492337 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2010); Searightv. Doherty Enters., Inc., No. 02-\ncv-604, 2005 WL 2413590, at *1  (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2005); Martinez v.  Headley, No. 99-cv-\n1735, 2001  WL 483448, at *1  (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2001).  I am not inclined to go through this \nexercise again. \nFurthermore, there is a far better reason not to do as Plaintiff asks. The Officer Defendants' \nmotion can be denied on the merits. \nFirst, even assuming all eleven facts in the Officer Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement to be \ntrue (and Plaintiff does not dispute most of them), those few facts, taken together, do not entitle \nthe Officer Defendants to summary judgment dismissing the Plaintiff's claims as a matter oflaw. \nThey do not even address Plaintiffs highly fact-based claims. \n5 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 6 of 73\nSecond, in response to the Officer Defendants' utterly inadequate Rule 56.1  Statement, \nPlaintiff did not file a \"Counterstatement of Undisputed Facts.\"1  Instead she filed an \"Objections \nand Responses to Defendants' Rule 56.1 ,\" which was accompanied by a far more comprehensive \ncounterstatement of material facts, styled \"Plaintiffs Statement of Additional Disputed Facts\" \n(Dkt. No. 289-1 (emphasis added).)  In other words, Plaintiff opposed the Officer Defendants' \nmotion by asserting that most (if not all) of the material facts concerning what happened between \nPlaintiffs decedent and the Officer Defendants are disputed.  The Officer Defendants agree.  (See \nDkt. No. 310 at  1 &  n.l  (titled \"Defendant Correction Officer's [sic]  Response to Plaintiffs \nStatement of Disputed Facts;  adopting Plaintiffs characterization of her  additional  facts  as \n\"disputed;\" and \"admit[ting] that the fact[s] characterized by plaintiff as disputed [are,] in fact[,] \ndisputed.\"))  Since nearly every fact in the Plaintiffs statement of additional disputed facts is \nmaterial to the resolution of this case, and since both sides agree that those facts are disputed, the \nOfficer Defendants' motion must be denied on the merits and it its entirety.  Further discussion is \nneither necessary nor appropriate, since summary judgment cannot be awarded where, as here, \nmaterial facts are hotly disputed.  That remedy is only for in cases where the material facts are not \nin dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a ). \nFor that reason, all remaining claims against the Officer Defendants will go to triaJ.2  Their \nmotion for summary judgment is denied. The motion to strike portions of their brieffor exceeding \nthe limit imposed by the Court's rules (Dkt. No. 312) is denied.3 \nContrast this with the fact that Plaintiff did file a counterstatement of undisputed facts in response to the \nmotion for summary judgment filed by Dr. Lee. \n2  Plaintiff's claim for conspiracy to obstruct justice--Third Cause of Action-was dropped (Dkt. No. 289 at \n17 n.l4) and so is out of the case.  It is not a \"remaining claim;\" it will not go to trial. And it will not be discussed \nfurther in this opinion. \nI note that, in the reply brief that I declined to strike, the Officer Defendants expressly abandon their \ndefense of qualified immunity, except with respect to the blood spill cleanup, which Plaintiff does not actually allege \n6 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 7 of 73\nHowever,  it is  impossible  to  deal  with the  other Defendants'  motions  for  summary \njudgment without recounting a great deal of the hotly disputed tale of what occurred between the \nOfficer Defendants and Plaintiffs decedent, Karl Taylor, on August 13, 2015. \nI now proceed to tell that story-relying in large part on the very comprehensive statement \nof disputed facts that was filed by the Plaintiff, as well as some evidence cited in her brief.  See \nDerienzo v.  Trek Bicycle Corp., 376 F. Supp. 2d 537, 543 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); see also US Fid. \n& Guar.  Co.  v.  Madison Fin.  Corp., No. 01-cv-3998, 2002 WL 31731020, at *1 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. \nDec. 4, 2002).  In addition, I have relied on the Supervisor Defendants' Local Rule 56.1 statement \nand Plaintiffs response  and counterstatement thereto,  as  well  as  Dr.  Lee's Local Rule  56.1 \nstatement and Plaintiffs response and counterstatement thereto. \nI will begin by telling the story of what happened between the Officer Defendants and \nTaylor, adding at the end how the Supervisor Defendants became involved.  Because the facts that \nrelate only to the claims against Dr. Lee have absolutely no bearing on the claims against the \nSupervisor Defendants, I will tell Dr. Lee's story after discussing the legal merits of the Supervisor \nDefendants' motion for summary judgment. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Facts \nA.  Sullivan Correctional Facility \nSullivan Correctional  Facility (\"Sullivan)  is  a maximum-security correctional  facility \nmanaged  by  the  New York  State  Department  of Corrections  and  Community  Supervision \n(\"DOCCS\").  (Supervisor  Defs.'  Rule  56.1  Statement,  Dkt.  No.  269  (\"Super.  56.1\")  ~ 22.) \nis a constitutional violation.  (Dkt. No. 305 at 21.)  Qualified immunity for the Officer Defendants, like the \nPlaintiffs abandoned obstruction of justice conspiracy charge, is out of the case. \n7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 8 of 73\nSullivan is comprised of eight housing units, four of which cater to inmates with special needs. \n(Id ~ 7.) \nOne of the units is the Intermediate Care Program (\"ICP\").  (Id ~ 23.)  The ICP is located \nin a separate housing unit within the facility and is specifically designed for inmates diagnosed \nwith a serious mental illness.  (Id ~~ 23, 25.)  At the Sullivan ICP program, inmates are to be seen \nby clinicians on daily rounds and are supposed to receive regular evaluations by psychiatrists and \nsocial workers and to participate in out of cell treatment programs.  (See Decl. of Daniel M. \nEisenberg in Opp. to Mots. for Summ. J., Dkt. No. 281 (\"Eisenberg Decl.\") Ex. 54 (\"ICP Manual\"), \nat -124-31.) \nB.  Karl Taylor \nInmate Karl Taylor was convicted of Rape in the First Degree and Sexual Abuse in the \nFirst Degree and sentenced to serve consecutive sentences of27 to 55 years.  (Def. Lee's Statement \nof Undisputed Material Facts, Dkt. No. 274 (\"Lee 56.1\") ~ 32; Pl. CO 56.1 Resp. ~ 1.)  Taylor \nentered DOCCS custody on March 24, 1995.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 32.) \nDuring his time in DOCCS custody, but prior to arriving at Sullivan, Taylor was rearrested \nand convicted of Aggravated Harassment of a Prison Employee by an Inmate, because he threw \nfeces and urine at a CO.  (Id; Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 71. (\"NYSCOC Prelim Rep.\") at -56100.)  He \nwas sentenced to 2 1/2 to 5 years, to be served consecutive to his rape sentence.  (Id .) \nTaylor was transfen·ed to  Sullivan on November 24, 2014.  (Lee 56.1  ~54.)  He was \nassigned to the ICP and housed in building E-North, Cell #148.  (Id. ~55; Supervisor 56.1 ~ 24.) \nWithin the ICP, Taylor was assigned to the Assisted Daily Living (\"ADL\") program.  (Eisenberg \nDecl. Ex. 3 (\"Bird EBT\"), at 16:15-17:11.) \n8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 9 of 73\nC.  The Supervisor Defendants \nDefendant William Keyser is the Superintendent at Sullivan, a position he has held since \nJune of 2014.  (Super. 56.1 ~ 2.)  As Superintendent, Keyser has supervisory oversight over all \naspects of the facilities,  and his responsibilities range from maintaining the facility budget to \nprograms, security, and administration.  (Id. ~ 3.) \nDefendant Edward Burnett became Deputy Superintendent for Security at Sullivan on \nNovember 15,  2014, where he  remained tmtil July 2018,  when he  transferred to  Downstate \nCorrectional Facility.  (Id  ~ 9.)  As  Deputy  Superintendent for  Security, Burnett had overall \nresponsibility for the supervision of all security staff, as well as the care, custody, and control of \nthe inmate population.  (Id . ~ 10 .) \nD.  The Officer Defendants \nDefendants Bruce Tucker,  Steven Witte,  Shane Topel, Kevin Darling, Daniel Walter, \nMichael Weir, James Steinberg, Felix Santos, and Joseph D' Addezio are all correction officers at \nSullivan.  (See Pl. CO 56.1 at~~ 9, 18-21, 29, 30.) \nDefendants Timothy Bunch and John Frunzi are correction officers at Sullivan who hold \nthe rank of sergeant.  (See id.) \nPrior to the incident that led to Taylor's death, Officer Tucker, who was assigned to the \nICP, had more uses of force on his record over the previous two years than any other correction \nofficer in Sullivan's ICP and Special Needs Unit (\"SNU\") combined.  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 91.) \nPrior to starting work as the Superintendent of Sullivan, Superintendent Keyser had been warned \nto keep an eye out for Officer Tucker.  (Id . Ex. 13 (\"Keyser EBT\"), at 221 :4-24.) \nOn April 7, 2015, Taylor filed a grievance against Officer Tucker.  (Keyser Dec!. ~ 21; id. \nEx. 1.)  The grievance, which was written on a \"know your rights\" pamphlet and was otherwise \ndisjointed and difficult to understand, alleged that some ofTaylor's personal property was missing \n9 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 10 of 73\nand that he feared abuse by Officer Tucker.  (!d.)  The allegations were investigated by non-party \nSergeant Beach, who  interviewed both Taylor and Officer Tucker.  (Super.  56.1  ~~ 93-94.) \nSergeant Beach asked Taylor \"if Officer Tucker had spoken to him in a negative manner,\" and \nTaylor responded that \"he did not and it was the officer's appearance and the way he acts [that] is \nhis fear.\"  (Keyser Dec!. Ex. 2.)  Sergeant Beach also wrote that \"Taylor stated that he was not \nthreatened in any way by Officer Tucker and that he feels that it may happen,\" but Taylor \"did not \ngive any specifics.\"  (!d)  Beach ultimately concluded there was no merit to Taylor's allegations. \n(Id.) \nE.  Events of Aprill3, 2015 \nThe following account of the two incidents that immediately preceded Taylor's death \none in Cell Block E-North, and the other in a hallway between the cell block and the infirmary \nis drawn from the testimony of the Officer Defendants and four inmates who witnessed various \nparts of the decedent's encounters with Sullivan COs:  Raymond Bird, Kurtis Lamar Williams, \nGregory Judge, and Malik Thomas. All four inmates were housed with Taylor in E North and \nwitnessed the initial encounter in the cell block.  (Bird EBT at 29:18-19; Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 4 \n(\"Williams EBT\") at 17:15-16; id. Ex. 6 (\"Judge EBT\") at 55:9-10); id. Ex. 7 (\"Thomas EBT\") \nat 32:21-24).)  Williams, who then left the cell block in order to obtain medication, also testified \nthat he witnessed the second encounter while standing at the cross gates in the hallway.  (Williams \nEBT at 17:8-24:23.) \nAs I have already noted, the facts about both incidents are hotly disputed. \n1.  First Use of Force-E North \nAccording to Bird, Williams, and Judge, for the six months that Taylor was at Sullivan \nprior to his death, various unidentified correction officers and, most particularly, Officer Tucker \nwaged  a campaign of racist name-calling and  harassment  against him.  (Pl.'s  Statement of \n10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 11 of 73\nAdditional Disputed Facts, Dkt. No. 289-1  (\"Pl.  CO  56.1\") ,;,; 1-8.)  On one occasion, they \ndestroyed property in his cell.  (Id ,; 8.)  Taylor often sought to protect himself from harassment \nby asking to be housed in the more restrictive mental health facilities at Sullivan.  (Bird EBT at \n21:16-24:25.) \nDuring the day shift of 7:00 a.m. to 3:00p.m. and the afternoon shift of 3:00p.m. to 11:00 \np.m., three correction officers-a main officer and two escort officers-are assigned to the ICP. \n(Burnett Dec!. ,; 8.) \nOfficer Tucker was one of the regular officers assigned to theE-North housing unit.  (Lee \n56.1,; 63 (citing Dec!. of Helene R. Hechtkopfin Supp. of Mot. for Sunun. J. (\"HechtkopfDecl.\"), \nDkt. No. 276, Ex. 29 (together with Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 101, \"Tucker EBT\") at 31:1-12).)  On \nthe morning of April 13, 2015, Officers Witte and Topel accompanied Officer Tucker on his \nrounds in E-North.  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 25 (\"Unusual Incident Rep.\") at -002.) \nAccording nonparty witness CO Jeffrey Hunt, on the morning of April 13, 2015, Officer \nTucker entered the E-Nmih cell block and instructed Hunt to \"crack Taylor out\"-meaning, open \nMr. Taylor's cell, which was up a flight of stairs from the main area in E-North, called \"the pit.\" \n(Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 5 (\"Hunt EBT\") at 99:25.)  Hunt testified that, after doing so, he \"went over \nto the other side of the control room to top [his] coffee mug off and[] heard a commotion.\"  (Id \nat 100:3-5.) \nAccording to an inmate witness, Officer Tucker approached and banged on Taylor's cell, \nshouting words to the effect of:  \"Come out of the f\"** cell, m***f\"** .\"  (Bird EBT at 76:8-21.) \nTwo inmates then saw Taylor exit his cell and head down the stairs, straight towards the \"A \nofficer's\" desk, in the pit, where, for his own protection, Taylor asked the \"A officer\" to \"call the \ncaptain, call the sergeant, call somebody\" and stated, \"I want to go to the Mental Health Unit\" and, \n11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 12 of 73\n\"I want to go to the observation cell.\" (Bird EBT at 77:9-78:5; Thomas EBT at 42:24-43:6.) The \nofficer at the A post apparently did not respond.  (Thomas EBT at 52:16-19.) \nOfficer Tucker then said that Taylor wasn't going anywhere if he did not clean his cell. \n(Thomas EBT at 43:6-9, 43:20-44:8, 52:20-53:4); accord Unusual Incident Rep. at -001.) \nOfficer Hunt testified that he went back over to the controls after hearing the commotion, \nand Officer Tucker instructed him to \"lock [Taylor] in\" his cell.  (Hunt EBT at 10 0:5-6.)  Officer \nHunt waited for Taylor to go back into his cell, but \"It didn't happen.\"  (Id. at 100:7.) \nThe parties disagree about who initiated the altercation. \nAt least one inmate saw Taylor walk toward the stairs to his cell, and then saw Officer \nTucker hit Taylor with his baton without any provocation.  (Thomas EBT at 44:4-14.) According \nto the two inmate eyewitnesses, Taylor tried to flee and was struck again. (Bird EBT at 83:22-\n84:18, 89:21-25; Thomas EBTat44:13-17.) According to Officer Hunt, however, Officer Tucker \ntook his baton out, and \"Taylor came rushing at him.  Bruce [Tucker] took it.  He swung it.  I don't \nknow if he clipped Taylor or not because I was up in the control room.\"  (Hunt EBT at 100:9-11.) \nHtmt agreed that \"Tucker took the first swing with the baton\" but did not \"remember if he actually \nclipped Taylor or not.\"  (Id .  at 106:4-9.) \nIt is undisputed that Taylor wrestled the baton from Officer Tucker (see id.), and that he \nswung it and struck Officer Tucker.  (Bird EBT at 83:20-84:18, 89:21-25).)  Hunt did not see \nTaylor grab Officer Tucker's baton, but that once Taylor did, and then \"the melee started.\"  (Hunt \nEBT at 100:11-14.) \nSomeone called in a Code 1.  Officer Hunt testified that he told another CO who was up in \nthe control room with him to call a Code 1.  (Hunt EBT at 100:15-17; accord Thomas EBT at \n57:5-6 (\"the guy who opens up the gate called in for backup\").) Inmate Bird testified that, Officer \n12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 13 of 73\nTucker \"pulled the pin\" on his radio and called a Code 1, signaling that an officer was in distress, \nbut that he did so later, after Taylor had been subdued.  (Bird EBT at 96:3-16.) \nOfficer Tucker headed toward the stairs leading back up to Taylor's cell.  (Eisenberg Dec!. \nEx. 9 (\"Topel EBT\") at 103 :4-11.)  Officer Tucker fell going up the stairs, and Taylor stmck him \nwith the baton. (Thomas EBT at 56:2-11.) Officer Topel pursued Taylor up the stairs, and Officer \nTucker eventually got to his feet again.  (Topel EBT at 108: 1-4.) \nAt the top of the stairs, Officer Topel dodged several more swings from Taylor.  Officer \nTopel then grabbed the baton, causing Taylor to lose his balance.  Officer Witte ran up the stairs, \nand Officers Topel and Witte tackled Taylor, who landed face-down.  (Topel EBT at 116:11-14, \n117:21-24, 118:11-14.) \nOfficer Topel struggled with Taylor, who was still holding on to the baton, even as he was \nlying face-down.  Officer Topel admits that he struck Taylor in the back of the head several times \nwith his fists. (Topel EBT at 120:2-121: 13.) Officer Topel saw blood underneath Taylor, although \nhe did not know where the blood came from.  (!d.) \nOfficer Defendants Santos,  Steinberg,  Walter,  Darling, Weir, D' Addezio, Frunzi, and \nBunch responded to the call.  (Pl. CO 56.1 ~ 19 (citing Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 10 (\"Darling EBT\") at \n12:25-16:14; id.  Exs.  34, 40-42 (written incident reports of Frunzi, D'Addezio, Bunch, and \nSantos).)  According to an eyewitness, although Taylor had already been pinned down by Officers \nTopel and Witte by the time backup anived, these officers began assaulting Taylor.  (Bird EBT at \n96:22-97:7.)  The same eyewitness testifies that, during the assault, Taylor cried repeatedly that \nhe couldn't breathe, then fell silent.  (Bird EBT at 97:3-5.) \nStatements prepared by the Officers Defendants themselves suggest that few-if any-of \nthe eight officers who arrived in response to the distress call actually touched Taylor, let alone \n13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 14 of 73\nwere involved in an assault against him after he was restrained.  (See Eisenberg Dec!. Exs. 34, 40-\n42 (written incident reports of Frunzi, D' Addezio, Bunch, and Santos).)  However, the Officer \nDefendants do not list this among their 11 \"statements of undisputed fact,\" and Plaintiff submitted \neyewitness testimony to the effect that \"you got over 20 something officers ran up in E North and \nthey're all beating on [Taylor].\"  (Bird EBT at 96:23-24 (emphasis added).)  Another inmate \ntestified that the six to seven officers who responded to the code \"were getting their licks in and \nhitting Taylor\" as inmates in surrounding cells screamed atthem to stop. (Thomas EBT at 131:13-\n16.) \nOne witness estimates that three minutes passed from the time Taylor was restrained until \nthe officers picked him up from the floor and began escorting him to the infirmary.  (Thomas EBT \nat 66:22-67:7.) \n2.  Second Use of Force-Hallway to Infirmary \nBefore Taylor left E-North, Officers Tucker and Witte headed to the infirmary.  (Topel \nEBT at 138: 17-139:23.)  Officer Topel stayed behind until he was relieved.  (!d) \nSome of the Officer Defendants then lifted Taylor to his feet and walked him off the cell \nblock towards the Sullivan infirmary.  (Pl. CO 56.1 ~ 23.)  When he left E North, \"Taylor had no \nsignificant visual injuries,\" except that his face looked \"roughed up.\"  (Id ~ 24; Thomas EBT at \n64:13-66:16.)  This is consistent with the Officer Defendants' written statements, which say that \nTaylor left E North walking under his own power.  (Eisenberg Dec!. 11 (\"Weir EBT\") at 50:6-9; \nEisenberg Dec!. Ex 16 (\"Witte EBT\") at 117: 17-25; see also Unusual Incident Rep. at -020-23 \n(compiling written statements from other COs and civilian witnesses).) \nThen, according to inmate Williams (who was being transported through the hallway at the \ntime), the Officer Defendants who were escorting Taylor to the clinic began to beat him, until he \nfell to the floor.  (Pl. CO 56.1 ~~ 25-35; Williams EBT at 24:10-13,25:8-20, 23:6-11.) Williams \n14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 15 of 73\ncould  identifY  only  one  Officer  Defendant  involved  in  this  attack-Sergeant  Frunzi-but \nPlaintiffs Statement of Additional Disputed Fact cites to the statements of the eleven Officer \nDefendants in asserting that all of them either testified, said in their written statements, or were \nobserved by someone else to have either (1) personally escorted Taylor to the clinic, (2) passed the \nescort on their way to the clinic, or (3) saw the escort proceed down the hallway.  (Pl. CO 56.1 \n~~ 29-31.) \nThe Officer Defendants deny that any such assault took place.  Several of them testified \nthat Taylor's State-issued green pants fell down during the walk to the clinic, so the escorting \nofficers pulled them up.  (Darling EBTat 27:13-29:6, 47:7; Weir EBTat 50:10-51:11; Eisenberg \nDecl. Ex. 15 (\"Bunch EBT\") at  49:25.)  They also testifY that Taylor asked for a \"cart\" because \nhe didn't want to walk (Darling EBT at23:11-16, 25:10-13; BunchEBT at 66:6; see also Unusual \nIncident Rep. at -036), then slumped to his knees.  (Darling EBT at 30:3-14; Bunch EBT at 66:5-\n6; see also Unusual Incident Rep. 25 at -002, -019, -036.)  Sergeant Bunch eventually made the \ncall to carry Taylor into the clinic face-down.  (Bunch EBT at 67:9-14; see also Unusual Incident \nRep. at -003). \nThe parties estimate that it takes between 5 and 10 minutes to walk from E-North to the \ninfirmary.  (Judge EBT at 89:8-13 (stating it is \"quite a ways\" and that it takes 10 minutes if you're \nwalking at \"regular pace\").) \nAccording  to  the  infirmary  nurse  who  triaged  him,  Taylor  arrived  in  the  clinic  at \napproximately 8:35 a.m.  (Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 12 (\"Greener EBT\") at 63:8-18; id at 117:18-20; \nbut see Darling EBT at 12:22-24 (stating he arrived on the scene in E-North at approximately 8:35 \na.m.); Unusual Incident Rep. at -021 and -023 (statements ofK. Danzilo and T. Wright stating that \nthey observed the escorts at 8:40 and 8:45a.m., respectively).) \n15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 16 of 73\nAt approximately 8:45a.m., nonparty-inmates Steven Lovett and Stacy Liggan, who were \ntrained in and assigned to \"blood spill\" work, were asked to clean up blood in the hallway leading \nfrom E-North to the infirmary.  (See Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 22 (\"Lovett Aff.\") (describing how the \ninmate saw \"mostly puddles\" and that it took \"at best 1 to 1 Y, hours to remove all the blood\"); id \nEx. 23 (\"Liggan Aff.\") (drawing 0.5 em to 1 em circles to illustrate \"the size of blood drops in the \nhallway fi·om the clinic area toE-Block\" and that it took \"at least an half an hour to clean\").) \nTaylor was still in mechanical restraints when he arrived at the infirmary, breathing heavily \nand complaining of discomfort.  Sergeant Bunch either saw or was told by Taylor that Taylor's \nsweatshirt was bunched around his neck  Because Taylor was still in restraints, Sergeant Bunch \ntook a pair of safety scissors he had requested from the nurse and cut the sweatshirt.  Taylor \nallegedly thanked him.  (Bunch  EBT at  74:15-75:6;  Unusual  Incident Rep.  at  -003  (report \nsummary).) \n3.  Events at the Infirmary \nIt is only at this point that the Supervisor Defendants enter the picture; it is undisputed that \nneither Superintendent Keyser nor Deputy Superintendent Burnett was present either in E-North \nor on the way to the infirmary. \nDeputy Superintendent Burnett received a phone call advising him that a serious assault on \nstaff had occurred.  (Burnett Decl. at .,; 22.)  He and Superintendent Keyser proceeded to the \ninfirmary.  (ld) \nAccording to the Supervisor Defendants, when they entered the infirmary, Taylor was in \nExam Room 2, in a chair, accompanied by two officers and a sergeant-most likely Sergeant \nBunch.  (Jd; Keyser Dec!..,; 25; see also Weir EBT at 83:17-20; Unusual Incident Rep. at -019 \n(memorandum from nonparty CO E. Kratz to Superintendent Keyser submitted as part of unusual \n16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 17 of 73\nincident report); id at -007 (noting that Sergeant Bunch was involved in use of the automatic \nextemal defibrillator on Taylor).) \nThe Supervisor Defendants testified that they then went into a nearby exam room, where \nOfficers Tucker, Witte, and Topel-all of whom had been injured in the first altercation-were \ntaken.  (Keyser Dec!.~ 26; Bumett Dec!.~ 23.) The Supervisor Defendants spoke to these officers, \nand then left the infirmary so that Superintendent Keyser could call DOCCS Central Office from \nthe nurse's station and advise them of the incident.  (Keyser Dec!.~ 28; Bumett Dec!.~ 24.) \nAccording to the triage nurse, during this time, Taylor was waiting in Exam Room 2. \n(Greener EBT at 63 :8-18.) Greener testified that she did not enter the exam room initially, because \nit needed to  get cleared by prison security.  (Id.  at 97:16-22.)  Greener estimates this took \n\"minutes.\"  (Greener  EBT  at  63:8-18;  id  at  117:18-20.)  But when  Greener  began  her \nexamination, Taylor was not showing signs of life.  (Jd; but see Unusual Incident Rep. at -03 7 \n(stating that another nurse, Nurse Floyd K. Darbee, II, \"found imnate to be unconscious with \nshallow breathing chest moving air\" but \"unable to obtain femural [sic] pulse due to positioning\").) \nAccording to the Supervisor Defendants, as they were walking down the hallway, non \nparty  Nurse  Practitioner  FNU  Diaz  yelled  that  she  needed  assistance  because  Taylor  was \nunresponsive.  (Bumett Dec!. ~ 24.)  The Supervisor Defendants apparently proceeded to the \nnurse's station and called the Central Office.  (/d) At some point, Nurse Practitioner Diaz advised \nSuperintendent Keyser that Taylor was in distress and that they were moving him to another room. \n(Keyser Dec!. ~ 28.) At some point, the infirmary staff called a Code Blue.  (See, e.g., Liggan Aff. \nat -001.) \nWhile at the clinic, Taylor was pronounced dead by Dr. Wladyslaw Sidorowicz.  (Lee 56.1 \n~ 135.) \n17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 18 of 73\nThe Supervisor Defendants were notified near the infirmary that Taylor had died, and were \nnotified again upon returning to their offices.  (Keyser Decl. ~ 28; Burnett Decl. ~ 24.) \nOn April13, 2015, an autopsy was conducted by Sullivan County Medical Examiner Dr. \nMargaret Prial.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 137.)  Taylor's cause of death was identified as \"cardiac arrhythmia \ncomplicating hypertensive cardiovascular disease following physical altercation with correction \nofficers.\"  (Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 29 (\"Autopsy Rep.\") at -054.) \nThe report also showed that Taylor had also suffered severe trauma to his neck, eight blunt \nforce impacts to his head, and various internal and external hemorrhages to his body, both back \nand front.  (Pl. CO 56.1 ~~ 38-40.) \nII.  Procedural History \nThe Court recounted the procedural history of this case extensively in its written opinion \ngranting  Plaintiff's motion  to  strike  Officers  Tucker's,  Witte's,  and  Topel's  counterclaims. \nRamsay-Nobles v.  Keyser, No. 16-cv-5778, 2018 WL 6985228, at *I (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2018). \nHerewith a briefer summary. \nOn  July  20,  2016,  Plaintiff Julia  Ramsay-Nobles,  Taylor's  sister,  filed  her  initial \nComplaint,  which  named  only  certain  Defendants-Superintendent  Keyser,  Deputy \nSuperintendent Burnett,  and  Officers Tucker, Topel,  and  Witte.  (Dkt.  No.  1.)  The  named \nDefendants answered the Complaint (Dkt. No. 30), and the parties proceeded to discovery (Dkt. \nNos. 27, 31-32). \nOn April25, 2017, Plaintiff amended her Complaint with Defendants' consent.  (Dkt. No. \n53.)  In this First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), Plaintiff added two additional Defendants-Dr. \nLee and Sergeant Frunzi.  (!d.)  All named Defendants again answered, with Dr. Lee answering \nseparately.

(Dkt. No. 115.) In the SAC, Plaintiff added additional Defendants-Sergeant Bunch \nand Officers Walter, D' Addezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir.  (Jd.) \nUntil this point, all Defendants except Dr. Lee had been represented by the New York State \nAttorney General's Office (\"NY AG\").  However, after alerting the Court to a potential conflict \nand securing its consent, the NY AG withdrew its representation of everyone but the Supervisor \nDefendants.  See Ramsay-Nobles, 2018 WL 6985228, at *2.  The correction officers collectively \nretained new counsel, the Orseck Law Finn.  Id \nOn July 5, 2018, the Officer Defendants' new counsel filed an answer to the SAC.  In that \nanswer, Officers Tucker, Witte, and Topel-who had been named in the original Complaint filed \ntwo years earlier-asserted counterclaims against Plaintiff for assault and battery, for injuries \nsuffered during the first altercation in E-North.  (Dkt. No. 171.)  On Plaintiffs motion, the Comi \nstruck these counterclaims and denied the officers' cross-motion for leave to amend.  Ramsay-\nNobles, 2018 WL 6985228, at* 11.4 \nAfter the  close  of discovery  (during  which counsel  for  the  Officer Defendants  was \nrepeatedly sanctioned for discovery violations (see Dkt. Nos. 230, 237, 278)) all three groups of \nDefendants moved separately for summary judgment.  (Dkt. Nos. 268,273, 295.) The Supervisor \nDefendants also move strike the testimony of Plaintiffs expert, Joseph Ponte.  (Dkt. No. 303.) \nIII.  Summary Judgment Standard \nA moving party is entitled to  summary judgment when it establishes that there is \"no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \n4  In their answer to the SAC, Officers Tucker, Witte, and Topel also asserted a cross-claim against Dr. Lee \nfor medical malpractice, which was later dismissed on consent.

Overview of Claims Against the Supervisor Defendants \nDefendants Superintendent Keyser and Deputy Superintendent Burnett have moved for \nsummary judgment on the only remaining count of the SAC asserted against them-supervisory \nliability under Section 1983 (First Cause of Action), which is based on three theories:  (1) failure \nto train; (2) failure to protect Taylor from the risk of excessive force and racially discriminatory \ntreatment by Officer Tucker; and (3) failure to protect Taylor from the risk of excessive force and \nracial discrimination by the other Officer Defendants. (Dkt. No. 268; see also Defs.' Mem. of Law \nin Further Supp. of their Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. No. 270 (\"Super Br.\") at 5-15.)5 \nWhile Plaintiff originally brought three other Causes of Action against the Supervisor \nDefendants in her Second Amended Complaint, she advises the Court that she has now dropped \nthem:  \"Plaintiff has consented to voluntary dismissal with prejudice of the Second, Third, and \n5  Ideally, each constitutional violation (Eighth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment) and each theory (failure \nto train, failure to protect) would have been asserted as a separate cause of action in the complaint. We have \nseparated them for individualized discussion. \n20 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 21 of 73\nFourth Causes of Action against the Supervisor Defendants ... because there is insufficient \nevidence  in  the  discovery  record  that  the  Supervisor  Defendants[]  conspired  with  the  CO \nDefendants.\" (Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. for Summ. J. by Supervisor Defs., Dkt. No. 288 (\"Super. Opp.\") \nat 2.)  The conspiracy claims are, therefore, dismissed with prejudice. \nThe Supervisor Defendants move for summary judgment on the remaining counts, both on \nthe merits and on the ground of qualified immunity.  (Supervisor Defs.' Mem. of Law in Further \nSupp. of Their Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Super. Br.\") at 5-15.) \nIn support of her opposition brief, Plaintiff offers the expert affidavit of Joseph Ponte, the \nformer New York City Department of Correction Commissioner with over 49 years of experience \nin corrections.  (Dkt. No. 284.)  The Supervisor Defendants move to strike his testimony under \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).  (Dkt. No. 303.) \nII.  The Supervisor Defendants' Motion to Strike the Testimony of Plaintiff's Expert \nJoseph Ponte Is Denied \nThe Court first considers the admissibility of Mr. Ponte's testimony, and then considers \nthe Supervisor Defendants' summary judgment motion.  \"If the expert testimony is excluded as \ninadmissible, the court must make the summary judgment determination without that evidence.\" \nIn re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 331  F.

The Daubert Standard \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 codifies the standard for admissibility set forth in Daubert \nv.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), under which the Court's role is to \ndetermine whether the expert is qualified to testify and whether the testimony is reliable.

Supp. 3d at 168. \n21 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 22 of 73\n\"[A] n expert with specialized knowledge [who] will help the trier of fact may testifY so \nlong as that testimony is based on sufficient facts or data and is the product of reliable principles \nand methods that the witness has reliably applied ... to the facts of the case.\"  In re Vivendi, S.A. \nSec.

(internal quotations and \nalterations omitted). \nAs this Court noted, \"The standard to evaluate non-scientific expert testimony is whether \nthe expert bases testimony upon professional studies or personal experience and employs in the \ncourtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the \nrelevant field.\"  Namenda, 331 F.

The Supervisor Defendants' Motion to Strike Is Denied \nI.  Mr. Ponte's Unassailable Credentials \nPlaintiffs expert Joseph Ponte has over 49 years of experience in the field of corrections, \nand has served \"every uniform position from Correction Officer to Captain.\"  (Ponte Dec!., Dkt. \nNo. 284 ~ 1.)  Mr. Ponte was first promoted to warden in 1980, and has \"served at this level of \nauthority or higher for more than 37 years, including as Commissioner for the New York City \nDepartment of Corrections and as the Commissioner of Corrections for the State of Maine.\" (Ponte \nDec!. Ex. 1 (\"Ponte Rep.\") at 1.)  The Supervisor Defendants do not-and could not---challenge \nMr. Ponte's qualifications to testifY regarding sound correctional policies. \n22 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 23 of 73\n2.  Mr. Ponte's Methodology \nMr.  Ponte was  asked to  provide expert testimony \"regarding the proper policies and \nprocedures to be followed in correctional facilities\" with respect to certain issues, including: (D the \nuse of force by correction officers against inmates, and supervisors' investigation of and responses \nthereto; (jj_) the use of de-escalation and crisis intervention techniques by correct officers; (iii) the \nescort of inmates by correction officers; (iv) supervisors' investigation of, and response to, inmate \ngrievances alleging improper conduct by con·ection officers; and ~)the preservation of evidence \nand securing of a crime scene following an incident of violence at a correctional facility.  (Ponte \nRep. at 1-2.) \nIn the second half ofhis report, Mr. Ponte applies these standards to the events that occurred \nat Sullivan, leading up to, during, and after Taylor's death, and opines on whether the staffs \nresponse was reasonable.  (Id. at 2.) \nMr. Ponte's affidavit states that he relies on his \"education, 49 years of experience in \ncorrections, and the factual information provided to [him] by [Plaintiffs counsel]\" in forming his \nopinions.  (Id.  at 3.)  In forming his opinions about the behavior of the Officer Defendants, Mr. \nPone reviewed, not only materials prepared during the investigation of the Taylor incident and \ntestimony given during this litigation, but also the ICP Manual; the DOCCS Employee Manual \nsection on the Disciplinary Control of Inmates;  the DOCCS Use of Force Directive;  various \nDOCCS training documents on the use of batons, the prevention of aggressive behavior, and \naggressive behavior and de-escalation skills; as well as the Office of Mental Health Con·ections \nBased Incident Policy 2.8-and even a report prepared by Human Rights Watch concerning U.S. \nprisons and offenders with mental illness.  (Ponte Rep. Ex. B.) These strike the court as exactly \nthe sort of documents one would expect an expert in correctional practice and procedure to review \nin reaching an opinion. \n23 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 24 of 73\n3.  The Motion to Strike Ponte's Report Is Denied \nBest correctional practices is a subject to which expert testimony is appropriately given.  It \nis a subject with which the average juror is unfamiliar.  Courts-including this Court-accept \ntestimony about best correctional practices, like testimony about best police practices, routinely. \nMr. Ponte's report could have been more elegantly drafted.  It is obvious that he is familiar \nwith best practices, for both supervisors and correction officers, as utilized at DOCCS.  Moreover, \nbetween his extensive experience and his familiarity with the materials he cites in Exhibit B, he is \nprobably better equipped to testify about those practices-and about whether particular actions by \nthe defendants comported with those practices-than anyone on the planet. \nOne  might prefer that various  assertions Mr.  Ponte makes about best practices were \naccompanied by citations to sources that document those practices-to the DOCCS manuals and \ntraining materials, for example.  For the most part they are not.  The failure to do that is not \nnecessarily fatal to his testimony.  As I have said, \"There is nothing wrong with [relying on \nexperience J:  the very text of Fed. R. Evid. 702 provides that an expert can be qualified on the \nbasis of his 'knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[.]\"'  Veleron Holding,  B. V  v. \nMorgan Stanley, 117 F. Supp. 3d 404, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (emphasis in original) (quoting Fed. \nR. Evid. 702); see also Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 156 (1999) (\"[N]o one denies \nthat an expert might draw a conclusion from  a  set  of observations based  on extensive and \nspecialized experience.\"). \nHowever, \"a proffered expert who relied solely on his or her experience in arriving at his \nor her expert opinion must have based that opinion on sufficient facts or data, and must explain \nhow that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for \nthe opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts[.]\"  Veleron, 117 F. Supp. 3d \nat 444 (internal quotations omitted). In the ordinary course, an expert--even one whose experience \n24 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 25 of 73\nis as extensive as Mr. Ponte's-should explain which supporting materials (i.e., which of the \nmaterials in Exhibit B, or what aspects of his experience) are cited as authority for the proposition \nasserted.  Mr. Ponte's report really does not do that.  He states that he consulted certain materials; \nthose materials do include what seem to this Court to be the universe of best practices materials \nand training documents used by DOCCS.  Mr. Ponte certainly has the experience to be familiar \nwith those materials-indeed, for all I know, many of them were developed lmder his watch or at \nhis direction.  The footnotes in the report, however, rarely mention any of those source materials. \nInstead,  his  assertions  are  often  \"supported\"  by  citations  to  the  testimony  of the  Officer \nDefendants. This appears intended to advise the Court that at least some of the Officer Defendants \nacknowledge that the practices Mr. Ponte discusses are best practices-as well as to demonstrate \nthat these particular officers were trained by DOCCS in mental health inmate care and were aware \nof DOCCS policies and procedures.  As a litigation technique, that will undoubtedly prove useful \nat trial; Plaintiff will want the jurors to know that the Defendants were familiar with best practices. \nBut Mr. Ponte's expert report is not the best place to make that point. \nThat said,  I  simply cannot ignore  Mr.  Ponte's extensive experience in corrections \nexperience familiar to every judge who has sat on this court for any length of time--or his assertion \nthat his opinions about best correctional practices (as set out in the first half of his report) are \ngrounded, not only in information about this particular incident, but also in the various manuals \nand training devices cited in Exhibit B.  While I can think of more effective ways to craft a report, \nhis testimony is plainly relevant and material and he is qualified to give it.  And the fact that various \nOfficer Defendants testified that statements now adopted by Mr. Ponte are in fact procedures they \nare supposed to follow makes his testimony about such matters-matters about which he has \nextraordinary professional knowledge-all the more powerful. \n25 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 26 of 73\nI will  not,  therefore,  accept the  Supervisor Defendants'  suggestion that  Mr.  Ponte's \ntestimony be stricken, or at least ignored in connection with this summary judgment motion. \nDaubert is designed to eliminate \"junk science\" from the courtroom-not to get rid of testimony \nfrom obviously qualified individuals that might have been better crafted.  Mr. Ponte's opinions are \nnot \"junk science.\"  Contrary to the Defendants' argument, Mr. Ponte did not take the facts of this \ncase and \"reverse engineer\" a mbric for the purpose of assessing whether the defendants acted \nproperly or not in Taylors' case-which, iftme, would make his conclusions inadmissible.  In re \nMirena IUD  Levonorgestrel-Related Prods.  Liab.  Litig.  (No.  II),  341  F.  Supp.  3d 213,  241 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018).  This is simply not such a case.  In the first half of his report, Mr. Ponte sets the \nstage by testifying extensively about best practices for officers and supervisors and by asserting \nthat DOCCS officers are trained in those practices.  In the second half of his report, he assesses \nthe conduct of the DOCCS personnel in this case against those best practices.  That is exactly what \nany expert in con-ectional practice and procedure would do in his expert testimony. \nTherefore, the motion to strike Mr. Ponte's testimony is denied. \nAt trial, Mr. Ponte can be cross-examined, with the benefit of the various manuals and \ntraining materials listed in Exhibit B, about the various \"best practices\" assertions he makes in his \nreport.  For now, they will be considered as I determine whether Plaintiff has raised genuine issues \nof material fact. \nIII.  The Supervisor Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Is Granted in Part and \nDenied in Part \nA.  The Court Will Consider All Arguments Fairly Raised By the Supervisor \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \nPlaintiffs opposition to this motion includes the following footnote: \nThe  Supervisor  Defendants'  motion  for  summary judgment  on \nPlaintiff's First Cause of Action (violation of 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 \n26 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 27 of 73\n(\"Section  1983\"))  is  directed  exclusively  to  the  Supervisor \nDefendants' failure to protect Mr. Taylor against the risk of assault \nby Officer Tucker, and therefore Plaintiffs response to the motion \nis limited to that issue and does not address other ways that the \nSupervisor  Defendants  violated  their  duty  to  protect  against \nconstitutional violations by the correction officer Defendants lmder \ntheir supervision. \n(Super Opp. at 2 n.l (emphasis added).)  But Plaintiff is not correct when she asserts that the \nSupervisor Defendants' motion only addresses her failure to protect from assault by Officer Tucker \ntheory of recovery.  The Supervisor Defendants' motion quite clearly addresses two additional \ntheories of supervisory liability:  (i) failure to train, which is discussed at pages 12-13 of her brief \n(and is listed in the table of contents); and (jj) deliberate indifference to the risks posed by ten of \nthe eleven individually named Officer Defendants.  (See Super. Br. at 8 (\"With respect to Officers \nWitte, Topel[,] Walter, Daddezio, Darling, Steinberg, Santos, and Weir and Sergeants Frunzi and \nBunch, plaintiff cannot raise a triable issue of fact regarding whether Superintendent Keyser or \nDeputy Superintendent Burnett were aware that any of these Officers posed a risk to Mr. Taylor, \nas there is no evidence regarding their knowledge.\").) \nPlaintiffs failure to respond to these clearly-raised arguments means that the motion will \nbe considered without benefit of her response.  I will not accept any reservation of rights in this \nregard.  If there is no evidence to support these theories of recovery (and we have found none), the \nmotion can and should be granted, and Plaintiff will be precluded from relying on those theories \nat trial. \nB.  Plaintiff Raises a Genuine Issue of Fact that the Supervisor Defendants \nFailed to Protect Taylor from the Risk of Excessive Force by Officer Tucker \nThe Supervisor Defendants move for sunnnary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff has \nfailed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that they failed to protect Taylor from Officer Tucker. \nFor the following reasons, this argument fails. \n27 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 28 of 73\n1.  Legal Standard \nAn inmate asserting a § 1983 claim that a prison official failed to protect him from harm \nin violation of the Eighth Amendment must satisfY both prongs of the test adopted in Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511  U.S. 825 (1994).  Under the objective prong, the imnate must show that he was \n\"incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\"  Farmer, 511 U.S. at \n834.  Subjectively, the prison official must have acted with a \"sufficiently culpable state of mind.\" \nId  This \"culpable state of mind\" exists when a prison official has \"knowledge that an imnate faces \na substantial risk of serious harm and he disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures \nto abate the harm.\"  Hayes v. NYC Dep't ofCorr., 84 F.3d 614,620 (2d Cir. 1996). \nA \"plaintiff may [] state a claim for deliberate indifference based on a failure to protect \nhim against a general risk ofharm to all inmates at the facility.\" Parris v. NY State Dep 't ofCorr. \nServs., 947 F. Supp. 2d 354, 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  To survive summary judgment under this \ntheory, \"a plaintiff must\" raise a genuine issue of material fact that \"the defendant knew of a history \nof attacks similar to that suffered by the plaintiff, and that the measures they should have taken to \nprevent the reoccurrence of such attacks would have prevented the harm to the plaintiff.\" Stephens \nv.  Venettozzi, No.  13-cv-5779, 2016 WL 929268, at *21  (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2016), report and \nrecommendation  adopted,  2016  WL  4272376  (S.D.N.Y.  Aug.  5,  2016)  (collecting  cases). \n\"Generally, a claim based on a generalized risk of assault requires facts showing a longstanding, \npervasive, well-documented history of similar attacks, coupled with circumstances suggesting that \nthe defendant-official being sued had been exposed to this information.\"  Id (internal quotation \nand alterations omitted). \n28 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 29 of 73\n2.  Plaintiff Meets Her Burden on Both Prongs \na)  Objective Prong \nThe  Supervisor Defendants argue that Taylor \"was not incarcerated under  conditions \nposing a substantial risk to his safety,\" and that his custody created no \"risk to his safety, regardless \nof which Officers were working on the unit.\"  (Super. Br. at 7-8.) \nPlaintiff raises a triable issue of fact that, viewed objectively, Taylor's incarceration in a \nunit overseen by an officer with a long record of using force, and long list of grievances describing \nunprovoked attacks, posed a substantial risk of serious harm.  Specifically, Officer Tucker's \nextensive use of force and grievance record, containing admissions that he repeatedly used force \nto subdue inmates or allegations that he used unprovoked force against them, respectively, would \npermit a reasonable juror to conclude that Officer Tucker's assignment to the ICP objectively \nposed a serious threat to Taylor. \nIn Officer Tucker's time working at the ICP and SNU, both of which housed mentally ill \nprisoners, Officer Tucker had twelves uses of force-constituting more than half of the 23 uses of \nforce for all COs in that unit.  The next officer had only \"three or four,\" making Officer Tucker \nthe clubhouse leader three times over.  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 91.)  This high incidence caused \nAlbany concern; they raised the issue with Supervisor Keyser before he began working at Sullivan, \nand they raised the issue again with both Supervisor Defendants shortly before the incident \noccurred. \nIn the time Superintendent Keyser worked at Sullivan, inmates also filed six grievances \nagainst  Officer  Tucker  alleging  unprovoked  assaults  and  excessive  force.  These  included: \n(1) aggressively pat frisking and sexually abusing an inmate (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 87); (2) tripping \na handcuffed inmate during an escort and then punching the inmate in the head and face (id. Ex. 85; \n(3) physically assaulting an inmate on two  separate occasions on the same day (id.  Ex.  83); \n29 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 30 of 73\n( 4) threatening an inmate with assault if he \"came offt he wall\" during a pat frisk, and then sexually \nassaulting the inmate (id. Ex. 82); (5) sexually assaulting an inmate during a pat frisk (id. Ex. 90); \nand (6) slamming a handcuffed inmate onto the ground and beating and kicking him (id. Ex. 89). \nDeputy Superintendent Burnett was at Sullivan for the first four of the incidents listed. \nThe Supervisor Defendants protest that each of the uses of force and grievances was duly \ninvestigated.  All uses of force except the most recent, on March 27, 2015, were found to be \njustified.  Moreover, all grievances, except the most recent, on April 6, 2015, were found to be \nunsubstantiated.  Both the unjustified use of force and the substantiated grievance were escalated \nto DOCCS' Office of State Investigations (\"OSI\"). \nIn Curry v. Scott, 249 F.3d 493 (6th Cir. 2001), a case with similar facts from a different \nCircuit, the  Sixth Circuit  disagreed  with the district court's finding  that,  because the  CO's \n\"employment record  show[ e]  no  incidents  of unprovoked assault  on inmates,  there  was  no \nevidence that the supervisors could have known that [the CO] would use excessive force on prison \ninmates.\"  Id.  at 507 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).  Instead, the Sixth \nCircuit held that because the CO's \"employment record contain[ed]  a great deal of evidence \nconcerning ... his propensity to use force against inmates and cause injury to them,\" there was a \ngenuine issue of fact whether the officer posed a substantial risk of serious harm.  !d. at 508. \nb)  Subjective Prong \nThe record also contains significant evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact \nabout whether the Supervisor Defendants \"knew of a history of attacks similar to that suffered by \nthe plaintiff.\" Stephens, 2016 WL 929268, at *21. \nThere is no dispute that, before Defendant Keyser began working as Superintendent of \nSullivan, the Assistant Commissioner for Facility Operations of DOCCS, who had previously \n30 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 31 of 73\nworked as the superintendent of Sullivan, warned Keyser that they were \"concerned about\" Officer \nTucker because of his high number of use-of-force incidents, telling Defendant Keyser to \"pay \ncloser attention to\" any uses of force by Officer Tucker.  (Pl.'s Objs. & Resps. to Supervisor Defs.' \nRule 56.1  Statement, Dkt. No. 287 (\"Pl. Super 56.1 Resp.\") ~ 6; see also Keyser EBT at 221:4-\n15; 292:7-12.)  Defendant Keyser admits that he did not review Officer Tucker's then-existing \nuses of force then or at any time.  (Keyser EBT at 311 :2-9.) \nWhile Keyser was Superintendent of Sullivan, Officer Tucker was involved in six more \nuse  of force incidents, and two of those occurred while Burnett was Deputy Superintendent. \n(Compare Super. 56.1 ~~ 2, 9 with Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 92.)  See Poe, 282 F.3d at 143 (\"In some \ncases, notice will also be imputed to an individual because of the particular duties he is assigned \nby virtue of his position.\"). \nBoth Supervisor Defendants were clearly put on notice of Officer Tucker's record second \ntime, when the DOCCS office in Albany asked the Supervisor Defendants to compile a list of \nOfficer Tucker's use of force reports spanning the past two years.  (Pl.'s Counterstatement of \nAdditional Disputed Facts, Diet. No. 287 (\"Pl. Super. 56.1\") ~7; Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 91  (email \ncorrespondence);  id.  Ex.  92  (listing uses  of force).)  As  Deputy Superintendent Burnett told \nAlbany, during the relevant period, Officer Tucker had twelve use of force reports, eleven of those \nagainst inmates with serious mental illness or disabilities.  This was three to four times more than \nany other officer at Sullivan, and accounted for just over half of all uses of force in the ICP and \nSNU units.  (!d.) This did not prompt either Keyser or Burnett to review these use of force reports, \nto speak with Officer Tucker, or to ask any of Officer Tucker's superiors to speak with him.  (Pl. \nSuper. 56.1 ~ 7.) \n31 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 32 of 73\nMoreover, as discussed, Superintendent Keyser and Deputy Superintendent Burnett would \nhave been aware of six and four grievances, respectively, which alleged unprovoked assaults by \nOfficer Tucker.  As Superintendent Keyser himself acknowledged in his deposition, grievances, \neven if unsubstantiated, may indicate a pattern of behavior that warrants investigation or requires \nhim or the deputy superintendent of security to have a talk with the officer. (Keyser EBT at 191:9-\n192:9,276:5-17. And, as Plaintiffs expert has noted, \"An effective grievance investigation must \nalso include a consideration by supervisors of any past allegations made against the correction \nofficer and past uses of force involving the officer, even if unsubstantiated, to determine whether \na pattern of behavior is exhibited.  If the conduct alleged is consistent with past allegations or use \nof force, further and more rigorous investigation may be warranted.\"  (Ponte Rep. at 10-ll.) \nFinally, the  evidence raises  a genuine  issue  of material fact  whether the  Supervisor \nDefendants failed to take reasonable steps to abate the risk of harm posed by Officer Tucker to \ninmates.  It is undisputed that the Supervisor Defendants did not take any action against Officer \nTucker within the walls of Sullivan, by, for example, placing him on desk duty or assigning him \nto the control room (rather than foot patrol). Plaintiffs expert has opined that this is umeasonable. \n\"[W]here a series of grievances indicates a pattern of potential misconduct by a correction officer, \ninnnediate re-assignment may be warranted. Re-assignment of the officer-for example, to duties \nwithout direct inmate contact-is often the pmdent course of action[.]\" (!d. at 11.) It is undisputed \nthat neither the Supervisor Defendants nor their subordinates even spoke with Officer Tucker about \nhis conduct.  It is undisputed that the Supervisor Defendants failed to take anything but routine \nactions with respect to the uses of force and grievances that occurred during their tenure-except \non two occasions, when they referred the March 27, 2015 use of force and the April 6, 2015 \ngrievance to OS I.  And regarding the grievance, Superintendent Keyser states that he referred the \n32 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 33 of 73\ngrievance \"because the inmate had made allegations of sexual abuse\"-not because he hoped OSI \nwould take further action with respect to Officer Tucker.  (Dkt. No. 301 (\"Second Keyser Dec!.\") \n~ 6.) \nThe Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of fact with respect to \neach prong of her claim alleging that the Supervisor Defendants failed to protect Taylor from the \nthreat of excessive force posed by Officer Tucker.  The Supervisor Defendants' motion to dismiss \non this ground is denied. \nC.  The Supervisor Defendants Are Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity on \nPlaintiff's Failure to Protect Claim with Respect to Officer Tucker \nThe  Supervisor Defendants next argue that their actions were objectively reasonable, \nentitling them to qualified immunity.  (SJ Br. at 13-15.) \n1.  Legal Standard \n\"Qualified immunity shields public officials from liability for civil damages if their actions \nwere  objectively  reasonable,  as  evaluated  in  the  context  of legal  rules  that  were  'clearly \nestablished' at the time.\"  Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d 123, 132 (2d Cir. 2002).  This framework is \nintended  to  \"avoid  excessive  disruption  of government  and permit the resolution  of many \ninsubstantial claims on summary judgment.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). \n\"The entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; ... it is \neffectively lost if a case is erroneously pennitted to go to trial.\" Atwood v.  Town ofE llington, 468 \nF.  Supp. 2d 340, 351 (D. Conn. 2007) (quoting Mitchell v.  Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) \n(emphasis in original)). \n33 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 34 of 73\nQualified immunity involves application of a two-part test:  (1) whether there  was  a \nconstitutional violation, and (2) whether the defendant acted unreasonably under settled law, i.e., \nwhether the right was clearly established.  Mara v. Rilling, 921 F.3d 48, 68 (2d Cir. 2019)6 \nNeedless to say, the Court has already found that Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact that the Supervisor Defendants violated her brother's Eighth Amendment right to be \nfree from cruel and tmusual punishment. \nThe second prong of qualified immunity requires courts to \"consider[] whether 'it would \nbe clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\"' \nBailey v.  Pataki, 708 F.3d 391, 404 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Saucier v.  Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 \n(2001)); see also Doninger v.  Niehoff, 642 F.3d 334, 346 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"in the light of pre-\nexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent\") (internal quotation omitted). \n\"[T]he objective legal reasonableness of an official's actions must be viewed in light of the \naction's relationship to the clearly established law at the time.\"  Walentas v. Lipper, 862 F.2d 414, \n423  (2d  Cir.  1988).  The  objective reasonableness test is  met when \"officers  of reasonable \ncompetence could disagree on\" the legality of the challenged actions.  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. \n335, 341  (1986).  A court facing this question at summary judgment must ask whether \"the \nevidence is such that, even when it is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with \nall permissible inferences drawn in his favor, no rational jury could fail to conclude that it was \nobjectively reasonable for the defendant to believe that he was acting in a fashion that did not \n6  The Second Circuit recognizes that \"There is some tension in our Circuit's cases as to whether the qualified \nimmunity standard is of two or three parts, and whether the 'reasonable officer' inquiry is part of step two---the \n'clearly established' prong--{)r whether it is a separate, third step in the analysis.\" Bailey v. Pataki, 708 F.3d 391, \n404 n.8 (2d Cir. 2013).  Regardless, the analysis is not materially different. \n34 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 35 of 73\nviolate a clearly established right.\"  Salahuddin v.  Goard, 467 F.3d 263, 273  (2d Cir.  2006) \n(internal quotation and alterations omitted). \nThe Second Circuit has held that \"in order for a supervisor to be held liable under section \n1983, both the law allegedly violated by the subordinate and the supervisory liability doctrine \nunder which the plaintiff seeks to hold the supervisor liable must be clearly established.\" Poe, 282 \nF.3d at 126; see also Atwood, 468 F. Supp. 2d at 351 (\"In the context of supervisory liability, as \nhere, there is an additional part to ... the inquiry; not only must the right violated have been clearly \nestablished, but the theory under which the supervisor may be held liable must also have been \nclearly established.\"). \nFor supervisory liability predicated on the actions of an employee, appellate precedent \nclearly establishes that a supervisor violates a plaintiffs constitutional rights when he or she fails \nto take reasonable steps to investigate a risky subordinate, particularly if that subordinate has \nengaged in a pattern of constitutional torts.  See Poe, 282 F.3d at 141.  For supervisory liability to \nissue under these circumstances, \"the concept of notice\" is key.  I d.  Actual or constructive notice \nof facts by a supervisor may \"require [the supervisor] to do more,\" or to investigate \"by virtue of \nhis supervismy position.\" I d. \n2.  Qualified Immunity Does Not Shield the Supervisor Defendants \nPlaintiff brings her Section 1983 claim against the Supervisor Defendants pursuant to a \nfailure to protect theory, i.e., for knowingly or recklessly ignoring a high degree of risk that Officer \nTucker would violate Taylor's right to be free from excessive force. \nThe Supervisor Defendants' argument begins and ends with the second prong of qualified \nimmunity.  \"[T]he  undisputed  facts  establish that both  Superintendent  Keyser  and  Deputy \nSuperintendent Burnett took appropriate actions to ensure the safety of the inmates at Sullivan in \ngeneral and Mr. Taylor in particular.\" (Super. Br. at 15.) They maintain they did this by:  \"keeping \n35 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 36 of 73\nan eye out\" for complaints against Tucker; taking Tucker's written statements after use of force \nincidents  (which  is  standard practice  following  all  use  of force  incidents);  forwarding  one \nsuspicious use of force incident to OSI; and reviewing inmate grievances against Officer Tucker \n(which is done as a matter of course). \nIn light of the record, these actions do not entitle them to qualified immunity. \nIt is true that \"A supervisor is not grossly negligent ... where the supervisor took adequate \nremedial steps immediately upon learning of the challenged conduct.\"  Raspardo v.  Carlone, 770 \nF.3d 97, 117 (2d Cir. 2014) (emphasis added.)  But, in order to be adequate, such responses must \nbe meaningful.  See Talib v.  Officer Garcia, No. 98-cv-3318, 2000 WL 968772, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. \nJuly 12, 2000) (officials must make a \"meaningful investigation into charges that [subordinates] \nhad used excessive force\") (quoting Ricciuti v.  NYC Transit Auth., 941  F.2d 119, 123 (2d Cir. \n1991));  Selvaggio  v.  Patterson,  93  F.  Supp.  3d  54,  79  (E.D.N.Y.  2015)  (\"meaningful[] \ninvestigation\" required after notice).  The question is whether \"essentially no action was taken\" \nafter the supervisors were put on notice.  Cosentino v.  Town of Hamden, No. 11-cv-1669, 2014 \nWL 1305148, at *3 (D. Conn. Mar. 31, 2014) (emphasis added). \nSeveral  cases  from  this  Circuit  confirm that  opening  real  investigations  and  taking \ndisciplinary action will typically shield a supervisor from liability, whereas merely going through \nthe motions or conducting a superficial investigation will not. \nIn Raspardo, for example, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court's determination that \nqualified immunity shielded a supervisor who, in response to allegations that his subordinate was \nharassing female officers:  conducted a thorough investigation; disciplined the officer through \nverbal counseling; ordered the officer not to pick up female officers in his patrol vehicle; gave the \nofficer another verbal warning when he continued to pick up female officers; and, eventually, \n36 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 37 of 73\nsuspended the officer for two days and ordered him to surrender two days' holiday time.  770 F.3d \nat  124.  That  same  supervisor was  protected  by qualified  immunity where,  in response  to \nallegations  of  racial  harassment  against  the  same  subordinate,  he  placed  the  officer  on \nadministrative leave and opened an investigation, id., and, in response to allegations of sexual \nmisconduct perpetrated by the same officer, he contacted the prosecutor's office; demoted the \nofficer from sergeant to patrol officer; and recommended at the conclusion of the investigation that \nthe office be terminated, id. at 124-25. \nBy contrast, the Second Circuit held that a police chief was deliberately indifferent to his \nofficers' unlawful use of force when the plaintiff introduced evidence that the chief, who oversaw \na relatively small force, had received five serious complaints of police brutality and had conducted \nonly cursory investigations in response.  Fiacco v. City ofR ensselaer, NY, 783 F.2d 319, 329-31 \n(2d Cir.  1986).  The chiefs investigation-which was limited to  personally interviewing the \nofficers--did not involve taking any formal or written statements, opening any investigations, or \nmaking any notation in the officers' files.  !d. at 3 31.  At trial, the chief \"testified that, with respect \nto each claim or complaint, he had conducted as much investigation as he thought necessary\" and \nthat  he  had  \"satisfied  himself with respect  to  each of the  claims  described  above  that  no \ndepartmental rules had been violated and no disciplinary action was warranted.\"  Id.  at 330-31. \nThe Second Circuit held that this was not enough, and that the jury was entitled to conclude that \nhis \"response to complaints of use of excessive force by City police officers was uninterested and \nsuperficial.\"  Id. \nIn a third case, the Second Circuit held that supervisors were not entitled to qualified \nimmunity after they failed to monitor an officer who \"had been identified by the police department \nas a 'violent-prone' individual who had a personality disorder manifested by frequent  quick-\n37 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 38 of 73\ntempered demands for  'respect,'  escalating into physical confrontations for which he always \ndisavowed responsibility[.]\"  Vann v.  City of New York, 72 F.3d 1040, 1050-51 (2d Cir. 1995). \nThe panel wrote that \"the need to be alert for new civilian complaints filed after [the officer's] \nreinstatement to full-duty status was obvious,\" and the jury could find deliberate indifference from \nthe \"paucity of [the department's] monitoring system after such officers [are] reinstated.\"  Id. \nVann's holding, therefore, suggests that, where the risk of a constitutional violation is heightened, \nand  the  supervisors  are  on notice  of this  heightened risk,  employing  ordinary investigative \nprocedmes may constitute deliberate indifference.  See also Shaw v.  Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 801, \n802-03 (4th Cir.  1994) (discussed favorably in Poe, 282 F.3d at 142-43) (upholding grant of \nqualified immunity to police sergeant (Smith) who, in response to brutality allegations about one \nofficer, had a line sergeant speak with that officer, personally rode with the officer on patrol at \nleast twice, and assigned a line sergeant to attend a trial where the officer's conduct dming a stop \nwas at issue); but see id.  at 806 (Hall, J., dissenting) (supervisors were not entitled to qualified \nimmunity where complaints against the officer received \"ostrich-like investigation, perhaps from \nineptitude, perhaps by design\"). \nRetuming to this case, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the \nPlaintiff, I cannot conclude that the Supervisor Defendants' anemic responses to Officer Tucker's \nrecord and continued conduct was anything but \"ostrich-like.\"  As described above, there is no \ndispute regarding the actions that the Supervisor Defendants took-or, more aptly--did not take \nwith respect to the outlier behavior of Officer Tucker, of which the Supervisor Defendants were \nwell aware.  Simply put, there is no evidence in the record that they took any extra precautions \nwith respect to Officer Tucker, and no evidence that they viewed him differently than any other \nofficer at Sullivan. \n38 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 39 of 73\nPlaintiffs expert also opines that, in light of best conectional policies and practices, theirs \nwas not a reasonable response.  \"Officer Tucker's use-of-force record-which was flagged for \nSuperintendent Keyser and available well before April 13, 2015, despite the fact that Sullivan \nfailed to track and monitor officers' use of force records-wan-anted immediate action to separate \nOfficer Tucker from inmates on the ICP.\"  (Ponte Rep. at 27.) \nFor all these reasons, the Supervisor Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the \nbasis of qualified immunity is denied. \nD.  The Supervisor Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment on the \nRemaining Theories of Liability \nAs discussed, the Supervisor Defendants also move for summary judgment with respect to \nPlaintiffs failure to train claims and failure to protect claims in relation to the other Officer \nDefendants.  As noted above, Plaintiff misread an unambiguous brief, did not offer any substantive \nresponse to these arguments, and instead purpmted to reserve her rights in a footnote. The court \nrejects that effort; I will consider the Supervisor Defendants' arguments. \nDespite the fact that Plaintiff did not respond to these aspects of the Supervisor Defendant's \nmotion, \"[a] district court cannot base the entry of summary judgment on the mere fact that the \nmotion was unopposed but, rather, must consider the merits of the motion.\"  D.H Blair & Co. v. \nGottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 110 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v.  One Piece of Real Prop., \n5800 S. W.  74th Ave., Miami, Fla., 363 F.3d 1099, llOl (lith Cir. 2004)).  After considering the \nmerits, I find that the Supervisor Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on these remaining \nclaims. \n1.  Failure to Train \nWith respect to Plaintiffs failure to train theory, nothing in the evidence suggests that \neither Superintendent Keyser's or Superintendent Burnett's failure to recommend more training \n39 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 40 of 73\nfor any Officer Defendant proximately caused Taylor's death. This is because there is no evidence \nthat Officer Tucker or any other officer actually fell shmt on required training, no evidence that \nfurther training was available (or that it would have made a difference), and no plausible theory of \nthe case that is consistent with failure to train liability.  Again, Plaintiff principally contends that \nthe attacks were the result of conspiracy, carried out in retaliation or out of racial animus.  It is \ndifficult to square this argument with one alleging that a lack of training proximately caused the \nattack. \n2.  Failure to Protect Against the Risk of Excessive Force by Other Officer \nDefendants \nIn addition, Plaintiff has not raised any triable issue offact that the Supervisor Defendants \nwere either \"grossly negligent in supervising\" the ten other Officer Defendants or that they \n\"exhibited deliberate indifference\" by failing to act on information about them.  Colon v. Coughlin, \n58 F.3d 865, 873 (2d Cir. 1995).  The materials cited in Plaintiff's opposition do not include any \nevidence regarding the disciplinary, use of force,  or grievance records of any of the other ten \nOfficer Defendants-with the exception of one grievance that mentions Sergeant Frunzi.  The \nrecord similarly reveals no instance where DOCCS personnel in Albany singled out any of these \nother ten Officer Defendants as a potentially problematic officer.  Where there is \"no indication\" \nof \"prior problems,\" failure to review or investigate subordinates is \"mere negligence,\" which is \n\"insufficient as a matter of law to state a claim under section 1983.\" Poe, 282 F.3d at 145. \n* * * * \nIn sum, the Court DENIES the Supervisor Defendants' motion for summary judgment on \nPlaintiff's Section 1983 claim (First Cause of Action), to the extent the claim is based on a theory \nof failure to protect Taylor from the risk of excessive force posed by Officer Tucker. \n40 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 41 of 73\nThe  Court  GRANTS  the  Supervisor  Defendants'  motion for  summary judgment  on \nPlaintiffs Section 1983 claim (First Cause of Action), to the extent the claim is based on either a \ntheory of (i) failure to train or (ii) failure to protect Taylor from the risk of excessive force and \nracial discrimination posed by the other Officer Defendants. \nThe Court now turns to Dr. Lee's motion. \nDR. LEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nI.  Factual Background \nA.  Dr. Lee \nDr. Seung Ho Lee is a psychiatrist, duly licensed to practice medicine in New York.  (Lee \n56.1 ~ 1.)  Dr. Lee graduated from medical school in Korea in 1967 aud completed a three-year \npsychiatric residency in New York.  (Id. ~~ 2-3.) \nDr. Lee has been employed by OHM as a psychiatrist since 1976. (Id.  ~ 5.) He has worked \nat Sullivan since 2011, providing psychiatric care to its incarcerated patients.  (Id .~ 6.) \nThe psychiatric team at Sullivan includes Dr. Lee and two other psychiatrists from theNe w \nYork State Office of Mental Health (\"OMH\"):  Dr. Syed Mahmud, who is both the supervisory \npsychiatrist at Sullivan and also in charge of the ICP unit, and Dr. Larry Ertrachter, who, like Dr. \nLee, reports to Dr.  Mahmud.  (Id.  ~~ 7, 9.)  All Sullivan psychiatrists, in tum, report to Dr. \nVenkateswara Inaganti, the OMH Hudson River Regional Clinical Director, who worked offsite \nand supervised psychiatrists by providing a second layer of review based on records forwarded to \nhim.  (Id . ~ 10 .) \nB.  Overview of Mental Health Treatment for Prisoners \nIn New York State correctional facilities, services provided for inmates include, among \nothers,  the  Residential  Crisis  Treatment  Program  (\"RCTP\");  ICP;  inpatient  hospitalization; \n41 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 42 of 73\ntraditional  outpatient  clinic  services,  such  as  psychotherapy;  and,  when  indicated, \npharmacotherapy.  (!d. ~ 13.) \n1.  Residential Crisis Treatment Program (\"RCTP\") \nSullivan's  Residential  Crisis  Treatment  Program  (\"RCTP\"),  which  consists  of both \nobservation cells and a dormitory, is intended for short-term crisis intervention.  (!d.~ 17.) \nInmate-patients  at  Sullivan  are  sent  to  RCTP  observation  cells  when  they  are \n\"psychiatrically unstable, unpredictable and/or a danger to themselves or others.\"  (Hechtkopf \nDec!. Ex. 9 at -11656.) \nInmates are transferred out ofRCTP when:  the crisis precipitating the original transfer has \nbeen resolved; psychiatric assessment suggests the patient is capable of meaningfully participating \nin programming and can return to a lower level of care; or the psychiatric assessment determines \nthe need for an increased level of treatment, such as transfer to an in-patient hospital for higher \nlevels of care.  (!d. at -11662.) \n2.  Central New York Psychiatric Center (\"CNYPC\") \nIn addition to providing mental health services at individual prisons like Sullivan, OMH \noperates one inpatient psychiatric hospital for inmates, the Central New York Psychiatric Center \n(\"CNYPC\").  (Lee 56.1 ~ 24.)  Once at the CNYPC, inmates like Taylor become eligible to have \na court order that they be forcibly medicated. \nIn acute circumstances, if a psychiatrist believes an inpatient inmate is mentally ill, but the \ninmate refuses to make medication, the psychiah·ist may provide treatment, regardless of objection, \n\"where the patient is presently dangerous and the proposed treatment is the most appropriate \nreasonably available means of reducing that dangerousness.\"  N.Y. Camp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. \n14, § 527.8(c)(l); see also id. § 527.8(c)(5)(i). \n42 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 43 of 73\nFor longer, non-emergency circumstances, an inmate may not be given a psychotropic \nmedication over his objection without court authorization.  Id.  § 527.8(c)(5)(i).  This is called \ncourt-ordered psychotropic medication (\"COPM\").  Title 14, Section 527.8 of the Compilation of \nCodes, Rules, & Regulations for the State of New York lays out the requirements that the clinical \ndirector of CNYPC (or his designee) must follow to make a reasoned decision concerning the \nadministration of the proposed medication.  I d. \nC.  Taylor's Mental Health Treatment History \n1.  Taylor's Twenty-Year-Long Mental Health Treatment Pre-Sullivan (May \n1995 to November 24, 2014) \nTaylor began receiving mental health treatment in May 1995, shortly after he entered \nDOCCs custody.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 33.) \nOn May 11, 1995, Taylor was admitted to CNYPC and diagnosed with Delusional Disorder \nand Paranoid Personality Disorder.  (Hechtkopf Dec!. Ex.  18 (\"Colley Rep.\") at 3.)  While at \nCNYPC, Taylor was given emergency antipsychotic medication, but generally refused to take \nmost doses of his prescribed medication, haloperidol.  (Jd.)  He was discharged from CNYPC on \nMay 31, 1995.  (HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 17 at -55188.) \nBetween May 1995 and October 2009, after Taylor had been discharged from CNYPC, he \n\"largely refused\" mental health services, as well as his prescribed psychotropic medication.  (Lee \n56.1 ~37.) \nOn October 22, 2009, Taylor was again admitted to CNYPC.  (Id . ,[38.) At the time of his \nadmission, he was \"barking like a dog, acting bizarre, delusional, withdrawn ...[ and] refusing to \ntalk to  [the]  staff and treatment team.\"  (Jd.  ~ 39.)  His admission report noted his history of \ninfractions for violent and disruptive behavior including, \"Assault on inmate, Fighting, Weapon, \nand Violent Conduct  [sic],  Refusing direct Order,  Threats  ... Interference with Employee, \n43 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 44 of 73\nProperty  damage  and  loss,  Create  Disturbance  [sic].\"  (Jd  at  4.)  Notes  fi·om  his  mental \nexamination administered upon admission say that he had poor personal hygiene, smelled, and \nappeared to be of a thin weight.  (Id)  They explain his \"thought process was Tangential and \nCircumstantial, but content indicated paranoia,\" and that \"His affect was  anxious,  angry and \ninappropriate was suspicious and paranoid [sic].\"  (Id) \nTaylor's primary admission diagnosis was Schizoaffective Disorder, a new diagnosis. \n(Id)  Taylor was immediately prescribed an antipsychotic and an antimanic medication.  (Id) \nTaylor had difficulty adjusting to hospitalization and required multiple \"statIM medication \nfor  psychotic  agitation.\"  (Id)  The treating psychiatrist then petitioned  for  Court Ordered \nPsychiatric Medication (\"COPM\"), which was granted.  (Jd) \nTaylor spent a total of seven months at CNYPC.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 43.)  On May 17,2010, he \nwas discharged to the Attica Correctional Facility (\"Attica\").  (Jd)  His outpatient treatment plan, \ndischarge summary, and progress notes-all drafted by CNYPC staff-attributed his improvement \nto  medication,  and  noted  that  without  it,  he  was  subject  to  \"mood  change[s],  auditory \nhallucinations, paranoi[a], [and] delusion[s].\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 104 at -2092; Ex. 48 at -626; \nEx. 51 at -1132.) \nAt Attica, Taylor was placed initially in the Attica special treatment program, where he \nremained for two months, when he was transferred to Attica's ICP unit.  (Id  ~~ 44-45.)  He \nremained in the ICP unit until January 24, 2011, when he was transfened to the ICP unit at the \nWende Correctional Facility.  (Id ~ 45.) \nThe facts are not clear as to when Taylor's COPM expired---{)ne set of notes says that \nTaylor's COPM expired on May 20, 2011, and he refused subsequent medications after that time \n(HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 21 at -55710), while his \"core history\" says that his psychiatric medications \n44 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 45 of 73\nwere discontinued on April 22, 2012 (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 44 (\"Core History\") at -023).  What is \nundisputed is that Taylor refused medication after his COPM expired, and that he was subsequently \nneither prescribed nor forced to take medication.  (Lee 56.1 '\\['\\[ 47, 51; Pl. Lee 56.1 Resp. '\\['\\[ 47, \n51). \nBeginning in early 2011, Plaintiff was transfen·ed among ICP and other mental health \ntreatment programs at several prisons.  (Lee 56.1 '\\[51.)  At each facility, he consistently refused \nto take medication.  (Id.)  Taylor's core history states that he \"remained stable\" without these \nmedications but Plaintiff disagrees, pointing out that prior to his death, Taylor exhibited delusions, \nhallucinations,  paranoia and  symptoms  of psychosis.  (Pl.'s Resps.  to  Dr.  Lee's Rule  56.1 \nStatement, Dkt. No. 285 (\"Pl.'s Lee 56.1 Resp.\") '\\[ 47.) \n2.  Taylor's Transfer to Sullivan and Two-Month-Long Initial Treatment \n(November 24, 2015 to January 29, 2015) \nAt Sullivan, Taylor was assigned to the ICP.  (Lee 56.1 '\\[55.) \nAt the Sullivan ICP, Taylor's primary therapist was social worker Lama7 Miller (\"Miller\"), \nLCSW/Social Workerii. (Id. '\\[ 60.)  In January 2015, Miller observed that Taylor refused to come \nout of his cell for call-outs, was refusing all programs, and presented as hostile during cell-side \ninteractions.  (Id . '\\[ 61.)  She also observed that his hygiene remained poor.  (Id . '\\[ 62.)  She noted \nthat Taylor denied having auditory hallucinations and that she did not observe psychotic symptoms \nduring her session.  (Id. '\\['\\[ 61-62.) \nOn January 14, 2015, Taylor was put on medical keeplock----confinement to his cell-for \nrefusing a tuberculosis test.  (NYSCOC Prelim. Rep. at -56105.) \nShe is refeJTed to as \"Linda Miller\" on typed, sworn statement taken on June 1, 2015.  (HechtkopfDecl. \nEx. 28 at -56223.) \n45 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 46 of 73\n3.  Taylor's One-Month-Long Admission to Sullivan's RCTP (January 29, \n2015 to February 25, 2015) \nOn January 29,2015, Officer Tucker submitted a mental health referral for Taylor, writing \nthat Taylor had not showered or cleaned his cell in over two months, and marking in a checklist \nthat Taylor talked about \"Giving up\" (listed as a possible self-harm concern), and that he exhibited \nverbal behaviors such as \"Makes verbal threats,\" \"Yells and screams,\" and \"Talks about:  People \nbeing out to get me.\" (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 56 at -215.) \nTaylor was initially evaluated by Dr. Ertrachter, and then formally admitted to the RCTP \nfor further observation.  (Lee 56.1  ~ 67.)  During his evaluation, Taylor complained that the \n\"officer who brought him to this area to be seen\" was trying to 'jump\" him and was harassing him \nto get him to clean his cell.  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 66 at -103.)  At the time of his admission, his \nhygiene was recorded as \"poor\" and his cell was described as \"filthy,\" with mold accumulating \nbehind his property.  (!d. Ex. 76 at -55105.) \nWhen Dr. Lee returned to work at Sullivan in early February 2015, Taylor was assigned as \none of his patients.  (Lee 56.1 ,  69.) \nIt is unclear whether Dr. Lee reviewed Taylor's medical history when Taylor was assigned \nto his service or ever.  Dr. Lee testified that he \"probably\" would have read Taylor's core history \nprior to seeing Taylor and then that he \"believes\" he reviewed the assessment evaluation prior to \ntreating Taylor; he said that his routine is to review documents if they are available, which Taylor's \nwere.  (HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 3 and Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 65 (collectively, \"Lee EBT\") at 111:12-\n18; 133:6-134:8.)  However, Dr. Lee also told the Medical Review Board during its review of \nTaylor's death that \"if he was aware of the fact that Taylor had previously had a COPM, he \nprobably would have sent him to  CNYPC.\"  (NYSCOC Prelim Rep.  at -56107.)  Given that \n46 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 47 of 73\nTaylor's COPM would have been in his medical history, this suggests that Dr. Lee did not actually \nreview Taylor's history. \nDr. Lee testified that he and other team members participated in daily treatment team \nmeetings, where they discussed all patients, including Taylor. He further testified that during these \nmeetings, the team reviewed the nurses' notes from the prior day's rounds, as well as the notes of \nany other member of the mental health team who met with the patient.  (Lee EBT at 159:17-23, \n160:9-25.)  There are no notes or records from these meetings.  (Hechtkopf Dec!. Ex. 7 and \nEisenberg Dec!. Ex. 70 (collectively, \"Sneckenberg EBT\") at 25:18-26:25.)  Plaintiff claims that \nat these meetings Dr. Lee failed to respond to important observations and questions about Taylor's \ncondition and, more generally, that he failed to engage with other members of the mental health \ntreatment team regarding key components of Taylor's treatment.  (Pl. Lee 56.1 Resp. ~ 71.) \na)  Taylor's Evaluations While in RCTP \nAt first, Taylor refused to meet either RCTP psychiatrist for a private interview.  (Lee 56.1 \n~ 72.)  Nurses  and  social  workers  had  daily  interactions  with  Taylor,  but  during  these \n\"interactions,\" Taylor often refused to  talk,  sometimes  going  into  bed to  cover himself up. \n(Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 66 at -197.)  On the \"nursing note\" forms, Taylor's hygiene was consistently \nrecorded as \"fair,\" but it is not clear whether or not the nurses were actually able to determine \nwhether Taylor was actually showering, as he refused to leave his cell.  The nurses also indicated \nthat Taylor did not exhibit signs of\"dangerousness.\"  (Lee 56.1 ~ 74.)  But other members of the \ntreatment team believed that, given Taylor's history, he did pose a substantial risk of harm to \nhimself or others.  (See Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 62 (\"Jackson EBT\") at 80:21-81 :6; Sneckenberg EBT \nat 103:15-104:2.) \n47 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 48 of 73\nOMH requires that the RCTP treatment team submit a \"7 Day Consult\" for each patient \nwho remains in the RCTP for at least seven days.  (Lee 56.1 'lf80.) The report must then be updated \nevery seven days thereafter.  (Id) \nOn February 5, 2017, Kristie Sneckenberg, Psychologist Level II, prepared Taylor's 7-day \nconsult.  (Lee 56.1 'lf82.)  As a \"Psychologist II\" with OMH, Sneckenberg \"see[s] patients ... \nprovide[ s] therapy both individual and group, if necessary ... provide[s ] counseling,\" and works \nwith the interdisciplinary team to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment.  (Sneckenberg \nEBT  at  12:21-13:4.)  She  was  temporarily  assigned to  the  RCTP  at  the  time  of Taylor's \nevaluation-her regular assignment involved working as the Pre-Release Coordinator for inmate \npatients preparing for their release from DOCCS custody.  (Lee 56.1 'lf 84.) In her nmmal role she \nwas \"very rarely\" in the mental health unit.  (Jd)  Nevertheless, Dr. Lee stated that he had no \nreason to disagree with Sneckenberg's observations.  (Lee EBT at 167:8-168:5.) \nSneckenberg sent the 7-day consult to Dr. Inaganti on Febmary 5, 2015, cc'ing the rest of \nthe medical team, including Dr. Lee.  In her cover email to Dr. Inaganti, Sneckenberg wrote: \nDr. Inaganti, Taylor has not showered in 60 days and states he is a \ntrained  Marine  (delusion)  and  so  has  been trained  to  not  need \nshowers avoiding offensive odor.  He is refusing medication and \ntreatment and has remained in his RCTP cell with the exception of \nhis first interview.  He does engage cell side but becomes paranoid \nand delusional with pressured speech within minutes.  He may need \nadmission to CNYPC. \n(Lee 56.1 'l[86.) \nThat  same  day,  Dr.  Inaganti  responded:  \"Go  ahead  and  send  me  a  TTN  [Transfer \nTermination Note].  Please document and emphasize (paranoid and delusional) statements make \nhim a target to get hurt by other inmates.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 60.)  Dr. Inaganti says that by this \nemail, he \"did not dictate that the Sullivan practitioners had to send Taylor for in-patient treatment\" \n48 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 49 of 73\nbut that if they could make a case for such treatment, they should send the TTN.  (Hechtkopf Decl. \nEx. 6 (\"Inaganti Decl.\") ~ 12.) No TTN was sent. \nOn February 12,2015, Raymond Fernekes, Social Worker II, prepared a 14-day consult to \nupdate Dr. Inaganti on Taylor's status.  (Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 67 (\"14-Day Consult\").)  Femekes \nobserved that Taylor \"continue[ d] to not shower or provide self-care other than eat/drink.\"  (!d. at \n-55084.) He explained that Taylor was \"being considered last week for admission to CNYPC, but \nwas held back to  see if the extended stay would show any  possible positive movement and \ncooperation, which has not come to light.\"  (!d. at -55085.)  Dr. Lee testified that he was \"the one \nwho made the decision\" to hold Taylor back, (Lee EBT at 269:2-7), which the unit's acting chief \nand nurse administrator, Garrick Jackson, confirmed.  (Jackson EBT at 95:8-24.)  Notably, Dr. \nLee made this  decision without having yet seen Taylor, who had refused all regular private \ninterviews with Dr. Lee at that time.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 92.) \nDr. Inaganti wrote in response to Femekes' evaluation that the team should \"consider \nadmission to CNYPC early next week.\"  (Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 68.)  He asked that he be sent the \n\"TTN early next week, so that I can approve admission, provided that there is no turnaround.\" \n(!d.) Dr. Lee was not on Dr. Inaganti's initial email, but the next day, February 13, Sneckenberg \nwho also was not on the original email but had received it from another member of the team \nforwarded Dr. Inaganti's responses to Drs. Lee, Mahmud, and Ertrachter, writing \"Gentleman [sic] \nDr. Inaganti wanted him send [sic] up early next week ...... What are we doing with this????\" \n(Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 69.)  There is no indication that she received any response from Dr. Lee. \nOn February 18, 2015, Dr. Lee visited Taylor \"cell-side\" because Taylor continued to \nrefuse his psychiatric interviews in a private room.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 93.)  Dr. Lee's notes state that \n49 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 50 of 73\nTaylor said he felt \"good, beautiful.\"  (Hechtkopf Dec!. Ex. 32 at -079.)  However, Taylor also \ntold Lee that he did not feel safe and requested to be placed in protective custody.  (Id .) Lee wrote: \nPt. says, \"I need to protect myself.  They beat me up.  I like Sullivan. \nI want to be in PC at Sullivan.\"  Speech is loud and pressured.  He \nstates that coming out of his cell for interview will make prejudice \npeople lie [sic]. He is paranoid and delusional. He state that he will \nnot come out for private interview.  Mood is angry.  He denies \nhaving  mental  illness  and  refuses  meds. \nASSESSMENT/CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION/PLAN \n-Encourage pt to take meds. \n(Id.) \nThe next day, Febmary 19,2015, Sneckenberg sent a 21-Day Consult to Dr. Inaganti.  She \nwrote, \"It is the consensus of most of the team that [Taylor] requires inpatient treatment for his \nsignificant psychiatric decompensation.  There has been no change in his status and he continues \nto refuse medication.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 78 (\"21-Day Consult\") at -55103).  She also wrote \nthat Taylor had not showered in 90 days.  (!d.) \nDr. Inaganti wrote back that Taylor's stay could be extended and that \"Inpatient level of \ncare seem[s] appropriate.\"  (HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 40 at -55105.) \nOn Febmary 25, 2015, Dr. Lee again met with Taylor cell-side.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 100.)  Dr. \nLee's notes from his interview say: \nPt was interviewed cellside because he continues to refuse to come \nout of his cell for interview in a private room.  When asked how he \nfelt, he said 'Beautiful.'  He denied having complaints except for \nmissing of his properties and not being in PC.  He has been refusing \nto come out of his cell for private interview continually.  He stated \nthat he has been taking shower in RCTP ... Pt was talkative.  He \ntalked loudly.  He refused to talk about the Marines which he said \nhe was in.  However speech was relevant and coherent.  He claimed \nthat an officer on his block assaulted him and that the officer is \nprejudicial.  He said, 'I need to protect myself. I want to be in PC.' \nHe denied hallucinations.  He denied suicidal and homicidal ideas. \nHe stated that he eats and sleeps very well and describes his mood \nas 'beautiful.'  He denied depression.  Initially he was pleasant, but \n50 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 51 of 73\nhe became upset when he was told that he has to go back to his block \nto initiate the process for PC. -He denied suicidal ideas. \n(Lee 56.1 ,; 10 1.)  Dr. Lee also wrote that he encouraged Taylor to consider taking medications, \nbut that Taylor continued to refuse to do so.  (!d.,; 102.) \nDr. Lee testified that, based on this meeting with Taylor, he concluded that Taylor had \"no \nsymptoms ... no acute symptoms.  He was not suicidal or homicidal.  And one of the major \nconcerns was that he was not taking shower.  He was taking shower.  And often he described he's \ngood, using word 'beautiful' ...\"   (Lee EBT at 200:23-201 :8.) \nAs a result, Dr. Lee concluded that Taylor could be returned to the ICP program to continue \ntreatment in an outpatient setting.  (Lee 56.1,; 97; Lee EBT at 200:18-22.) \nDr. Lee says that Dr. Mahmud, who supervised the other two psychiatrists at Sullivan and \nwho oversaw care at the ICP unit, agreed with his decision.  (Id .)  Dr. Lee recorded in his progress \nnotes on February 25 that \"This case was discussed with Dr. Mahmud and it was concluded that \npt no longer needs to be in RCTP and he should be sent back to his block.  Reportedly he will be \nplaced back in keeplock when he goes back to his bloc.\"  (Lee 56.1 ,; 105.)  Dr. Mahmud said that \nDr. Lee's progress note indicated that Taylor's condition had improved and that he was showering, \nand based on that information, he agreed that it was appropriate to return Taylor to ICP for further \nmonitoring.  (HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 5 (\"Mahmud Dec!.\"),;,; 14-15; HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 32 at-\n083-85 (Lee's notes from February 25 meeting with Taylor); Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 63 (\"Mahmud \nStatement\").)  Dr. Mahmud had never seen Taylor nor reviewed his records.  (Id.) \nDr. Lee testified that he knew that by discharging Taylor to ICP, he was sending him \nsomewhere where he could be seen by mental health staff and where he could have treatment.  He \nfurther stated that, \"In case there is a problem ... ICP staff can call us or they can bring in [sic] \nfor another evaluation and the doors are open all the time.\"  (Lee EBT at 201:11-25.)  Plaintiff \n51 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 52 of 73\ndisagrees with Dr. Lee's assessment, claiming that while these services might be available to ICP \ninmates more generally, they may not have been available to Taylor, who, as Dr. Lee knew, was \nconfined to his cell and not engaging with programming or mental health professionals.  (See Lee \n56.1 ~ 68.) \nb)  The RCTP Treatment's Teams Differing Opinions on Taylor's \nTreatment \nIt is clear that during Taylor's time in the RCTP, the members of the treatment team \ndiffered as to how to treat him. It is also undisputed that, while each member of the treatment team \nhas a chance to express his or her opinion on the appropriate treatment for a patient, ultimately it \nis up to the treating psychiatrist to decide the appropriate course of treatment for the patient.  (Lee \n56.1 ~ 98.) \nMost team members, including Sneckenberg, believed Taylor should be sent to CNYPC \nfor inpatient treatment and COPM, and did not agree with Dr. Lee's decision to hold Taylor or \nsend him back to ICP.  (Lee 56.1  ~ 96.)  For example, in a statement taken on June 18, 2015, \nGatTick Jackson, the Acting Unit Chief at the time of Taylor's admission, said: \"Every time we \ndiscussed Mr. Taylor's case, the plan that was discussed was to admit him to [CNYPC.]  Dr. Lee \nwould indicate that he wanted to have more time to evaluate him ... Then all of a sudden Dr. Lee \nwanted to discharge him on the day that he did.  Basically the rest of the team did not agree with \nthis plan ... \"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 61.) He further stated that \"99.9% of the time we would admit \nthe patient to Central [i.e., CNYPC] in this case.\"  (!d.) \n4.  Taylor's Return to ICP and Death (February 25, 2015 to Aprill3, 2015) \nTaylor was returned to the ICP on February 25, 2015.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 111.)  Taylor was in \n\"keeplock\" because he still refused the PPD skin test to diagnose a tuberculosis infection.  (!d. \n~~ 106-07.)  He was inkeeplock until AprilS, 2015.  (!d.~ 119.) \n52 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 53 of 73\nTaylor was reassigned to Dr. Mahmud and Laura Miller.  (Lee 56.1 -,r-,r  114-15.)  In the \nICP, Taylor was supposed to receive daily mental health checks, during rounds in the morning and \nafternoons, but there is no formal documentation that these checks actually occmTed, other than \nDr. Mahmud's general statement that Taylor \"was seen by clinicians on the treatment team daily.\" \n(Mahmud Dec!. -,r 19.) \nTaylor was scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Mahmud on March 23, 2015, but he did \nnot appearfor the appointment.  (Lee 56.1 -,r 118.) \nDuring the time between which Taylor was retumed to the ICP and his death, Miller says \nthat she observed no psychotic symptoms.  However, she also said that while he was \"stable \nenough to send back to the block\" he was \"resistant to treatment ...d elusional ... verbally \naggressive ...a nd wasn't on meds.\"  (Hechtkopf Dec!. Ex. 42 at -56223.)  Upon review the \ncontemporaneous reports of mental health team, Plaintiffs expert and the Officer Defendants' \nexpert noted that Miller's and other's observations of \"irrelevant speech, loose associations per \nseparation and paranoia ... are symptoms of psychosis.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 8 (\"Colley EBT\") \n230:19-24; id.  Ex.  49 (\"Bardey EBT\" 49:4-53:5  (testifying that Taylor was \"psychotic\" and \n\"delusional\" while in the ICP at Sullivan).) \nThe ICP team felt generally that Taylor should be admitted to CNYPC and, would \"discuss \non occasion to reconsider readmission during team meetings.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 77 at -56245 \n(sworn written statement of Femekes).)  But, they felt that their hands were tied because \"the \nRCTP team [of which Dr. Lee was principal psychiatrist] relayed that this was how the [inmate \npatient] Taylor is going to be.\"  (!d.) \n53 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 54 of 73\nDr. Lee testified that after he discharged Taylor, he hadn't \"heard anything about him and \nnothing showed up, nothing came up in the round, so [he] assumed he was okay.\"  (Lee EBT at \n246:12-15.) \nTaylor was once referred for mental health evaluation while in the ICP, on April 8, 2015, \nbecause another nurse, who visited him when he was taken off of medical keeplock, observed that \nhe had toilet paper around his neck.  (Lee 56.1 ~ 122.)  In response to the mental health referr-al, \nMiller spoke with Taylor cell-side.  She found that he did not appear to be in acute distress.  (Id \n~ 123.)  She observed that this behavior \"appear to be an aspect of patient's baseline behavior,\" \nand that she did not feel he was in crisis but that he \"was bizarr-e and would do bizarr-e things.\" \n(Id ~ 124.) Miller determined that he did not need to be transferr-ed to the RCTP and that he should \nremain in ICP.  (Id ~ 125.) \nOn April13, 2015, Taylor was involved in an altercation with corr-ection officers in theE \nNorth Housing unit.  (ld ~ 131.)  Taylor was pronounced dead at the prison infirmary later that \nmorning.  (ld ~ 135.) \nII.  Dr. Lee's Motion for Summary Judgment \nA.  Overview of Claims Against Dr. Lee; Proximate Causation \nThe basic claim against Dr. Lee is that-against the advice of many colleagues-he did \nnot transfer Taylor out of the ICP and into an inpatient program providing a higher level of mental \nhealth care.  If he had done that, Taylor would not have been in E-North on April13, 2015-the \ndate he was beaten to death. \nIt is quite clear from the papers that Plaintiff seeks to have Dr. Lee held liable for her \nbrother's death under two theories:  section 1983 deliberate indifference (Fifth Cause of Action) \nand New York state medical malpractice (Sixth Cause of Action). \n54 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 55 of 73\nThat effort fails. \n\"Defendants may be held liable under § 1983 if they ... exhibited deliberate indifference \nto a known injury, a known risk, or a specific duty, and their failure to perform the duty or act to \nameliorate the risk or injury was a proximate cause of plaintiffs deprivation of rights under the \nConstitution.\" Hawkins v. Nassau Cty. Carr. Facility, 781 F. Supp. 2d 107, 112 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) \n(internal quotation and alterations omitted).  Similarly, \"In order to establish the liability of a \nphysician for medical malpractice, a plaintiff must prove that the physician deviated or departed \nfrom accepted community standards of practice, and that such departure was a proximate cause of \nthe plaintiffs injuries.\"  Gillespie v. NY Hasp.  Queens, 96 A.D.3d 901,902, 947 N.Y.S.2d 148, \n149 (2d Dep't 2012).  In each instance, a defendant can be held liable only for injuries proximately \ncaused by his deliberate indifference or his deviation from accepted medical practices. \nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, I cannot conclude that Taylor's \ndeath was proximately caused by Dr. Lee's failure to transfer him to an inpatient program outside \nof Sullivan. \n\"When evaluating causation under§ 1983, courts consider the 'foreseeability or the scope \nof the risk created by the predicate conduct,' and must conclude that there was 'some direct relation \nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'\" Anderson v. City ofN  Y, No. 16-\ncv-6629, 2017 WL 2729092, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2017) (quoting Cty. ofL .A. v. Mendez, 137 \nS. Ct. 1539, 1548--49 (2017)). \nPlaintifffails to meet either the substantial factor or foreseeability prong. \nFirst, there is no indication that Taylor's untreated mental illness had a direct relationship \nto theE-North altercation. There is not a scintilla of evidence that Dr. Lee decided to leave Taylor \nin E-North as a result of any interaction with Officer Tucker, Sergeant Frunzi, or any of the Officer \n55 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 56 of 73\nDefendants. Nor is there evidence that Taylor had behaved aggressively against correction officers \nin the  past.  His  mental health history  as  an inmate includes  a few,  but not many,  acts  of \naggression-at least one during his time at CNYPC in 1995 (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 45 at -559-60), \nhis throwing feces and urine at a CO in 2002, and again during his admission to CNYPC in 20 I 0 \n(id Ex. 48 at -622)-and none within five years of his death.  Two occurred at CNYPC, not in \nprisons, and only one involved a correction officer.  Plaintiff points to no documentation of \naggression in Taylor's more recent psychiatric history, despite his propensity for agitation, and \nprovides no evidence that Taylor acted violently or aggressively while in the Sullivan ICP or \nRCTP. \nThere is also no indication that the E-North altercation was foreseeable-at least to Dr. \nLee.  There is no evidence in the record that Dr. Lee was aware of Officer Tucker's increased \ntendency to employ force, or of the multiple grievances alleging unprovoked assaults and sexually \nabusive pat-downs.  Although Dr. Lee knew that Taylor had a history of\"paranoid thoughts about \ncorrectional officers\" generally (Mem. in Supp. of Def. Lee's Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. No. 277 \n(\"Lee Br.\") at 21), a history of general complaints is insufficient to make an altercation with COs \nforeseeable-particularly as Plaintiff points to no documentation that Taylor had physical conflicts \nwith these COs in the past. \nPlaintiff argues that Dr. Lee should have foreseen an altercation with Officer Tucker, \nbecause Taylor claimed, upon his admission to the RCTP, that the officer who brought him there \n(Officer Tucker),  had threatened him.  But this  one  comment does  not make  a life-ending \naltercation \"foreseeable\" to an OMH employee. \n56 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 57 of 73\nSo there is absolutely no basis on which Plaintiff can hold Dr. Lee accountable for her \nbrother's death, on a theory that Dr. Lee's failure to move Taylor to CNYPC left him in the wrong \nplace at the wrong time.  The case against Dr. Lee will not proceed to the jury on that theory. \nThe question remains:  do either of Plaintiffs claims against Dr. Lee remain viable because \nDr. Lee's deliberate indifference and/or medical malpractice caused him to suffer another injury, \nspecifically, prolonged psychosis and/or worsened mental distress? I find that such injury, if there \nis evidence of it, would be cognizable under both causes of action. See, e.g., Fricano v. Lane Cty., \nNo. 16-cv-1339, 2018 WL 2770643, at *9 (D. Or. June 8, 2018) (\"Here, there is evidence from \nwhich a  reasonable jury could find that,  because  of Mr.  Pleich's failure  to take reasonable \nameliorative steps, Mr. Fricano suffered through an unnecessarily long period of psychosis.\"). \nI also conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether Taylor was acutely \npsychotic when he returned to the ICP.  The evidence shows that, after being discharged from the \nRCTP, Taylor continued to experience symptoms of psychosis. He still refused to shower or leave \nhis cell, and exhibited \"hostile\" and \"odd behavior.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 55 at 199-205.)  On \none occasion, a few days prior to his death, he had written on toilet paper and was wearing it \naround his neck like a scarf.  (Id. at -211.) \nWith that injury in mind, the Court turns to the claims against Dr. Lee. \nB.  Section 1983 Claim for Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Needs \n(Fifth Cause of Action) \nThe Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause requires prison officials \nto ensure that inmates receive adequate medical care.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832.  Accordingly, a \nprison official who exhibits \"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\" violates \nthe Eighth Amendment because such action \"constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of \n57 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 58 of 73\npain.\"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 \n(1976)). \nAs with other Eighth Amendment claims, deliberate indifference to serious medical needs \nhas both an objective and a subjective prong.  Hawkins, 781 F. Supp. 2d at 112.  The objective \nprong requires that \"the alleged deprivation of adequate medical care ... be 'sufficiently serious.\"' \nSalahuddin, 467 F.3d at 279 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844).  The subjective requirement is \nthat the \"charged official must act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\"  Jd at 280 (quoting \nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 300 (1991)). \n1.  Plaintiff Raises a Genuine Issue of Fact Whether Taylor Was Denied \nConstitutionally Adequate Care \nA  \"sufficiently serious\"  deprivation  occurs  when  'the  conditions,  either  alone  or  in \ncombination, pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to [plaintiff's] health.\"' King v. Falco, \nNo. 16-cv-6315, 2018 WL 6510809, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. II, 2018) (quoting Darnell v. Pineiro, \n849 F.3d 17, 30 (2d Cir. 2017)).  This, in turn, has two components:  first, whether the prisoner \nwas actually deprived of adequate medical care,  id, and, second, whether the inadequacy in \nmedical care is sufficiently serious.  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 279.  The Court looks at \"how the \noffending conduct is inadequate and what harm, if any, the inadequacy has caused or will likely \ncause the prisoner.\"  Jd at 280. \na)  A Genuine Issue ofM  aterial Fact Exists as to Whether Taylor \nWas Denied Adequate Care \nThere is  no  doubt that Taylor was provided with medical care while at Sullivan-the \nquestion here is  whether that care was adequate.  \"Medical care is  adequate where the care \nprovided is  a  'reasonable'  response to  the  inmate's  medical  condition.\"  Melvin  v.  Cty.  of \nWestchester,  No.  14-cv-2995, 2019  WL 1227903, at  *9  (S.D.N.Y.  Mar.  15,  2019)  (internal \n58 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 59 of 73\nquotation  omitted).  Federal  courts  are  \"reluctant  to  second  guess  medical judgments  and \nconstitutionalize [medical malpractice claims]\"-when a prisoner has received some medical \ntreatment, deliberate indifference will be found when \"the medical attention rendered [was]  so \nwoefully inadequate as to amount to no treatment at all.\" Johnson v.  Wright, 234 F. Supp. 2d 352, \n360 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (internal quotation omitted).  For example, one Second Circuit panel found \ndeliberate indifference when the \"course of treatment was largely ineffective [and the physician] \ndeclined to  do  anything more to  attempt to  improve  [the  imnate's]  situation.\"  Hathaway v. \nCoughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1994). However, \"Mere differences in opinion, whether between \ndoctors or laymen, based on medical care does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation of \ninadequate medical treatment pursuant to section 1983.\"  Webb v. Jackson, No. 92-cv-2149, 1994 \nWL 86390, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 1994), ajf'd, 47 F.3d 1158 (2d Cir. 1995). \nTaking all the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, a jUly could find that Dr. Lee \nfailed to provide Taylor with constitutionally adequate care.  Specifically, a jury could find that \nDr.  Lee provided inadequate treatment when he refused to refer Taylor for further treatment \nbeyond Sullivan's in-house RCTP, and eventually sent him back to ICP housing without changing \nhis treatment plan. \nDr. Lee missed several opportunities to either transfer Taylor to CNYPC for a higher level \nof inpatient care, to seek a COPM, or to change his treatment plan within RCTP.  When Taylor \nwas admitted to the RCTP on January 29,2015, he was \"paranoid\" and \"delusional.\"  (Eisenberg \nDec!. Ex. 58 at -061-63; id. Ex. 66 at -101-03.) He claimed to be \"an officer trained in sex crimes\" \nand a \"trained soldier.\"  (Jd.)  He denied any mental illness.  (Jd.)  Taylor remained in the RCTP \nfor 27 days, during which his providers (except for Dr. Lee) noted no improvement.  Taylor \nconsistently refused to  come out of his cell and  speak with mental health staff.  On the few \n59 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 60 of 73\noccasions that he did speak with the staff, he was described as \"delusional\" and \"paranoid.\" \n(Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 66 at -107, -123, -131.)  There is no evidence that Taylor showered during \nthe month he was under observation at the RCTP.  (See  id.  at -135.)  As a result of Taylor's \nbehavior,  staff members  consistently  recognized  that  he  might  need  further  treatment  and \nhospitalization-their notes say that Taylor \"appears to need inpatient hospitalization and possible \nCOPM\" and \"CNYPC is being actively considered.\"  (See id. at -145, -183.) \nDr. Lee was made aware of Taylor's behavior as well as his fellow team members' beliefs \nthat Taylor required additional levels of care.  These issues were raised in daily meetings and, \nmore than once, Dr. Lee was included on emails in which staff members inquired about raising \nTaylor's level of care by admitting him to CNYPC, including emails from the regional clinical \ndirector Dr. Inaganti.  (See Lee EBT at 163:14-165:14, 167:8-168:5; Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 69.) Dr. \nLee never responded to this information.  He neither replied to the emails nor informed the staff \nof his next steps. \nDr. Lee decided that he would not follow Dr. Inaganti's suggestion to transfer Taylor \nbecause he felt more observation was needed.  Dr. Lee made this decision when he had yet to meet \nwith Taylor, and potentially without knowledge of his full history.  Dr. Lee did not actually meet \nwith Taylor until five days later on February 18, when he observed that Taylor was \"loud and \npressured,\" \"paranoid and  delusional,\"  and that he  seemed \"angry\" and  was  refusing meds. \n(Eisenberg Decl. Ex. 58 at Lee_00079.)  Still, he kept Taylor in RCTP. \nDr. Lee then did not see Taylor again until seven days later.  In the interim, Dr. Lee's \ncolleague again suggested that Taylor receive a higher level of care.  (21-Day Consult.)  At this \nsecond meeting, on February 25, Dr. Lee found that Taylor had improved.  He based on this \nconclusion on the fact that Taylor reported his mood as \"beautiful,\" denied hallucinations and \n60 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 61 of 73\ndepression, and had showered (although there is no documentation of how Dr. Lee knew that \nTaylor had showered). \nThis one evaluation led Dr. Lee to determine that Taylor was ready to be sent back to ICP \nunit, which, while it provides mental health treatment, does so at a level of care that is less than \nthat ofRCTP. (See id. at -83-85, -250.)  While Dr. Lee noted that he consulted with Dr. Mabrnud, \nDr. Mabrnud performed no independent evaluation ofTaylor and relied on Dr. Lee's observations. \nNot only were Dr. Lee's actions contrary to RCTP medical health team's conclusions and \nthe conclusions of the regional clinical director, but Plaintiff has provided expert testimony that \nthey were inadequate and unreasonable.  Plaintiffs expert, Dr. Jeremy Colley, a board certified \npsychiatrist and the Director of Inpatient Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital Center, submits that \n\"[t]here was no reasonable medical justification for Dr.  Lee's treatment decision\" because his \nevaluations \"fell well below the standard of care.\" He concluded that the records of Taylor's time \nin RCTP show that Taylor \"met the criteria for inpatient admission and involuntary medication,\" \nas recognized on clinicians on his treatment team.  (Colley Rep. at 12.)  Moreover, Dr. Colley \nobserved that Dr. Lee's analysis failed to consider Taylor's history of violence and refusal of \nmedication, which was clearly documented by the team and presented to Dr. Lee.  (!d.) \nDrawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiff, Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material \nfact as to whether Dr. Lee's treatment was reasonable.  See Fricano, 2018 WL 2770643, at *7 \n(finding genuine issue of material fact  as  to whether treatment was adequate when Plaintiff \n\"arrived and departed from [the jail] in the same acutely psychotic state, despite evidence that his \ncondition  could  have  been,  and  indeed  was,  quickly  improved  with  basic  therapeutic \ninterventions\"). Plaintiff has provided evidence that ( 1) Dr. Lee's actions were contrary to medical \n61 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 62 of 73\nstandards and the contemporaneous opinions of his peers; (2) without adequate justification, given \nhis limited evaluations; and (3) uninformed, given Plaintiffs history. \nb)  There is a Genuine Issue of Material Fact as to Whether the \nInadequacy of Care Was Sufficiently Serious. \nNext, the Court turns to the second part of the objective prong, which asks whether there \nis a genuine issue of material fact that the inadequacy in care was \"sufficiently serious.\"  When \nthe \"offending conduct is the medical treatment given ... the seriousness inquiry is narrower. ... \nCourts look to the alleged inadequate treatment, not the underlying condition alone, and consider \nthe effectiveness of the treatment the prisoner received, and the harm that resulted from the alleged \nshortfalls.\" King, 2018 WL 6510809, at *7 (internal citations and quotations removed). Psychosis \nmay be a serious medical condition.  Charles v.  Orange Cty., 925 F.3d 73, 88 (2d Cir. 2019). \nDefendant argues that there is no evidence that Dr. Lee's decision to send Taylor to ICP \nand not to transfer him to CNYPC caused him any harm.  (Lee Br. at 10  .)  Plaintiff argues that Dr. \nLee's decision harmed Taylor by prolonging his psychosis and by sending him \"in a paranoid and \nunstable state to a cellblock where he felt threatened,\" a decision lead to Taylor's death.  (Pl.'s \nOpp. to Mot. for Summ. J. by Def. Lee, Dkt. No. 286 at 13.) \nA reasonable juror could conclude that, because of Dr.  Lee's actions, Taylor suffered \nadditional period of psychosis that could have been avoided with adequate treatment.  (Bardey \nEBT at 94:9-22 (explaining that Taylor was \"suffering\" without higher level of care and it was \nlike \"psychological torment ... to be having those kinds of symptoms on an ongoing basis.\").)  It \nis clear that Taylor's symptoms continued when he returned to ICP.  This was not unpredictable \ngiven that, as Dr. Lee was aware, Plaintiff felt threatened in ICP and the ICP unit was not equipped \nto provide care for inmates \"so severely dysfunctional that, at the time of referral they require acute \ncare.\"  (Eisenberg Dec!. Ex. 54 at -120.) \n62 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 63 of 73\nDr. Lee argues that Taylor might have continued to experience the same symptoms even if \nhe were transferred to CNYPC, since prison officials would still need to obtain a COPM in order \nto medicate Taylor.  (Lee Br. at 3-5, 10 .)  While Dr. Lee is correct that obtaining a COPM was not \nguaranteed (although, as Plaintiffs expert has stated, it does seem likely given his history), a \nreasonable juror could nonetheless conclude that, given the opinions ofthe medical treatment team \nin the RCTP, Taylor's ongoing symptoms, and the fact that Taylor had received COPM in the past, \nDr. Lee's decision denied Taylor his only opportunity for effective treatment, and that this led to \nhim to experience additional, unwarranted, symptoms of psychosis. \nIn sum, Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Taylor was \ndenied adequate care. \n2.  Plaintiff Fails to Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact Whether Dr. \nLee Acted With Deliberate Indifference \nSince Plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant violated \nthe objective prong, the Court turns to the subjective prong. \nTo be held culpable for a claim of failure to provide adequate medical care, the prison \nofficial must exhibit \"deliberate indifference.\"  Wilson, 501 U.S. at 302.  A prison official acts \nwith deliberate indifference when he or she \"knows of and disregards and excessive risk to inmate \nhealth or safety.\"  Ortiz v.  Goard, 276 F. App'x 97, 98 (2d Cir. 2008) (summary order) (quoting \nFarmer, 511  U.S.  at 837).  Deliberate indifference is equivalent to \"subjective recklessness,\" \nwhich requires that the \"charged official act or fail to act while actually aware of a substantial risk \nthat serious inmate harm will result.\"  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 280.  \"[I]t is well-settled that a \ncomplaint that a doctor was 'negligent in diagnosing or treating a medical condition does not state \na valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.\"' Atkins v.  Cty. of Orange, \n63 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 64 of 73\n372 F. Supp. 2d 377, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Be/lotto v.  Cty.  of \nOrange, 248 F. App'x 232 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106). \nMoreover, the official must be aware that his conduct creates such a risk-\"a  defendant's \nbelief that his conduct poses no risk of serious harm (or an insubstantial risk of serious harm) need \nnot be sound so long as it is sincere.  Thus, even if objectively unreasonable, a defendant's mental \nstate may be nonculpable.\"  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 281.  \"Mere medical malpractice is not \ntantammmt to deliberate indifference, but it may rise to the level of deliberate indifference when \nit involves culpable recklessness, i.e., an act or a failure to act . . .  that evinces a conscious \ndisregard of a substantial risk of serious harm.\"  Cuoco v.  Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir. \n2000) (internal quotation omitted). \nPlaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact that Dr. Lee evinced a \"conscious disregard \nof a substantial risk of serious harm.\"  At most, the evidence raises an issue of whether Dr. Lee \nwas negligent-a state of mind insufficiently culpable for liability under the Eighth Amendment. \nThe evidence reflects only a possible disagreement regarding the best course of treatment.  Cf R. T \nv. Gross, 298 F. Supp. 2d 289,299 (N.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"The evidence in the record is that Melendez \ndid not ignore or otherwise callously disregard Plaintiffs condition.  Melendez observed Plaintiff \non three separate occasions .... and determined that he was not suffering from any delusions, \ndepression, suicidal ideations, or mania[.]\"). \nFirst, Dr. Lee's staff, including nurses, social workers and a psychologist, saw Taylor daily \nduring his stay in the RCTP.  Second, While Taylor initially refused private interviews with Dr. \nLee  and  Dr.  Ertrachter  initially,  Dr.  Lee  attended  meetings  where  Taylor's  condition  was \ndiscussed, and, toward the end of Taylor's stay at RCTP, Dr. Lee himself saw Taylor twice in \nperson.  Although hindsight suggests that Dr. Lee may have been wise to probe further, Taylor \n64 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 65 of 73\nstated that he felt well, and that he had showered.  Further, Taylor had been admitted to the RCTP \nbecause he had mentioned \"giving up,\" but no healthcare provider in the RCTP concluded that \nTaylor was a threat to himself or to others.  Finally, Dr. Lee released Taylor into the care of his \ncolleague and supervisor, Dr. Syed Mahmud, who had previously been assigned to treat Taylor in \nthe ICP, after speaking with Dr. Mahmud about what he had observed during his most recent \npatient interview.  There is no evidence that Dr. Lee !mew, or had reason to guess, that returning \nTaylor to the ICP after he had spent 27 days in the RCTP in an arguably stable condition, would \n\"result[] in a 'a condition of urgency that may result in degeneration or extreme pain'\" or lead to \nan \"irreversible deterioration of the plaintiffs mental condition[.]\" Smith v.  Wurzberger, No. 05-\ncv-968, 2008 WL 2157127, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2008), report and recommendation adopted, \n2008 WL 2157126 (N.D.N.Y. May 20, 2008) (quoting Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 702 \n(2d Cir. 1998)). \nUnder these facts, therefore, \"no rational fact finder could conclude that [Dr. Lee J acted \nwith a mental state akin to criminal recklessness.\" Hall v. NYS Dep 't ofCorr. & Cmty. Supervision, \nNo. 12-cv-0377, 2015 WL 901010, at *19 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2015).  Therefore, I grant summary \njudgment to Dr. Lee on Plaintiffs claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs under \nthe Eighth Amendment (Fifth Cause of Action). \nC.  Plaintiff Raises a Genuine Issue of Material Fact on Her Medical \nMalpractice Claim (Sixth Cause of Action). \nPlaintiff also brings a medical malpractice claim under New York state law against Dr. \nLee.  The Court declines to dismiss this claim. \n\"To establish a claim for medical malpractice tmder New York law, a plaintiff must prove \n(I) that the defendant breached the standard of care in the community, and (2) that the breach \nproximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.\"  Lettman v.  United States, No. 12-cv-6696, 2013 WL \n65 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 66 of 73\n4618301, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2013) (quoting Arkin v.  Gittleson, 32 F.3d 658, 664 (2d Cir. \n1994)); Matthews v. Malkus, 377 F. Supp. 2d 350, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). \n\"To meet the initial burden on a summary judgment motion in a medical malpractice action, \ndefendants must present factual proof, generally consisting of affidavits, deposition testimony and \nmedical records, to rebut the claim of malpractice by establishing tbat they complied with the \naccepted standard of care or did not cause any injury to the patient.\"  Tkacheffv. Roberts, 147 \nA.D.3d 1271, 1272 (3d Dep't 2017) (internal quotation omitted).  The burden then shifts to the \nPlaintiff to show the existence of a material question of fact as to whether the defendant's actions \ndeparted from the accepted standard of care.  !d. \n\"Summary judgment is not appropriate in a medical malpractice action where the parties \nadduce conflicting medical expert opinions.  Such conflicting expert opinions will raise credibility \nissues which can only be resolved by a jury.\"  Tarqui v.  United States, No. 14-cv-3523, 2017 WL \n4326542, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2017) (quoting DiGeronimo v.  Fuchs, 101 A.D.3d 933, 936, \n957 N.Y.S.2d 167, 171 (2d Dep't 2012)). \n1.  New York Correction Law§ 24 Does Not Immunize Dr. Lee \nDr. Lee argues that he is to be awarded immunity for this claim pursuant to New York \nCorrection Law § 24 (\"Section 24\").  Section 24 reads: \nNo civil action shall be brought in any court of the state, except by \nthe attorney general on behalf of the state, against any officer or \nemployee ofthe department, which for purposes of this section shall \ninclude members of the state board of parole, in his or her personal \ncapacity, for damages arising out of any act done or the failure to \nperform any act within the scope of the employment and in the \ndischarge of the duties by such officer or employee. \nN.Y. Correct. Law§ 24.  \"Courts in the Second Circuit have long held that Section 24 precludes a \nplaintiff from raising state law claims in federal comi against state employees in their personal \n66 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 67 of 73\ncapacities for actions arising within the scope of their employment.\"  Davis v.  McCready, 283 F. \nSupp. 3d 108, 123 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). \nThe  Parties  agree  that  the  statute  explicitly  refers  to  protections  only  for  DOCCS \nemployees,  not  OMH  employees.  See  Colon  v.  New  York  State  Dep 't  of Carr.  &  Cmty. \nSupervision, No. 15-cv-7432, 2017 WL 4157372, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2017).  Nevertheless, \nDr. Lee argues that \"courts have extended [the Section 24] protection to individuals employed by \nOMH working in a correctional setting.\"  (Lee Br. at 24.) \nThe cases upon which Dr. Lee relies do not support his argument.  First, in in Brown v. \nDep't ofCorr. Servs., No. 09-cv-949, 2011 WL 2182775 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2011), the Court \nfound that the \"defendants,\" who were a mix ofDOCCS and OMH employees, would be entitled \nto immunity under Section 24 without discussing (or recognizing) that the defendants included \nnon-DOCCs employees and that any extension of immunity would be extending the language of \nthe statute beyond its plain text.  !d.  at *9.  Likewise, in Povoski v. Artus, No. 11-cv-120, 2014 \nWL 1292219 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2014), the court found that Section 24 barred a case against \"the \ndefendants, who are all DOCCS employees,\" failing to acknowledge that one of the employees \nwas technically employed by OMH, not DOCCS.  !d.  at *2.  The Court never actually held that \nthe statute extended to  OMH employees.  Finally, in Hall v.  N Y.S.  Dep 't of Carr.  &  Cmty. \nSupervision, No. 12-CV-0377, 2015 WL 901010, (N.D.N.Y. March 3, 2015), the court dismissed \nthe plaintiffs claims because they were unaccompanied by surviving federal claims against these \nsame defendants and because the case raised a complex issue of state law, which was whether or \nnot Section 24 actually applied to non-DOCCS personnel, such as OMH employees.  !d. at *15 & \nn.30 (citing Brown, 2011 WL 2182775, at *9 and Povoski, 2014 WL 1292219, at *2.) \n67 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 68 of 73\nPlaintiff, by contrast, points persuasively to Reeder v. Hogan, No. 09-cv-0977, 2011 WL \n1484118  (N.D.N.Y.  Mar.  1, 2011), report and recommendation adopted, 2011  WL 1302915 \n(N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2011), where the Court examined Section 24 liability only for the DOCCS \nemployees,  and not the  OMH employees, because \"Section 24 does not shield non-DOCCS \npersonnel, including employees of the OMH, from liability.\"  Jd at* 13 & n.13; see also Abreu v. \nTravers, No. 15-cv-540, 2016 WL 6127510, at *17 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 20, 2016) (barring state tort \nlaw claims  against only DOCCs  defendants  based  on  Correction Law § 24  and  not  OMH \ndefendants, whose claims were barred on separate basis).  In another case, a district court did \nimmunize a provider of medical care; however, that provider was employed by DOCCS.  Vann v. \nSudranski, No.  16-cv-7367, 2017 WL  6515612,  at *1,  *7  (S.D.N.Y.  Dec.  20,  2017), appeal \ndismissed, No. 18-270,2018 WL 2064771 (2d Cir. Apr. 25, 2018). \nDr. Lee fmiher argues that there is no \"logical basis\" to deprive psychiatrists of the same \nprotections afforded to other medical professionals.  However, this is no reason to ignore the plain \nlanguage of the statute, which bars actions against \"any officer or employee of the department,\" \nN.Y. Correct. Law§ 24(1) (emphasis added). \nGiven the plain language of the statute and the fact that neither state courts nor the Second \nCircuit have clearly extended its protection to non-DOCCS employees, I cannot find that Section \n24 grants Dr. Lee immunity from liability. \nAccordingly, I tum to Dr. Lee's arguments regarding the substance of Plaintiffs state law \nclaim. \n2.  Plaintiff Raises a Genuine Issue of Fact that Dr. Lee Did Not Meet the \nStandard of Care \n\"It is well-established that New York courts will not impose liability for a mere error in \nprofessional medical judgment . . .  Rather, for liability to attach, a plaintiff must show that \"the \n68 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 69 of 73\nprovider's treatment decision was something less than a professional medical determination.\" \nCerbelli v.  City of New York,  600 F.  Supp.  2d 405, 414 (E.D.N.Y.  2009) (internal quotation \nomitted).  Courts recognize that \"[t]he line between the proper exercise of judgment and deviation \nfi·om accepted practice can be difficult to delineate, particularly in cases involving psychiatric \ntreatment.\" !d. \n\"When a psychiatrist chooses a course of treatment, within a range of medically accepted \nchoices,  for a patient after a proper examination and evaluation, the doctrine of professional \nmedical judgment will insulate such psychiatrist from liability.\"  0 'Sullivan v. Presbyterian Hasp. \nin City ofN. Y. at Columbia Presbyterian Med. Ctr., 217 A.D.2d 98, 100 (1995) (denying summary \njudgment on basis that reports by state agencies and plaintiffs expert concluded that psychiatrist's \ntreatment was inadequate).  By contrast, \"a decision that is without proper medical foundation, \nthat is, one which is not the product of a careful examination\" is not protected as an adequate \nprofessional judgment.  Gallen v. Cty. ofR  ockland, 13 7 A.D .3d 969, 970 (2d Dep't 20 16) (internal \nquotation  omitted).  Ultimately, \"Liability may not be imposed for honest errors in medical \njudgment but can and should ensue if that judgment was not based upon intelligent reasoning or \nupon adequate examination so that there has been a failure to exercise any professional judgment.\" \n0 'Sullivan, 217 A.D.2d at 103 (internal quotations omitted). \nDr. Lee argues that he provided appropriate psychiatric care to Taylor while he was an \ninpatient at the RCTP by reviewing Dr. Ertrachter's case notes on Taylor, discussing Taylor's case \nin daily treatment meetings, visiting Taylor in his cell despite Taylor's consistent refused to meet \nwith Dr. Lee for private interviews, continually monitoring Taylor's psychiatric condition, and \nmalcing the decision to return Taylor to the ICP after his February 25 evaluation with the approval \nof his supervisor.  (Lee Br. 18-19.) He contends that any error he made would have been an honest \n69 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 70 of 73\n\"error in medical judgment,\" for which he is not legally liable.  Fiederlein v. City ofN  Y Health \n& Hasps. Corp., 80 A.D.2d. 821, 822 (1st Dep't 1981). \nTo support his case, Dr. Lee provides an expert report from Dr. George D. Annas-whose \nresume is omitted from the record but whose qualifications Plaintiff does not appear to dispute. \n(HechtkopfDecl. Ex. 13 (\"Annas Rep.\").)  In his report, Dr. Annas concludes that Dr. Lee did not \ndepart from the acceptable standards of psychiatric care in his treatment of Taylor, because he \nevaluated and offered him medications, appropriately determined and documented that Taylor had \nimproved, and exercised reasonable clinical judgment by dischmging Taylor to the ICP after \ndiscussing the decision with this colleague.  (!d. at l 0.) \nHowever,  Plaintiff provides  her  own  expert,  Dr.  Colley,  who  opmes  that  Dr.  Lee \nconsistently made unreasoned medical decisions based on insufficient information, inadequate \nexamination, and flawed reasoning.  Dr.  Colley asserts that Dr.  Lee's decision breached the \nstandmd of care by not admitting Taylor for inpatient treatment, given that his medical record and \nsymptoms while in RCTP demonstrated that he was acutely psychotic and presented a risk to \nhimself and others.  (Colley Rep. at 12-13.) Dr. Colley specifically found that Dr. Lee's decisions \nhad \"no reasonable medical justification.\" (!d.)  \"[W]hen there are dueling experts, both of whom \nhave put forward opinions in contradiction with each other, and when those opinions are important \nto resolution of a material factual dispute, smnmary judgment may not be appropriate.\"  Melvin, \n2019 WL 1227903, at *14 (internal quotation omitted). \nDr. Colley's opinion is supported by the record.  Dr. Lee made his decision to keep Taylor \nin RCTP, rather than prepming the paperwork to initiate the transfer to CNYPC, as recommended \nby other members of the team, without seeing Taylor, despite reports that Taylor was hostile, \n70 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 71 of 73\nconfrontational, and not improving.  (Colley Rep. at 8 (citing -2972-94).)  It was not until seven \ndays later that Dr. Lee actually met with Taylor, one of two times he did so. \nIn addition, in this first meeting, Dr. Lee found Taylor's behavior to be consistent with \nother team members' reports, noting that Taylor was \"paranoid and delusional\" and \"angry.\" \n(Hechtkopf Dec!. Ex.  32 at -78-81.)  Then, at the second meeting, seven days later, Dr.  Lee \nconcluded that Plaintiffs behavior had changed. As has been discussed, Dr. Lee relied exclusively \non Taylor's own descriptions of his mood and hygiene behaviors to justify transferring him to the \nICP, despite the fact that notes from other members of the treatment team on the previous days \ndocumented that Taylor had been acutely psychotic. (Colley Rep. at 9.) These facts raise a genuine \nissue  whether  Dr.  Lee's  refeiTal  to  ICP  was  based  on  intelligent  reasoning  and  adequate \nexamination.  See Thomas v. Reddy, 86 A.D.3d 602,604 (2d Dep't 2011) (genuine issue of fact \nwhen  plaintiffs  expert  opined  that  psychiatrist  had  made  \"an  incomplete  and  superficial \nassessment of the decedent's mental condition prior to discharge\"). \nMoreover, it is not clear whether Dr. Lee made this decisions with adequate knowledge of \nTaylor's history,  as would be expected for  a \"careful examination.\"  Dr.  Lee argues that he \nexamined the case notes and other records, but he also told the Commission of Conection that he \nwas unaware of Taylor's history of COPM, and further, that if he had been aware of it, he probably \nwould have sent Taylor to CNYPC.  (NYSCOC Prelim Rep. at -56105.)  This is also sufficient to \nraise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the decision to send Taylor to the ICP was made \nwith the \"proper medical foundation.\"  Fotinas v.  Westchester Cty.  Med.  Ctr., 300 A.D.2d 437, \n439 (2002) (failure to obtain and review patient's hospital records sufficient to raise genuine issue \nof material fact). \n71 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 72 of 73\nHere, Dr. Lee's and Plaintiff's experts have \"reasonable differences,\" and each expert does \nnot \"merely assert[] his own ipse dixit.\"  Realtime Data, LLC v. Morgan Stanley, No. 11-cv-6696, \n2012 WL 5835303, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2012), aff'd, 554 F. App'x 923 (Fed. Cir. 2014). \nAccordingly, the Court must leave the credibility of the experts' opinions to the jury. See Melvin, \n2019 WL 1227903, at *14. \nIII.  Order to Show Cause Why Dr. Lee's Case Should Not Be Severed \nThe facts relevant to the lone remaining claim against Dr. Lee, for medical malpractice \nunder New York State law, are wholly different from the facts relevant to the remaining claims \nagainst the Officer and Supervisor Defendants. \nMoreover, the allegations against the Officer and Supervisor Defendants, and the brutal \ntestimony that will be adduced in support of those claims, have the potential to unduly prejudice a \njury against Dr. Lee-- who, per the ruling of this Court, bears no legal responsibility for the death \nofKarl Taylor. \nAccordingly, the Plaintiff is ordered to show cause, no later than September 10, 2019, why \nthe claim against Dr. Lee should not be severed and tried separately. As there is no federal interest \nin the remaining claim against Dr. Lee, Plaintiff must also show cause why the case against him \nshould not be dismissed without prejudice to being brought again in the New York State Supreme \nCourt within the six-month time period provided by N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 205(a). \n* * * * \nIn sum, the Court GRANTS Dr. Lee's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs Section \n1983 claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needs (Fifth Cause of Action). \nThe  Court DENIES  Dr.  Lee's motion for  summary judgment on Plaintiffs medical \nmalpractice claim (Sixth Cause of Action). \n72 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 338   Filed 08/21/19   Page 73 of 73\nPlaintiff is ordered to show cause, no later than September 10, 2019, why the claim against \nDr. Lee should not be severed and tried separately. \nCONCLUSION \nThis constitutes the written opinion and order of the Court. \nThe Clerk of Court is directed to close the motions at Docket Numbers 186, 188, 190, 192, \nand 194. \nDated: August 21,2019 \nChief Judge \nBY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL \n73 ",

LEE \nMcMahon, C.J.: \nIn an order dated August 21, 2019, this court (1) dismissed the federal claim asserted \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against defendant Dr. Lee, and (2) directed Plaintiffs to show cause why \nthe remaining claim against him (for medical malpractice) should not be severed for separate \ntrial and dismissed without prejudice so that this purely state law claim could be brought in the \nNew York State Supreme Court. (Docket #338) \nIn a letter dated September 10, 2019 (Docket #340), counsel for Plaintiff indicated that \nthe Plaintiff did not object to the severance and dismissal of the malpractice claim against Dr. \nLee without prejudice to its refiling in the New York State Supreme Court, but reserved the right \nto take an appeal from the dismissal of the analogous federal claim, which the court dismissed on \nthe ground that the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence that would satisfy her burden under \nthe subjective (as opposed to the objective) prong of Section 1983 liability for inadequate \nmedical care in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nAfter further consideration, I have concluded - especially given the amount of time and \neffort that this court has expended in dealing with the claims against Dr. Lee - that the better part \nof valor is to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claim, but to sever it and try \nit separately from the claims against the other Defendants. As noted in the August 21, 2019 \nopinion, the claim against Dr. Lee has almost no factual nexus to the claims against the other \nDefendants, and the probability of prejudice arising from the evidence that will be introduced \nagainst the other Defendants is simply overwhelming. In fact, I do not believe it would be \npossible for Dr. Lee to get a fair trial if the malpractice claim against him were tried with the \n\nCase 1:16-cv-05778-CM-BCM   Document 341   Filed 09/12/19   Page 2 of 2\nclaims against the other Defendants. Plaintiff obviously does not disagree, since she has \nconsented to severance. \nTherefore, the medical malpractice claim against Dr. Lee (Count Six) is severed for \nseparate trial, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). This ruling preserves Plaintiffs right to take an \nappeal from the dismissal of her federal claim (and from this court's ruling that Dr. Lee cannot \nbe held to have proximately caused the death of her brother); after the resolution of the \nmalpractice claim (assuming it cannot be settled), she will be able to take an appeal from any and \nall of this court's orders that aggrieve her. \nThe case against the Defendants other than Dr. Lee will be tri~d first. The court's deputy \nclerk will contact the parties in the next few weeks with a firm trial date (which will be in early \n2020) and a pre-trial schedule. \nThis constitutes the written opinion and order of the court. \nDate1: September 12, 2019 \nChief Judge \nBY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL ",

(Orseck, Kirk) (Entered:\n11/06/2018)\n11/07/2018 223  DISCOVERY ORDER. It is hereby ORDERED that the New Officer Defendants shall\ndo all of the following things on or before November 30, 2018 as further set forth in\nthis Order. It is FURTHER ORDERED that the Orseck Firm (which this Court finds to\nbe primarily responsible for the New Officer Defendants' discovery failures) shall pay\nplaintiff's reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in obtaining this\nOrder. As noted during the November 5 conference, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5) requires\nsuch an award when the Court grants a motion to compel discovery, unless one of the\nexceptions set forth in Rule 37(a)(5)(A)(i)−(iii) would make a fee award unjust. In this\ncase, none of the exceptions applies. Moreover, this Court previously ordered the New\nOfficer Defendants to respond to the Document Requests and produce all\nnon−privileged, responsive documents no later than August 31, 2018. Thus, a fee\naward is also required pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C). Plaintiff shall submit one or more\ndeclarations setting forth her reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining this Order no\nlater than November 9, 2018. In order to recover attorney fees, plaintiff must submit\ndetailed time records, properly authenticated, as well as admissible evidence\nconcerning each timekeeper's background and qualifications, sufficient to evaluate the\nreasonableness of their charges. The Officer Defendants may submit a response,\nlimited to the amount of the expenses to be awarded, no later than November 19, 2018.\nThere shall be no reply. The New Officer Defendants who are the only parties to this\naction still out of compliance with their discovery obligations have now missed two\nCourt−ordered deadlines to comply with Rule 34. Should they miss their third\ndeadline, they will not be given a fourth or a fifth. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) (if a\nparty fails to obey a discovery order, the court may issue \"further just orders\" up to and\nincluding the entry of a default judgment and/or contempt sanctions).

Dr. Alexander Bardey will\nnot be permitted to testify for the defense, for the reasons set out in the Plaintiff's\nBench Memorandum (which is not a bench memorandum − those are prepared by my\nlaw clerks − but rather, a brief in support of a motion to preclude his testimony, which\nis an outstanding in limine issue). Dr. Bardey has absolutely no basis to testify about\nwhat Plaintiff's decedent − whom he has never met − would have perceived on the\nmorning he died. Treating physician testimony and information from his prison\nmedical records, not the suppositions of a purported expert who has never seen Karl\nTaylor, will be sufficient to establish that he suffered from mental illness; defendants\nare free to ask the jury to devalue the life of a person with mental disabilities, and we\nwill see how kindly the jury takes to that argument. 2. I will rule on the objections to\nthe deposition testimony of Officer Hunt at some point before he takes the stand, but I\ncan tell you right now that most of these objections appear to be meritless. However,\ndues to Judge Batts' death and the preparations for her funeral, I cannot immerse\nmyself in Officer Hunt's testimony today or Monday. 3. Dr. Christensen will not be\npermitted to testify about his views on which witnesses are telling the truth, or whose\ntestimony should be believed when there is a dispute. Any effort to introduce such\ntestimony will be met with most vigorous intervention by the court. I will be listening\nwith extra care to Dr. Christensen.

(Court Reporter Kristen Carannante, Eve Giniger, Sam\nMauro). (mde) (Entered: 03/03/2020)\n02/19/2020 406  ORDER DISALLOWING WRIT OF PRODUCTION: Williams' deposition testimony\nwas read into the record yesterday morning − both the Plaintiffs designations and the\nSupervisor Defendants' cross−designations. The decision whether to issue a writ to\nbring in a prisoner to testify for trial is committed to the sound discretion of the court.\nIn an exercise of my discretion I allowed the deposition testimony to be read. As far as\nthe court is concerned, the application to writ Williams in is now moot. I note for the\nrecord that Williams does not appear on the witness list of the Corrections Officers; he\nwas scheduled to testify only on the Plaintiff's case. The court had ruled that he could\ntestify by deposition. Since counsel for the Corrections Officer Defendants did not see\nfit to alert chambers by phone or fax to their last−second application for a writ − in\neffect, for reconsideration of a ruling already made by the court − the court had no\nability to deal with the application last Friday afternoon, when it was made. By the\ntime I was aware of the application it was too late to writ the witness, as Plaintiff was\nscheduled to rest, and did rest that very day. The Officer Defendants suffer no\nprejudice as a result. Defendants never indicated an interest in calling Williams on\ntheir case (and indeed, their opportunity to list him as a witness on their case expired\nlong ago). The jury has now heard Williams' testimony − together with the Supervisor\nDefendants' cross−designations, which were read to the jury along with the deposition\n\ntestimony that was offered by Plaintiff. The Officer Defendants had plenty of\nopportunity to cross examine Williams during his examination, and to offer\ncross−designations as well. Writting Williams in now so that he can say again what the\njury has already heard would be purely duplicative. There is simply no reason to do it\n− it certainly would not \"substantially further the resolution of the case,\" which is one\nof the factors to be considered when deciding whether to grant or deny a writ to bring\nin a prisoner from a distant facility. 28 U.S.C. § 2241; In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv.\nSec. LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48401, at* 17 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014). And the\ndisruption to a trial that writing in Williams would have caused would have been ill\nadvised. The trial is running long; it will inevitably go into a third week. Plaintiffs\ncounsel made a good faith effort to get Williams into the district at a time when it was\nfeasible to do so. I do not fault Plaintiff for not seeking a new writ given the last\nminute, mid−trial nature of the information that Williams was back in custody. The\napplication for a writ is disallowed. The Clerk should remove Docket #402 from the\ncourt's list of open motions if it in fact appears thereon.

Keyser (16 Civ.\n5778)(CM) from Chief Judge McMahon dated 4/22/2020 re: Your letters of April 17.\nENDORSEMENT: I have reviewed your letters of April 17. There is, in my opinion,\nnothing for me to do. The case was settled in mid−trial. If an exact date, or even a time\nframe, for installing camera and microphones was essential to the settlement, it should\nhave been put on the record at that time − or we should have continued with the trial.\nBut everything I heard from both parties was at best aspirational. And the landscape\nhas altered dramatically since we parted in February. In view of the COVID crisis, and\nthe unprecedented stress (financial and otherwise) that it has put on correctional\nfacilities, I am simply not prepared to start negotiating the precise terms of bidding and\ninstallation that the parties were content for whatever reason, to leave vague at the time\nthe settlement was put on the record. Frankly, it is enough for me to know that this is\ngoing to happen in what I consider to be the foreseeable future. If it took three years to\nget a first rate camera and microphone system installed in Attica, and if Attica is the\ngold standard to be emulated at Sullivan it would be irrational for me to expect\ncameras and microphones of similar quality to be installed at Sullivan this year −\nespecially in the middle of a pandemic that we all expect will last well into next year. I\nwant the settlement agreement signed now. I want Ms. Ramsay−Nobles to get paid\nsoon. That is, and always has been, my highest priority. So get it done.
