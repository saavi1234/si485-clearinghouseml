Snyder, 323 Mich.App. 1 (2018)   \n916 N.W.2d 227 \n \n \n4  Defendants argue that the Court of Claims erred by relying “only” on hypothetical claims of putative class members \n  to find remaining issues of fact. It is true that a plaintiff who has not suffered an injury “cannot maintain the cause \nof action as an individual [and] is not qualified to represent [a] proposed class.” Doe v. Henry Ford Health Sys., 308 \nMich. App. 592, 604, 865 N.W.2d 915 (2014) (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, the issue of class \ncertification has not yet been raised, and in any case, defendants’ argument is not supported by the record. The \nCourt of Claims fully considered plaintiffs’ complaint and cited specific allegations by plaintiffs in this case before \nconcluding that questions of fact remained regarding plaintiffs’ ability to establish claims accruing later than the \ndate of the water switch. \n \n5  The Court of Claims did not err by recognizing that plaintiffs’ complaint alleges multiple harms resulting from distinct \n  tortious acts rather than a continuing harm resulting from the single tortious act of switching the water source. For \npurposes of accrual, each of plaintiffs’ individual causes of action must be considered separately. See Joliet v. \nPitoniak, 475 Mich. 30, 42, 715 N.W.2d 60 (2006). \n \n6  The Due Process Clause of the Michigan Constitution proscribes specific conduct and sets forth “a sufficient rule by \n  means of which the right which it grants may be enjoyed and protected” and is therefore self-executing. See Rusha, \n307 Mich. App. at 309, 859 N.W.2d 735 (quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Santiago v. New York State \nDep’t of Correctional Servs., 945 F.2d 25, 27 (C.A.2, 1991) (considering the coextensive clause of the United States \nConstitution and opining that the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment are self-executing in \nnature). Indeed, the presumption is that all provisions of the Constitution, unless drafted only to reflect mere \ngeneral principles, are self-executing. Detroit v. Oakland Circuit Judge, 237 Mich. 446, 450, 212 N.W. 207 (1927). \n \n7  Because we find no conflict between Rusha and the earlier Michigan Supreme Court cases cited by defendants here, \n  we decline defendants’ request to convene a conflict panel under MCR 7.215(J). \n \n8  The state defendants direct this Court’s attention to Bacon v. Michigan, unpublished opinion of the Court of Claims, \n  issued June 7, 2017 (Docket No. 16-000312-MM), in which the court suggested in a footnote that “defendants \nappear  correct  in  their  argument  that  the  statement  [from  Rusha  recognizing  a \nharsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception] is no longer a valid statement of the law as it pertains to statutes \nof limitations....” Id. at 8 n. 5. The Court of Claims correctly noted that in Curtin v. Dep’t of State Hwys, 127 Mich. \nApp. 160, 339 N.W.2d 7 (1983), the case cited by Rusha, the Court relied for this language on a now-abrogated \nopinion, Reich v. State Hwy Dep’t, 386 Mich. 617, 194 N.W.2d 700 (1972), abrogated by Rowland, 477 Mich. at \n206–207, 731 N.W.2d 41, for this language. Bacon, unpub op. at 8 n. 5. However, the Court of Claims incorrectly \nconcluded that because Curtin cited bad caselaw, the principle announced in Rusha is “no longer ... valid.” Id. Our \ncourts have recognized a harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception to the Legislature’s statute of limitations \nin various lines of cases that have not been overruled. Most recently, this Court affirmed the application of the \nexception in Genesee Co. Drain Comm’r v. Genesee Co., 309 Mich. App. 317, 332–333, 869 N.W.2d 635 (2015), with \nthe same language employed by the Court in Rusha. Rusha’s detailed discussion of the exception and its application \nto the statutory notice period remains valid despite the citation error. \nWe note that the Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal the Rusha decision. Rusha v. Dep’t of Corrections, \n36 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Snyder, 323 Mich.App. 1 (2018)   \n916 N.W.2d 227 \n \n498 Mich. 860, 865 N.W.2d 28 (2015). \n \n9  We flatly reject defendants’ contention that the burden on plaintiffs to file statutory notice within six months of the \n  water switch would have been “minimal” because plaintiffs only needed to know that a claim was possible, not that \na claim was fully supported, in order to provide timely notice. Defendants assume that plaintiffs had any knowledge \nof a possible claim during the period when, as plaintiffs allege, defendants were actively concealing information that \na claim had accrued and the notice period had begun. If plaintiffs’ allegations are proved true, filing notice within six \nmonths after the physical water switch would have placed more than a “minimal” burden on plaintiffs and their \ncounsel. Indeed, it would have required clairvoyant recognition of circumstances that the state was working to \nconvince the public did not actually exist. \n \n10  We reject defendants’ contention that to find a conflict between MCL 600.5855 and MCL 600.6431 one must \n  “wrongly assume[ ] that a notice of intent is the same as a legal complaint.” It is true that a claimant requires only \nminimal information to file a notice of intent and that the knowledge required distinguishes a notice of intent from a \nlegal complaint. However, a claimant who can satisfy the fraudulent-concealment exception will have no knowledge \nof the potential claim prior to the date he or she discovers or should reasonably be expected to discover it. It is \nsimply nonsensical to argue that a claimant may satisfy the notice requirement and still claim the benefit of the \nfraudulent-concealment tolling provision. \n \n11  We recognize that this Court, in two unpublished opinions, has declined to import the fraudulent-concealment \n  provision into MCL 600.6431. See Brewer v. Central Mich. Univ. Bd. of Trustees, unpublished per curiam opinion of \nthe Court of Appeals, issued November 21, 2013 (Docket No. 312374); Zelek v. State of Michigan, unpublished per \ncuriam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued October 16, 2012 (Docket No. 305191). These opinions are not \nbinding on this Court. MCR 7.215(C)(1). Additionally, in both Brewer and Zelek, the panel’s conclusion that the \nfraudulent-concealment exception did not apply to toll the statutory notice period was reached without recognition \nthat the Legislature specifically imported the fraudulent-concealment exception into the statute-of-limitations \nprovision of the CCA and without consideration of the practical conflict created when the fraudulent-concealment \nexception is applied to the statutory limitations period without also being applied to the statutory notice period. \nBecause both cases also involved strikingly dissimilar factual situations, we find them unpersuasive. \n \n12  In the lower court and in this Court on appeal, the city defendants argue that in their official capacities as \n  emergency managers, they were state officers subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims under MCL \n600.6419. However, state defendants argued in the lower court, and argue again on appeal, that the Court of Claims \nlacks subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against Earley and Ambrose because neither, in his official \ncapacity, was a state officer. Although neither the state defendants nor the city defendants raise the issue of \nstanding on appeal, we note that because an official-capacity suit against city defendants is, for practical purposes, a \nsuit against the state, Carlton v. Dep’t of Corrections, 215 Mich. App. 490, 500–501, 546 N.W.2d 671 (1996), the \nstate defendants have a significant interest in the outcome of plaintiffs’ case. \n \n13  2012 PA 436 created the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, MCL 141.1541 et seq. \n \n37 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Snyder, 323 Mich.App. 1 (2018)   \n916 N.W.2d 227 \n \n \n14  Neither the Court of Claims opinion in this case nor the quoted opinion is binding on this Court. However, we adopt \n  the court’s accurate summary of the law as stated. \n \n15  The state defendants argue that this Court should find persuasive a recent opinion, Gulla v. Snyder, unpublished \n  opinion of the Court of Claims, issued August 16, 2017 (Docket No. 16-000298-MZ), in which the Court of Claims \njudge concluded that emergency managers are not state officers for purposes of the CCA. This Court is not bound to \nfollow the opinion of the Court of Claims, which directly conflicts with the Court of Claims opinion at issue here. \nFurther, we note that the Court of Claims judge who considered the issue in Gulla had analyzed the issue according \nto the provisions of 2012 PA 436 rather than the jurisdictional provision of the CCA—an erroneous approach this \nCourt, as discussed in this opinion, specifically disavows. \n \n16  Defendants ask this Court to rely on an extrajurisdictional opinion, Coshow v. City of Escondido, 132 Cal. App. 4th \n  687, 709–710, 34 Cal.Rptr.3d 19 (2005), as support for the conclusion that plaintiffs’ right to bodily integrity is not \nimplicated in the context of public drinking water because the Due Process Clause does not guarantee a right to \ncontaminant-free  drinking  water.  While  the  California  court  noted  that  “the  right  to  bodily  integrity  is  not \ncoextensive with the right to be free from the introduction of an allegedly contaminated substance in the public \ndrinking water,” id. at 709, 34 Cal.Rptr.3d 19, it did not hold that the introduction of contaminated substances could \nnever form the basis of a claim for an injury to bodily integrity. Additionally, this Court finds Coshow unpersuasive as \nfactually dissimilar. The alleged “contaminant” in that case was fluoride, which is frequently introduced into water \nsystems. Coshow did not address whether substantive due-process protections might be implicated in the case of \nintentional introduction of known contaminants by governmental officials, and its reasoning is inapplicable here. \n \n17  MCL 141.1560(1) of the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act, MCL 141.1541 et seq., specifically grants emergency \n  managers immunity from liability as provided in MCL 691.1407, which grants complete immunity to “the elective or \nhighest appointive executive official of all levels of government ....” \n \n18  The state defendants instruct this Court to “see” MCL 691.1407(1), (2), and (5), provisions of the GTLA, but provide \n  nothing in the way of argument supporting their conclusory assertion that the GTLA “in no way contemplate[s] an \n‘official capacity’ claim.” “It is not sufficient for a party simply to announce a position ... and then leave it up to this \nCourt to discover and rationalize the basis for his claims, or unravel and elaborate for him his arguments ....” Wilson \nv. Taylor, 457 Mich. 232, 243, 577 N.W.2d 100 (1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In any case, the state \ndefendants’ argument that the GTLA precludes official-capacity suits is belied by an immediately adjacent provision \nof the GTLA, which specifically contemplates causes of action “against an officer, employee, or volunteer of a \ngovernmental agency for injuries to persons or property ....” MCL 691.1408(1). \n \n1  I note that the Court of Claims has reached a similar conclusion. See Gulla v. Snyder, unpublished opinion of the \n  Court of Claims, issued September 13, 2017 (Docket No. 16-000298-MZ), pp. 3–6. \n38 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

See Executive Order No. 2019-06. For consistency’s sake, in this case we refer to the \nDepartment as the MDEQ. We note that the Department of Human Services and the Department of Community \nHealth were combined to form DHHS during the pendency of this case. See Executive Order No. 2015-04. \n \n2  An emergency manager is an official appointed by the governor “to address a financial emergency” within a local \n  government. MCL 141.1549(1). Under our state’s law, emergency managers effectively replace locally elected \ngovernment officials and have broad powers to address financial emergencies: \nUpon appointment, an emergency manager shall act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the \noffice of chief administrative officer of the local government. The emergency manager shall have broad powers in \nreceivership to rectify the financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and \nthe local government’s capacity to provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to \nthe public health, safety, and welfare. Following appointment of an emergency manager and during the pendency \nof receivership, the governing body and the chief administrative officer of the local government shall not exercise \nany of the powers of those offices except as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager \nor as otherwise provided by this act and are subject to any conditions required by the emergency manager. [MCL \n141.1549(2).] \n \n3  We conclude that defendants have not produced sufficient evidence at this stage of litigation to contradict plaintiffs’ \n  allegations. \n \n4  Later in this opinion, we review defendants’ motions for summary disposition on plaintiffs’ procedural compliance \n  with statutory notice requirements under MCR 2.116(C)(4) and (7). \n37 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n \n5  We address plaintiffs’ claim of inverse condemnation first because it is the sole claim in which a majority exists to \n  expressly affirm the Court of Appeals. \n \n6  In the context of this unique case, the analysis is somewhat ill-fitting because we do not normally consider delivery \n  of water to the public as a “legalized nuisance.” See Richards, 233 U.S. at 554, 34 S.Ct. 654. \n \n7  This provision was amended after plaintiffs filed their suit. See 2020 PA 42 (effective March 3, 2020). We analyze the \n  version of the statute in effect when plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in 2016. \n \n8  While plaintiffs’ amended complaint states that their claim “accrued on October 16, 2016, when Defendants \n  re-connected the Flint water system to water supplied by the [DWSD],” elsewhere in their complaint plaintiffs \nacknowledge that defendants actually reconnected Flint to the DWSD on October 16, 2015. (Emphasis added.) In \nreviewing the complaint as a whole, we conclude that plaintiffs’ mention of that event occurring in 2016 was made \nin error. \n \n9  Justice MARKMAN asserts that plaintiffs do not allege injuries from in vitro exposure to Flint water. We disagree. \n  While plaintiffs do not mention in vitro exposure explicitly, they make allegations regarding personal injury from \nexposure to and ingestion of Flint water on behalf of themselves and other Flint water users. In our view, it is \nreasonable to assume that plaintiffs exist in this putative class who were exposed to Flint water in the womb, \nsuffered injury, and were born after April 2014. \n \n10  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges numerous harms resulting from separate tortious acts. These allegations are \n  different from a continuing harm resulting from a single tortious act. For purposes of determining the accrual date \nof plaintiffs’ claims, each of plaintiffs’ individual causes of action must be considered separately. See Joliet v. \nPitoniak, 475 Mich. 30, 42, 715 N.W.2d 60 (2006). \nMoreover, we disagree with Justice MARKMAN’s characterization of Hart v. Detroit, 416 Mich. 488, 331 N.W.2d 438 \n(1982),  as  no  longer  good  law.  Justice  MARKMAN  notes  that  plaintiffs  rely  on  Hart  to  argue  that  their \ninverse-condemnation  claim  was  timely  filed.  In  Hart,  this  Court  recognized  that  with  regard  to  an \ninverse-condemnation claim in which plaintiffs allege that their property was taken via a continuous wrong, the \nstatute of limitations does not begin to run “until the consequences of the condemnor’s actions have stabilized.” Id. \nat 504, 331 N.W.2d 438. Justice MARKMAN argues that “Hart is no longer good law because this Court in Garg v. \nMacomb Co. Community Mental Health Servs., 472 Mich. 263, 696 N.W.2d 646 (2005) [(analyzing a discrimination \nclaim)], later abolished the ‘continuing violations’ doctrine because it was inconsistent with the language of the \nstatute of limitations.” In our view, Justice MARKMAN misapplies the continuing-violations doctrine to plaintiffs’ \nclaim of inverse condemnation. The continuing-violations doctrine is often applied by the federal courts in the \ncontext of Title VII, civil-rights actions, and other discrimination claims. See, e.g., Hunt v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1263, 1266 \n(C.A. 10, 1994); Lockridge v. Univ. of Maine Sys., 597 F.3d 464, 474 (C.A. 1, 2010); Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., 224 \nF.3d  806,  829  (C.A.  6,  2000).  In  contrast,  the  stabilization  doctrine  was  developed  in  the  context  of \n38 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \ninverse-condemnation claims. See, e.g., United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 749, 67 S. Ct. 1382, 91 L. Ed. 1789 \n(1947); Hart, 416 Mich. at 504, 331 N.W.2d 438; Etchegoinberry v. United States, 114 Fed. Cl. 437, 475 (2013); Banks \nv. United States, 741 F.3d 1268, 1281 (C.A. Fed., 2014). We have found no instance in which our Court has applied \nthe continuing-violations doctrine to a claim of inverse condemnation. We also note that this Court’s decision in \nGarg never mentioned Hart, nor did it abolish the stabilization doctrine. We believe that Hart remains good law \nbecause this Court has never overruled it. \n \n11  Plaintiffs argue that the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences doctrine and the fraudulent-concealment doctrine \n  also support their claims that satisfactory notice was filed. Because we believe that there still remain questions of \nfact about when plaintiffs’ harms accrued, we see no need to look to these doctrines at this point in the \nproceedings. Once discovery is completed, the applicability of these doctrines may be reconsidered as necessary. \n \n12  The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend \n  to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, \nor by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const., Am. XI. \n \n13  We conclude that Justice VIVIANO’s arguments to the contrary are premature. Plaintiffs should be permitted to \n  develop  their  factual  allegations  through  discovery  before  it  is  determined  whether  monetary  damages  are \navailable. \n \n14  We note that plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against several of the named defendants in a related federal-court \n  action. Plaintiffs seek an order to remediate the harm caused by defendants’ conduct, including repairs to property \nand the establishment of a medical-monitoring fund. Plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages. Although plaintiffs may seek alternative remedies in federal court, that fact does not affect our decision \nregarding the availability of alternative remedies. The availability of these remedies remains to be seen. If those \nremedies materialize, they, of course, may affect any future consideration of appropriate remedies in this action. \n \n1  In Rowland, a personal-injury case against a municipality in which the plaintiff fell and was injured while crossing a \n  street, this Court ruled that a suit may be dismissed for failure to comply with a statutory notice requirement even if \nthe defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of notice. The Court explained, “[I]nasmuch as the Legislature is not \neven required to provide a defective highway exception to governmental immunity, it surely has the authority to \nallow such suits only upon compliance with rational notice limits.” Rowland, 477 Mich. at 212, 731 N.W.2d 41. \n \n2  Trentadue, 479 Mich. at 386-387, 738 N.W.2d 664 (considering the statute of limitations for a wrongful-death \n  action). \n \n3  In McCahan, 492 Mich. at 732-733, 822 N.W.2d 747, the Court determined that the notice requirement of MCL \n39 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n  600.6431 is a “condition precedent to sue the state,” McCahan v. Brennan, 291 Mich. App. 430, 433, 804 N.W.2d \n906 (2011), aff’d 492 Mich. 730, 822 N.W.2d 747 (2012), and that a claimant’s failure to strictly comply warrants \ndismissal of the claim, McCahan, 492 Mich. at 746-747, 822 N.W.2d 747. \n \n4  I note that the RJA has no statutory notice requirement. See MCL 600.101 et seq. \n   \n1  I respectfully disagree with Justice VIVIANO’s framing of the right in question as the right “not to be exposed to \n  contaminated  water.”  Plaintiffs’  substantive  due-process  claim  is  based  on  the  alleged  violation  of  their \nconstitutional right to bodily integrity. This well-established right is among the most fundamental. “Because our \nnotions of liberty are inextricably entwined with our idea of physical freedom and self-determination, the Court has \noften deemed state incursions into the body repugnant to the interests protected by the Due Process Clause.” \nCruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 287, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990) (O’Connor, J., \nconcurring). See also Union Pac. R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S. Ct. 1000, 35 L. Ed. 734 (1891) (“No right is \nheld more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the \npossession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and \nunquestionable authority of law.”); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 772, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966) \n(“The integrity of an individual’s person is a cherished value of our society.”). \nJustice VIVIANO relies on Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997), \nto define the right at such a level of specificity. But the viability of Glucksberg’s specificity prong is in serious \nquestion. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court acknowledged Glucksberg’s call for a “careful description” of the \nasserted right but concluded that “while that approach may have been appropriate for the asserted right there \ninvolved (physician-assisted suicide), it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other \nfundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 671, 135 S. Ct. 2584, \n2602, 192 L. Ed. 2d 609 (2015). Dissenting Chief Justice Roberts asserted that “the majority’s position requires it to \neffectively overrule Glucksberg, the leading modern case setting the bounds of substantive due process.” Id. at 702, \n135 S. Ct. at 2621 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). See also Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 566, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. \n2d 508 (2003) (rejecting the framing of the issue presented, as described in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190, \n106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986), as “ ‘whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon \nhomosexuals to engage in sodomy,’ ” because it “fail[s] to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake”); Yoshino, A \nNew Birth of Freedom?: Obergefell v. Hodges, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 147, 154-159 (2015) (describing the development of \nGlucksberg’s “careful description” requirement and the “battle royale over how abstractly an alleged liberty interest \ncould be defined”); Tribe, Equal Dignity: Speaking Its Name, 129 Harv. L. Rev. F. 16, 17 (2015) (“[T]here is no doubt \nthat Glucksberg’s cramped methodology cast a significant pall that Justice Kennedy’s Lawrence v. Texas opinion in \n2003 only partially swept away ... and that his Obergefell opinion in 2015 finally displaced decisively.”) (citation \nomitted). The alleged exposure to contaminated water is how the plaintiffs’ fundamental right to bodily integrity \nwas violated; indeed, this is precisely what the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint. In the same way that the \nObergefell Court defined the fundamental right as “the right to marry” rather than the “right to same-sex marriage,” \nObergefell, 576 U.S. at 671, 135 S. Ct. at 2602, the fundamental right asserted here is the right to bodily integrity, \nnot the right to contaminant-free water. \n \n2  Restatement Torts, 2d, § 874A provides: “When a legislative provision protects a class of persons by proscribing or \n  requiring certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the court may, if it determines that \nthe remedy is appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of \nthe provision, accord to an injured member of the class a right of action, using a suitable existing tort action or a \n40 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nnew cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.” This section makes clear that the term “legislative \nprovision” includes a constitutional provision. See id. at comment a. \n \n3  Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 authorizes suits for monetary damages for federal civil-rights violations \n  committed under color of state law. \n \n4  “Examples of the influence of federalism include: the existence and scope of absolute and qualified individual \n  immunities; the ‘official policy or custom’ requirement for local government liability; and the various ‘procedural’ \ndefenses the Court has applied to section 1983, such as statutes of limitations, preclusion and abstention.” Nahmod, \nState Constitutional Torts: DeShaney, Reverse-Federalism and Community, 26 Rutgers L. J. 949, 950 (1995) (citations \nomitted). See also Friesen, Recovering Damages for State Bills of Rights Claims, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1269, 1275 (1985) \n(arguing that state-court judges “should not suffer from the conservatizing influences, which affect federal courts, of \nthe need to make nationally uniform rules, which often bind the officials of another sovereign”). \n \n5  For what it is worth, I do not share Justice VIVIANO’s critique of Bivens’s foundation. The Supreme Court has a long \n  history of permitting suits for damages against rogue federal officers. See Fallon, Bidding Farewell to Constitutional \nTorts, 107 Calif. L. Rev. 933, 941-946 (2019); see, e.g., Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 2 L. \nEd. 208 (1804); Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 2 L. Ed. 243 (1804) (affirming tort damages against \ngovernment officers for ultra vires seizures of vessels); cf. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327, \n135 S. Ct. 1378, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2015) (noting the “long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing \nback to England”). \nNor do I share Justice VIVIANO’s understanding that “[t]he United States Supreme Court’s abandonment of implied \ncauses of action in the statutory context has cast doubt on Bivens ....” The difference between statutory-based \nclaims and constitutional-tort claims is significant. It makes sense to defer to the Legislature to authorize a cause of \naction arising under a statute, which exists only by the Legislature’s creation, but, as discussed below, I do not \nbelieve that the Legislature has exclusive jurisdiction over crafting remedies for violations of the Constitution, which \nwas created by the people, exists independently of the Legislature, and reigns supreme in our system. \n \n1  In other words, I join Parts II(A), (B)(1), (B)(2), and (B)(3) of the lead opinion. Because I believe more factual \n  development is needed to determine when plaintiffs’ inverse-condemnation claim accrued, I would not yet reach a \nconclusion as to whether the fraudulent-concealment exception or the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences \nexception might apply if the claim is later determined to be untimely. \n \n2  Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17. \n \n \n3  Cummins v. Robinson Twp., 283 Mich. App. 677, 700-701, 770 N.W.2d 421 (2009). The Due Process Clause of the \n  federal Constitution states, “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities \nof citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \n41 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const., Am. XIV \n(emphasis added). \nWe have held out the possibility that our Due Process Clause grants greater protection than the federal clause. AFT \nMich. v. Michigan, 497 Mich. 197, 245 n. 28, 866 N.W.2d 782 (2015) (“The portions of Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 and \nU.S. Const., Am. XIV addressing due process are worded differently, so they may grant disparate levels of protection. \nThis Court has, on occasion, applied distinctive due process protections under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 broader than \nhave been afforded under U.S. Const., Am. XIV.”). In general, however, “[w]e have often spoken indistinguishably \nabout the standards governing our respective constitutions and been vague as to which constitution we were \ninterpreting.” Delta Charter Twp. v. Dinolfo, 419 Mich. 253, 276 n. 7, 351 N.W.2d 831 (1984), citing Robinson Twp. v. \nKnoll, 410 Mich. 293, 302 N.W.2d 146 (1981); O’Donnell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Because plaintiffs do not argue that our \nstate’s Constitution provides greater protection in this instance, and because the particular language at issue is \nidentical, it is unnecessary for me to address whether Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 offers more protection than its \nfederal counterpart. \n \n4  Bonner v.

However, because I find that plaintiffs have not \nadequately alleged a violation of due process, it is unnecessary for me to address the merits (or lack thereof) of \nsubstantive due process generally. \n \n7  As Lillard v. Shelby Co. Bd. of Ed., 76 F.3d 716, 724 (C.A. 6, 1996), explained: \n \nThis court has recognized two categories of substantive due process rights: \nThe first type includes claims asserting denial of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or \nby federal statute other than procedural claims under “the Fourteenth Amendment simpliciter.” ... \nThe other type of claim is directed at official acts which may not occur regardless of the procedural safeguards \naccompanying  them.  The  test  for  substantive  due  process  claims  of  this  type  is  whether  the  conduct \ncomplained of “shocks the conscience” of the court. \nMertik v. Blalock, 983 F.2d 1353, 1367–68 (6th Cir. 1993). The first type of claim exists, for example, when a \nplaintiff alleges that his right to be free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment was violated. \nSee Wilson v. Beebe, 770 F.2d 578, 585–86 (6th Cir. 1985) (en banc); see also Braley v. City of Pontiac, 906 F.2d \n220, 225 (6th Cir. 1990). The latter type of claim, however, does not “require[ ] a claim that some specific \nguarantee of the Constitution apart from the due process clause be violated .... This is a substantive due process \nright akin to the ‘fundamental fairness’ concept of procedural due process.” Wilson, 770 F.2d at 586. \nCompare Lillard, 76 F.3d 716, with 1 Bodensteiner & Levinson, State & Local Government Civil Rights Liability \n(November 2019 update), § 1:16 (“There are three aspects to substantive due process. First, it protects the \nenumerated rights (Bill of Rights) from state interference. Second, it provides the source for protecting certain, \nunenumerated, nontextual, yet significant, rights from interference by the legislative branch of government. Third, it \nprohibits arbitrary abuses of power by government officials.”). I point out that it is not entirely clear whether \nplaintiffs must show both the deprivation of a constitutional right and conscience-shocking behavior, or whether \nthey must only show one or the other. Guertin v. Michigan, 912 F.3d 907, 946 (C.A. 6, 2019) (McKeague, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“At times we have treated these two elements (deprivation of a \nconstitutional right and conscience-shocking behavior) as separate methods of stating a substantive-due-process \nclaim. Range v. Douglas, 763 F.3d 573, 588 (6th Cir. 2014). At other times we have concluded they are both \nrequired. See Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., Inc. v. Kentucky, 641 F.3d 685, 688 (6th Cir. 2011).”). Because I \nconclude that plaintiffs have shown neither, it is not necessary to decide whether only one would be sufficient. \n \n8  It is not entirely clear from plaintiffs’ amended complaint which type of claim they assert. \n \n \n9  Sierb, 456 Mich. at 529, 581 N.W.2d 219, quoting Albright, 510 U.S. at 272, 114 S.Ct. 807. \n \n43 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990), had grounded its decision in \n“the common-law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition protecting the decision to \nrefuse unwanted medical treatment,” not “from abstract concepts of personal autonomy”). \n \n13  See Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722, 117 S.Ct. 2258 (“[T]he development of this Court’s substantive-due-process \n  jurisprudence ... has been a process whereby the outlines of the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment—never fully clarified, to be sure, and perhaps not capable of being fully clarified—have at least been \ncarefully refined by concrete examples involving fundamental rights found to be deeply rooted in our legal \ntradition.”) (citation omitted). For example, in Glucksberg the Court clarified that the right at issue was not “a right \nto die” or “a liberty to choose how to die” but more specifically “a right to commit suicide which itself includes a \nright to assistance in doing so.” Id. at 722-723, 117 S. Ct. 2258 (quotation marks and citations omitted). \nChief Justice MCCORMACK contends that “the viability of Glucksberg’s specificity prong is in serious question.” But \nGlucksberg has not been overruled.

As Justice Scalia explained \n  in Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 121-123, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989): \nWithout that core textual meaning as a limitation, defining the scope of the Due Process Clause “has at times \nbeen a treacherous field for this Court,” giving “reason for concern lest the only limits to ... judicial intervention \nbecome the predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court.” Moore v. East \nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502[, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531] (1977). The need for restraint has been cogently \nexpressed by Justice WHITE: \nThat the Court has ample precedent for the creation of new constitutional rights should not lead it to repeat \nthe process at will. The Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy \nwhen it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even \nthe design of the Constitution. Realizing that the present construction of the Due Process Clause represents a \nmajor judicial gloss on its terms, as well as on the anticipation of the Framers ..., the Court should be extremely \nreluctant to breathe still further substantive content into the Due Process Clause so as to strike down \nlegislation adopted by a State or city to promote its welfare. Whenever the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably \npre-empts for itself another part of the governance of the country without express constitutional authority. \n44 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

This study did conclude that there would “need to be some modifications to existing \nfacilities, operating agreements, and permits” if the Flint River was to be used for the water supply. Id. at 12.

Id. In another section, \nthe study stated: “Preliminary analysis indicates that water from the river can be treated to meet current \nregulations; however, additional treatment will be required than for [sic] Lake Huron water. This results in higher \noperating costs than the alternative of a new Lake Huron supply.” Id. at 7. But I see nothing in this particular study \nthat clearly indicates that using the Flint River as a water source would risk a public health crisis. \n \n37  Defendants moved for summary disposition regarding plaintiffs’ claim of a substantive due-process right to bodily \n  integrity under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (8). For motions under MCR 2.116(C)(7), “[t]he contents of the complaint are \naccepted as true unless contradicted by documentation submitted by the movant.” Maiden v. Rozwood, 461 Mich. \n109, 119, 597 N.W.2d 817 (1999). Motions under MCR 2.116(C)(8) “test[ ] the legal sufficiency of the complaint. All \nwell-pleaded factual allegations are accepted as true and construed in a light most favorable to the nonmovant.” Id. \nCourts decide motions under MCR 2.116(C)(8) by considering only the pleadings. Id. at 119-120, 597 N.W.2d 817. A \nmotion “may be granted only where the claims alleged are ‘so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no \nfactual development could possibly justify recovery.’ ” Id. at 119, 597 N.W.2d 817, quoting Wade v. Dep’t of \nCorrections, 439 Mich. 158, 163, 483 N.W.2d 26 (1992). \n \n38  For example, the high incidence of Legionnaires’ disease was, at first, only noted as having a “possible connection to \n  [the] water supply.” There was also disagreement among experts regarding the quality of the water. After Agent \nMiguel Del Toral of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepared a memorandum stating that there were \nhigh levels of lead, EPA Region 5 Director Dr. Susan Hedman told Mayor Dwayne Walling that “what he was given \nwas a preliminary draft [of the memorandum] and that it would be premature to draw any conclusions based on \nthat draft.” Specifically regarding studies of blood lead levels in children, plaintiffs recount that though the Michigan \nDepartment of Health and Human Services had data showing elevated blood lead levels, others at the Childhood \nLead Poisoning Prevention Program disputed that the water was the cause or that there even were elevated blood \nlead levels. In sum, despite the various signs that the water posed health risks, plaintiffs cite the Task Force Report, \nwhich recounts that there were “repeated assurances that the water was safe.” \n \n49 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

When considering whether to add language guaranteeing that no “ ‘person be held to answer for a criminal \noffence unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury,’ ” Mr. S. Clark referred to the Due Process Clause, \nnoting that the language came from the Magna Carta. Report of the Proceedings and Debates in the Convention to \nRevise the Constitution of the State of Michigan, 1850 (Lansing: R. W. Ingals, 1850), pp. 192-195. But this, of course, \ndoes not favor creating or not creating a damages remedy. \n \n58  Sierb, 456 Mich. at 528, 581 N.W.2d 219, quoting Collins, 503 U.S. at 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061. \n \n \n59  Though I point out that in In re Flint Water Cases, 960 F.3d 303, 325 (C.A. 6, 2020), a case involving some of the \n  same plaintiffs here, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recently denied several defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss, including those of Darnell Earley and Jerry Ambrose, id. at 325, and former Governor Snyder, id. \nat 332. The Sixth Circuit also determined that Flint could not claim Eleventh Amendment immunity. However, the \ncase is still at a relatively early stage, and the Sixth Circuit did not rule out that certain defendants might be immune \nin the future. See, e.g., id. at 324 (“Some judges of this court have even noted that, because the facts at this stage \nare yet undeveloped, ‘it is generally inappropriate for a district court to grant a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the \nbasis of qualified immunity. Although an officer’s entitlement to qualified immunity is a threshold question to be \nresolved at the earliest possible point, that point is usually summary judgment and not dismissal under Rule 12.’ ”), \nquoting Wesley v. Campbell, 779 F.3d 421, 433-434 (C.A. 6, 2015). Thus, it appears that plaintiffs’ federal case might \nprovide an alternative remedy, which would weigh against the creation of a cause of action for damages in this case. \n \n60  See Boler v. Earley, 865 F.3d 391, 408-409 (C.A. 6, 2017) (noting that the SDWA protections are not “ ‘wholly \n  congruent’ ” with the federal constitutional protections) (citation omitted). \n \n61  The Court of Appeals noted “ ‘the degree of outrageousness of the state actors’ conduct as alleged by plaintiffs ....’ ” \n  Mays, 323 Mich. App. at 72, 916 N.W.2d 227 (citation omitted). However, as stated above, I do not believe that \nJustice BOYLE opined that courts should take into account other factors weighing in favor of inferring a damages \n52 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nremedy. I recognize that Justice BOYLE’s multifactor test is not binding. But even still, I do not believe that, for \npurposes  of  determining  whether  to  infer  a  damages  remedy,  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  the  degree  of \noutrageousness of the conduct plaintiffs allege. None of the other factors relates to the particular facts at issue; \ninstead, the focus of the analysis is on the nature of the constitutional right at issue, whether it was clearly violated, \nwhether there is any historical support for a damages remedy, and whether another remedy is available. Focusing \non the egregiousness of the facts alleged would change the nature of the inquiry and lead to arbitrary outcomes. \n \n62  Smith, 428 Mich. at 544, 410 N.W.2d 749. \n \n \n63  Bivens, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619. \n \n \n64  Smith, 122 Mich. App. 340, 333 N.W.2d 50. \n \n \n65  The plaintiff in Will had failed to preserve his claim, and the Court voted to reverse that portion of the Court of \n  Appeals judgment that remanded Will to the Court of Claims for further proceedings regarding the liability of the \nDirector of the State Police. Smith, 428 Mich. at 544-545, 410 N.W.2d 749. Chief Justice MCCORMACK asserts that \n“it is not at all clear that the relevant holding of Smith is at all or exclusively based on Bivens.” Smith is certainly an \nodd decision, since the Court’s opinion was issued as a memorandum opinion consisting only of the issues \npresented, the Court’s holdings, and its disposition of the case. Standing alone, that opinion would appear to lack \nany substantive legal effect because it violates Const. 1963, art. 6, § 6, which states that “[d]ecisions of the supreme \ncourt ... shall be in writing and shall contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision ....” See \nDeFrain v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 491 Mich. 359, 369, 817 N.W.2d 504 (2012). However, I think it is clearly \napparent from the separate opinions in Smith that the Court’s holding was based on Bivens. Justice BRICKLEY’s \nopinion, which was joined by Justice RILEY, discussed Bivens and its progeny at length, Smith, 428 Mich. at 613-626, \n410 N.W.2d 749 (opinion by BRICKLEY, J.), though it declined to recognize a damages remedy in either of the cases \nbefore the Court, id. at 626, 410 N.W.2d 749. Justice BOYLE’s partial concurrence, which was joined by Justice \nCAVANAGH, also very clearly relied on Bivens to support the conclusion that damages were possible and that Smith \nshould be remanded to determine whether such a remedy was proper. Id. at 645-648, 410 N.W.2d 749 (BOYLE, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, four of the six justices explicitly considered Bivens. Though \nJustice ARCHER and Justice LEVIN wrote separate opinions, they concurred in Justice BOYLE’s remand, id. at 652, \n410 N.W.2d 749 (opinion by LEVIN, J.); id. at 658, 410 N.W.2d 749 (ARCHER, J., dissenting), and, presumably, her \ndiscussion of Bivens since the opinion did not provide any other rationale in support of Justice BOYLE’s remand. \n \n66  Bivens, 403 U.S. at 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999. \n \n \n67  Id. \n   \n68  Id. \n   \n53 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

Chief Justice MCCORMACK states that “[t]he Supreme Court has a long history of \n  permitting suits for damages against rogue federal officers.” However, the cases she cites are not examples of courts \nawarding damages for constitutional violations but rather involve common-law tort and statutory violations. Fallon, \nBidding Farewell to Constitutional Torts, 107 Calif. L. Rev. 933, 943 (2019) (discussing Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 \nCranch) 170, 2 L. Ed. 243 (1804), and noting that “Barreme sought to recover by bringing a common law trespass \naction”); Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 64-65, 2 L.

If there was no reasonable ground \nof suspicion that she was a vessel trading contrary to that law, the commander of a United States ship of war, who \nseizes and sends her in, is liable for damages.”). Indeed, it is undisputed that Bivens broke new ground in inferring \ncauses of action for damages for constitutional violations. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. \n939 (1946) (noting that the issue “whether federal courts can grant money recovery for damages said to have been \nsuffered as a result of federal officers violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments ... has never been specifically \ndecided by this Court”).

Although Congress has created such a \nfederal cause of action against state officials acting under color of state law [in 42 USC 1983], it has never created \nsuch a cause of action against federal officials. If it wanted to do so, Congress could, of course, create a remedy \nagainst federal officials who violate the Fourth Amendment in the performance of their duties. But the point of this \ncase and the fatal weakness in the Court’s judgment is that neither Congress nor the State of New York has enacted \nlegislation creating such a right of action. For us to do so is, in my judgment, an exercise of power that the \nConstitution does not give us.”); id. at 430, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (referring to the majority opinion \nas “judicial legislation”).

F. Farnell Co. v. Monahan, 377 Mich. 552, 555-556, 141 N.W.2d 58 (1966), this Court noted the “ ‘general rule’ ” \nthat there would be a private cause of action under a statute: “ ‘where a statute imposes upon any person a specific \nduty for the protection or benefit of others, if he neglects or refuses to perform such duty, he is liable for any injury \nor detriment caused by such neglect or refusal, if such injury or hurt is of the kind which the statute was intended to \nprevent; nor is it necessary in such a case as this to declare upon or refer to the statute.’ ” (Citation omitted.) In \nPompey v. Gen. Motors Corp., 385 Mich. 537, 552, 189 N.W.2d 243 (1971), though the Court recognized “[t]he \ngeneral rule ... that where a new right is created or a new duty is imposed by statute, the remedy provided for \nenforcement of that right by the statute for its violation and nonperformance is exclusive,” the Court noted “two \nimportant qualifications to this rule of statutory construction: In the absence of a pre-existent common law remedy, \nthe statutory remedy is not deemed exclusive if such remedy is plainly inadequate, or unless a contrary intent \nclearly appears,” id. at 552 n. 14, 189 N.W.2d 243 (citations omitted). Later, the Court set forth a test to determine \nwhether to create a new cause of action. Gardner v. Wood, 429 Mich. 290, 302, 414 N.W.2d 706 (1987) (“In the \ninterest of public policy, this Court has created a new cause of action to redress the violation of a penal statute and, \npursuant to the following test, incorporated the statute as the specific standard of care: ‘The court may adopt as the \nstandard conduct of a reasonable man the requirements of a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation \nwhose purpose is found to be exclusively or in part (a) to protect a class of persons which includes the one whose \ninterest is invaded, and (b) to protect the particular interest which is invaded, and (c) to protect that interest against \nthe kind of harm which has resulted, and (d) to protect that interest against the particular hazard from which the \nharm results.’ ”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nHowever, the Court later disavowed Pompey’s two qualifications to the general rule that when a statute creates a \nnew duty or a new right, the statutory remedy is exclusive. Lash v. Traverse City, 479 Mich. 180, 192 n. 19, 735 \nN.W.2d 628 (2007) (“We need not address the dictum in the Pompey footnote that some quantum of additional \nremedy is permitted where a statutory remedy is ‘plainly inadequate.’ We do note that this principle, which has \nnever since been cited in any majority opinion of this Court, appears inconsistent with subsequent caselaw.”). \nFinally, though Lash, id. at 192-193, 735 N.W.2d 628, did cite the test from Gardner, 429 Mich. at 302, 414 N.W.2d \n706, to determine if the Court may create a new cause of action, only a week before Lash was issued, the Court \nissued South Haven v. Van Buren Co. Bd. of Comm’rs, 478 Mich. 518, 734 N.W.2d 533 (2007). In that case, the Court \nreaffirmed the more recent trend in our cases, which emphasizes that it is the Legislature’s intent and the statutory \nlanguage that control whether a party may pursue a particular remedy: \n“It is well settled that when a statute provides a remedy, a court should enforce the legislative remedy rather \nthan one the court prefers.” To determine whether a plaintiff may bring a cause of action for a specific remedy, \nthis Court “must determine whether [the Legislature] intended to create such a cause of action.” “ ‘ “Where a \nstatute gives new rights and prescribes new remedies, such remedies must be strictly pursued; and a party \nseeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy conferred thereby and to that only.” ’ ” Accordingly, \nthis Court has previously declined to establish a remedy that the Legislature has not provided.

We decide the meaning of the Michigan \nConstitution and do not take our cue from any other court, including the highest Court in the land.” Of course, I \nagree that we are separate sovereigns and that we alone are tasked with interpreting our Constitution. However, it \nwould hardly be a mark of our independence to continue to follow Bivens, which, although it has been cabined, \nremains the governing federal precedent. \n \n91  In Jo-Dan, Ltd. v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued July 14, 2000 \n  (Docket No. 201406), p. 16, the Court of Appeals held, “If the finder of fact in the trial court determines that a \nplaintiff sustained his, her, or its burden of proving that the defendant violated the fair and just treatment clause, \nthe full panoply of remedies are available. Those remedies include, but are not limited to, monetary damages when \n‘appropriate’ according to Smith ....” But there, the Detroit Board of Education did not argue that monetary \ndamages were inappropriate. Id. at 16 n. 13. And, of course, the decision is unpublished, and therefore it is not \nprecedentially binding. MCR 7.215(C)(1). \nThe Court of Appeals has repeatedly noted Smith’s holding that there may be an implied cause of action for \ndamages for state constitutional violations. In most cases, findings that there was no constitutional violation, or that \nthe violation did not occur as a result of a custom or policy, have precluded the Court of Appeals from recognizing \nsuch a cause of action. See, e.g., Champion’s Auto Ferry, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 231 Mich. App. 699, 717, 588 \nN.W.2d 153 (1998) (citing Smith in support of the conclusion that “[i]f and when [the plaintiff] can establish that its \nauthorized rates are in fact confiscatory, it may sue in the Court of Claims for just compensation on a theory of \nconstitutional tort,” but also stating that the plaintiff “ha[d] failed to establish that any ... taking has occurred”); see \nalso Marlin v. Detroit, 177 Mich. App. 108, 441 N.W.2d 45 (1989); Johnson v. Wayne Co., 213 Mich. App. 143, 540 \nN.W.2d 66 (1995); Carlton v. Dep’t of Corrections, 215 Mich. App. 490, 546 N.W.2d 671 (1996); Jones v. Powell, 227 \nMich. App. 662, 577 N.W.2d 130 (1998), aff’d 462 Mich. 329, 612 N.W.2d 423 (2000); Reid v. Michigan, 239 Mich. \nApp. 621, 609 N.W.2d 215 (2000); LM v. Michigan, 307 Mich. App. 685, 862 N.W.2d 246 (2014). Before Smith was \ndecided, the Court of Appeals also relied on Bivens in Kewin v. Melvindale Northern Allen Park Pub. Sch. Bd. of Ed., \n65 Mich. App. 472, 237 N.W.2d 514 (1975), in which it recognized a damages award for a violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Though this decision is published, it was issued prior to November 1, 1990, so it is not precedential. \nMCR 7.215(J)(1). \nOther states remain split on whether to recognize a Bivens-style remedy for state constitutional violations. See 74 \nAm. Jur. 2d, Torts (May 2020 update), § 44 (recounting that some states allow an implied cause of action for \nunconstitutional searches, while others do not). However, in recent years, state courts have recognized fewer \nBivens-style remedies. 75 A.L.R.5th 619 lists 25 cases in which an implied cause of action was recognized under an \nanalogy to Bivens and 61 cases in which the cause of action was not recognized. Every case decided after 2000 \ndeclined to recognize a Bivens-style remedy. \n \n58 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n92  To be clear, limiting Smith to the due-process and equal-protection claims at issue in that case would mean declining \n  to recognize a claim for monetary damages under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 11, our state Constitution’s parallel provision \nto the Fourth Amendment, even though that would be similar to the type of claim recognized in Bivens itself. \n \n93  Smith, 428 Mich. at 544, 410 N.W.2d 749. \n \n \n1  Justice BERNSTEIN is certainly correct that what occurred to the people of Flint was appalling. But he is, with all \n  respect, incorrect in his characterization of the instant analysis as “highly legalistic.” Relevant law requires plaintiffs \nto “file with the clerk of the court of claims a notice of intention to file a claim or the claim itself within 6 months \nfollowing the happening of the event giving rise to the cause of action,” MCL 600.6431(3), and plaintiffs did not do \nthis. Mine is a wholly legal, not a “legalistic,” analysis. \n \n2  This Court noted that “[b]ecause the issue is uncontested, we presume, without deciding, that the definition of \n  ‘accrual’ in MCL 600.5827 applies equivalently to MCL 600.6431.” Id. at 183 n. 8, 931 N.W.2d 539. We also noted \nthat even if we were to apply the common-law definition of “accrual,” the outcome would not be any different. Id. \n“Under the common law, a claim generally accrues ‘when all of the elements of the cause of action have occurred \nand can be alleged in a proper complaint.’ ” Id., quoting Connelly v. Paul Ruddy’s Equip. Repair & Serv. Co., 388 Mich. \n146, 150, 200 N.W.2d 70 (1972). Similarly, in the instant case, because the issue is uncontested, I presume, without \ndeciding, that the definition of “accrual” in MCL 600.5827 applies equivalently to MCL 600.6431. In addition, as \ndiscussed in more detail later, application of the common-law definition of “accrual” would not alter my conclusion \nthat plaintiffs’ complaint was not timely filed. \n \n3  The Court of Appeals opinion in the instant case preceded this Court’s opinion in Bauserman. The Court of Appeals \n  dissent concluded that the common-law definition of accrual was applicable, including the common-law discovery \nrule. Mays, 323 Mich. App. at 98, 916 N.W.2d 227 (RIORDAN, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the dissent concluded \nthat the action was not timely filed because plaintiffs knew or should have known of their cause of action \nsignificantly longer than six months before they filed this cause of action. Id. at 99, 916 N.W.2d 227. Assuming for \nthe sake of argument that the common-law definition of accrual, including the common-law discovery rule, does \napply here, I agree with the dissenting judge that the action was not timely filed because plaintiffs knew or should \nhave known of their cause of action more than six months before they filed the cause of action, as will be discussed \nin greater detail later. \n \n4  The lead opinion concludes that Henry is distinguishable because plaintiffs in the instant case “do not allege that \n  their claimed harms resulted at the time Flint’s water source was switched.” However, plaintiffs’ original complaint \nalleges that plaintiffs “from April 25, 2014 to the present, have experienced and will continue to experience serious \npersonal injury and property damage caused by Defendants’ deliberately indifferent decision to expose them to the \nextreme toxicity of water pumped from the Flint River into their homes, schools, hospitals, correctional facilities, \nworkplaces and public places.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges that plaintiffs \n“since April 25, 2014, were and continue to be injured in person and property because they were exposed to highly \ndangerous conditions created, caused and knowingly prolonged by Defendants’ conduct ....” (Emphasis added.) \n59 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n \n5  The lead opinion states that “[p]laintiffs have also alleged injuries that might include plaintiffs who suffered in vitro \n  exposure to toxic water” and therefore “[i]t would simply be illogical to foreclose a plaintiff’s suit if the plaintiff had \nbeen exposed to the Flint water in the womb and thus suffered harm but had not yet been born as of April 2014.” \nHowever, plaintiffs’ complaints do not say anything at all concerning in vitro exposure to toxic water; therefore, that \nissue is simply not before this Court. \n \n6  The lead opinion is correct that Hart involved an inverse-condemnation claim, while Garg involved a discrimination \n  claim. However, the issue in both those cases was essentially the same: whether the statute of limitations permits a \nplaintiff to recover for injuries suffered outside the limitations period where those injuries are susceptible to being \ncharacterized as “continuing violations.” Garg, the later-in-time decision, answered that question in the negative, \nand I see no logical reason why its reasoning would not apply in other contexts, including, in particular, in the \ncontext of an inverse-condemnation claim. Although this Court did not expressly overrule Hart in Garg, I do not see \nhow the reasoning of Hart conceivably could survive the reasoning of Garg. \n \n7  Although Henry did not involve an inverse-condemnation claim, it did involve a similar claim of contamination that \n  allegedly resulted in a diminution of property value. And this Court held that the claim accrued when the dioxin \nreached the plaintiffs’ property, “regardless of whether it was possible at that time to calculate the level of \nmonetary damage.” Henry v. Dow Chem. Co., 319 Mich. App. 704, 736, 905 N.W.2d 422 (2017) (GADOLA, P.J., \ndissenting); Henry, 501 Mich. at 965, 905 N.W.2d 601 (reversing part of the opinion of the Court of Appeals “for the \nreasons stated in the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion”). \nThe lead opinion concludes that “[t]he economic damage plaintiffs allege from the diminution of their properties’ \nvalue could not have occurred on the date the water source was switched.” Instead, it asserts, “[p]laintiffs’ property \ndiminished in value at a later date, yet to be determined, when a buyer or bank had the requisite information to be \ndisinclined to buy or finance the purchase of property in Flint.” But this Court rejected a similar argument in Henry \nwhen it adopted Judge GADOLA’s dissent. In Henry, the Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs’ action did not \naccrue  until  the  MDEQ  revealed  to  the  public  that  elevated  dioxin  concentrations  were  pervasive  in  the \nTittabawassee river floodplain and restricted the property owners’ rights to use their property. Judge GADOLA \nconcluded that the plaintiffs’ action accrued when the dioxins reached the plaintiffs’ property, explaining that “[i]t \nmay be true that the value of plaintiffs’ property changed when the MDEQ published its 2002 bulletin, but plaintiffs’ \ndiscovery in 2002 that their damages were greater than originally supposed when the dioxin was deposited on their \nproperties, possibly as early as the 1970s, did not create a new accrual date for plaintiffs’ claims. Such reasoning \noverlooks the clear directive of MCL 600.5827 that ‘the claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is \nbased was done regardless of the time when damage results.’ (Emphasis added.)” Henry, 319 Mich. App. at 735, 905 \nN.W.2d 422 (GADOLA, P.J., dissenting). As already noted, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals in Henry “for the \nreasons stated in the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion.” Henry, 501 Mich. at 965, 905 N.W.2d 601. As a result, \npursuant to Henry, plaintiffs’ action here accrued when the Flint River water reached plaintiffs’ property, without \nregard to when “a buyer or bank had the requisite information to be disinclined to buy or finance the purchase of \nproperty in Flint.” \n \n8  Moreover, I question whether plaintiffs have even adequately alleged a claim of inverse condemnation. “The right \n  to just compensation, in the context of an inverse condemnation suit for diminution in value ... exists only where the \n60 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nlandowner can allege a unique or special injury, that is, an injury that is different in kind, not simply in degree, from \nthe harm suffered by all persons similarly situated.” Spiek v. Dep’t of Transp., 456 Mich. 331, 348, 572 N.W.2d 201 \n(1998). As we have explained: \nWhere harm is shared in common by many members of the public, the appropriate remedy lies with the \nlegislative branch and the regulatory bodies created thereby .... Only where the harm is peculiar or unique in this \ncontext does the judicial remedy become appropriate. [Id. at 349, 572 N.W.2d 201.] \nConcerning the meaning of “similarly situated,” the lead opinion is correct that Spiek compared the plaintiffs to \nother persons who “reside near a public highway,” rather than the specific highway that the plaintiffs resided near. \nId. at 350, 572 N.W.2d 201 (emphasis added). However, in discussing this requirement in general, Spiek expressly \nindicated that a plaintiff’s alleged damage must not be “common to all property in the neighborhood” or “common \n[to] all lands in the vicinity.” Id. at 346, 348, 572 N.W.2d 201 n. 14 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In \naddition, contrary to the approach of the majority, this Court in Hill v. State Hwy. Comm., 382 Mich. 398, 170 \nN.W.2d 18 (1969), compared the plaintiffs in that case with those whose property was also affected by the specific \nconstruction at issue. See id. at 404, 170 N.W.2d 18 (“[P]laintiffs make no showing that they are differently treated \nfrom other members of the traveling public or property owners whose use of these streets has been restricted by \nthe construction of the limited access expressway.”). Accordingly, I question whether the majority is correct in \nholding that the pertinent inquiry is whether plaintiffs are similarly situated to municipal water users generally \nrather than with other Flint water users. \nAssuming that the latter defines the pertinent inquiry, plaintiffs have not alleged that they have suffered a unique or \nspecial injury that is any different in kind from the harm suffered by all persons similarly situated. Indeed, plaintiffs \nclaim to represent all the Flint water users that suffered personal injuries and property damage from the water. That \nis, plaintiffs claim to represent all persons similarly situated. Therefore, arguably by definition, plaintiffs have not \nalleged an injury that is any different in kind from those suffered by all persons similarly situated. Because the harm \nthat plaintiffs alleged is shared in common by many members of the public, the appropriate remedy arguably lies \nwith the legislative branch and the regulatory bodies created thereby. That is, it is not necessarily that there is no \nremedy available to persons injured but that the remedy is more properly fashioned by a different agency of \ngovernment. However, given that I conclude that plaintiffs here failed to comply with the notice provision of the \nCourt of Claims Act, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim of inverse \ncondemnation. Similarly, it is unnecessary for me to address the merits of plaintiffs’ substantive due-process claim, \nso I will merely observe that I find Justice VIVIANO’s opinion to be highly estimable and share a good many of his \nconcerns. \n \n9  The Court of Claims also relied on the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception to deny defendants’ \n  motions  for  summary  disposition.  The  Court  of  Appeals  dissent  concluded  that  the \nharsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception was abrogated by McCahan and Rowland because in those cases \nthis Court held that no judicially created savings construction is permitted to avoid a clear statutory mandate. \nHowever, those cases involved statutory claims, and we held that because the Legislature could completely abolish \nthose claims, it could obviously place restrictions on such claims. The instant case involves constitutional claims that \nthe Legislature lacks the authority to completely abolish (at least with regard to inverse condemnation), and this \nCourt has long held that the Legislature cannot enact limitation periods that “are so harsh and unreasonable in their \nconsequences that they effectively divest plaintiffs of the access to the courts intended by the grant of the \nsubstantive right.” Forest, 402 Mich. at 359, 262 N.W.2d 653. For example, the Legislature could not enact a statute \nthat requires a claimant to file a takings action within one day of the alleged taking. The Court of Appeals dissent \nalso concluded that application of the notice provision would not be harsh or unreasonable given that plaintiffs had \nnumerous indications that they were suffering harm within six months of the water-source switch and so could have \n61 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nreasonably filed their notice of intent in a timely fashion. I fully agree with this conclusion. \n \n10  The Court of Claims rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the fraudulent-concealment statute should be applied in this \n  case. The Court of Appeals dissent also concluded that the fraudulent-concealment statute does not apply. \n \n11  The fraudulent-concealment statute, MCL 600.5855, provides: \n \nIf a person who is or may be liable for any claim fraudulently conceals the existence of the claim or the identity of \nany person who is liable for the claim from the knowledge of the person entitled to sue on the claim, the action \nmay be commenced at any time within 2 years after the person who is entitled to bring the action discovers, or \nshould have discovered, the existence of the claim or the identity of the person who is liable for the claim, \nalthough the action would otherwise be barred by the period of limitations. \n \n12  Justice BERNSTEIN recognizes that “[t]he Legislature did not create a fraudulent-concealment exception for the \n  statutory notice provision in the [Court of Claims Act].” Yet, he reads such an exception into the statutory notice \nprovision of the Court of Claims Act because its absence there is “not reconcilable with the Legislature’s intent to \nprovide claimants with two years from the date of discovery to bring suit for harm that was fraudulently concealed, \nas expressed in MCL 600.6452(2).” However, this is simply inconsistent with the plainest expression of the \nLegislature’s actual intention, i.e., the law enacted. See Mayor of Lansing v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 470 Mich. 154, 161, \n680 N.W.2d 840 (2004). \nJustice BERNSTEIN also asserts that failing to read a fraudulent-concealment exception into the statutory notice \nprovision “would result in reading out MCL 600.6452(2) entirely, because plaintiffs would never be able to utilize the \nfraudulent-concealment exception.” I respectfully disagree. MCL 600.6452(2) does more than incorporate the \nfraudulent-concealment statute into the statute-of-limitations provision of the Court of Claims Act; rather, it \nincorporates all the “provisions of RJA chapter 58, relative to the limitation of actions” into the statute-of-limitations \nprovision of the Court of Claims Act. Therefore, failing to read a fraudulent-concealment exception into the \nstatutory notice provision of the Court of Claims Act would not “entirely” result in reading out MCL 600.6452(2). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n62 \n ",

See Executive Order No. 2019-06. For consistency’s sake, in this case we refer to the \nDepartment as the MDEQ. We note that the Department of Human Services and the Department of Community \nHealth were combined to form DHHS during the pendency of this case. See Executive Order No. 2015-04. \n \n2  An emergency manager is an official appointed by the governor “to address a financial emergency” within a local \n  government. MCL 141.1549(1). Under our state’s law, emergency managers effectively replace locally elected \ngovernment officials and have broad powers to address financial emergencies: \nUpon appointment, an emergency manager shall act for and in the place and stead of the governing body and the \noffice of chief administrative officer of the local government. The emergency manager shall have broad powers in \nreceivership to rectify the financial emergency and to assure the fiscal accountability of the local government and \nthe local government’s capacity to provide or cause to be provided necessary governmental services essential to \nthe public health, safety, and welfare. Following appointment of an emergency manager and during the pendency \nof receivership, the governing body and the chief administrative officer of the local government shall not exercise \nany of the powers of those offices except as may be specifically authorized in writing by the emergency manager \nor as otherwise provided by this act and are subject to any conditions required by the emergency manager. [MCL \n141.1549(2).] \n \n3  We conclude that defendants have not produced sufficient evidence at this stage of litigation to contradict plaintiffs’ \n  allegations. \n \n4  Later in this opinion, we review defendants’ motions for summary disposition on plaintiffs’ procedural compliance \n  with statutory notice requirements under MCR 2.116(C)(4) and (7). \n37 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n \n5  We address plaintiffs’ claim of inverse condemnation first because it is the sole claim in which a majority exists to \n  expressly affirm the Court of Appeals. \n \n6  In the context of this unique case, the analysis is somewhat ill-fitting because we do not normally consider delivery \n  of water to the public as a “legalized nuisance.” See Richards, 233 U.S. at 554, 34 S.Ct. 654. \n \n7  This provision was amended after plaintiffs filed their suit. See 2020 PA 42 (effective March 3, 2020). We analyze the \n  version of the statute in effect when plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in 2016. \n \n8  While plaintiffs’ amended complaint states that their claim “accrued on October 16, 2016, when Defendants \n  re-connected the Flint water system to water supplied by the [DWSD],” elsewhere in their complaint plaintiffs \nacknowledge that defendants actually reconnected Flint to the DWSD on October 16, 2015. (Emphasis added.) In \nreviewing the complaint as a whole, we conclude that plaintiffs’ mention of that event occurring in 2016 was made \nin error. \n \n9  Justice MARKMAN asserts that plaintiffs do not allege injuries from in vitro exposure to Flint water. We disagree. \n  While plaintiffs do not mention in vitro exposure explicitly, they make allegations regarding personal injury from \nexposure to and ingestion of Flint water on behalf of themselves and other Flint water users. In our view, it is \nreasonable to assume that plaintiffs exist in this putative class who were exposed to Flint water in the womb, \nsuffered injury, and were born after April 2014. \n \n10  Plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges numerous harms resulting from separate tortious acts. These allegations are \n  different from a continuing harm resulting from a single tortious act. For purposes of determining the accrual date \nof plaintiffs’ claims, each of plaintiffs’ individual causes of action must be considered separately. See Joliet v. \nPitoniak, 475 Mich. 30, 42, 715 N.W.2d 60 (2006). \nMoreover, we disagree with Justice MARKMAN’s characterization of Hart v. Detroit, 416 Mich. 488, 331 N.W.2d 438 \n(1982),  as  no  longer  good  law.  Justice  MARKMAN  notes  that  plaintiffs  rely  on  Hart  to  argue  that  their \ninverse-condemnation  claim  was  timely  filed.  In  Hart,  this  Court  recognized  that  with  regard  to  an \ninverse-condemnation claim in which plaintiffs allege that their property was taken via a continuous wrong, the \nstatute of limitations does not begin to run “until the consequences of the condemnor’s actions have stabilized.” Id. \nat 504, 331 N.W.2d 438. Justice MARKMAN argues that “Hart is no longer good law because this Court in Garg v. \nMacomb Co. Community Mental Health Servs., 472 Mich. 263, 696 N.W.2d 646 (2005) [(analyzing a discrimination \nclaim)], later abolished the ‘continuing violations’ doctrine because it was inconsistent with the language of the \nstatute of limitations.” In our view, Justice MARKMAN misapplies the continuing-violations doctrine to plaintiffs’ \nclaim of inverse condemnation. The continuing-violations doctrine is often applied by the federal courts in the \ncontext of Title VII, civil-rights actions, and other discrimination claims. See, e.g., Hunt v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1263, 1266 \n(C.A. 10, 1994); Lockridge v. Univ. of Maine Sys., 597 F.3d 464, 474 (C.A. 1, 2010); Kovacevich v. Kent State Univ., 224 \nF.3d  806,  829  (C.A.  6,  2000).  In  contrast,  the  stabilization  doctrine  was  developed  in  the  context  of \n38 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \ninverse-condemnation claims. See, e.g., United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 749, 67 S. Ct. 1382, 91 L. Ed. 1789 \n(1947); Hart, 416 Mich. at 504, 331 N.W.2d 438; Etchegoinberry v. United States, 114 Fed. Cl. 437, 475 (2013); Banks \nv. United States, 741 F.3d 1268, 1281 (C.A. Fed., 2014). We have found no instance in which our Court has applied \nthe continuing-violations doctrine to a claim of inverse condemnation. We also note that this Court’s decision in \nGarg never mentioned Hart, nor did it abolish the stabilization doctrine. We believe that Hart remains good law \nbecause this Court has never overruled it. \n \n11  Plaintiffs argue that the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences doctrine and the fraudulent-concealment doctrine \n  also support their claims that satisfactory notice was filed. Because we believe that there still remain questions of \nfact about when plaintiffs’ harms accrued, we see no need to look to these doctrines at this point in the \nproceedings. Once discovery is completed, the applicability of these doctrines may be reconsidered as necessary. \n \n12  The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend \n  to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, \nor by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S. Const., Am. XI. \n \n13  We conclude that Justice VIVIANO’s arguments to the contrary are premature. Plaintiffs should be permitted to \n  develop  their  factual  allegations  through  discovery  before  it  is  determined  whether  monetary  damages  are \navailable. \n \n14  We note that plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against several of the named defendants in a related federal-court \n  action. Plaintiffs seek an order to remediate the harm caused by defendants’ conduct, including repairs to property \nand the establishment of a medical-monitoring fund. Plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive \ndamages. Although plaintiffs may seek alternative remedies in federal court, that fact does not affect our decision \nregarding the availability of alternative remedies. The availability of these remedies remains to be seen. If those \nremedies materialize, they, of course, may affect any future consideration of appropriate remedies in this action. \n \n1  In Rowland, a personal-injury case against a municipality in which the plaintiff fell and was injured while crossing a \n  street, this Court ruled that a suit may be dismissed for failure to comply with a statutory notice requirement even if \nthe defendant was not prejudiced by the lack of notice. The Court explained, “[I]nasmuch as the Legislature is not \neven required to provide a defective highway exception to governmental immunity, it surely has the authority to \nallow such suits only upon compliance with rational notice limits.” Rowland, 477 Mich. at 212, 731 N.W.2d 41. \n \n2  Trentadue, 479 Mich. at 386-387, 738 N.W.2d 664 (considering the statute of limitations for a wrongful-death \n  action). \n \n3  In McCahan, 492 Mich. at 732-733, 822 N.W.2d 747, the Court determined that the notice requirement of MCL \n39 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n  600.6431 is a “condition precedent to sue the state,” McCahan v. Brennan, 291 Mich.

See MCL 600.101 et seq. \n   \n1  I respectfully disagree with Justice VIVIANO’s framing of the right in question as the right “not to be exposed to \n  contaminated  water.”  Plaintiffs’  substantive  due-process  claim  is  based  on  the  alleged  violation  of  their \nconstitutional right to bodily integrity. This well-established right is among the most fundamental. “Because our \nnotions of liberty are inextricably entwined with our idea of physical freedom and self-determination, the Court has \noften deemed state incursions into the body repugnant to the interests protected by the Due Process Clause.” \nCruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 287, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990) (O’Connor, J., \nconcurring). See also Union Pac. R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S. Ct. 1000, 35 L.

California, 384 U.S. 757, 772, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1966) \n(“The integrity of an individual’s person is a cherished value of our society.”). \nJustice VIVIANO relies on Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997), \nto define the right at such a level of specificity. But the viability of Glucksberg’s specificity prong is in serious \nquestion. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court acknowledged Glucksberg’s call for a “careful description” of the \nasserted right but concluded that “while that approach may have been appropriate for the asserted right there \ninvolved (physician-assisted suicide), it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other \nfundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 671, 135 S. Ct. 2584, \n2602, 192 L. Ed. 2d 609 (2015). Dissenting Chief Justice Roberts asserted that “the majority’s position requires it to \neffectively overrule Glucksberg, the leading modern case setting the bounds of substantive due process.” Id. at 702, \n135 S. Ct. at 2621 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). See also Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 566, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. \n2d 508 (2003) (rejecting the framing of the issue presented, as described in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 190, \n106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986), as “ ‘whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon \nhomosexuals to engage in sodomy,’ ” because it “fail[s] to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake”); Yoshino, A \nNew Birth of Freedom?: Obergefell v. Hodges, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 147, 154-159 (2015) (describing the development of \nGlucksberg’s “careful description” requirement and the “battle royale over how abstractly an alleged liberty interest \ncould be defined”); Tribe, Equal Dignity: Speaking Its Name, 129 Harv. L. Rev. F. 16, 17 (2015) (“[T]here is no doubt \nthat Glucksberg’s cramped methodology cast a significant pall that Justice Kennedy’s Lawrence v. Texas opinion in \n2003 only partially swept away ... and that his Obergefell opinion in 2015 finally displaced decisively.”) (citation \nomitted). The alleged exposure to contaminated water is how the plaintiffs’ fundamental right to bodily integrity \nwas violated; indeed, this is precisely what the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint. In the same way that the \nObergefell Court defined the fundamental right as “the right to marry” rather than the “right to same-sex marriage,” \nObergefell, 576 U.S. at 671, 135 S. Ct. at 2602, the fundamental right asserted here is the right to bodily integrity, \nnot the right to contaminant-free water. \n \n2  Restatement Torts, 2d, § 874A provides: “When a legislative provision protects a class of persons by proscribing or \n  requiring certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation, the court may, if it determines that \nthe remedy is appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of \nthe provision, accord to an injured member of the class a right of action, using a suitable existing tort action or a \n40 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nnew cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.” This section makes clear that the term “legislative \nprovision” includes a constitutional provision. See id. at comment a. \n \n3  Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 authorizes suits for monetary damages for federal civil-rights violations \n  committed under color of state law. \n \n4  “Examples of the influence of federalism include: the existence and scope of absolute and qualified individual \n  immunities; the ‘official policy or custom’ requirement for local government liability; and the various ‘procedural’ \ndefenses the Court has applied to section 1983, such as statutes of limitations, preclusion and abstention.” Nahmod, \nState Constitutional Torts: DeShaney, Reverse-Federalism and Community, 26 Rutgers L. J. 949, 950 (1995) (citations \nomitted). See also Friesen, Recovering Damages for State Bills of Rights Claims, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1269, 1275 (1985) \n(arguing that state-court judges “should not suffer from the conservatizing influences, which affect federal courts, of \nthe need to make nationally uniform rules, which often bind the officials of another sovereign”). \n \n5  For what it is worth, I do not share Justice VIVIANO’s critique of Bivens’s foundation. The Supreme Court has a long \n  history of permitting suits for damages against rogue federal officers. See Fallon, Bidding Farewell to Constitutional \nTorts, 107 Calif. L. Rev. 933, 941-946 (2019); see, e.g., Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 2 L. \nEd. 208 (1804); Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 2 L. Ed. 243 (1804) (affirming tort damages against \ngovernment officers for ultra vires seizures of vessels); cf. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327, \n135 S. Ct. 1378, 191 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2015) (noting the “long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing \nback to England”). \nNor do I share Justice VIVIANO’s understanding that “[t]he United States Supreme Court’s abandonment of implied \ncauses of action in the statutory context has cast doubt on Bivens ....” The difference between statutory-based \nclaims and constitutional-tort claims is significant. It makes sense to defer to the Legislature to authorize a cause of \naction arising under a statute, which exists only by the Legislature’s creation, but, as discussed below, I do not \nbelieve that the Legislature has exclusive jurisdiction over crafting remedies for violations of the Constitution, which \nwas created by the people, exists independently of the Legislature, and reigns supreme in our system. \n \n1  In other words, I join Parts II(A), (B)(1), (B)(2), and (B)(3) of the lead opinion. Because I believe more factual \n  development is needed to determine when plaintiffs’ inverse-condemnation claim accrued, I would not yet reach a \nconclusion as to whether the fraudulent-concealment exception or the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences \nexception might apply if the claim is later determined to be untimely. \n \n2  Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17. \n \n \n3  Cummins v. Robinson Twp., 283 Mich. App. 677, 700-701, 770 N.W.2d 421 (2009). The Due Process Clause of the \n  federal Constitution states, “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities \nof citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due \n41 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nprocess of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const., Am. XIV \n(emphasis added). \nWe have held out the possibility that our Due Process Clause grants greater protection than the federal clause. AFT \nMich. v. Michigan, 497 Mich. 197, 245 n. 28, 866 N.W.2d 782 (2015) (“The portions of Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 and \nU.S. Const., Am. XIV addressing due process are worded differently, so they may grant disparate levels of protection. \nThis Court has, on occasion, applied distinctive due process protections under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 broader than \nhave been afforded under U.S. Const., Am. XIV.”). In general, however, “[w]e have often spoken indistinguishably \nabout the standards governing our respective constitutions and been vague as to which constitution we were \ninterpreting.” Delta Charter Twp. v. Dinolfo, 419 Mich. 253, 276 n. 7, 351 N.W.2d 831 (1984), citing Robinson Twp. v. \nKnoll, 410 Mich. 293, 302 N.W.2d 146 (1981); O’Donnell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Because plaintiffs do not argue that our \nstate’s Constitution provides greater protection in this instance, and because the particular language at issue is \nidentical, it is unnecessary for me to address whether Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17 offers more protection than its \nfederal counterpart. \n \n4  Bonner v.

However, because I find that plaintiffs have not \nadequately alleged a violation of due process, it is unnecessary for me to address the merits (or lack thereof) of \nsubstantive due process generally. \n \n7  As Lillard v. Shelby Co. Bd. of Ed., 76 F.3d 716, 724 (C.A. 6, 1996), explained: \n \nThis court has recognized two categories of substantive due process rights: \nThe first type includes claims asserting denial of a right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or \nby federal statute other than procedural claims under “the Fourteenth Amendment simpliciter.” ... \nThe other type of claim is directed at official acts which may not occur regardless of the procedural safeguards \naccompanying  them.  The  test  for  substantive  due  process  claims  of  this  type  is  whether  the  conduct \ncomplained of “shocks the conscience” of the court. \nMertik v. Blalock, 983 F.2d 1353, 1367–68 (6th Cir. 1993). The first type of claim exists, for example, when a \nplaintiff alleges that his right to be free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment was violated. \nSee Wilson v. Beebe, 770 F.2d 578, 585–86 (6th Cir. 1985) (en banc); see also Braley v. City of Pontiac, 906 F.2d \n220, 225 (6th Cir. 1990). The latter type of claim, however, does not “require[ ] a claim that some specific \nguarantee of the Constitution apart from the due process clause be violated .... This is a substantive due process \nright akin to the ‘fundamental fairness’ concept of procedural due process.” Wilson, 770 F.2d at 586. \nCompare Lillard, 76 F.3d 716, with 1 Bodensteiner & Levinson, State & Local Government Civil Rights Liability \n(November 2019 update), § 1:16 (“There are three aspects to substantive due process. First, it protects the \nenumerated rights (Bill of Rights) from state interference. Second, it provides the source for protecting certain, \nunenumerated, nontextual, yet significant, rights from interference by the legislative branch of government. Third, it \nprohibits arbitrary abuses of power by government officials.”). I point out that it is not entirely clear whether \nplaintiffs must show both the deprivation of a constitutional right and conscience-shocking behavior, or whether \nthey must only show one or the other. Guertin v. Michigan, 912 F.3d 907, 946 (C.A. 6, 2019) (McKeague, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“At times we have treated these two elements (deprivation of a \nconstitutional right and conscience-shocking behavior) as separate methods of stating a substantive-due-process \nclaim. Range v. Douglas, 763 F.3d 573, 588 (6th Cir. 2014). At other times we have concluded they are both \nrequired. See Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., Inc. v. Kentucky, 641 F.3d 685, 688 (6th Cir. 2011).”). Because I \nconclude that plaintiffs have shown neither, it is not necessary to decide whether only one would be sufficient. \n \n8  It is not entirely clear from plaintiffs’ amended complaint which type of claim they assert. \n \n \n9  Sierb, 456 Mich. at 529, 581 N.W.2d 219, quoting Albright, 510 U.S. at 272, 114 S.Ct. 807. \n \n43 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990), had grounded its decision in \n“the common-law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition protecting the decision to \nrefuse unwanted medical treatment,” not “from abstract concepts of personal autonomy”). \n \n13  See Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722, 117 S.Ct. 2258 (“[T]he development of this Court’s substantive-due-process \n  jurisprudence ... has been a process whereby the outlines of the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment—never fully clarified, to be sure, and perhaps not capable of being fully clarified—have at least been \ncarefully refined by concrete examples involving fundamental rights found to be deeply rooted in our legal \ntradition.”) (citation omitted). For example, in Glucksberg the Court clarified that the right at issue was not “a right \nto die” or “a liberty to choose how to die” but more specifically “a right to commit suicide which itself includes a \nright to assistance in doing so.” Id. at 722-723, 117 S. Ct. 2258 (quotation marks and citations omitted). \nChief Justice MCCORMACK contends that “the viability of Glucksberg’s specificity prong is in serious question.” But \nGlucksberg has not been overruled.

As Justice Scalia explained \n  in Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 121-123, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989): \nWithout that core textual meaning as a limitation, defining the scope of the Due Process Clause “has at times \nbeen a treacherous field for this Court,” giving “reason for concern lest the only limits to ... judicial intervention \nbecome the predilections of those who happen at the time to be Members of this Court.” Moore v. East \nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502[, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531] (1977). The need for restraint has been cogently \nexpressed by Justice WHITE: \nThat the Court has ample precedent for the creation of new constitutional rights should not lead it to repeat \nthe process at will. The Judiciary, including this Court, is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy \nwhen it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even \nthe design of the Constitution. Realizing that the present construction of the Due Process Clause represents a \nmajor judicial gloss on its terms, as well as on the anticipation of the Framers ..., the Court should be extremely \nreluctant to breathe still further substantive content into the Due Process Clause so as to strike down \nlegislation adopted by a State or city to promote its welfare. Whenever the Judiciary does so, it unavoidably \npre-empts for itself another part of the governance of the country without express constitutional authority. \n44 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

But I see nothing in this particular study \nthat clearly indicates that using the Flint River as a water source would risk a public health crisis. \n \n37  Defendants moved for summary disposition regarding plaintiffs’ claim of a substantive due-process right to bodily \n  integrity under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (8).

After Agent \nMiguel Del Toral of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepared a memorandum stating that there were \nhigh levels of lead, EPA Region 5 Director Dr. Susan Hedman told Mayor Dwayne Walling that “what he was given \nwas a preliminary draft [of the memorandum] and that it would be premature to draw any conclusions based on \nthat draft.” Specifically regarding studies of blood lead levels in children, plaintiffs recount that though the Michigan \nDepartment of Health and Human Services had data showing elevated blood lead levels, others at the Childhood \nLead Poisoning Prevention Program disputed that the water was the cause or that there even were elevated blood \nlead levels. In sum, despite the various signs that the water posed health risks, plaintiffs cite the Task Force Report, \nwhich recounts that there were “repeated assurances that the water was safe.” \n \n49 \n \n\n \n \nMays v.

Cremonte v. Mich. State Police, 232 Mich. App. 240, 252, 591 N.W.2d 261 (1998) (determining that \nthere is no such cause of action because the Equal Protection Clause, Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2, states that it shall be \nimplemented by the Legislature); Lewis v. Michigan, 464 Mich. 781, 789, 629 N.W.2d 868 (2001) (“Given the \nlanguage of the Michigan Constitution, we hold in this case that we are without proper authority to recognize a \ncause of action for money damages or other compensatory relief for past violations of Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.”). \nThere is no such language in Const. 1963, art. 1, § 17. \nRegarding history, our state’s Constitution has guaranteed due process since the 1850 Constitution. Const. 1908, art. \n2, § 16 (“No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, \nliberty or property, without due process of law.”); Const. 1850, art. 6, § 32 (“No person shall be compelled, in any \ncriminal case, to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of \nlaw.”). When considering whether to add language guaranteeing that no “ ‘person be held to answer for a criminal \noffence unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury,’ ” Mr. S. Clark referred to the Due Process Clause, \nnoting that the language came from the Magna Carta. Report of the Proceedings and Debates in the Convention to \nRevise the Constitution of the State of Michigan, 1850 (Lansing: R. W. Ingals, 1850), pp. 192-195. But this, of course, \ndoes not favor creating or not creating a damages remedy. \n \n58  Sierb, 456 Mich. at 528, 581 N.W.2d 219, quoting Collins, 503 U.S. at 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061. \n \n \n59  Though I point out that in In re Flint Water Cases, 960 F.3d 303, 325 (C.A. 6, 2020), a case involving some of the \n  same plaintiffs here, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has recently denied several defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss, including those of Darnell Earley and Jerry Ambrose, id. at 325, and former Governor Snyder, id. \nat 332. The Sixth Circuit also determined that Flint could not claim Eleventh Amendment immunity. However, the \ncase is still at a relatively early stage, and the Sixth Circuit did not rule out that certain defendants might be immune \nin the future. See, e.g., id. at 324 (“Some judges of this court have even noted that, because the facts at this stage \nare yet undeveloped, ‘it is generally inappropriate for a district court to grant a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the \nbasis of qualified immunity. Although an officer’s entitlement to qualified immunity is a threshold question to be \nresolved at the earliest possible point, that point is usually summary judgment and not dismissal under Rule 12.’ ”), \nquoting Wesley v. Campbell, 779 F.3d 421, 433-434 (C.A. 6, 2015). Thus, it appears that plaintiffs’ federal case might \nprovide an alternative remedy, which would weigh against the creation of a cause of action for damages in this case. \n \n60  See Boler v. Earley, 865 F.3d 391, 408-409 (C.A. 6, 2017) (noting that the SDWA protections are not “ ‘wholly \n  congruent’ ” with the federal constitutional protections) (citation omitted). \n \n61  The Court of Appeals noted “ ‘the degree of outrageousness of the state actors’ conduct as alleged by plaintiffs ....’ ” \n  Mays, 323 Mich. App. at 72, 916 N.W.2d 227 (citation omitted). However, as stated above, I do not believe that \nJustice BOYLE opined that courts should take into account other factors weighing in favor of inferring a damages \n52 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nremedy. I recognize that Justice BOYLE’s multifactor test is not binding. But even still, I do not believe that, for \npurposes  of  determining  whether  to  infer  a  damages  remedy,  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  the  degree  of \noutrageousness of the conduct plaintiffs allege. None of the other factors relates to the particular facts at issue; \ninstead, the focus of the analysis is on the nature of the constitutional right at issue, whether it was clearly violated, \nwhether there is any historical support for a damages remedy, and whether another remedy is available. Focusing \non the egregiousness of the facts alleged would change the nature of the inquiry and lead to arbitrary outcomes. \n \n62  Smith, 428 Mich. at 544, 410 N.W.2d 749. \n \n \n63  Bivens, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619. \n \n \n64  Smith, 122 Mich. App. 340, 333 N.W.2d 50. \n \n \n65  The plaintiff in Will had failed to preserve his claim, and the Court voted to reverse that portion of the Court of \n  Appeals judgment that remanded Will to the Court of Claims for further proceedings regarding the liability of the \nDirector of the State Police. Smith, 428 Mich. at 544-545, 410 N.W.2d 749. Chief Justice MCCORMACK asserts that \n“it is not at all clear that the relevant holding of Smith is at all or exclusively based on Bivens.” Smith is certainly an \nodd decision, since the Court’s opinion was issued as a memorandum opinion consisting only of the issues \npresented, the Court’s holdings, and its disposition of the case. Standing alone, that opinion would appear to lack \nany substantive legal effect because it violates Const. 1963, art. 6, § 6, which states that “[d]ecisions of the supreme \ncourt ... shall be in writing and shall contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision ....” See \nDeFrain v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 491 Mich. 359, 369, 817 N.W.2d 504 (2012). However, I think it is clearly \napparent from the separate opinions in Smith that the Court’s holding was based on Bivens. Justice BRICKLEY’s \nopinion, which was joined by Justice RILEY, discussed Bivens and its progeny at length, Smith, 428 Mich. at 613-626, \n410 N.W.2d 749 (opinion by BRICKLEY, J.), though it declined to recognize a damages remedy in either of the cases \nbefore the Court, id. at 626, 410 N.W.2d 749. Justice BOYLE’s partial concurrence, which was joined by Justice \nCAVANAGH, also very clearly relied on Bivens to support the conclusion that damages were possible and that Smith \nshould be remanded to determine whether such a remedy was proper. Id. at 645-648, 410 N.W.2d 749 (BOYLE, J., \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, four of the six justices explicitly considered Bivens. Though \nJustice ARCHER and Justice LEVIN wrote separate opinions, they concurred in Justice BOYLE’s remand, id. at 652, \n410 N.W.2d 749 (opinion by LEVIN, J.); id. at 658, 410 N.W.2d 749 (ARCHER, J., dissenting), and, presumably, her \ndiscussion of Bivens since the opinion did not provide any other rationale in support of Justice BOYLE’s remand. \n \n66  Bivens, 403 U.S. at 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999. \n \n \n67  Id. \n   \n68  Id. \n   \n53 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n69  Id. at 392, 91 S.Ct. 1999. \n \n \n70  Id. at 394, 91 S.Ct. 1999. \n \n \n71  Id. at 395, 91 S.Ct. 1999. \n \n \n72  Id. at 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999. Chief Justice MCCORMACK states that “[t]he Supreme Court has a long history of \n  permitting suits for damages against rogue federal officers.” However, the cases she cites are not examples of courts \nawarding damages for constitutional violations but rather involve common-law tort and statutory violations. Fallon, \nBidding Farewell to Constitutional Torts, 107 Calif. L. Rev. 933, 943 (2019) (discussing Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 \nCranch) 170, 2 L. Ed. 243 (1804), and noting that “Barreme sought to recover by bringing a common law trespass \naction”); Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 64-65, 2 L.

If there was no reasonable ground \nof suspicion that she was a vessel trading contrary to that law, the commander of a United States ship of war, who \nseizes and sends her in, is liable for damages.”). Indeed, it is undisputed that Bivens broke new ground in inferring \ncauses of action for damages for constitutional violations. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. \n939 (1946) (noting that the issue “whether federal courts can grant money recovery for damages said to have been \nsuffered as a result of federal officers violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments ... has never been specifically \ndecided by this Court”).

Legislation is \nthe business of the Congress, and it has the facilities and competence for that task—as we do not.”); id. at 427-428, \n91 S.Ct. 1999 (Black, J., dissenting) (“There can be no doubt that Congress could create a federal cause of action for \ndamages for an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Although Congress has created such a \nfederal cause of action against state officials acting under color of state law [in 42 USC 1983], it has never created \nsuch a cause of action against federal officials. If it wanted to do so, Congress could, of course, create a remedy \nagainst federal officials who violate the Fourth Amendment in the performance of their duties. But the point of this \ncase and the fatal weakness in the Court’s judgment is that neither Congress nor the State of New York has enacted \nlegislation creating such a right of action. For us to do so is, in my judgment, an exercise of power that the \nConstitution does not give us.”); id. at 430, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (referring to the majority opinion \nas “judicial legislation”).

As Justice Rehnquist explained: \nBecause the judgments that must be made here involve many “competing policies, goals, and priorities” that are \nnot well suited for evaluation by the Judicial Branch, in my view “[t]he task of evaluating the pros and cons of \ncreating judicial remedies for particular wrongs is a matter for Congress and the legislatures of the States.” \n[Carlson, 446 U.S. at 36, 100 S.Ct. 1468 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).] \n \n89  Like the United States Supreme Court, our Court has declined in recent decades to imply statutory causes of action. \n  In B. F. Farnell Co. v. Monahan, 377 Mich. 552, 555-556, 141 N.W.2d 58 (1966), this Court noted the “ ‘general rule’ ” \nthat there would be a private cause of action under a statute: “ ‘where a statute imposes upon any person a specific \nduty for the protection or benefit of others, if he neglects or refuses to perform such duty, he is liable for any injury \nor detriment caused by such neglect or refusal, if such injury or hurt is of the kind which the statute was intended to \nprevent; nor is it necessary in such a case as this to declare upon or refer to the statute.’ ” (Citation omitted.) In \nPompey v. Gen. Motors Corp., 385 Mich. 537, 552, 189 N.W.2d 243 (1971), though the Court recognized “[t]he \ngeneral rule ... that where a new right is created or a new duty is imposed by statute, the remedy provided for \nenforcement of that right by the statute for its violation and nonperformance is exclusive,” the Court noted “two \nimportant qualifications to this rule of statutory construction: In the absence of a pre-existent common law remedy, \nthe statutory remedy is not deemed exclusive if such remedy is plainly inadequate, or unless a contrary intent \nclearly appears,” id. at 552 n. 14, 189 N.W.2d 243 (citations omitted). Later, the Court set forth a test to determine \nwhether to create a new cause of action. Gardner v. Wood, 429 Mich. 290, 302, 414 N.W.2d 706 (1987) (“In the \ninterest of public policy, this Court has created a new cause of action to redress the violation of a penal statute and, \npursuant to the following test, incorporated the statute as the specific standard of care: ‘The court may adopt as the \nstandard conduct of a reasonable man the requirements of a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation \nwhose purpose is found to be exclusively or in part (a) to protect a class of persons which includes the one whose \ninterest is invaded, and (b) to protect the particular interest which is invaded, and (c) to protect that interest against \nthe kind of harm which has resulted, and (d) to protect that interest against the particular hazard from which the \nharm results.’ ”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \nHowever, the Court later disavowed Pompey’s two qualifications to the general rule that when a statute creates a \nnew duty or a new right, the statutory remedy is exclusive. Lash v. Traverse City, 479 Mich. 180, 192 n. 19, 735 \nN.W.2d 628 (2007) (“We need not address the dictum in the Pompey footnote that some quantum of additional \nremedy is permitted where a statutory remedy is ‘plainly inadequate.’ We do note that this principle, which has \nnever since been cited in any majority opinion of this Court, appears inconsistent with subsequent caselaw.”). \nFinally, though Lash, id. at 192-193, 735 N.W.2d 628, did cite the test from Gardner, 429 Mich. at 302, 414 N.W.2d \n706, to determine if the Court may create a new cause of action, only a week before Lash was issued, the Court \nissued South Haven v. Van Buren Co. Bd. of Comm’rs, 478 Mich. 518, 734 N.W.2d 533 (2007). In that case, the Court \nreaffirmed the more recent trend in our cases, which emphasizes that it is the Legislature’s intent and the statutory \nlanguage that control whether a party may pursue a particular remedy: \n“It is well settled that when a statute provides a remedy, a court should enforce the legislative remedy rather \nthan one the court prefers.” To determine whether a plaintiff may bring a cause of action for a specific remedy, \nthis Court “must determine whether [the Legislature] intended to create such a cause of action.” “ ‘ “Where a \nstatute gives new rights and prescribes new remedies, such remedies must be strictly pursued; and a party \nseeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy conferred thereby and to that only.” ’ ” Accordingly, \nthis Court has previously declined to establish a remedy that the Legislature has not provided. [Id. at 528-529, 734 \nN.W.2d 533, quoting Roberts v. Mecosta Co. Gen. Hosp., 466 Mich. 57, 66 n. 5, 642 N.W.2d 663 (2002); Office \nPlanning Group, 472 Mich. at 496, 697 N.W.2d 871; McClements v.

City of Troy, 504 Mich. 204, 225, 934 N.W.2d 713 (2019) (citing Lash for the \nconclusion that though the plaintiffs could not bring a cause of action for damages when the statute created a new \nright but did not provide an express cause of action, the plaintiffs could seek injunctive or declaratory relief). \n \n90  Chief Justice MCCORMACK argues that the fact that the United States Supreme Court now looks askance at Bivens \n  should not lead us to question Smith because “we are separate sovereigns. We decide the meaning of the Michigan \nConstitution and do not take our cue from any other court, including the highest Court in the land.” Of course, I \nagree that we are separate sovereigns and that we alone are tasked with interpreting our Constitution. However, it \nwould hardly be a mark of our independence to continue to follow Bivens, which, although it has been cabined, \nremains the governing federal precedent. \n \n91  In Jo-Dan, Ltd. v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued July 14, 2000 \n  (Docket No. 201406), p. 16, the Court of Appeals held, “If the finder of fact in the trial court determines that a \nplaintiff sustained his, her, or its burden of proving that the defendant violated the fair and just treatment clause, \nthe full panoply of remedies are available. Those remedies include, but are not limited to, monetary damages when \n‘appropriate’ according to Smith ....” But there, the Detroit Board of Education did not argue that monetary \ndamages were inappropriate. Id. at 16 n. 13. And, of course, the decision is unpublished, and therefore it is not \nprecedentially binding. MCR 7.215(C)(1). \nThe Court of Appeals has repeatedly noted Smith’s holding that there may be an implied cause of action for \ndamages for state constitutional violations. In most cases, findings that there was no constitutional violation, or that \nthe violation did not occur as a result of a custom or policy, have precluded the Court of Appeals from recognizing \nsuch a cause of action. See, e.g., Champion’s Auto Ferry, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 231 Mich. App. 699, 717, 588 \nN.W.2d 153 (1998) (citing Smith in support of the conclusion that “[i]f and when [the plaintiff] can establish that its \nauthorized rates are in fact confiscatory, it may sue in the Court of Claims for just compensation on a theory of \nconstitutional tort,” but also stating that the plaintiff “ha[d] failed to establish that any ... taking has occurred”); see \nalso Marlin v. Detroit, 177 Mich. App. 108, 441 N.W.2d 45 (1989); Johnson v. Wayne Co., 213 Mich. App. 143, 540 \nN.W.2d 66 (1995); Carlton v. Dep’t of Corrections, 215 Mich. App. 490, 546 N.W.2d 671 (1996); Jones v. Powell, 227 \nMich. App. 662, 577 N.W.2d 130 (1998), aff’d 462 Mich. 329, 612 N.W.2d 423 (2000); Reid v.

Melvindale Northern Allen Park Pub. Sch. Bd. of Ed., \n65 Mich. App. 472, 237 N.W.2d 514 (1975), in which it recognized a damages award for a violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Though this decision is published, it was issued prior to November 1, 1990, so it is not precedential. \nMCR 7.215(J)(1). \nOther states remain split on whether to recognize a Bivens-style remedy for state constitutional violations. See 74 \nAm. Jur. 2d, Torts (May 2020 update), § 44 (recounting that some states allow an implied cause of action for \nunconstitutional searches, while others do not). However, in recent years, state courts have recognized fewer \nBivens-style remedies. 75 A.L.R.5th 619 lists 25 cases in which an implied cause of action was recognized under an \nanalogy to Bivens and 61 cases in which the cause of action was not recognized. Every case decided after 2000 \ndeclined to recognize a Bivens-style remedy. \n \n58 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n92  To be clear, limiting Smith to the due-process and equal-protection claims at issue in that case would mean declining \n  to recognize a claim for monetary damages under Const. 1963, art. 1, § 11, our state Constitution’s parallel provision \nto the Fourth Amendment, even though that would be similar to the type of claim recognized in Bivens itself. \n \n93  Smith, 428 Mich. at 544, 410 N.W.2d 749. \n \n \n1  Justice BERNSTEIN is certainly correct that what occurred to the people of Flint was appalling. But he is, with all \n  respect, incorrect in his characterization of the instant analysis as “highly legalistic.” Relevant law requires plaintiffs \nto “file with the clerk of the court of claims a notice of intention to file a claim or the claim itself within 6 months \nfollowing the happening of the event giving rise to the cause of action,” MCL 600.6431(3), and plaintiffs did not do \nthis. Mine is a wholly legal, not a “legalistic,” analysis. \n \n2  This Court noted that “[b]ecause the issue is uncontested, we presume, without deciding, that the definition of \n  ‘accrual’ in MCL 600.5827 applies equivalently to MCL 600.6431.” Id. at 183 n. 8, 931 N.W.2d 539. We also noted \nthat even if we were to apply the common-law definition of “accrual,” the outcome would not be any different. Id. \n“Under the common law, a claim generally accrues ‘when all of the elements of the cause of action have occurred \nand can be alleged in a proper complaint.’ ” Id., quoting Connelly v. Paul Ruddy’s Equip. Repair & Serv. Co., 388 Mich. \n146, 150, 200 N.W.2d 70 (1972). Similarly, in the instant case, because the issue is uncontested, I presume, without \ndeciding, that the definition of “accrual” in MCL 600.5827 applies equivalently to MCL 600.6431. In addition, as \ndiscussed in more detail later, application of the common-law definition of “accrual” would not alter my conclusion \nthat plaintiffs’ complaint was not timely filed. \n \n3  The Court of Appeals opinion in the instant case preceded this Court’s opinion in Bauserman. The Court of Appeals \n  dissent concluded that the common-law definition of accrual was applicable, including the common-law discovery \nrule. Mays, 323 Mich. App. at 98, 916 N.W.2d 227 (RIORDAN, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the dissent concluded \nthat the action was not timely filed because plaintiffs knew or should have known of their cause of action \nsignificantly longer than six months before they filed this cause of action. Id. at 99, 916 N.W.2d 227. Assuming for \nthe sake of argument that the common-law definition of accrual, including the common-law discovery rule, does \napply here, I agree with the dissenting judge that the action was not timely filed because plaintiffs knew or should \nhave known of their cause of action more than six months before they filed the cause of action, as will be discussed \nin greater detail later. \n \n4  The lead opinion concludes that Henry is distinguishable because plaintiffs in the instant case “do not allege that \n  their claimed harms resulted at the time Flint’s water source was switched.” However, plaintiffs’ original complaint \nalleges that plaintiffs “from April 25, 2014 to the present, have experienced and will continue to experience serious \npersonal injury and property damage caused by Defendants’ deliberately indifferent decision to expose them to the \nextreme toxicity of water pumped from the Flint River into their homes, schools, hospitals, correctional facilities, \nworkplaces and public places.” (Emphasis added.) Similarly, plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges that plaintiffs \n“since April 25, 2014, were and continue to be injured in person and property because they were exposed to highly \ndangerous conditions created, caused and knowingly prolonged by Defendants’ conduct ....” (Emphasis added.) \n59 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \n \n5  The lead opinion states that “[p]laintiffs have also alleged injuries that might include plaintiffs who suffered in vitro \n  exposure to toxic water” and therefore “[i]t would simply be illogical to foreclose a plaintiff’s suit if the plaintiff had \nbeen exposed to the Flint water in the womb and thus suffered harm but had not yet been born as of April 2014.” \nHowever, plaintiffs’ complaints do not say anything at all concerning in vitro exposure to toxic water; therefore, that \nissue is simply not before this Court. \n \n6  The lead opinion is correct that Hart involved an inverse-condemnation claim, while Garg involved a discrimination \n  claim. However, the issue in both those cases was essentially the same: whether the statute of limitations permits a \nplaintiff to recover for injuries suffered outside the limitations period where those injuries are susceptible to being \ncharacterized as “continuing violations.” Garg, the later-in-time decision, answered that question in the negative, \nand I see no logical reason why its reasoning would not apply in other contexts, including, in particular, in the \ncontext of an inverse-condemnation claim. Although this Court did not expressly overrule Hart in Garg, I do not see \nhow the reasoning of Hart conceivably could survive the reasoning of Garg. \n \n7  Although Henry did not involve an inverse-condemnation claim, it did involve a similar claim of contamination that \n  allegedly resulted in a diminution of property value. And this Court held that the claim accrued when the dioxin \nreached the plaintiffs’ property, “regardless of whether it was possible at that time to calculate the level of \nmonetary damage.” Henry v. Dow Chem. Co., 319 Mich. App. 704, 736, 905 N.W.2d 422 (2017) (GADOLA, P.J., \ndissenting); Henry, 501 Mich. at 965, 905 N.W.2d 601 (reversing part of the opinion of the Court of Appeals “for the \nreasons stated in the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion”). \nThe lead opinion concludes that “[t]he economic damage plaintiffs allege from the diminution of their properties’ \nvalue could not have occurred on the date the water source was switched.” Instead, it asserts, “[p]laintiffs’ property \ndiminished in value at a later date, yet to be determined, when a buyer or bank had the requisite information to be \ndisinclined to buy or finance the purchase of property in Flint.” But this Court rejected a similar argument in Henry \nwhen it adopted Judge GADOLA’s dissent. In Henry, the Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs’ action did not \naccrue  until  the  MDEQ  revealed  to  the  public  that  elevated  dioxin  concentrations  were  pervasive  in  the \nTittabawassee river floodplain and restricted the property owners’ rights to use their property. Judge GADOLA \nconcluded that the plaintiffs’ action accrued when the dioxins reached the plaintiffs’ property, explaining that “[i]t \nmay be true that the value of plaintiffs’ property changed when the MDEQ published its 2002 bulletin, but plaintiffs’ \ndiscovery in 2002 that their damages were greater than originally supposed when the dioxin was deposited on their \nproperties, possibly as early as the 1970s, did not create a new accrual date for plaintiffs’ claims. Such reasoning \noverlooks the clear directive of MCL 600.5827 that ‘the claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is \nbased was done regardless of the time when damage results.’ (Emphasis added.)” Henry, 319 Mich. App. at 735, 905 \nN.W.2d 422 (GADOLA, P.J., dissenting). As already noted, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals in Henry “for the \nreasons stated in the Court of Appeals dissenting opinion.” Henry, 501 Mich. at 965, 905 N.W.2d 601. As a result, \npursuant to Henry, plaintiffs’ action here accrued when the Flint River water reached plaintiffs’ property, without \nregard to when “a buyer or bank had the requisite information to be disinclined to buy or finance the purchase of \nproperty in Flint.” \n \n8  Moreover, I question whether plaintiffs have even adequately alleged a claim of inverse condemnation. “The right \n  to just compensation, in the context of an inverse condemnation suit for diminution in value ... exists only where the \n60 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nlandowner can allege a unique or special injury, that is, an injury that is different in kind, not simply in degree, from \nthe harm suffered by all persons similarly situated.” Spiek v. Dep’t of Transp., 456 Mich. 331, 348, 572 N.W.2d 201 \n(1998). As we have explained: \nWhere harm is shared in common by many members of the public, the appropriate remedy lies with the \nlegislative branch and the regulatory bodies created thereby .... Only where the harm is peculiar or unique in this \ncontext does the judicial remedy become appropriate. [Id. at 349, 572 N.W.2d 201.] \nConcerning the meaning of “similarly situated,” the lead opinion is correct that Spiek compared the plaintiffs to \nother persons who “reside near a public highway,” rather than the specific highway that the plaintiffs resided near. \nId. at 350, 572 N.W.2d 201 (emphasis added). However, in discussing this requirement in general, Spiek expressly \nindicated that a plaintiff’s alleged damage must not be “common to all property in the neighborhood” or “common \n[to] all lands in the vicinity.” Id. at 346, 348, 572 N.W.2d 201 n. 14 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In \naddition, contrary to the approach of the majority, this Court in Hill v. State Hwy. Comm., 382 Mich. 398, 170 \nN.W.2d 18 (1969), compared the plaintiffs in that case with those whose property was also affected by the specific \nconstruction at issue. See id. at 404, 170 N.W.2d 18 (“[P]laintiffs make no showing that they are differently treated \nfrom other members of the traveling public or property owners whose use of these streets has been restricted by \nthe construction of the limited access expressway.”). Accordingly, I question whether the majority is correct in \nholding that the pertinent inquiry is whether plaintiffs are similarly situated to municipal water users generally \nrather than with other Flint water users. \nAssuming that the latter defines the pertinent inquiry, plaintiffs have not alleged that they have suffered a unique or \nspecial injury that is any different in kind from the harm suffered by all persons similarly situated. Indeed, plaintiffs \nclaim to represent all the Flint water users that suffered personal injuries and property damage from the water. That \nis, plaintiffs claim to represent all persons similarly situated. Therefore, arguably by definition, plaintiffs have not \nalleged an injury that is any different in kind from those suffered by all persons similarly situated. Because the harm \nthat plaintiffs alleged is shared in common by many members of the public, the appropriate remedy arguably lies \nwith the legislative branch and the regulatory bodies created thereby. That is, it is not necessarily that there is no \nremedy available to persons injured but that the remedy is more properly fashioned by a different agency of \ngovernment. However, given that I conclude that plaintiffs here failed to comply with the notice provision of the \nCourt of Claims Act, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim of inverse \ncondemnation. Similarly, it is unnecessary for me to address the merits of plaintiffs’ substantive due-process claim, \nso I will merely observe that I find Justice VIVIANO’s opinion to be highly estimable and share a good many of his \nconcerns. \n \n9  The Court of Claims also relied on the harsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception to deny defendants’ \n  motions  for  summary  disposition.  The  Court  of  Appeals  dissent  concluded  that  the \nharsh-and-unreasonable-consequences exception was abrogated by McCahan and Rowland because in those cases \nthis Court held that no judicially created savings construction is permitted to avoid a clear statutory mandate. \nHowever, those cases involved statutory claims, and we held that because the Legislature could completely abolish \nthose claims, it could obviously place restrictions on such claims. The instant case involves constitutional claims that \nthe Legislature lacks the authority to completely abolish (at least with regard to inverse condemnation), and this \nCourt has long held that the Legislature cannot enact limitation periods that “are so harsh and unreasonable in their \nconsequences that they effectively divest plaintiffs of the access to the courts intended by the grant of the \nsubstantive right.” Forest, 402 Mich. at 359, 262 N.W.2d 653. For example, the Legislature could not enact a statute \nthat requires a claimant to file a takings action within one day of the alleged taking. The Court of Appeals dissent \nalso concluded that application of the notice provision would not be harsh or unreasonable given that plaintiffs had \nnumerous indications that they were suffering harm within six months of the water-source switch and so could have \n61 \n \n\n \n \nMays v. Governor of Michigan, 506 Mich. 157 (2020)   \n954 N.W.2d 139 \n \nreasonably filed their notice of intent in a timely fashion. I fully agree with this conclusion. \n \n10  The Court of Claims rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the fraudulent-concealment statute should be applied in this \n  case. The Court of Appeals dissent also concluded that the fraudulent-concealment statute does not apply. \n \n11  The fraudulent-concealment statute, MCL 600.5855, provides: \n \nIf a person who is or may be liable for any claim fraudulently conceals the existence of the claim or the identity of \nany person who is liable for the claim from the knowledge of the person entitled to sue on the claim, the action \nmay be commenced at any time within 2 years after the person who is entitled to bring the action discovers, or \nshould have discovered, the existence of the claim or the identity of the person who is liable for the claim, \nalthough the action would otherwise be barred by the period of limitations. \n \n12  Justice BERNSTEIN recognizes that “[t]he Legislature did not create a fraudulent-concealment exception for the \n  statutory notice provision in the [Court of Claims Act].” Yet, he reads such an exception into the statutory notice \nprovision of the Court of Claims Act because its absence there is “not reconcilable with the Legislature’s intent to \nprovide claimants with two years from the date of discovery to bring suit for harm that was fraudulently concealed, \nas expressed in MCL 600.6452(2).” However, this is simply inconsistent with the plainest expression of the \nLegislature’s actual intention, i.e., the law enacted. See Mayor of Lansing v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 470 Mich. 154, 161, \n680 N.W.2d 840 (2004). \nJustice BERNSTEIN also asserts that failing to read a fraudulent-concealment exception into the statutory notice \nprovision “would result in reading out MCL 600.6452(2) entirely, because plaintiffs would never be able to utilize the \nfraudulent-concealment exception.” I respectfully disagree. MCL 600.6452(2) does more than incorporate the \nfraudulent-concealment statute into the statute-of-limitations provision of the Court of Claims Act; rather, it \nincorporates all the “provisions of RJA chapter 58, relative to the limitation of actions” into the statute-of-limitations \nprovision of the Court of Claims Act. Therefore, failing to read a fraudulent-concealment exception into the \nstatutory notice provision of the Court of Claims Act would not “entirely” result in reading out MCL 600.6452(2). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n62 \n ",
